Habeas      Petitioner          Alton\n\nClarke      appeals    the      district     court’s       decision      denying       him\n\nrelief,      under    28     U.S.C.      §   2254,       from    his    Massachusetts\n\nconvictions for kidnapping and rape.                            Clarke argues that\n\n1) the Commonwealth unconstitutionally used the fact that he\n\ninvoked      his     right        to    remain      silent       during       a     police\n\ninterrogation against him at trial; and 2) Clarke’s retrial,\n\nfollowing two earlier trials on similar charges, violated\n\ndouble      jeopardy.        We    reject        these    arguments      and,       having\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2253, we AFFIRM.\n\n                                   I.    BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Factual background\n\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, see\n\nBrewer v. Marshall, 119 F.3d 993, 995 (1st Cir. 1997), the\n\nevidence presented during Clarke’s third trial established\n\nthe following: At approximately 9:30 p.m. one night in March\n\n1995,    the   victim       was    walking        from    her    home    in       Roxbury,\n\nMassachusetts, to a nearby restaurant.                          A burgundy-colored\n\ncar drove up onto the sidewalk, blocking the victim’s path.\n\nA    man,    unknown       to     the    victim      at    the    time     but       later\n\nidentified as Clarke, jumped out of the car, pointed a gun\n\nat the victim, and pushed her into the car.                              Clarke then\n\ndrove to a home at 22 Skyview Lane, where he forced the\n\nvictim into the home’s basement at gunpoint.                            There, Clarke\n\n\n                                             3\n\f“raped her by first inserting the gun into her vagina, then\n\ninserting         his   penis      into    her     vagina,     and     finally    by\n\ninserting his penis into her mouth.”                  Clarke v. Spencer, 585\n\nF. Supp.2d 196, 200 (D. Mass. 2008).\n\n       Several       weeks      later,     the     victim     “recognized        and\n\nidentified Clarke as the man who raped her when, by chance,\n\nshe ran into him at Boston City Hospital.                      After a chase by\n\n[the    victim’s]       boyfriend         and    hospital     security       guards,\n\nClarke      was    apprehended      and    taken    into     custody    by    Boston\n\nPolice officers.”            Id.\n\n       At the time of his arrest, Clarke told police that he\n\nknew the woman who lived at 22 Skyview Lane, but that he had\n\nnever taken another woman there and he had never seen the\n\nwoman who was now accusing him of rape.                     At trial, however,\n\nClarke testified instead that he met the victim at a club\n\nand    she        propositioned      him,        offering     sex    for     money.\n\nAccording to Clarke, he accepted the offer, paid the woman\n\nhalf of their agreed-upon fee, and drove her to 22 Skyview\n\nLane, where he knew the owner would not be at home.                          Clarke\n\ntestified that, once they got to the house, he was unable to\n\npay    the    rest      of   the     agreed-upon       fee     and     the    woman,\n\ntherefore, threatened to accuse Clarke of rape.\n\nB.     Procedural background\n\n       1.    State proceedings\n\n\n                                           4\n\f       The Commonwealth tried Clarke three times.\n\n              a.     First trial, occurring in January 1997\n\n       Massachusetts         initially            charged       Clarke        with    five\n\noffenses:      “assault       and    battery        with    a    dangerous       weapon,\n\nkidnapping, and three counts of aggravated rape, one count\n\nfor    each    different      form    of      penetration.          Clarke’s         first\n\ntrial . . . resulted in a mistrial when the jury failed to\n\nreach a unanimous verdict.”                   Id.\n\n              b.     Second trial, occurring in August 1997\n\n       “Clarke     was      retried      in       August,   1997,        on    the    same\n\ncharges.”      Id.     The jury convicted him of kidnapping and two\n\ncounts of the lesser included offense of rape.                                See id. at\n\n201.    The jury acquitted Clarke of the aggravated portion of\n\nthe    rape    charges,      as   well     as      the   charge    of     assault      and\n\nbattery with a dangerous weapon and the third rape count.\n\nSee id. at 201. On direct appeal, however, the Massachusetts\n\nAppeals       Court     reversed      Clarke’s           three    convictions          and\n\nremanded his case for another trial, after concluding the\n\nCommonwealth          had   improperly            used    Clarke’s       post-Miranda\n\nsilence against him at trial.                     See Commonwealth v. Clarke,\n\n722 N.E.2d 987, 992 (Mass. App. Ct. 2000), further review\n\ndenied, 733 N.E.2d 124 (Table) (Mass. 2000).\n\n              c.     Third trial, occurring in August 2001\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f      Clarke’s third trial, the one at issue here, occurred\n\nin August 2001.          The Commonwealth, this time, tried Clarke\n\nonly on two charges of rape and one count of kidnapping.\n\nSee   Clarke,     585    F.    Supp.       2d    at    201.     The       third     jury\n\nconvicted    Clarke       of   all       three     offenses,        and    the    court\n\nsentenced    Clarke       to   twelve          years   in     prison.        See       id.\n\nAccording    to   Clarke,      that       sentence      was    later      reduced       to\n\n“eight to ten years.”             (Aplt. Br. at 4 n.1.)\n\n      On   direct       appeal,      the       Massachusetts         Appeals      Court\n\naffirmed Clarke’s convictions, Commonwealth v. Clarke, 799\n\nN.E.2d 605 (Table), 2003 WL 22881000 (Mass App. Ct. Dec. 5,\n\n2003) (unpublished), and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt   denied    further      review,          Commonwealth        v.    Clarke,      806\n\nN.E.2d 102 (Table) (Mass. Mar. 31, 2004) (unpublished).\n\n      2.    Federal habeas proceedings\n\n      In March 2006, Clarke filed his federal habeas petition\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254.                     The district court denied\n\nrelief, but granted Clarke a certificate of appealability\n\n(“COA”),    see   28     U.S.C.      §    2253(c),      on    the    claims       he    is\n\ncurrently pursuing on appeal.\n\n                               II.       DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Whether the Commonwealth used Clarke’s invocation of his\n      right to remain silent during a police interrogation\n      against him at trial\n\n      1.    Standard of review\n\n\n                                           6\n\f     Because the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed and\n\nrejected     the    merits   of   this    claim,   see    Clarke,    2003    WL\n\n22881000, at *1, a federal court “shall not” grant Clarke\n\nhabeas     relief    on   this    basis   unless    the   state     appellate\n\ncourt’s\n\n     adjudication of the claim—\n\n     (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n     involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\n     established Federal law, as determined by the\n     Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n     (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an\n     unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\n     the   evidence  presented   in  the   State   court\n     proceeding.\n\n28   U.S.C.    §    2254(d).      This    court    reviews   the     district\n\ncourt’s decision to deny § 2254 relief de novo.                See John v.\n\nRusso, 561 F.3d 88, 91 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n     2.     Merits\n\n     The Government may not use at trial the fact that a\n\ndefendant, after receiving Miranda 1 warnings,                invoked his\n\nright to remain silent.            See Anderson v. Charles, 447 U.S.\n\n404, 407-08 (1980); Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 611 (1976);\n\nMiranda, 384 U.S. at 468 n. 37.              A defendant can, however,\n\nknowingly and voluntarily waive his right to remain silent,\n\nsee Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444, by, for example, voluntarily\n\nanswering questions after receiving Miranda warnings.                       See\n\n\n     1\n         Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n                                      7\n\fCharles,         447    U.S.    at    408;      cf.    Montejo      v.    Louisiana,         129\n\nS.    Ct.    2079,       2085        (2009)      (addressing         waiver       of    Fifth\n\nAmendment right to counsel after Miranda warnings).                                          But\n\nsuch waiver “is not an all-or-nothing proposition.”                                    United\n\nStates v. Andújar-Basco, 488 F.3d 549, 555 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nA    suspect      may    invoke       his     right      to    remain     silent       in    any\n\nmanner      at    any    time    before         or    during    interrogation.               See\n\nMiranda, 384 U.S. at 444-45, 473-74.                           The First Circuit has\n\nfurther      concluded         that       “the       words    the   defendant      uses       to\n\nassert      the    privilege          are     themselves        protected      by      it.”\n\nAndújar-Basco, 488 F.3d at 557.\n\n       Clarke contends that at trial the Commonwealth, in three\n\nways, improperly used at trial the fact that he invoked his\n\nright to remain silent during an interrogation.\n\n             a.        Detective Gavin’s testimony\n\n       Clarke      first       argues      that       the    Commonwealth     improperly\n\nused his post-Miranda silence during its direct examination\n\nof Detective Donna Gavin.                        Gavin testified that when she\n\ninterviewed Clarke, following his arrest, Clarke told her\n\nthat he had never seen the victim before and that he had\n\nnever brought any female guest to 22 Skyview Lane.                                      Gavin\n\nasked    Clarke         how     it    was,       then,       that   the    victim       could\n\ndescribe the home located at 22 Skyview Lane.                                But, before\n\nGavin    could         explain       to   the    jury       Clarke’s     answer    to       that\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fquestion, the court sustained defense counsel’s objection\n\nbecause    it    was    in    response    to    that   question    that    Clarke\n\ninvoked his right to remain silent.                    Gavin then testified\n\nsimply that the interview had ended shortly thereafter.\n\n     The Massachusetts Appeals Court rejected Clarke’s claim\n\nthat Detective Gavin’s direct testimony amounted to improper\n\nuse of his invoking his right to remain silent at the post-\n\narrest    interview          because   the     trial   court    sustained     the\n\nobjection       and    Gavin      never   answered     the     question.      See\n\nClarke, 2003 WL 22881000, at *1.                That determination was not\n\ncontrary    to,       nor    an   unreasonable    application      of,    clearly\n\nestablished Supreme Court precedent.                   See Greer v. Miller,\n\n483 U.S. 756, 763-65 (1987).\n\n            b.        Cross-examination of Clarke\n\n     Clarke next argues that the prosecutor improperly used\n\nClarke’s post-Miranda silence while cross-examining him.\n\nOn   direct      examination,          Clarke     testified,      contrary     to\n\nDetective Gavin, that he told the detective that he had once\n\nbrought a prostitute to 22 Skyview Lane and that when he\n\ncould not pay her, she threatened to accuse him of rape.\n\nDuring cross-examination, the following exchange occurred:\n\n     Q. It’s your testimony ----\n\n     A. It’s my testimony today before the jurors that\n     I did told [Detective Gavin] I brought someone, a\n     guest, a prostitute, at 22 Skyview Lane.\n\n\n                                          9\n\fQ. Sir, isn’t it true that you told Detective Gavin\nthat you never brought anyone to Skyview Lane,\nright sir?\n\nA. Totally impossible.\n\nQ. And sir, when she asked you, she asked you,\ndidn’t she, sir, how the woman would know the\ninside and outside of that house, right?\n\n    [Defense Counsel]: Objection\n\n    THE COURT: Sustained.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Your Honor, may I be heard\n    at sidebar?\n\n    THE COURT: No, you may not.      Sustained.\n    Move on, let’s go.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Your Honor, may I be heard\n    at side bar?\n\n    THE COURT: No, you may not.\n\nQ. You were asked about the    description   of   the\nhouse, correct, Mr. Clarke?\n\n    [Defense attorney]: Objection.\n\n    THE COURT: Sustained.\n\nQ. Sir, you’d agree with me that Detective Gavin\nwouldn’t have asked that question if you had said\nthat you had brought someone to Skyview Lane,\nright, Mr. Clarke?\n\n    [Defense Attorney]: Objection.\n\n    THE COURT: Sustained.\n\n    [Prosecutor]: Your Honor, may I be heard\n    at side bar?\n\n    THE COURT: No, you may not.      Let’s move\n    on.\n\n\n\n                         10\n\f      Q. You’d agree, sir, that that question wouldn’t\n      make any sense, right, sir?\n\n            [Defense Attorney]: Objection.\n\n            THE COURT: Sustained.\n\n      Q.   You’d agree, sir, that Detective Gavin would\n      have no reason to ask you about how she would be\n      able to describe the inside and outside of the\n      house if you had told her that you brought someone\n      in that house, right, Mr. Clarke?\n\n            [Defense Attorney]: Objection.\n\n            THE COURT: Sustained.\n\n      Q.  And Detective Gavin asked you that question,\n      didn’t she, Mr. Clarke?\n\n            [Defense Attorney]: Objection.\n\n            THE COURT: Sustained.\n\n(Tr. v. II at 278-80.)          Later in the cross-examination, the\n\nprosecutor       asked:   “When    you      knew,    sir,      that     mistaken\n\nidentity would not work” as a defense, “isn’t that when you\n\nsaid . . . she was a prostitute?”              (Id. at 293.)           The trial\n\ncourt sustained defense counsel’s objection and ordered the\n\n“[j]ury [to] disregard the last question.”                     (Id.)\n\n      The        Massachusetts      Appeals         Court        held         this\n\ncross-examination did not amount to improper use of Clarke’s\n\npost-Miranda       silence,    again    because     the    trial      court    had\n\nsustained    defense      counsel’s      objections       to    all    of   those\n\nquestions “and the jury consequently never heard the answer\n\nor   that   it    was   the   defendant,     not    Detective      Gavin,      who\n\n\n                                       11\n\fterminated the interview.”          Clarke, 2003 WL 22881000, at *1.\n\nThat determination was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\n       The   Government   might     improperly           “use”       a    defendant’s\n\npost-Miranda      silence    simply       by    posing         questions          to     a\n\nwitness, even where the witness does not answer.                            See Ellen\n\nv. Brady, 475 F.3d 5, 12-14 (1st Cir. 2007).                             In addition,\n\n“[a]       prosecutor’s     persistence         in        referring          to        the\n\ndefendant’s     post-Miranda       silence     .     .    .    may       result    in    a\n\n[constitutional]     violation       even      when      no    evidence       of       the\n\ndefendant’s silence is submitted to a jury.” 2                            Id. at 14.\n\nBut that was not the case here.\n\n       The    prosecutor’s     questions           did        not        directly       or\n\nindirectly suggest that Clarke might have invoked his right\n\nto   remain    silent.       And   the    trial          court      prevented          any\n\nresponse from Clarke from which jurors might have inferred\n\n\n\n       2\n     In making this observation, the First Circuit cited,\ne.g., Hill v. Turpin, 135 F.3d 1411 (11th Cir. 1998), which\nfound a constitutional violation under much more egregious\ncircumstances than those presented here.     See Ellen, 475\nF.3d at 14. In Hill, the prosecutor directly brought to the\njury’s  attention   Hill’s   post-Miranda silence  on  four\nseparate occasions over the course of two days of trial,\nduring the examination of several witnesses and closing\nargument.   See Hill, 135 F.3d at 1414-16.      Under those\ncircumstances,   the   Eleventh   Circuit held   that  “the\nprosecution’s repeated and deliberate references throughout\nHill’s trial to his post-Miranda silence and request for\ncounsel violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.” Id. at 1412.\n\n                                     12\n\fthat he invoked that right.           In addition, both before and\n\nafter    trial,    the    court   instructed     jurors    generally       to\n\ndisregard questions and evidence to which an objection had\n\nbeen sustained.       See Greer, 483 U.S. at 764-65 (addressing\n\na single objectionable question); see also Andújar-Basco,\n\n488 F.3d at 559-60; Ellen, 475 F.3d at 11.\n\n           c.     Closing argument\n\n    Lastly, Clarke asserts that comments the prosecutor made\n\nduring   her    closing   argument    amounted    to   improper      use   of\n\nClarke’s post-Miranda silence.             The prosecutor argued, in\n\nclosing, that Clarke\n\n    needs to explain to you today why he said to\n    Detective Gavin when Detective Gavin said to him,\n    “Did you ever see that woman before?”    “No, I’ve\n    never seen her before.” “Did you ever take a woman\n    to 22 Skyview Lane?” “No, I never took a woman to\n    22 Skyview Lane.”   But think about it, ladies and\n    gentlemen, why would Detective Gavin then ask, why\n    would she say, “Well, if you never took a woman to\n    22 Skyview Lane and you don’t know this woman, how\n    come she can describe the inside and outside of\n    that house?” Why would she ask that, that wouldn’t\n    make sense.\n\n(Tr. v. III at 30.)\n\n    The Massachusetts Appeals Court held that “there was\n\nnothing improper about the prosecutor’s arguing to the jury\n\nthat the story the defendant gave to the detective prior to\n\nending    the     interview   was    inconsistent      with    his    trial\n\ntestimony.”        Clarke,    2003    WL   22881000,      at   *1.     That\n\ndetermination, too, was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable\n\n                                     13\n\fapplication of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\nThe Commonwealth could properly introduce evidence of what\n\nClarke told Detective Gavin during the interrogation, before\n\nClarke invoked his right to remain silent.             See Charles, 447\n\nU.S. at 408; Andújar-Basco, 488 F.3d at 555.              The fact that\n\nwhat Clarke told Detective Gavin contradicted the story that\n\nClarke told jurors at trial was fair game during closing\n\nargument.\n\nB.    Whether  the   jury’s  verdict  in   the  second  trial\n      precluded Clarke’s third trial on the two rape offenses\n\n      At   his   second   trial,   the   jury    acquitted     Clarke    of\n\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon, one count of\n\nrape, and the aggravated element of all three rape charges,\n\nbut convicted him of kidnapping and two counts of rape.                 See\n\nClarke, 2003 WL 22881000, at *1.          The Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt reversed those three convictions, paving the way for\n\nClarke’s third trial, at issue here.            See Clarke, 722 N.E.2d\n\nat 989, 994.      On appeal to this court, Clarke asserts two\n\ntheories for why the results of his second trial precluded\n\nhis retrial on any of the rape counts, or at least precluded\n\nthe   Commonwealth    from   presenting    at    his   third   trial    any\n\nevidence that he had a gun.\n\n      1.    Whether double jeopardy barred Clarke’s third trial\n            on any of the rape charges\n\n\n\n\n                                   14\n\f      Clarke’s first theory is that the Double Jeopardy Clause\n\nprecluded the Commonwealth from retrying him on any of the\n\nthree rape charges.\n\n               a.        Procedural default\n\n      The district court held that for federal habeas purposes\n\nClarke had procedurally defaulted this claim by failing to\n\nraise     it    in        the    state    trial        court.         See    Clarke,   585\n\nF.    Supp.     2d        at    203-04.          We    disagree.            “[A]   federal\n\nclaimant’s          procedural          default        precludes       federal      habeas\n\nreview    .     .    .    only     if    the    last       state    court    rendering   a\n\njudgment in the case rests its judgment on the procedural\n\ndefault.”            Harris       v.     Reed,       489     U.S.   255,     262   (1989).\n\nAlthough        Clarke          failed     to        raise     this    double-jeopardy\n\nargument before or during his third trial, 3 Clarke did raise\n\nthe   issue         on    direct    appeal       to    the    Massachusetts        Appeals\n\nCourt.     And, notwithstanding Clarke’s default in the trial\n\ncourt,     the           Massachusetts          Appeals        Court    addressed      and\n\nrejected this claim on its merits.                              See Clarke, 2003 WL\n\n22881000, at *2.                We, therefore, can address the merits of\n\n\n      3\n     Prior to his third trial, Clarke did file a motion to\ndismiss the indictment, raising a different double-jeopardy\nargument—that, because the prosecutor’s actions during the\nsecond trial were taken in an attempt to goad Clarke into\nmoving for a mistrial, double jeopardy precluded his retrial\non the offenses on which the second jury convicted Clarke.\nSee Clarke, 2003 WL 22881000, at *1.        Clarke does not\nreassert that double-jeopardy argument in these habeas\nproceedings.\n\n                                                15\n\fClarke’s double-jeopardy claim here.                           See Harris, 489 U.S.\n\nat   263    (holding         that    “a    procedural          default     does     not    bar\n\nconsideration of a federal claim on . . . habeas review\n\nunless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case\n\nclearly and expressly states that its judgment rests on a\n\nstate procedural bar” internal quotes omitted)); see also\n\nCarsetti     v.    Maine,       932       F.2d    1007,    1010     (1st     Cir.      1991);\n\nAllen v. Massachusetts, 926 F.2d 74, 78-79 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n             b.        Standard of review\n\n      Because the state appellate court addressed and rejected\n\nClarke’s     double-jeopardy               claim    on    its      merits,    this      court\n\n“shall     not”    grant       Clarke       habeas       relief     unless       the    state\n\nappellate court’s “adjudication of the claim” was contrary\n\nto, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established\n\nSupreme       Court          precedent,            or     was       an      unreasonable\n\ndetermination           of     the       facts     in     light     of     the     evidence\n\npresented         in     the    state-court             proceeding.           28       U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d).\n\n             c.        Merits\n\n      Following the reversal of the results of Clarke’s second\n\ntrial,     the     Commonwealth            was     free       to   retry     him    on     the\n\noffenses           for         which         he         had        previously             b een\n\nconvicted—kidnapping and two rapes—but could not retry him\n\non    the        offenses           on     which         the       second        jury      had\n\n\n                                             16\n\facquitted—assault        and       battery      with   a    dangerous       weapon,\n\naggravated rape, and a third rape.                   See Lockhart v. Nelson,\n\n488   U.S.   33,     38-39    (1988).          The   problem    in    this    case,\n\naccording to Clarke, is that it is unclear on which of the\n\nthree    rape   counts       the   jury    acquitted       during     the    second\n\ntrial.     The three verdict forms for rape submitted to the\n\njury during the second trial each listed aggravated rape and\n\nthe lesser offense of rape, but did not otherwise specify to\n\nwhich of the rape charges each verdict form referred—penile\n\npenetration, oral rape, or penetration with the gun.                         Clarke\n\ncontends     that,    because      it   was     unclear    on   which   of    these\n\nthree    rape   charges      the    jury       acquitted,    the     Commonwealth\n\ncould not retry him on any of those three rape charges.\n\n      The Massachusetts Appeals Court rejected that argument\n\nsee Clarke, 2003 WL 22881000, at *2, concluding that the\n\ntrial court had clearly instructed jurors which charged rape\n\ncount pertained to each verdict slip:\n\n      [L]et me first tell you what the Commonwealth’s\n      theory is.     The Commonwealth is going forward\n      alleging   aggravated   rape,  three   counts   of\n      aggravated rape, first by penetration by the\n      defendant,   the   defendant’s  penis  into   [the\n      victim’s] vagina; second, oral penetration of the\n      defendant’s penis into her mouth; and, third,\n      penetration into her vagina by a gun.    Those are\n      the three indictments for aggravated rape.\n\n(D. Ct. Doc. 11, attachment 1, supp. app. at 1.)                            Because\n\nthe jury acquitted Clarke of the third rape count, the state\n\n\n                                          17\n\fappellate court determined that the second jury acquitted\n\nClarke      of    the    rape       involving         penetration          with      the    gun,\n\nClarke,      2003        WL     22881000,         at        *2.          Therefore,          the\n\nMassachusetts           Appeals      Court       concluded         that    trying       Clarke\n\nagain on the other two rapes counts did not violate double\n\njeopardy.           See       id.       That       determination               was    not     an\n\nunreasonable         application         of      clearly          established         Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.              See Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651,\n\n663-65      (1977)      (considering,            in    rejecting          double-jeopardy\n\nargument         against      second     trial,         jury       instructions            given\n\nduring first trial to determine which of two offenses the\n\njury convicted the defendant).                        Nor, on the facts of this\n\ncase, was it “an unreasonable determination of the facts in\n\nlight of the evidence.”                 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).\n\n       As   an     alternative        theory          for    habeas       relief,       Clarke\n\nargues      that        his     trial       attorney             was     constitutionally\n\nineffective         for       failing       to    raise          this     double-jeopardy\n\nargument before or during his third trial.                                 To succeed on\n\nsuch   a    claim,      Clarke       must    establish            both    that    his      trial\n\ncounsel’s performance was deficient and that that deficiency\n\nprejudiced his defense.                 See Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S.    668,      687     (1984).       Because             we    have    concluded         that\n\nClarke’s         double-jeopardy        claim         fails       on     its   merits,       his\n\ntrial attorney was not constitutionally deficient in failing\n\n\n                                             18\n\fto raise this issue, nor did that failure prejudice Clarke’s\n\ndefense.\n\n       2.    Whether principles of collateral estoppel precluded\n             the Commonwealth, during Clarke’s third trial, from\n             introducing evidence that Clarke had a gun\n\n       Clarke’s final theory for habeas relief is that, if it\n\nwas clear that the jury at his second trial acquitted him of\n\nrape    by   penetrating    the   victim       with    a   gun,   then   the\n\nCommonwealth was collaterally estopped from presenting at\n\nhis third trial evidence that he had a gun.\n\n             a.   Exhaustion\n\n       While collateral estoppel is still an “element in the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause,” such an argument is distinct from\n\nthe core concept of Double Jeopardy.                 See United States v.\n\nMarino, 200 F.3d 6, 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1999).                    Clarke never\n\nspecifically raised his collateral-estoppel argument to the\n\nMassachusetts      state   courts.        It   is,    thus,   unexhausted.\n\nNevertheless, we can still address the merits of Clarke’s\n\nclaim here because we conclude the issue does not warrant\n\nhabeas relief.      See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2) (“An application\n\nfor a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits,\n\nnotwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the\n\nremedies available in the courts of the State.”)\n\n\n\n\n                                     19\n\f             b.     Merits\n\n      Because       Clarke    never    raised         his    collateral-estoppel\n\nclaim   in    the     state   court,       our    review     is   de   novo.      See\n\nMarino, 200 F.3d at 10.\n\n      Collateral       estoppel,      in    the   criminal        context,     “means\n\nsimply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been\n\ndetermined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot\n\nagain be litigated between the same parties in any future\n\nlawsuit.”         Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 443 (1970); see\n\nalso Yeager v. United States, 129 S. Ct. 2360, 2367 (2009);\n\nBobby v. Bies, 129 S. Ct. 2145, 2152 (2009).                       Clarke asserts\n\nthat the jury at his second trial found that he did not have\n\na gun when he kidnapped and twice raped the victim.                            Clarke\n\nbases this argument on the jury’s decision to acquit him of\n\nthe charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,\n\nrape by penetration with a gun, and aggravated rape, which\n\nmay   be     proven    by     the   use     of    a    gun    during    the     rape.\n\nAssuming, without deciding, that Clarke’s second jury did\n\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\ffind       that   he   did   not    have   a   gun, 4   Clarke’s\n\ncollateral-estoppel argument still does not warrant relief.\n\n       The jury at his third trial, in convicting Clarke of\n\nkidnapping and two rape counts, did not necessarily have to\n\nfind that Clarke had a gun.        See Bies, 129 S. Ct. at 2152\n\n(“A determination ranks as necessary or essential only when\n\n\n\n       4\n      In applying collateral estoppel in a criminal context\nwhere, as here, the jury issued a general verdict, we must\n“examine the record of the prior proceeding” to determine\nwhat the prior jury necessarily found.    Ashe, 397 U.S. at\n444 (quotations omitted).   In doing so, we will take “into\naccount the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant\nmatter” in order to decide “whether a rational jury could\nhave grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that\nwhich the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.”\nId. (quotation omitted); see also Yeager, 129 S. Ct. at\n2367.   Clarke bears the burden of proving “unequivocally[]\nthat the [earlier] jury verdict . . . necessarily included\nan implicit factual finding” precluding retrial.    Marino,\n200 F.3d at 10 (quotations omitted); see also Dowling v.\nUnited States, 493 U.S. 342, 350 (1990).    But Clarke, who\nhas been represented by counsel throughout these federal\nhabeas proceedings, has failed to provide this court with a\nrecord from the second trial sufficient to permit us to\nconduct such a review.     See Dowling, 493 U.S. at 351-52\n(rejecting collateral-estoppel argument where defendant had\nfailed to show that prior prosecution necessarily decided\nissue sought to be precluded in subsequent prosecution).\n\n     “If a judgment does not depend on a given determination,\nrelitigation of that determination is not precluded”; “[a]\ndetermination ranks as necessary or essential only when the\nfinal outcome hinges on it.” Bies, 129 S. Ct. at 2152. The\ndistrict court, in denying habeas relief, held that Clarke\nhad failed to show that his second jury found that he had no\ngun, suggesting that, even in light of the acquittals, the\njury still would not necessarily have had to find that\nClarke had no gun.     See Clarke, 585 F. Supp.2d at 208.\nClarke has failed to present to us an adequate record for us\nto challenge that conclusion.\n\n                               21\n\fthe final outcome hinges on it.”).               Therefore, the jury did\n\nnot     have     to    make    a   finding      of    ultimate      fact      that\n\ncontradicted the second jury’s findings.                     See Dowling, 493\n\nU.S.    at     348    (rejecting   collateral-estoppel          claim      where,\n\n“unlike the situation in Ashe . . . , the prior acquittal\n\ndid not determine an ultimate issue in the present case”);\n\nMarino, 200 F.3d at 9 (noting that, “[w]hen a jury reaches\n\na general verdict of acquittal on certain counts, . . . the\n\ndefendant       may    argue   that    the   jury     must   have   based      its\n\nacquittal on certain factual findings favorable to him, and\n\nthat those findings bar any retrial on other counts upon\n\nwhich    he    was    not   acquitted,   since       his   conviction    in    the\n\nretrial       necessarily      would   depend   on    the    jury   at   retrial\n\nreaching contrary findings as to the same essential facts”)\n\n(emphasis added); United States v. Dray, 901 F.2d 1132, 1136\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (noting that, “if an issue determined in a\n\nprior proceeding between the same parties (or their privies)\n\nconstitutes a necessary element of a subsequent prosecution,\n\ncollateral estoppel will likely operate as a complete bar to\n\nthe latter prosecution”) (emphasis added).\n\n       Here, in the third trial, Clarke was charged with one\n\ncount of kidnapping and two counts of rape.                     None of those\n\ncounts required proof that Clarke had or used a gun.                        Thus,\n\nthere is no double jeopardy problem, even assuming the jury\n\n\n                                       22\n\fin the second trial determined that Clarke did not use a gun\n\nduring these crimes.\n\n      Nevertheless, evidence that Clarke used a gun was still\n\nrelevant evidence to help explain how Clarke was able to\n\nforce the victim into his car and to compel her to submit to\n\nhis   sexual    demands.      Even         reading        the    second    verdict    as\n\nClarke argues, all that can be determined from the second\n\nverdict is that the jury found the government had failed to\n\nprove the existence of a gun “beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\nBut that is not the test for the introduction of relevant\n\nevidence in the third trial; that only requires that the\n\nevidence   be    probative        —    that          it   tends     to    explain     or\n\nstrengthen or make an asserted act more likely than not to\n\nbe true.   Clarke never objected to the introduction of this\n\nevidence   on    the    grounds       that      it    was    not   relevant.         See\n\nDowling, 493 U.S. at 348, 350 (declining to extend Ashe “to\n\nexclude in all circumstances . . . relevant and probative\n\nevidence that is otherwise admissible under the Rules of\n\nEvidence   simply       because       it    relates         to    alleged    criminal\n\nconduct for which a defendant has been acquitted”).\n\n      This case is similar to Dowling, in which the Supreme\n\nCourt held that the prosecution could present evidence of a\n\nprior   robbery,       of   which     the       defendant        had     already   been\n\nacquitted, as evidence of other crimes or bad acts under\n\n\n                                           23\n\fFed. R. Evid. 404(b).                See 493 U.S. at 348, 350.              Dowling\n\nspecifically noted that, to present evidence of other bad\n\nacts under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), the prosecution need not\n\nprove the defendant committed that act beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, but only that the jury could “reasonably conclude\n\nthat the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.”\n\n493 U.S. at 348-49.            In Dowling, then, “[t]he Supreme Court\n\nrejected the [collateral-estoppel] claim, pointing to the\n\ndifference in the burden[s] of proof” between convicting a\n\ndefendant         and   establishing         the    evidence’s     admissibility.\n\nRossetti v. Curran, 80 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996); see also\n\nUnited States v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378, 386 (1992).                               Under\n\nMassachusetts law, the proponent of evidence at trial, upon\n\ngeneral objection, only “has the burden . . . of satisfying\n\nthe    trial      judge     that    the    proposed    evidence     has    rational\n\nprobative value.”             H.E. Fletcher Co. v. Commonwealth, 214\n\nN.E.2d 721, 725 (Mass. 1966); see generally Rossetti, 80\n\nF.3d    at    5    (noting    that        “[n]o    intermediate    fact     need   be\n\nproved       beyond     a   reasonable       doubt,    so   long   as     the   crime\n\nitself is proved beyond a reasonable doubt”).                             For these\n\nreasons, Clarke has failed to establish that habeas relief\n\nis warranted under his collateral-estoppel claim.\n\n                                   III.

Clarke argues that 1) the Commonwealth unconstitutionally used the fact that he invoked his right to remain silent during a police interrogation against him at trial; and 2) Clarke's retrial, following two earlier trials on similar charges, violated double jeopardy. We reject these arguments and, having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ß 2253, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual background</h2>\n<p>Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, <i>see </i><i>Brewer v. Marshall,</i> 119 F.3d 993, 995 (1st Cir.1997), the evidence presented during Clarke's third trial established <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> the following: At approximately 9:30 p.m. one night in March 1995, the victim was walking from her home in Roxbury, Massachusetts, to a nearby restaurant. A burgundy-colored car drove up onto the sidewalk, blocking the victim's path. A man, unknown to the victim at the time but later identified as Clarke, jumped out of the car, pointed a gun at the victim, and pushed her into the car. Clarke then drove to a home at 22 Skyview Lane, where he forced the victim into the home's basement at gunpoint. There, Clarke \"raped her by first inserting the gun into her vagina, then inserting his penis into her vagina, and finally by inserting his penis into her mouth.\" <i>Clarke v. Spencer,</i> 585 F.Supp.2d 196, 200 (D.Mass. 2008).</p>\n<p>Several weeks later, the victim \"recognized and identified Clarke as the man who raped her when, by chance, she ran into him at Boston City Hospital. After a chase by [the victim's] boyfriend and hospital security guards, Clarke was apprehended and taken into custody by Boston Police officers.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>At the time of his arrest, Clarke told police that he knew the woman who lived at 22 Skyview Lane, but that he had never taken another woman there and he had never seen the woman who was now accusing him of rape. At trial, however, Clarke testified instead that he met the victim at a club and she propositioned him, offering sex for money. According to Clarke, he accepted the offer, paid the woman half of their agreed-upon fee, and drove her to 22 Skyview Lane, where he knew the owner would not be at home. Clarke testified that, once they got to the house, he was unable to pay the rest of the agreed-upon fee and the woman, therefore, threatened to accuse Clarke of rape.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural background</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. State proceedings</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth tried Clarke three times.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. First trial, occurring in January 1997</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts initially charged Clarke with five offenses: \"assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping, and three counts of aggravated rape, one count for each different form of penetration. Clarke's first trial ... resulted in a mistrial when the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Second trial, occurring in August 1997</h2>\n<p>\"Clarke was retried in August, 1997, on the same charges.\" <i>Id.</i> The jury convicted him of kidnapping and two counts of the lesser included offense of rape. <i>See id.</i> at 201. The jury acquitted Clarke of the aggravated portion of the rape charges, as well as the charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and the third rape count. <i>See id.</i> at 201. On direct appeal, however, the Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed Clarke's three convictions and remanded his case for another trial, after concluding the Commonwealth had improperly used Clarke's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence against him at trial. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Clarke,</i> 48 Mass.App.Ct. 482, 722 N.E.2d 987, 992 (2000), <i>further review denied,</i> 431 Mass. 1103, 733 N.E.2d 124 (Table) (2000).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Third trial, occurring in August 2001</h2>\n<p>Clarke's third trial, the one at issue here, occurred in August 2001. The Commonwealth, this time, tried Clarke only on two charges of rape and one count of kidnapping. <i>See </i><i>Clarke,</i> 585 F.Supp.2d at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> 201. The third jury convicted Clarke of all three offenses, and the court sentenced Clarke to twelve years in prison. <i>See id.</i> According to Clarke, that sentence was later reduced to \"eight to ten years.\" (Aplt. Br. at 4 n. 1.)</p>\n<p>On direct appeal, the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed Clarke's convictions, <i>Commonwealth v. Clarke,</i> 799 N.E.2d 605 (Table), 2003 WL 22881000 (Mass.App.Ct. Dec.5, 2003) (unpublished), and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied further review, <i>Commonwealth v. Clarke,</i> 441 Mass. 1105, 806 N.E.2d 102 (Table) (Mass. Mar. 31, 2004) (unpublished).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Federal habeas proceedings</h2>\n<p>In March 2006, Clarke filed his federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ß 2254. The district court denied relief, but granted Clarke a certificate of appealability (\"COA\"), <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. ß 2253(c), on the claims he is currently pursuing on appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Whether the Commonwealth used Clarke's invocation of his right to remain silent during a police interrogation against him at trial</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Standard of review</h2>\n<p>Because the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed and rejected the merits of this claim, <i>see Clarke,</i> 2003 WL 22881000, at *1, a federal court \"shall not\" grant Clarke habeas relief on this basis unless the state appellate court's</p>\n<blockquote>adjudication of the claimÄî</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p>28 U.S.C. ß 2254(d). This court reviews the district court's decision to deny ß 2254 relief <i>de novo. See </i><i>John v. Russo,</i> 561 F.3d 88, 91 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Merits</h2>\n<p>The Government may not use at trial the fact that a defendant, after receiving <i>Miranda</i><sup>[1]</sup> warnings, invoked his right to remain silent. <i>See </i><i>Anderson v. Charles,</i> 447 U.S. 404, 407-08, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 65 L.Ed.2d 222 (1980); <i>Doyle v. Ohio,</i> 426 U.S. 610, 611, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976); <i>Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602. A defendant can, however, knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to remain silent, <i>see Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, by, for example, voluntarily answering questions after receiving <i>Miranda</i> warnings. <i>See </i><i>Charles,</i> 447 U.S. at 408, 100 S.Ct. 2180; <i>cf. </i><i>Montejo v. Louisiana,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2079, 2085, 173 L.Ed.2d 955 (2009) (addressing waiver of Fifth Amendment right to counsel after <i>Miranda</i> warnings). But such waiver \"is not an all-or-nothing proposition.\" <i>United States v. And˙jar-Basco,</i> 488 F.3d 549, 555 (1st Cir.2007). A suspect may invoke his right to remain silent in any manner at any time before or during interrogation. <i>See </i><i>Miranda,</i> 384 U.S. at 444-45, 473-74, 86 S.Ct. 1602. The First Circuit has further concluded that \"the words the defendant uses to assert the privilege are themselves protected by it.\" <i>And˙jar-Basco,</i> 488 F.3d at 557.</p>\n<p>Clarke contends that at trial the Commonwealth, in three ways, improperly used at trial the fact that he invoked his right to remain silent during an interrogation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*141</span> a. Detective Gavin's testimony</h2>\n<p>Clarke first argues that the Commonwealth improperly used his post-<i>Miranda</i> silence during its direct examination of Detective Donna Gavin. Gavin testified that when she interviewed Clarke, following his arrest, Clarke told her that he had never seen the victim before and that he had never brought any female guest to 22 Skyview Lane. Gavin asked Clarke how it was, then, that the victim could describe the home located at 22 Skyview Lane. But, before Gavin could explain to the jury Clarke's answer to that question, the court sustained defense counsel's objection because it was in response to that question that Clarke invoked his right to remain silent. Gavin then testified simply that the interview had ended shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court rejected Clarke's claim that Detective Gavin's direct testimony amounted to improper use of his invoking his right to remain silent at the post-arrest interview because the trial court sustained the objection and Gavin never answered the question. <i>See Clarke,</i> 2003 WL 22881000, at *1. That determination was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. <i>See </i><i>Greer v. Miller,</i> 483 U.S. 756, 763-65, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Cross-examination of Clarke</h2>\n<p>Clarke next argues that the prosecutor improperly used Clarke's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence while cross-examining him. On direct examination, Clarke testified, contrary to Detective Gavin, that he told the detective that he had once brought a prostitute to 22 Skyview Lane and that when he could not pay her, she threatened to accuse him of rape. During cross-examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. It's your testimony ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. It's my testimony today before the jurors that I did told [Detective Gavin] I brought someone, a guest, a prostitute, at 22 Skyview Lane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Sir, isn't it true that you told Detective Gavin that you never brought anyone to Skyview Lane, right sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Totally impossible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And sir, when she asked you, she asked you, didn't she, sir, how the woman would know the inside and outside of that house, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Counsel]: Objection</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, may I be heard at sidebar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: No, you may not. Sustained. Move on, let's go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, may I be heard at side bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: No, you may not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You were asked about the description of the house, correct, Mr. Clarke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Sir, you'd agree with me that Detective Gavin wouldn't have asked that question if you had said that you had brought someone to Skyview Lane, right, Mr. Clarke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, may I be heard at side bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: No, you may not. Let's move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You'd agree, sir, that that question wouldn't make any sense, right, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You'd agree, sir, that Detective Gavin would have no reason to ask you about how she would be able to describe <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> the inside and outside of the house if you had told her that you brought someone in that house, right, Mr. Clarke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And Detective Gavin asked you that question, didn't she, Mr. Clarke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p>(Tr. v. II at 278-80.) Later in the cross-examination, the prosecutor asked: \"When you knew, sir, that mistaken identity would not work\" as a defense, \"isn't that when you said ... she was a prostitute?\" (<i>Id.</i> at 293.) The trial court sustained defense counsel's objection and ordered the \"[j]ury [to] disregard the last question.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court held this cross-examination did not amount to improper use of Clarke's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence, again because the trial court had sustained defense counsel's objections to all of those questions \"and the jury consequently never heard the answer or that it was the defendant, not Detective Gavin, who terminated the interview.\" <i>Clarke,</i> 2003 WL 22881000, at *1. That determination was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>The Government might improperly \"use\" a defendant's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence simply by posing questions to a witness, even where the witness does not answer. <i>See </i><i>Ellen v. Brady,</i> 475 F.3d 5, 12-14 (1st Cir.2007). In addition, \"[a] prosecutor's persistence in referring to the defendant's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence ... may result in a [constitutional] violation even when no evidence of the defendant's silence is submitted to a jury.\"<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 14. But that was not the case here.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor's questions did not directly or indirectly suggest that Clarke might have invoked his right to remain silent. And the trial court prevented any response from Clarke from which jurors might have inferred that he invoked that right. In addition, both before and after trial, the court instructed jurors generally to disregard questions and evidence to which an objection had been sustained. <i>See </i><i>Greer,</i> 483 U.S. at 764-65, 107 S.Ct. 3102 (addressing a single objectionable question); <i>see also And˙jar-Basco,</i> 488 F.3d at 559-60; <i>Ellen,</i> 475 F.3d at 11.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Closing argument</h2>\n<p>Lastly, Clarke asserts that comments the prosecutor made during her closing argument amounted to improper use of Clarke's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence. The prosecutor argued, in closing, that Clarke</p>\n<blockquote>needs to explain to you today why he said to Detective Gavin when Detective Gavin said to him, \"Did you ever see that woman before?\" \"No, I've never seen her before.\" \"Did you ever take a woman to 22 Skyview Lane?\" \"No, I never took a woman to 22 Skyview Lane.\" But think about it, ladies and gentlemen, why would Detective Gavin then ask, why would she say, \"Well, if you never took a woman to 22 Skyview Lane and you don't know this woman, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> how come she can describe the inside and outside of that house?\" Why would she ask that, that wouldn't make sense.</blockquote>\n<p>(Tr. v. III at 30.)</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court held that \"there was nothing improper about the prosecutor's arguing to the jury that the story the defendant gave to the detective prior to ending the interview was inconsistent with his trial testimony.\" <i>Clarke,</i> 2003 WL 22881000, at *1. That determination, too, was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. The Commonwealth could properly introduce evidence of what Clarke told Detective Gavin during the interrogation, before Clarke invoked his right to remain silent. <i>See </i><i>Charles,</i> 447 U.S. at 408, 100 S.Ct. 2180; <i>And˙jar-Basco,</i> 488 F.3d at 555. The fact that what Clarke told Detective Gavin contradicted the story that Clarke told jurors at trial was fair game during closing argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Whether the jury's verdict in the second trial precluded Clarke's third trial on the two rape offenses</h2>\n<p>At his <i>second</i> trial, the jury acquitted Clarke of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, one count of rape, and the aggravated element of all three rape charges, but convicted him of kidnapping and two counts of rape. <i>See Clarke,</i> 2003 WL 22881000, at *1. The Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed those three convictions, paving the way for Clarke's third trial, at issue here. <i>See </i><i>Clarke,</i> 722 N.E.2d at 989, 994. On appeal to this court, Clarke asserts two theories for why the results of his second trial precluded his retrial on any of the rape counts, or at least precluded the Commonwealth from presenting at his third trial any evidence that he had a gun.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Whether double jeopardy barred Clarke's third trial on any of the rape charges</h2>\n<p>Clarke's first theory is that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded the Commonwealth from retrying him on any of the three rape charges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Procedural default</h2>\n<p>The district court held that for federal habeas purposes Clarke had procedurally defaulted this claim by failing to raise it in the state trial court. <i>See </i><i>Clarke,</i> 585 F.Supp.2d at 203-04. We disagree. \"[A] federal claimant's procedural default precludes federal habeas review. . . only if the last state court rendering a judgment in the case rests its judgment on the procedural default.\" <i>Harris v. Reed,</i> 489 U.S. 255, 262, 109 S.Ct. 1038, 103 L.Ed.2d 308 (1989). Although Clarke failed to raise this double-jeopardy argument before or during his third trial,<sup>[3]</sup> Clarke did raise the issue on direct appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. And, notwithstanding Clarke's default in the trial court, the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed and rejected this claim on its merits. <i>See Clarke,</i> 2003 WL 22881000, at *2. We, therefore, can address the merits of Clarke's double-jeopardy claim here. <i>See </i><i>Harris,</i> 489 U.S. at 263, 109 S.Ct. 1038 (holding that \"a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on... habeas review unless the last state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*144</span> court rendering a judgment in the case clearly and expressly states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar\" internal quotes omitted)); <i>see also </i><i>Carsetti v. Maine,</i> 932 F.2d 1007, 1010 (1st Cir. 1991); <i>Allen v. Massachusetts,</i> 926 F.2d 74, 78-79 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Standard of review</h2>\n<p>Because the state appellate court addressed and rejected Clarke's double-jeopardy claim on its merits, this court \"shall not\" grant Clarke habeas relief unless the state appellate court's \"adjudication of the claim\" was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent, or was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. ß 2254(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Merits</h2>\n<p>Following the reversal of the results of Clarke's second trial, the Commonwealth was free to retry him on the offenses for which he had previously been convicted-kidnapping and two rapes-but could not retry him on the offenses on which the second jury had acquitted-assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, aggravated rape, and a third rape. <i>See </i><i>Lockhart v. Nelson,</i> 488 U.S. 33, 38-39, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988). The problem in this case, according to Clarke, is that it is unclear on which of the three rape counts the jury acquitted during the second trial. The three verdict forms for rape submitted to the jury during the second trial each listed aggravated rape and the lesser offense of rape, but did not otherwise specify to which of the rape charges each verdict form referred-penile penetration, oral rape, or penetration with the gun. Clarke contends that, because it was unclear on which of these three rape charges the jury acquitted, the Commonwealth could not retry him on <i>any</i> of those three rape charges.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court rejected that argument <i>see Clarke,</i> 2003 WL 22881000, at *2, concluding that the trial court had clearly instructed jurors which charged rape count pertained to each verdict slip:</p>\n<blockquote>[L]et me first tell you what the Commonwealth's theory is. The Commonwealth is going forward alleging aggravated rape, three counts of aggravated rape, first by penetration by the defendant, the defendant's penis into [the victim's] vagina; second, oral penetration of the defendant's penis into her mouth; and, third, penetration into her vagina by a gun. Those are the three indictments for aggravated rape.</blockquote>\n<p>(D. Ct. Doc. 11, attachment 1, supp. app. at 1.) Because the jury acquitted Clarke of the third rape count, the state appellate court determined that the second jury acquitted Clarke of the rape involving penetration with the gun, <i>Clarke,</i> 2003 WL 22881000, at *2. Therefore, the Massachusetts Appeals Court concluded that trying Clarke again on the other two rapes counts did not violate double jeopardy. <i>See id.</i> That determination was not an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent. <i>See </i><i>Abney v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 651, 663-65, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977) (considering, in rejecting double-jeopardy argument against second trial, jury instructions given during first trial to determine which of two offenses the jury convicted the defendant). Nor, on the facts of this case, was it \"an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.\" 28 U.S.C. ß 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p>As an alternative theory for habeas relief, Clarke argues that his trial attorney was constitutionally ineffective for failing to raise this double-jeopardy argument before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> or during his third trial. To succeed on such a claim, Clarke must establish both that his trial counsel's performance was deficient and that that deficiency prejudiced his defense. <i>See </i><i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Because we have concluded that Clarke's double-jeopardy claim fails on its merits, his trial attorney was not constitutionally deficient in failing to raise this issue, nor did that failure prejudice Clarke's defense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Whether principles of collateral estoppel precluded the Commonwealth, during Clarke's third trial, from introducing evidence that Clarke had a gun</h2>\n<p>Clarke's final theory for habeas relief is that, if it was clear that the jury at his second trial acquitted him of rape by penetrating the victim with a gun, then the Commonwealth was collaterally estopped from presenting at his third trial evidence that he had a gun.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Exhaustion</h2>\n<p>While collateral estoppel is still an \"element in the Double Jeopardy Clause,\" such an argument is distinct from the core concept of Double Jeopardy. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marino,</i> 200 F.3d 6, 9, 12 (1st Cir.1999). Clarke never specifically raised his collateral-estoppel argument to the Massachusetts state courts. It is, thus, unexhausted. Nevertheless, we can still address the merits of Clarke's claim here because we conclude the issue does not warrant habeas relief. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. ß 2254(b)(2) (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.\")</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Merits</h2>\n<p>Because Clarke never raised his collateral-estoppel claim in the state court, our review is <i>de novo. See </i><i>Marino,</i> 200 F.3d at 10.</p>\n<p>Collateral estoppel, in the criminal context, \"means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\" <i>Ashe v. Swenson,</i> 397 U.S. 436, 443, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970); <i>see also </i><i>Yeager v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2360, 2367, 174 L.Ed.2d 78 (2009); <i>Bobby v. Bies,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2145, 2152, 173 L.Ed.2d 1173 (2009). Clarke asserts that the jury at his second trial found that he did not have a gun when he kidnapped and twice raped the victim. Clarke bases this argument on the jury's decision to acquit him of the charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, rape by penetration with a gun, and aggravated rape, which may be proven by the use of a gun during the rape. Assuming, without deciding, that Clarke's second jury did find that he did not have a gun,<sup>[4]</sup> Clarke's collateral-estoppel argument still does not warrant relief.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*146</span> The jury at his third trial, in convicting Clarke of kidnapping and two rape counts, did not necessarily have to find that Clarke had a gun. <i>See </i><i>Bies,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2152 (\"A determination ranks as necessary or essential only when the final outcome hinges on it.\"). Therefore, the jury did not have to make a finding of ultimate fact that contradicted the second jury's findings. <i>See Dowling,</i> 493 U.S. at 348, 110 S.Ct. 668 (rejecting collateral-estoppel claim where, \"unlike the situation in <i>Ashe</i>..., the prior acquittal did not determine an ultimate issue in the present case\"); <i>Marino,</i> 200 F.3d at 9 (noting that, \"[w]hen a jury reaches a general verdict of acquittal on certain counts, ... the defendant may argue that the jury must have based its acquittal on certain factual findings favorable to him, and that those findings bar any retrial on other counts upon which he was not acquitted, since his conviction in the retrial <i>necessarily</i> would depend on the jury at retrial reaching contrary findings as to the same <i>essential</i> facts\") (emphasis added); <i>United States v. Dray,</i> 901 F.2d 1132, 1136 (1st Cir.1990) (noting that, \"if an issue determined in a prior proceeding between the same parties (or their privies) constitutes a <i>necessary element</i> of a subsequent prosecution, collateral estoppel will likely operate as a complete bar to the latter prosecution\") (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Here, in the third trial, Clarke was charged with one count of kidnapping and two counts of rape. None of those counts required proof that Clarke had or used a gun. Thus, there is no double jeopardy problem, even assuming the jury in the second trial determined that Clarke did not use a gun during these crimes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, evidence that Clarke used a gun was still relevant evidence to help explain how Clarke was able to force the victim into his car and to compel her to submit to his sexual demands. Even reading the second verdict as Clarke argues, all that can be determined from the second verdict is that the jury found the government had failed to prove the existence of a gun \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" But that is not the test for the introduction of relevant evidence in the third trial; that only requires that the evidence be probativeÄîthat it tends to explain or strengthen or make an asserted act more likely than not to be true. Clarke never objected to the introduction of this evidence on the grounds that it was not relevant. <i>See </i><i>Dowling,</i> 493 U.S. at 348, 350, 110 S.Ct. 668 (declining to extend <i>Ashe</i> \"to exclude in all circumstances ... relevant and probative evidence that is otherwise admissible under the Rules of Evidence simply because it relates to alleged criminal conduct for which a defendant has been acquitted\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*147</span> This case is similar to <i>Dowling,</i> in which the Supreme Court held that the prosecution could present evidence of a prior robbery, of which the defendant had already been acquitted, as evidence of other crimes or bad acts under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). <i>See</i> 493 U.S. at 348, 350, 110 S.Ct. 668. <i>Dowling</i> specifically noted that, to present evidence of other bad acts under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), the prosecution need not prove the defendant committed that act beyond a reasonable doubt, but only that the jury could \"reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.\" 493 U.S. at 348-49, 110 S.Ct. 668. In <i>Dowling,</i> then, \"[t]he Supreme Court rejected the [collateral-estoppel] claim, pointing to the difference in the burden[s] of proof\" between convicting a defendant and establishing the evidence's admissibility. <i>Rossetti v. Curran,</i> 80 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1996); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Felix,</i> 503 U.S. 378, 386, 112 S.Ct. 1377, 118 L.Ed.2d 25 (1992). Under Massachusetts law, the proponent of evidence at trial, upon general objection, only \"has the burden ... of satisfying the trial judge that the proposed evidence has rational probative value.\" <i>H.E. Fletcher Co. v. Commonwealth,</i> 350 Mass. 316, 214 N.E.2d 721, 725 (1966); <i>see generally </i><i>Rossetti,</i> 80 F.3d at 5 (noting that \"[n]o intermediate fact need be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, so long as the crime itself is proved beyond a reasonable doubt\"). For these reasons, Clarke has failed to establish that habeas relief is warranted under his collateral-estoppel claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's decision denying Clark habeas relief.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, \"sitting by designation.\"</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p>[2]  In making this observation, the First Circuit cited, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hill v. Turpin,</i> 135 F.3d 1411 (11th Cir. 1998), which found a constitutional violation under much more egregious circumstances than those presented here. <i>See </i><i>Ellen,</i> 475 F.3d at 14. In <i>Hill,</i> the prosecutor directly brought to the jury's attention Hill's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence on four separate occasions over the course of two days of trial, during the examination of several witnesses and closing argument. <i>See </i><i>Hill,</i> 135 F.3d at 1414-16. Under those circumstances, the Eleventh Circuit held that \"the prosecution's repeated and deliberate references throughout Hill's trial to his post-<i>Miranda</i> silence and request for counsel violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1412.</p>\n<p>[3]  Prior to his third trial, Clarke did file a motion to dismiss the indictment, raising a different double-jeopardy argumentÄîthat, because the prosecutor's actions during the second trial were taken in an attempt to goad Clarke into moving for a mistrial, double jeopardy precluded his retrial on the offenses on which the second jury convicted Clarke. <i>See Clarke,</i> 2003 WL 22881000, at *1. Clarke does not reassert that double-jeopardy argument in these habeas proceedings.</p>\n<p>[4]  In applying collateral estoppel in a criminal context where, as here, the jury issued a general verdict, we must \"examine the record of the prior proceeding\" to determine what the prior jury necessarily found. <i>Ashe,</i> 397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.Ct. 1189 (quotations omitted). In doing so, we will take \"into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter\" in order to decide \"whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Yeager,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2367. Clarke bears the burden of proving \"unequivocally[ ] that the [earlier] jury verdict ... necessarily included an implicit factual finding\" precluding retrial. <i>Marino,</i> 200 F.3d at 10 (quotations omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Dowling v. United States,</i> 493 U.S. 342, 350, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990). But Clarke, who has been represented by counsel throughout these federal habeas proceedings, has failed to provide this court with a record from the second trial sufficient to permit us to conduct such a review. <i>See </i><i>Dowling,</i> 493 U.S. at 351-52, 110 S.Ct. 668 (rejecting collateral-estoppel argument where defendant had failed to show that prior prosecution necessarily decided issue sought to be precluded in subsequent prosecution).\n</p>\n<p>\"If a judgment does not depend on a given determination, relitigation of that determination is not precluded\"; \"[a] determination ranks as necessary or essential only when the final outcome hinges on it.\" <i>Bies,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2152. The district court, in denying habeas relief, held that Clarke had failed to show that his second jury found that he had no gun, suggesting that, even in light of the acquittals, the jury still would not necessarily have had to find that Clarke had no gun. <i>See </i><i>Clarke,</i> 585 F.Supp.2d at 208. Clarke has failed to present to us an adequate record for us to challenge that conclusion.</p>\n\n</div>",

We reject these arguments and, having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ß 2253, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Factual background</h2>\n<p>Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, <i>see </i><i>Brewer v. Marshall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197471\"><a href=\"/opinion/197471/brewer-v-marshall-sheriff/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, 995 (1st Cir.1997), the evidence presented during Clarke's third trial established <span class=\"star-pagination\">*139</span> the following: At approximately 9:30 p.m. one night in March 1995, the victim was walking from her home in Roxbury, Massachusetts, to a nearby restaurant. A burgundy-colored car drove up onto the sidewalk, blocking the victim's path. A man, unknown to the victim at the time but later identified as Clarke, jumped out of the car, pointed a gun at the victim, and pushed her into the car. Clarke then drove to a home at 22 Skyview Lane, where he forced the victim into the home's basement at gunpoint. There, Clarke \"raped her by first inserting the gun into her vagina, then inserting his penis into her vagina, and finally by inserting his penis into her mouth.\" <i>Clarke v. Spencer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2422394\"><a href=\"/opinion/2422394/clarke-v-spencer/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 200 (D.Mass. 2008).</p>\n<p>Several weeks later, the victim \"recognized and identified Clarke as the man who raped her when, by chance, she ran into him at Boston City Hospital. After a chase by [the victim's] boyfriend and hospital security guards, Clarke was apprehended and taken into custody by Boston Police officers.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>At the time of his arrest, Clarke told police that he knew the woman who lived at 22 Skyview Lane, but that he had never taken another woman there and he had never seen the woman who was now accusing him of rape. At trial, however, Clarke testified instead that he met the victim at a club and she propositioned him, offering sex for money. According to Clarke, he accepted the offer, paid the woman half of their agreed-upon fee, and drove her to 22 Skyview Lane, where he knew the owner would not be at home. Clarke testified that, once they got to the house, he was unable to pay the rest of the agreed-upon fee and the woman, therefore, threatened to accuse Clarke of rape.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Procedural background</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. State proceedings</h2>\n<p>The Commonwealth tried Clarke three times.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. First trial, occurring in January 1997</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts initially charged Clarke with five offenses: \"assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, kidnapping, and three counts of aggravated rape, one count for each different form of penetration. Clarke's first trial ... resulted in a mistrial when the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. Second trial, occurring in August 1997</h2>\n<p>\"Clarke was retried in August, 1997, on the same charges.\" <i>Id.</i> The jury convicted him of kidnapping and two counts of the lesser included offense of rape. <i>See id.</i> at 201. The jury acquitted Clarke of the aggravated portion of the rape charges, as well as the charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and the third rape count. <i>See id.</i> at 201. On direct appeal, however, the Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed Clarke's three convictions and remanded his case for another trial, after concluding the Commonwealth had improperly used Clarke's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence against him at trial. <i>See </i><i>Commonwealth v. Clarke,</i> 48 Mass.App.Ct. 482, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></span>, 992 (2000), <i>further review denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span> (Table) (2000).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Third trial, occurring in August 2001</h2>\n<p>Clarke's third trial, the one at issue here, occurred in August 2001. The Commonwealth, this time, tried Clarke only on two charges of rape and one count of kidnapping. <i>See </i><i>Clarke,</i> 585 F.Supp.2d at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*140</span> 201. The third jury convicted Clarke of all three offenses, and the court sentenced Clarke to twelve years in prison. <i>See id.</i> According to Clarke, that sentence was later reduced to \"eight to ten years.\" (Aplt.

Detective Gavin's testimony</h2>\n<p>Clarke first argues that the Commonwealth improperly used his post-<i>Miranda</i> silence during its direct examination of Detective Donna Gavin. Gavin testified that when she interviewed Clarke, following his arrest, Clarke told her that he had never seen the victim before and that he had never brought any female guest to 22 Skyview Lane. Gavin asked Clarke how it was, then, that the victim could describe the home located at 22 Skyview Lane. But, before Gavin could explain to the jury Clarke's answer to that question, the court sustained defense counsel's objection because it was in response to that question that Clarke invoked his right to remain silent. Gavin then testified simply that the interview had ended shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court rejected Clarke's claim that Detective Gavin's direct testimony amounted to improper use of his invoking his right to remain silent at the post-arrest interview because the trial court sustained the objection and Gavin never answered the question. <i>See Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22881000</span></span>, at *1.

Cross-examination of Clarke</h2>\n<p>Clarke next argues that the prosecutor improperly used Clarke's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence while cross-examining him. On direct examination, Clarke testified, contrary to Detective Gavin, that he told the detective that he had once brought a prostitute to 22 Skyview Lane and that when he could not pay her, she threatened to accuse him of rape. During cross-examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote>Q. It's your testimony ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. It's my testimony today before the jurors that I did told [Detective Gavin] I brought someone, a guest, a prostitute, at 22 Skyview Lane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Sir, isn't it true that you told Detective Gavin that you never brought anyone to Skyview Lane, right sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A. Totally impossible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And sir, when she asked you, she asked you, didn't she, sir, how the woman would know the inside and outside of that house, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Counsel]: Objection</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, may I be heard at sidebar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: No, you may not. Sustained. Move on, let's go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, may I be heard at side bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: No, you may not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You were asked about the description of the house, correct, Mr. Clarke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. Sir, you'd agree with me that Detective Gavin wouldn't have asked that question if you had said that you had brought someone to Skyview Lane, right, Mr. Clarke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, may I be heard at side bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: No, you may not. Let's move on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You'd agree, sir, that that question wouldn't make any sense, right, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. You'd agree, sir, that Detective Gavin would have no reason to ask you about how she would be able to describe <span class=\"star-pagination\">*142</span> the inside and outside of the house if you had told her that you brought someone in that house, right, Mr. Clarke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q. And Detective Gavin asked you that question, didn't she, Mr. Clarke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[Defense Attorney]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p>(Tr. v. II at 278-80.) Later in the cross-examination, the prosecutor asked: \"When you knew, sir, that mistaken identity would not work\" as a defense, \"isn't that when you said ... she was a prostitute?\" (<i>Id.</i> at 293.) The trial court sustained defense counsel's objection and ordered the \"[j]ury [to] disregard the last question.\" (<i>Id.</i>)</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court held this cross-examination did not amount to improper use of Clarke's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence, again because the trial court had sustained defense counsel's objections to all of those questions \"and the jury consequently never heard the answer or that it was the defendant, not Detective Gavin, who terminated the interview.\" <i>Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22881000</span></span>, at *1. That determination was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p>The Government might improperly \"use\" a defendant's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence simply by posing questions to a witness, even where the witness does not answer. <i>See </i><i>Ellen v. Brady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202609\"><a href=\"/opinion/202609/ellen-v-brady/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 12-14 (1st Cir.2007). In addition, \"[a] prosecutor's persistence in referring to the defendant's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence ... may result in a [constitutional] violation even when no evidence of the defendant's silence is submitted to a jury.\"<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 14. But that was not the case here.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor's questions did not directly or indirectly suggest that Clarke might have invoked his right to remain silent. And the trial court prevented any response from Clarke from which jurors might have inferred that he invoked that right. In addition, both before and after trial, the court instructed jurors generally to disregard questions and evidence to which an objection had been sustained. <i>See </i><i>Greer,</i> 483 U.S. at 764-65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111956\"><a href=\"/opinion/111956/greer-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Closing argument</h2>\n<p>Lastly, Clarke asserts that comments the prosecutor made during her closing argument amounted to improper use of Clarke's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence. The prosecutor argued, in closing, that Clarke</p>\n<blockquote>needs to explain to you today why he said to Detective Gavin when Detective Gavin said to him, \"Did you ever see that woman before?\" \"No, I've never seen her before.\" \"Did you ever take a woman to 22 Skyview Lane?\" \"No, I never took a woman to 22 Skyview Lane.\" But think about it, ladies and gentlemen, why would Detective Gavin then ask, why would she say, \"Well, if you never took a woman to 22 Skyview Lane and you don't know this woman, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*143</span> how come she can describe the inside and outside of that house?\" Why would she ask that, that wouldn't make sense.</blockquote>\n<p>(Tr. v. III at 30.)</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court held that \"there was nothing improper about the prosecutor's arguing to the jury that the story the defendant gave to the detective prior to ending the interview was inconsistent with his trial testimony.\" <i>Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22881000</span></span>, at *1. That determination, too, was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent. The Commonwealth could properly introduce evidence of what Clarke told Detective Gavin during the interrogation, before Clarke invoked his right to remain silent. <i>See </i><i>Charles,</i> 447 U.S. at 408, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110306\"><a href=\"/opinion/110306/anderson-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2180</span></a></span>; <i>And˙jar-Basco,</i> 488 F.3d at 555. The fact that what Clarke told Detective Gavin contradicted the story that Clarke told jurors at trial was fair game during closing argument.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Whether the jury's verdict in the second trial precluded Clarke's third trial on the two rape offenses</h2>\n<p>At his <i>second</i> trial, the jury acquitted Clarke of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, one count of rape, and the aggravated element of all three rape charges, but convicted him of kidnapping and two counts of rape. <i>See Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22881000</span></span>, at *1. The Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed those three convictions, paving the way for Clarke's third trial, at issue here. <i>See </i><i>Clarke,</i> 722 N.E.2d at 989, 994. On appeal to this court, Clarke asserts two theories for why the results of his second trial precluded his retrial on any of the rape counts, or at least precluded the Commonwealth from presenting at his third trial any evidence that he had a gun.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Whether double jeopardy barred Clarke's third trial on any of the rape charges</h2>\n<p>Clarke's first theory is that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded the Commonwealth from retrying him on any of the three rape charges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Procedural default</h2>\n<p>The district court held that for federal habeas purposes Clarke had procedurally defaulted this claim by failing to raise it in the state trial court. <i>See </i><i>Clarke,</i> 585 F.Supp.2d at 203-04. We disagree. \"[A] federal claimant's procedural default precludes federal habeas review. . . only if the last state court rendering a judgment in the case rests its judgment on the procedural default.\" <i>Harris v. Reed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112205\"><a href=\"/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 262, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112205\"><a href=\"/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span> (1989). Although Clarke failed to raise this double-jeopardy argument before or during his third trial,<sup>[3]</sup> Clarke did raise the issue on direct appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. And, notwithstanding Clarke's default in the trial court, the Massachusetts Appeals Court addressed and rejected this claim on its merits. <i>See Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22881000</span></span>, at *2. We, therefore, can address the merits of Clarke's double-jeopardy claim here. <i>See </i><i>Harris,</i> 489 U.S. at 263, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112205\"><a href=\"/opinion/112205/harris-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Standard of review</h2>\n<p>Because the state appellate court addressed and rejected Clarke's double-jeopardy claim on its merits, this court \"shall not\" grant Clarke habeas relief unless the state appellate court's \"adjudication of the claim\" was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court precedent, or was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state-court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. ß 2254(d).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. Merits</h2>\n<p>Following the reversal of the results of Clarke's second trial, the Commonwealth was free to retry him on the offenses for which he had previously been convicted-kidnapping and two rapes-but could not retry him on the offenses on which the second jury had acquitted-assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, aggravated rape, and a third rape. <i>See </i><i>Lockhart v. Nelson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112155\"><a href=\"/opinion/112155/lockhart-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 38-39, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112155\"><a href=\"/opinion/112155/lockhart-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1988). The problem in this case, according to Clarke, is that it is unclear on which of the three rape counts the jury acquitted during the second trial. The three verdict forms for rape submitted to the jury during the second trial each listed aggravated rape and the lesser offense of rape, but did not otherwise specify to which of the rape charges each verdict form referred-penile penetration, oral rape, or penetration with the gun. Clarke contends that, because it was unclear on which of these three rape charges the jury acquitted, the Commonwealth could not retry him on <i>any</i> of those three rape charges.</p>\n<p>The Massachusetts Appeals Court rejected that argument <i>see Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22881000</span></span>, at *2, concluding that the trial court had clearly instructed jurors which charged rape count pertained to each verdict slip:</p>\n<blockquote>[L]et me first tell you what the Commonwealth's theory is. The Commonwealth is going forward alleging aggravated rape, three counts of aggravated rape, first by penetration by the defendant, the defendant's penis into [the victim's] vagina; second, oral penetration of the defendant's penis into her mouth; and, third, penetration into her vagina by a gun. Those are the three indictments for aggravated rape.</blockquote>\n<p>(D. Ct. Doc. 11, attachment 1, supp. app. at 1.) Because the jury acquitted Clarke of the third rape count, the state appellate court determined that the second jury acquitted Clarke of the rape involving penetration with the gun, <i>Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22881000</span></span>, at *2. Therefore, the Massachusetts Appeals Court concluded that trying Clarke again on the other two rapes counts did not violate double jeopardy. <i>See id.</i> That determination was not an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent. <i>See </i><i>Abney v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 663-65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109677\"><a href=\"/opinion/109677/abney-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nor, on the facts of this case, was it \"an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.\" 28 U.S.C. ß 2254(d)(2).</p>\n<p>As an alternative theory for habeas relief, Clarke argues that his trial attorney was constitutionally ineffective for failing to raise this double-jeopardy argument before <span class=\"star-pagination\">*145</span> or during his third trial. To succeed on such a claim, Clarke must establish both that his trial counsel's performance was deficient and that that deficiency prejudiced his defense. <i>See </i><i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984). Because we have concluded that Clarke's double-jeopardy claim fails on its merits, his trial attorney was not constitutionally deficient in failing to raise this issue, nor did that failure prejudice Clarke's defense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Whether principles of collateral estoppel precluded the Commonwealth, during Clarke's third trial, from introducing evidence that Clarke had a gun</h2>\n<p>Clarke's final theory for habeas relief is that, if it was clear that the jury at his second trial acquitted him of rape by penetrating the victim with a gun, then the Commonwealth was collaterally estopped from presenting at his third trial evidence that he had a gun.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. Exhaustion</h2>\n<p>While collateral estoppel is still an \"element in the Double Jeopardy Clause,\" such an argument is distinct from the core concept of Double Jeopardy. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Marino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198792\"><a href=\"/opinion/198792/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 9, 12 (1st Cir.1999). Clarke never specifically raised his collateral-estoppel argument to the Massachusetts state courts. It is, thus, unexhausted. Nevertheless, we can still address the merits of Clarke's claim here because we conclude the issue does not warrant habeas relief. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. ß 2254(b)(2) (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.\")</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b.

See </i><i>Marino,</i> 200 F.3d at 10.</p>\n<p>Collateral estoppel, in the criminal context, \"means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\" <i>Ashe v.

Clarke bases this argument on the jury's decision to acquit him of the charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, rape by penetration with a gun, and aggravated rape, which may be proven by the use of a gun during the rape. Assuming, without deciding, that Clarke's second jury did find that he did not have a gun,<sup>[4]</sup> Clarke's collateral-estoppel argument still does not warrant relief.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*146</span> The jury at his third trial, in convicting Clarke of kidnapping and two rape counts, did not necessarily have to find that Clarke had a gun. <i>See </i><i>Bies,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2152 (\"A determination ranks as necessary or essential only when the final outcome hinges on it.\"). Therefore, the jury did not have to make a finding of ultimate fact that contradicted the second jury's findings. <i>See Dowling,</i> 493 U.S. at 348, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

None of those counts required proof that Clarke had or used a gun. Thus, there is no double jeopardy problem, even assuming the jury in the second trial determined that Clarke did not use a gun during these crimes.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, evidence that Clarke used a gun was still relevant evidence to help explain how Clarke was able to force the victim into his car and to compel her to submit to his sexual demands. Even reading the second verdict as Clarke argues, all that can be determined from the second verdict is that the jury found the government had failed to prove the existence of a gun \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" But that is not the test for the introduction of relevant evidence in the third trial; that only requires that the evidence be probativeÄîthat it tends to explain or strengthen or make an asserted act more likely than not to be true. Clarke never objected to the introduction of this evidence on the grounds that it was not relevant. <i>See </i><i>Dowling,</i> 493 U.S. at 348, 350, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For these reasons, Clarke has failed to establish that habeas relief is warranted under his collateral-estoppel claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's decision denying Clark habeas relief.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, \"sitting by designation.\"</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966).</p>\n<p>[2]  In making this observation, the First Circuit cited, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hill v. Turpin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72636\"><a href=\"/opinion/72636/hill-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1411</span></a></span> (11th Cir. 1998), which found a constitutional violation under much more egregious circumstances than those presented here. <i>See </i><i>Ellen,</i> 475 F.3d at 14. In <i>Hill,</i> the prosecutor directly brought to the jury's attention Hill's post-<i>Miranda</i> silence on four separate occasions over the course of two days of trial, during the examination of several witnesses and closing argument. <i>See </i><i>Hill,</i> 135 F.3d at 1414-16. Under those circumstances, the Eleventh Circuit held that \"the prosecution's repeated and deliberate references throughout Hill's trial to his post-<i>Miranda</i> silence and request for counsel violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1412.</p>\n<p>[3]  Prior to his third trial, Clarke did file a motion to dismiss the indictment, raising a different double-jeopardy argumentÄîthat, because the prosecutor's actions during the second trial were taken in an attempt to goad Clarke into moving for a mistrial, double jeopardy precluded his retrial on the offenses on which the second jury convicted Clarke. <i>See Clarke,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22881000</span></span>, at *1. Clarke does not reassert that double-jeopardy argument in these habeas proceedings.</p>\n<p>[4]  In applying collateral estoppel in a criminal context where, as here, the jury issued a general verdict, we must \"examine the record of the prior proceeding\" to determine what the prior jury necessarily found. <i>Ashe,</i> 397 U.S. at 444, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108114\"><a href=\"/opinion/108114/ashe-v-swenson/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></a></span> (quotations omitted). In doing so, we will take \"into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter\" in order to decide \"whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Yeager,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2367. Clarke bears the burden of proving \"unequivocally[ ] that the [earlier] jury verdict ... necessarily included an implicit factual finding\" precluding retrial. <i>Marino,</i> 200 F.3d at 10 (quotations omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Dowling v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 350, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span> (1990). But Clarke, who has been represented by counsel throughout these federal habeas proceedings, has failed to provide this court with a record from the second trial sufficient to permit us to conduct such a review. <i>See </i><i>Dowling,</i> 493 U.S. at 351-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (rejecting collateral-estoppel argument where defendant had failed to show that prior prosecution necessarily decided issue sought to be precluded in subsequent prosecution).\n</p>\n<p>\"If a judgment does not depend on a given determination, relitigation of that determination is not precluded\"; \"[a] determination ranks as necessary or essential only when the final outcome hinges on it.\" <i>Bies,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 2152. The district court, in denying habeas relief, held that Clarke had failed to show that his second jury found that he had no gun, suggesting that, even in light of the acquittals, the jury still would not necessarily have had to find that Clarke had no gun. <i>See </i><i>Clarke,</i> 585 F.Supp.2d at 208. Clarke has failed to present to us an adequate record for us to challenge that conclusion.</p>\n\n</div>",
