Dugan on Petition for Review of an Order of The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals for petitioner.\n     Robert D. McCallum, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, Civil\nDivision, Christopher C. Fuller, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office\nof Immigration Litigation, and Brenda M. O'Malley, Trial Attorney,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, Civil Division, Department of\nJustice, on Respondent's Motion to Dismiss Petition for Review for\nLack of Jurisdiction and Opposition to Petitioner's Motion for a\nStay of Removal for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         November 27, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam. In 1995, petitioner Dias was convicted in\n\nthe trial court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of a\n\nviolation of the drug laws of that state. At the time of the\n\nconviction, petitioner was eligible for a discretionary waiver\n\nof deportation pursuant to former § 212(c) of the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act. In 1996, § 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) restricted the availability\n\nof   §   212(c)    relief   for   aliens   convicted   of   a   number   of\n\nfelonies, including petitioner's controlled substance offense.\n\n             The issue presented by this petition for review is\n\nwhether application of the new law to petitioner would have an\n\nimpermissible retroactive effect. Relying on INS v. St. Cyr,\n\n533 U.S. 289 (2001), petitioner argues that it would. In St.\n\nCyr, the Court held that, because new legal consequences would\n\nattach to events completed before its enactment, application of\n\nAEDPA to alien criminal defendants who pled guilty prior to\n\nAEDPA would constitute an \"impermissible retroactive effect.\"\n\nId., at 321. However, the decision in St. Cyr relied on the\n\nCourt's recognition that (1) plea agreements generally involve\n\na quid pro quo between a defendant and the government and (2)\n\nthat aliens often attach much importance to the immigration\n\nconsequences of the decision whether or not to enter into an\n\nagreement.        \"Preserving the client's right to remain in the\n\nUnited States may be more important to the client than any\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fpotential jail sentence.\" St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 322 (citation\n\nomitted).       Therefore, the potential for unfairness to one who\n\npled guilty in reliance on immigration law as it existed at the\n\ntime of the plea would be significant if the new law were\n\napplied retroactively. For this reason, the Court held that\n\nalien criminal defendants who pled guilty prior to AEDPA are\n\neligible to apply for discretionary relief under former §\n\n212(c) of the INA.\n\n              In contrast, those alien criminal defendants who\n\nchose to go to trial, prior to the change wrought by AEDPA,\n\nwere not relying on immigration law as it existed at the time\n\nin     making    that    decision.   The   inquiry   into    retroactive\n\napplication of a statute requires a \"commonsense, functional\n\njudgment\" about the new legal consequences that attach to\n\nevents completed before its passage. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 321.\n\n              Although predating St. Cyr, our decision in Mattis v.\n\nReno, 212 F.3d 31 (1st Cir. 2000), foreshadowed the correct\n\noutcome of this case. In Mattis we held that the retroactivity\n\nanalysis must include an examination of reliance in a guilty\n\nplea situation.         It follows that, having been convicted after\n\na trial where there was not, and could not have been, reliance\n\nby the defendant on the availability of discretionary relief,\n\nDias    may     not   argue   that   the   statute   has    impermissible\n\nretroactive effect as to him.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f               We now join the Seventh and Ninth Circuits in ruling\n\nthat     application       of   the    new   statutory    limitations    on\n\ndiscretionary relief does not have an impermissible retroactive\n\neffect    on    those   aliens   who    would   have   been   eligible   for\n\ndiscretionary relief when they were convicted of a felony after\n\ntrial. See Armendariz v. Sonchik, 291 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.\n\n2002)(\"aliens who elected a jury trial cannot plausibly claim\n\nthat they would have acted any differently if they had known\n\nabout § 440(d)\"); LaGuerre v. Reno, 164 F.3d 1035, 1041 (7th\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f",
