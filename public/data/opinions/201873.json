Madden, Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States\nAttorneys, and Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, on\nbrief for the appellee.\n\n\n\n                             October 21, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam.    Jose Del Carmen Corcino-Ramirez, a/k/a Juan\n\nRosado-Rivera, pled guilty to heroin trafficking charges and was\n\nsentenced to 97 months in prison.             On appeal, he claims that the\n\ndistrict court erred in enhancing his offense level for obstruction\n\nof justice based on his materially false statements about his\n\nidentity    and   citizenship     and,    because      of    that      obstruction,\n\ndeclining    to   reduce    his    offense       level      for    acceptance      of\n\nresponsibility.      He    also   claims       that   he    is    entitled    to   be\n\nresentenced under United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\n\nFinding those claims of error to be without merit, we affirm.\n\nA.   Obstruction of Justice\n\n            Guidelines     section   3C1.1      provides         for   a   two-level\n\nenhancement of the offense level where \"the defendant willfully\n\nobstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the\n\nadministration of justice during the course of the investigation,\n\nprosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\"\n\nThe commentary to this adjustment advises that it applies to, among\n\nother kinds of conduct, \"providing materially false information to\n\na judge or magistrate.\"           USSG § 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(f)). On\n\nappeal, defendant challenges the obstruction of justice enhancement\n\non   two   grounds--that    he    did    not    \"willfully\"         provide   false\n\ninformation and that the false information he provided, concerning\n\nhis identity and citizenship, was not material.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f           The short answer to defendant's willfulness argument is\n\nthat he waived it by conceding in the trial court that his false\n\nstatements were willfully made.1 United States v. Ruiz-Garcia, 886\n\nF.2d 474, 476 (1st Cir. 1989).      Moreover, even if this argument is\n\nviewed as merely forfeited--and therefore subject to plain error\n\nreview, United States v. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 272 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)--the district court did not plainly err in finding that\n\ndefendant's falsehoods were willful, given defendant's repeated use\n\nof a false name and misrepresentation of his citizenship over a\n\nfive-month period to pre-trial services, a magistrate judge, and\n\nthe   district   court--including    manufactured    details     about   his\n\npurported birth and early childhood in the United States--and the\n\nabsence of any innocent explanation of defendant's motive for doing\n\nso.   See United States v. Fox, 393 F.3d 52, 61 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Nor has defendant met his heavy burden of challenging the\n\ndistrict court's materiality finding on appeal.           See United States\n\nv. Feldman, 83 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1996).      In making that finding,\n\nthe   district   court   focused   primarily   on   the    materiality    of\n\ndefendant's misrepresentation of United States citizenship to the\n\nmagistrate judge's consideration of whether or not to grant him\n\n\n      1\n      In response to defense counsel's characterization of\ndefendant's lying to the court about his name and citizenship as a\n\"mistake,\" the district court said, \"Well, I don't call it a\nmistake. I call it a willful act,\" at which point defense counsel\nconceded:   \"That's fine.   His erroneous willful act, then.    He\nshould not have done that . . . . He knows that, and he knew it\nthen . . . .\"\n\n                                    -3-\n\fbail.       Defendant's argument that the bail determination ultimately\n\ndid not turn on that information (since bail was denied on other\n\ngrounds) is unavailing because materiality does not depend on\n\nwhether       the        false   information        actually    affected      the    bail\n\ndetermination but only on whether it could have done so.                            United\n\nStates v. Berrios, 132 F.3d 834, 840 (1st Cir. 1998); United States\n\nv. Restrepo, 53 F.3d 396, 397-98 (1st Cir. 1995). The district\n\ncourt's finding that defendant's citizenship was material, in that\n\nsense, to the bail determination is not clearly erroneous.2                         United\n\nStates v. Biyaga, 9 F.3d 204, 206 n.2 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nB.   Acceptance of Responsibility\n\n               Where, as here, the district court has properly granted\n\nan upward adjustment for obstruction of justice, a defendant bears\n\nthe burden of demonstrating that his case is so \"extraordinary\" as\n\nto   warrant        an    exception    to    the    general    rule   that   \"[c]onduct\n\nresulting in an enhancement [for obstruction of justice] ordinarily\n\nindicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for\n\nhis criminal conduct.\"                USSG § 3E1.1, comment. (n.4); see also\n\nUnited States v. Gonzalez, 12 F.3d 298, 300 (1st Cir. 1993).                        Here,\n\ndefendant       argues      that   his      case    was   extraordinary      because   he\n\n\n\n        2\n      Because we conclude that the district court correctly granted\nan   upward     adjustment    based   on    defendant's    material\nmisrepresentations to the magistrate judge at the bail hearing, we\nneed not consider whether his similar misrepresentations to pre-\ntrial services and to the district judge further supported an\nupward adjustment under this section.\n\n                                              -4-\n\fattempted    to    correct    his     falsehoods         shortly    after     the     court\n\naccepted    his    guilty    plea.      The       district      court    rejected     that\n\nargument    as,    essentially,       too    little,      too    late.        Given   that\n\ndefendant waited more than four months to correct his repeated\n\nfalse statements, that finding was not clearly erroneous.\n\nC.   Blakely/Booker Error\n\n            Defendant       concedes        that    he    did     not    preserve       his\n\nBlakely/Booker claim below and that the plain error standard\n\ntherefore applies.         However, before arguing that he is entitled to\n\nresentencing under the plain error standard articulated by this\n\ncourt in United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), he argues that we should reconsider that standard and\n\nconclude, instead, that a defendant need not show prejudice to\n\nestablish plain error.        We have repeatedly rejected such arguments\n\nas beyond the power of a post-Antonakopoulos panel, see, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Villafane-Jimenez, 410 F.3d 74, 85 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(per curiam); United States v. Bailey, 405 F.3d 102, 114 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); and, for the same reason, we do so here.\n\n            Alternatively,       in    an     attempt      to   show     \"a   reasonable\n\nprobability that the district court would impose a different\n\nsentence more favorable to the defendant under the new 'advisory\n\nGuidelines'       Booker    regime,\"    Antonakopoulos,            399    F.3d   at    75,\n\ndefendant points to the fact that he was sentenced at the bottom of\n\nthe applicable Guidelines range and to various allegedly mitigating\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\ffactors that were already proffered and rejected at his original\n\nsentencing.     That showing is insufficient to insufficient to\n\nsatisfy the third element of the plain error test.      See United\n\nStates v. Sánchez-Berríos, 2005 WL 2277629, at *9 (1st Cir. Sept.\n\n20, 2005); United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 505 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n            For the above reasons, the district court's judgment is\n\naffirmed.   See Local R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",
