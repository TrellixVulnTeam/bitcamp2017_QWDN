Plaintiffs, employees of Baxter\n\nHealthcare Corporation of Puerto Rico (\"Baxter-PR\"), appeal from\n\nthe   district    court's   decision      granting   summary     judgment   to\n\ndefendants   on   plaintiffs'     Title    VII   claim.     Ramos v.   Baxter\n\nHealthcare Corp. of Puerto Rico, Inc., 256 F. Supp. 2d 127, 150\n\n(D.P.R. 2003). That claim charged Baxter-PR, and its U.S. parent--\n\nBaxter, International, Inc. (\"Baxter\")--with discriminating based\n\non race and national origin in setting the terms of plaintiffs'\n\npension plan.     The background facts are undisputed.\n\n           Baxter is a major manufacturer of health care products.\n\nTogether with its numerous subsidiaries, it employs about 45,000\n\npeople worldwide. It maintains a pension plan, called the Domestic\n\nPlan, covering employees of Baxter and many but not all of its U.S.\n\nmainland subsidiaries.      The Domestic Plan permits early retirement\n\n(i.e., before a worker reaches 65), but does not provide full\n\nretirement benefits to employees who retire early; until 1990, the\n\nDomestic   Plan    mechanically    reduced       benefits   in   set   amounts\n\ndepending on how early an employee retired.\n\n           In 1990, Baxter revised the Domestic Plan to employ a\n\npoint system for early retirement that, in addition to age, took\n\naccount of how many years the worker had been at Baxter or a\n\ncovered subsidiary. The net effect was to make the reduction less,\n\nand benefits greater, for early retiring workers who had served\n\nlonger.    This in turn made early retirement more attractive for\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\flong-serving workers covered by the Domestic Plan.           Baxter says\n\nsome workers are better off with the change and others worse off.\n\n          About 6,000 Baxter employees work in Puerto Rico, mostly\n\nfor Baxter-PR. Employees of Baxter-PR are covered by the so-called\n\nPuerto Rico Plan, but this plan, like the Domestic Plan, is\n\ncontrolled     by   Baxter   through     its   so-called   Administrative\n\nCommittee, the members of which are appointed by the Compensation\n\nCommittee of Baxter's Board of Directors.         Although the plans had\n\ndiffered in the past, just prior to 1990 the retirement terms of\n\nthe Domestic and Puerto Rico plans were similar.1          However, when\n\nBaxter converted its Domestic Plan to the point system, it did not\n\nmake a comparable adjustment in the Puerto Rico Plan.\n\n             In 1995 Baxter began the closing of a major plant in\n\nCarolina, Puerto Rico.       A number of Baxter-PR employees, most of\n\nwhom worked at the plant, responded in 1998 by filing the present\n\nlaw suit in the federal district court in Puerto Rico.                The\n\ndefendants were their employer, Baxter itself, two other Baxter\n\nsubsidiaries doing business in Puerto Rico, and the members of the\n\nBaxter committee that managed both plans.         A principal claim, and\n\nthe only one pursued on appeal, is that the different treatment of\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Puerto Rico plan derives from the consolidation with\nBaxter's enterprises in 1985 of another major company having Puerto\nRico facilities; the benefits in Puerto Rico at the outset were\nwell below mainland standards but were raised after the initial\nconsolidation.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fearly retirees under the respective plans violates Title VII.           42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (2000).\n\n          On motion for summary judgment, the district court ruled\n\nin favor of the defendants.        Ramos, 256 F. Supp. 2d at 150.\n\nAlthough class certification had been sought, that issue was not\n\ndiscussed and neither side complains.     In a nutshell, the district\n\ncourt analyzed the evidence adduced on the Title VII claim and\n\nconcluded that there was no evidence of intentional discrimination\n\nsufficient to warrant a trial.     After a brief analysis, the court\n\nalso rejected a claim of disparate impact discrimination.              This\n\nappeal followed.2\n\n          Our review of the granting of a motion for summary\n\njudgment is de novo, drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nnon-moving party, here the plaintiffs.         Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &\n\nColman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 42 (1st Cir. 2002).         Title VII, so far\n\nas   pertinent,   says   an   employer   may    not   \"discriminate\"    in\n\ncompensation or terms of employment based, inter alia, on \"race\" or\n\n\"national origin.\"       § 2000e-2(a)(1).       Baxter assumes without\n\nargument that intentional discrimination in pension plan terms\n\nagainst Puerto Ricans would violate Title VII.\n\n\n     2\n      The plaintiffs also challenged Baxter's decision not to\nextend subsidized retiree medical and life insurance benefits, both\nof which are offered under the Domestic Plan, to the Puerto Rico\nPlan.    However, both parties seem to agree on appeal that\nresolution of the issues surrounding the point system necessarily\ndisposes of the same issues with regard to the medical and life\ninsurance benefits. See Ramos, 256 F. Supp. 2d at 133.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f          Baxter is less ready to concede that the Domestic Plan is\n\nmore favorable to employees than is the Puerto Rico Plan.                  It\n\nsuggests that some employees are better off under the latter than\n\nthe former.    But its documents also show that it would have cost\n\nBaxter-PR a substantial sum to switch over to the new point system.\n\nSo we will also assume arguendo (it does not alter the outcome)\n\nthat it would be \"discrimination\" under Title VII to withhold the\n\npoint system if the motive in whole or in part was hostility to\n\nPuerto Ricans. See Rodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 181\n\nF.3d 15, 18-20 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          This brings us to the evidence of motive.           Typically at\n\nthis stage     Title   VII   cases   undertake   a   relentless   survey   of\n\nMcDonell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and its main\n\nsequels,3 but we can be spared this exercise.                Assuming the\n\nplaintiffs     made    out   the     so-called   prima    facie    case    of\n\ndiscrimination, see id. at 802--a point which Baxter disputes on\n\nthe ground that not all of its mainland subsidiaries enjoy access\n\nto the point system--the defendants provided a facially plausible\n\nreason for not adopting the point system in Puerto Rico.                   The\n\nreasons were the added cost, the financial climate, and the view\n\nthat the benefits offered by Baxter-PR were already competitive in\n\nPuerto Rico.    See Feliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort &\n\n\n     3\n      E.g., Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248\n(1981); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502 (1993); Reeves\nv. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., 530 U.S. 133 (2000).\n\n                                     -5-\n\fCountry Club, 218 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000); Zapata-Matos, 277 F.3d\n\nat 45.\n\n            Whether the evidence in this case created a jury issue on\n\nimproper motive depends simply on analyzing the sworn testimony and\n\ndocuments    presented     on    summary       judgment   and    deciding     what\n\ncommonsense inferences they permit.            If the plaintiffs lack direct\n\nevidence    of   animus,    it    may    yet     be   possible   to   infer     it\n\ncircumstantially, depending on the facts; and if the defendants\n\ngave explanations that a jury could find to be false, this will\n\ncount against them in the mix of inferences.              Reeves v. Sanderson\n\nPlumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148-49 (2000); Thomas v.\n\nEastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 57 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied,\n\n528 U.S. 1161 (2000).\n\n                 Here no direct evidence exists of discriminatory\n\nintent–-for example, there are no statements by Baxter management\n\ndisparaging Puerto Ricans.        Instead, plaintiffs concentrate their\n\nattack on the alleged inadequacy of Baxter's reasons for its\n\ndifferential      treatment,     on     supposed      discrepancies    in     its\n\nexplanations, on its failure to produce documents, and on the\n\ninference that weak explanations are given to cover wicked motives.\n\nWe set forth the sequence of events within Baxter in more detail\n\nand then consider the plaintiffs' arguments.\n\n            In 1988 and 1989 a Baxter task force reporting to the\n\nBoard's Compensation Committee undertook a review of Baxter's\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fretirement program.       According to the affidavit of a consultant,\n\nGregory Hansen, who participated in the exercise, the decision to\n\nadopt the point system was made because the prior system created a\n\nstrong disincentive for long serving employees to retire early.\n\nThe politely unspoken inference is that Baxter wanted to encourage\n\nretirements      of   employees    whose      long   service      also    meant    high\n\nsalaries.\n\n            In    all    events,      plaintiffs       do   not     challenge       the\n\nexplanation but only the failure to extend the same courtesy to\n\nemployees of Baxter-PR.        According to Hansen, by the time of a June\n\n6, 1989, meeting of the task force, Baxter had decided to adopt the\n\npoint system for the Domestic Plan as of January 1, 1990.                          When\n\nHansen asked in the meeting whether the system would also be\n\nadopted in Puerto Rico, he was told that there might be a delay\n\nbecause of translation and related problems but that his firm\n\nshould develop an estimate of the increased costs if the Puerto\n\nRico Plan were to be similarly amended.\n\n            Other Baxter documents created at the same time suggest\n\nthat Baxter was inclined to delay any such change in Puerto Rico\n\nuntil, among other things, it could complete a survey of overall\n\nbenefits and compensation for its Puerto Rico operations.                            An\n\naffidavit from Mary Barker, a former Vice President of Benefits\n\nManagement at Baxter, says that Baxter's compensation at different\n\nlocations   around      the   world    differs       depending     upon    \"cost    and\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fcompetitive market conditions\" and that the benefits package in\n\nPuerto Rico   differs   in   various    respects   from   those   in   other\n\nlocations-–some favoring Puerto Rico and some not.\n\n          In all events, later documents and testimony covering the\n\n1990-1993 period show that Baxter created a new task force on\n\ncompensation early in 1993 to review benefits for Puerto Rico\n\nemployees, and it conducted a study during the year.              The study\n\nconcluded that Baxter's \"base salaries in Puerto Rico [were] 93% of\n\nthe comparator group\" and that overall Baxter's \"benefits [were]\n\ngenerally competitive.\"      In addition to the study, the task force\n\nalso priced various enhancements for the Puerto Rico Plan–-the\n\npoint system was estimated to cost $900,000 per year–-but there was\n\n\"no consensus\" among task force members on the question whether to\n\nadopt the point system.\n\n          In her deposition, Mary Barker said that various task\n\nforce proposals, including the possibility of switching to the\n\npoint system, were considered by senior Baxter management in\n\nOctober 1993.   She said that there were cost concerns about new\n\nbenefits in Puerto Rico and that at the time business conditions\n\nwere unfavorable: Baxter's stock price was not doing well and tax-\n\nlaw changes then under review were thought to have potentially\n\nadverse effects on Puerto Rico operations. Among the objectives of\n\nsenior management was to be sure that Puerto Rico costs remained\n\ncompetitive with Baxter's other worldwide operations.         Ultimately,\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthe decision was made not to adopt the point system for the Puerto\n\nRico Plan, although other benefits changes were adopted.\n\n           The following year Baxter created an advisory counsel\n\nmade up of representatives of its business units operating in\n\nPuerto Rico. This council eventually recommended that Baxter adopt\n\nfor Puerto Rico units the point system, or a new 401(k) type\n\ncontribution plan, or both; but Baxter decided not to do either,\n\npartly because of cost and partly because a separate 1995 study of\n\nits   competitors   in   Puerto   Rico   showed   that   Baxter's   pension\n\nbenefits were well above the median.        The same study showed that\n\nBaxter's overall compensation package in Puerto Rico was below the\n\nmedian but this was, importantly, because Baxter did not offer the\n\n401(k) type plan.    Baxter did adopt such a plan for Puerto Rico in\n\n1998.\n\n           Thus far there is nothing ominous in the story.           About\n\nthe most one could say–-if this were all--is that Baxter, although\n\nsometimes following a uniform approach, appears for the most part\n\nto have varied its compensation regimes based on location and that\n\nBaxter considered adopting the point system in Puerto Rico, but\n\nconcluded that it would be costly and was not needed to retain its\n\nemployees.    This shows that Baxter's management were profit-\n\noriented capitalists, but not that they intentionally discriminated\n\nagainst Puerto Ricans within the meaning of Title VII.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f            In attacking this scenario and the district court's grant\n\nof summary judgment, plaintiffs' very able brief presents four main\n\nthemes: that the failure to extend the point system to Puerto Rico\n\ncontradicted a settled Baxter policy of uniformity as to benefits;\n\nthat allegedly inconsistent statements were provided as to certain\n\nevents; that there are suspicious failures by Baxter to produce\n\ndocuments or remember events; and that the district court relied on\n\nfactual    propositions    that       were    fairly    controverted       and   drew\n\ninferences against plaintiffs.\n\n            Plaintiffs' broadest position, and the foundation for\n\nmost of their other arguments, is that Baxter had adopted prior to\n\n1990 a general policy of uniformity of treatment in compensation\n\nfor all employees of Baxter enterprises whether located on the\n\nmainland or in Puerto Rico.       From this it follows, according to the\n\nplaintiffs, that purported cost concerns about extending the point\n\nsystem to    Puerto     Rico   were    pretextual       and   that   a    reasonable\n\ninference from this deceit is an illicit motive.\n\n            Whatever the logic, the premise is wrong.                    It is based\n\nmainly on statements in a Corporate Human Resource Policy and\n\nProcedure Manual adopted in 1988 described as having \"corporate-\n\nwide application.\"        The manual says that \"[u]nless otherwise\n\napproved,\" each Baxter unit is to \"participate\" in employee benefit\n\nprograms    including    retirement      programs       designed     by    Corporate\n\nBenefits.     Plaintiffs       take    this    as   a   commitment        to   uniform\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fcompensation at all locations, making the discrepant treatment of\n\nPuerto Rico a suspicious deviation.\n\n              But the manual, apart from other routine disclaimers,\n\nsays   that     uniform     treatment       is   provided     \"unless    otherwise\n\napproved.\"       The evidence is clear that Baxter did in certain\n\nrespects vary benefits by location both before and after 1990; and\n\nthe history of the Puerto Rico operations vis à vis mainland\n\noperations is a tangled one.                The claim that uniformity was a\n\nstrict policy        from   which    this    case   was   a   unique,   suspicious\n\ndeviation is wrong on the facts and not one that a reasonable jury\n\ncould accept.\n\n              Plaintiffs' second argument is narrower and comes closest\n\nto   making    out   a   conventional       case    against   summary    judgment.\n\nFocusing primarily on the 1990 decision itself, plaintiffs point to\n\none statement, already mentioned, that the extension of the point\n\nsystem to Puerto Rico was being delayed for six months or a year\n\nbecause   of     translation        and   related    problems;    and,    charging\n\n\"pretext,\" plaintiffs contrast this with the indefinite delays that\n\nfollowed and the concern with cost that was given as the reason for\n\ninaction.\n\n              This is a fair argument–-a false reason coupled with\n\nother facts can suggest an illicit real reason, Zapata-Matos, 277\n\nF.3d at 45-–but context here greatly blunts its force.                   The focus\n\nof the 1988-89 task force was on the Domestic Plan, and Hansen in\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fa memorandum discussing the June 6, 1989, implementation meeting\n\nsays that he \"brought up the subject of the Puerto Rico plan and\n\nwhether comparable changes will be made.\" He then says that Baxter\n\nsaid it \"might want to at least delay 6 months and maybe a year\"\n\nbecause of translation and related issues.4\n\n          Then, the formal minutes of the June 28, 1989, task force\n\nmeeting record that Hansen again raised the issue and got the\n\nfollowing reply:\n\n          Judy Coffey-Hedquist explained that, from a\n          time perspective, it would not be possible to\n          implement and communicate changes to the\n          Puerto Rico Plan by January 1, 1990.\n\n          Herb Walker pointed out that it would also be\n          prudent to defer implementation so that the\n          results of several employee surveys on\n          compensation    and     benefits    currently\n          distributed to Puerto Rico employees become\n          available.\n\nA memorandum by Hansen the next day says: \"A survey is being\n\nconducted on compensation and benefits in Puerto Rico.       It was\n\ndecided not to extend the new early retirement or death benefit\n\nprovisions to the Puerto Rico plan currently.\"\n\n          In other words, from the outset, cost and competitiveness\n\nwere at issue.     No juror could reasonably draw from this supposed\n\n\n\n     4\n      There was also an oblique reference in this report to\nconcerns about discrimination, but comparable references in other\ndocuments indicate that this concern involved the risk that\nadoption of the points system in Puerto Rico could have the effect\nof impermissibly favoring highly compensated employees.     See 26\nU.S.C. § 401(a)(4) (2000); Ramos, 256 F. Supp. 2d at 138.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f\"discrepancy\" an inference that Baxter lied about its reasons for\n\nnot extending the point system to Puerto Rico and must have\n\nharbored    animus   toward   Puerto    Ricans.   Even   plaintiffs'\n\nfoundational premise–-Baxter's supposed policy of uniformity–-is\n\nundercut by the documents.\n\n            Next, the plaintiffs say that Baxter failed to produce\n\ndocuments to back up its story and that the failures undercut or\n\ncast doubt on the reasons given by Baxter for its actions.        In\n\nparticular, plaintiffs complain about the absence of the formal\n\nminutes of the June 6, 1989, meeting of the task force; any formal\n\nstudy underpinning the decision to adopt the points system for the\n\nDomestic Plan; any cost or competitive study leading to the refusal\n\nto do so for Puerto Rico; and the results of any Puerto Rico\n\nsurveys on compensation and benefits.\n\n            Starting with the most specific complaint–-the absence of\n\nJune 6, 1989, task force minutes--there is simply no indication\n\nthat such minutes ever existed, or if they did, were deliberately\n\nwithheld.   The task force appears to have been a working group, not\n\na formal administrative unit like the Administrative Committee that\n\nran the pension plans (all of whose minutes were produced). Baxter\n\ndid produce an agenda for the June 6, 1989, task force meeting and\n\nHansen's summary, and, although Baxter did produce minutes for at\n\nleast one other task force meeting, nothing suggests that any\n\nfurther documentary record of the June 6, 1989, meeting exists.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f            The lack of any formal study of adopting the point system\n\nas part of the Domestic Plan may or may not be surprising, but,\n\nagain, there is no indication that Baxter deliberately withheld any\n\ndocuments in its possession from the plaintiffs.      The point system\n\nwas one of a number of issues considered by the task force; and\n\nanyone familiar with corporate decision-making culture would not be\n\nsurprised that the remnants would be nothing more than agendas,\n\nscattered references in summaries and minutes, and a few memories\n\nsecured by depositions.\n\n            Plaintiffs also point out that a stated reason for\n\ndeferring the point system for Puerto Rico was to await alleged\n\nsurveys of compensation and benefits being conducted in Puerto\n\nRico.    Yet the March 8, 1991, minutes of the Administrative\n\nCommittee suggest that surveys and other studies were underway, and\n\nthere is no dispute that by 1993 Baxter had surveyed employees in\n\nPuerto Rico and also obtained a study of benefits from comparable\n\ncompanies   in   Puerto   Rico–-information   made   available   to   the\n\nplaintiffs.5\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      To bolster their argument, plaintiffs produced the affidavits\nof three long-term Baxter-PR employees, all plaintiffs in this\ncase, who say that they were unaware of any employment surveys\nconducted between 1989 and 1993. However, as the district court\npointed out, \"the fact that plaintiffs in this particular action\ndid not personally know of any such surveys nor [were] advised of\nthe results is not indicative that none were carried out.\" Ramos,\n256 F. Supp. 2d at 140.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f            The   last   \"missing\"    item   is   any   document   formally\n\nexplaining the decision not to extend the point system to Puerto\n\nRico.   But, as with many cases of inaction, there is no reason to\n\nthink that any such formal document existed.            What the documents\n\ntaken together show is an initial decision to defer the issue for\n\nstudy, a later determination that the cost of extension would be\n\nconsiderable, and at least two benefits studies indicating that\n\nBaxter-PR's retirement benefits matched those of other companies in\n\nPuerto Rico.\n\n            This brings us to plaintiffs' final claim, a general-–but\n\nthen elaborately documented-–claim that the district court relied\n\non facts not proved, ignored evidence favorable to plaintiffs, and\n\ndrew inferences in favor of defendants.            An introductory table\n\nprovides one to two dozen examples (depending on how one counts)\n\ntogether with record cites and then refines or restates a number of\n\nthem in text.      This is certainly a helpful way to present the\n\nmaterial.\n\n            The difficulty is that on close examination the examples\n\ngiven tend to dissolve.        The first, and most important, group\n\nreflect plaintiffs' main premise that from the outset Baxter\n\nintended a single retirement regime embracing the mainland and\n\nPuerto Rico, deviating at the last minute for pretextual reasons.\n\nBut we have already explained why the plaintiffs' premise is\n\nfaulty, resting as it does on a misreading of the manual and an\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\foversimplification   of   Baxter's   history   and   practice   as    to\n\nuniformity.   Several other criticisms rest on the absence of\n\ndocuments (e.g., surveys) and the alleged contradictions in reasons\n\ngiven by Baxter in June 1989–-both points already discussed.         And\n\nsome of the examples are just argument: e.g., that Christmas\n\nbonuses were admittedly paid in Puerto Rico and not in the United\n\nStates but were required in Puerto Rico by statute.\n\n          In the end plaintiffs' collection of examples fails\n\nbecause whatever the quibbles, there is simply no evidence that\n\nBaxter management acted out of animus to Puerto Ricans. Plaintiffs\n\nsay in their table that this ignores evidence that a Baxter-PR\n\nofficial was concerned about the fairness of the decision and that\n\nMary Barker was concerned about employee reaction.        But neither\n\ncomment provides a basis for an inference that Baxter management\n\nitself was concerned about anything beyond saving money.6\n\n          Even with reasonable inferences drawn in plaintiffs'\n\nfavor, the district court correctly held that there was no evidence\n\n\n\n     6\n      Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in\nrefusing to consider the affidavit of one Gilda Nevin, a retired\nBaxter employee who transferred from Puerto Rico to Illinois in the\nearly 1980s.    Nevin said that her new colleagues in Illinois\ntreated her poorly because she was Puerto Rican and that Baxter\nunfairly refused to credit her years of service in Puerto Rico\ntoward her pension benefits. Nevin stopped working for Baxter in\n1987, before implementation of the points system was even\ncontemplated, and the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin ruling that her affidavit had little bearing on the issues in\nthis case. See Bradley v. Work, 154 F.3d 704, 708-09 (7th Cir.\n1998).\n\n                                -16-\n\fof animus--and that means that the discriminatory treatment claim\n\nfails.   What is left is that part of the evidence that shows that\n\nemployees of Baxter-PR–-most and perhaps almost all of whom are\n\nPuerto Rican-–were      treated    differently      than   Baxter's   mainland\n\nemployees, who we will assume are mostly not Puerto Rican.                  This\n\nbrings us to plaintiffs' alternative disparate impact theory of\n\nviolation.\n\n             Plaintiffs claim that regardless of intent or lack of\n\nracial   discrimination,      Baxter's     dual    plan    approach   has    the\n\nimpermissible effect of disfavoring Puerto Ricans.             See Int'l Bhd.\n\nof Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977)\n\n(disparate impact prohibits \"employment practices that are facially\n\nneutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact\n\nfall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified\n\nby business necessity\"); see generally Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,\n\n401 U.S. 424 (1971).\n\n           It is true that disparate impact liability can be imposed\n\nregardless     of   whether   an   employer       possesses   an   intent    to\n\ndiscriminate, Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 987\n\n(1988), but Title VII also says:\n\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of this\n          subchapter, it shall not be an unlawful\n          employment practice for an employer to apply\n          different   standards  of   compensation,   or\n          different terms, conditions, or privileges of\n          employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority\n          system . . . or to employees who work in\n          different   locations,  provided   that   such\n\n                                    -17-\n\f              differences are not the result of an intention\n              to discriminate because of race, color,\n              religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(h) (2000) (emphasis added).              In other words,\n\ndifferent treatment in different locations is permissible absent an\n\nintent to discriminate.\n\n              What legislative history there is tends to confirm this\n\nview,   see    110    Cong.   Rec.   12,723   (1964)   (statement    of   Sen.\n\nHumphrey); and the few appellate cases interpreting the \"different\n\nlocations\" language of § 2000e-2(h) also appear to support this\n\nreading. See Russell v. Am. Tobacco Co., 528 F.2d 357, 362-63 (4th\n\nCir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 935 (1976) (\"If . . . Leaf and\n\nBranch are different locations, and if the differences in treatment\n\nof workers at the different locations are not due to an intention\n\nto discriminate, the company's refusal to allow Leaf employees to\n\ntransfer on the basis of company-wide seniority would not violate\n\nthe Act.\").\n\n              In addition, there are numerous cases, including Supreme\n\nCourt decisions, construing the companion \"bona fide seniority\n\nsystem\" language of § 2000e-2(h)--those cases hold that an employer\n\nwho   provides    different     levels   of   compensation    for   employees\n\npursuant to a bona fide seniority system cannot be held liable\n\nunder a disparate impact theory--plaintiffs must prove an intent to\n\ndiscriminate.        E.g., Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 289\n\n(1982); Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 82\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f(1977); Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 348-56.                   The two\n\nprovisions of subsection 2(h) can fairly be read together.\n\n          The subsection itself is not surprising.              Location is\n\noften a   proxy   for   differences   in   cost   and   other   competitive\n\ncircumstances;    and    while   Congress    could      have    made     those\n\ncircumstances a separate defense, the difficulties of showing that\n\na difference in pay precisely correlated with a difference in cost\n\nwould be formidable.     Cf. Texaco Inc. v. Hasbrouck, 496 U.S. 543,\n\n561 n.18 (1990) (discussing the difficulties of establishing the\n\ncost justification defense under the Robinson-Patman Act).                  In\n\neffect, different locations are simply a safe harbor where there is\n\nno intentional discrimination.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

Ramos v.   Baxter\n\nHealthcare Corp. of Puerto Rico, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2390544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2390544/ramos-v-baxter-healthcare-corp-of-puerto-rico-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150\n\n(D.P.R. 2003). That claim charged Baxter-PR, and its U.S. parent--\n\nBaxter, International, Inc. (\"Baxter\")--with discriminating based\n\non race and national origin in setting the terms of plaintiffs'\n\npension plan.     The background facts are undisputed.\n\n           Baxter is a major manufacturer of health care products.\n\nTogether with its numerous subsidiaries, it employs about 45,000\n\npeople worldwide. It maintains a pension plan, called the Domestic\n\nPlan, covering employees of Baxter and many but not all of its U.S.\n\nmainland subsidiaries.      The Domestic Plan permits early retirement\n\n(i.e., before a worker reaches 65), but does not provide full\n\nretirement benefits to employees who retire early; until 1990, the\n\nDomestic   Plan    mechanically    reduced       benefits   in   set   amounts\n\ndepending on how early an employee retired.\n\n           In 1990, Baxter revised the Domestic Plan to employ a\n\npoint system for early retirement that, in addition to age, took\n\naccount of how many years the worker had been at Baxter or a\n\ncovered subsidiary. The net effect was to make the reduction less,\n\nand benefits greater, for early retiring workers who had served\n\nlonger.    This in turn made early retirement more attractive for\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\flong-serving workers covered by the Domestic Plan.           Baxter says\n\nsome workers are better off with the change and others worse off.\n\n          About 6,000 Baxter employees work in Puerto Rico, mostly\n\nfor Baxter-PR. Employees of Baxter-PR are covered by the so-called\n\nPuerto Rico Plan, but this plan, like the Domestic Plan, is\n\ncontrolled     by   Baxter   through     its   so-called   Administrative\n\nCommittee, the members of which are appointed by the Compensation\n\nCommittee of Baxter's Board of Directors.         Although the plans had\n\ndiffered in the past, just prior to 1990 the retirement terms of\n\nthe Domestic and Puerto Rico plans were similar.1          However, when\n\nBaxter converted its Domestic Plan to the point system, it did not\n\nmake a comparable adjustment in the Puerto Rico Plan.\n\n             In 1995 Baxter began the closing of a major plant in\n\nCarolina, Puerto Rico.       A number of Baxter-PR employees, most of\n\nwhom worked at the plant, responded in 1998 by filing the present\n\nlaw suit in the federal district court in Puerto Rico.                The\n\ndefendants were their employer, Baxter itself, two other Baxter\n\nsubsidiaries doing business in Puerto Rico, and the members of the\n\nBaxter committee that managed both plans.         A principal claim, and\n\nthe only one pursued on appeal, is that the different treatment of\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Puerto Rico plan derives from the consolidation with\nBaxter's enterprises in 1985 of another major company having Puerto\nRico facilities; the benefits in Puerto Rico at the outset were\nwell below mainland standards but were raised after the initial\nconsolidation.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fearly retirees under the respective plans violates Title VII.           42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (2000).\n\n          On motion for summary judgment, the district court ruled\n\nin favor of the defendants.        Ramos, 256 F. Supp. 2d at 150.\n\nAlthough class certification had been sought, that issue was not\n\ndiscussed and neither side complains.     In a nutshell, the district\n\ncourt analyzed the evidence adduced on the Title VII claim and\n\nconcluded that there was no evidence of intentional discrimination\n\nsufficient to warrant a trial.     After a brief analysis, the court\n\nalso rejected a claim of disparate impact discrimination.              This\n\nappeal followed.2\n\n          Our review of the granting of a motion for summary\n\njudgment is de novo, drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nnon-moving party, here the plaintiffs.

Reckitt &\n\nColman, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776184\"><a href=\"/opinion/776184/ram-n-zapata-matos-v-reckitt-colman-inc-fka-lf-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 (1st Cir. 2002).         Title VII, so far\n\nas   pertinent,   says   an   employer   may    not   \"discriminate\"    in\n\ncompensation or terms of employment based, inter alia, on \"race\" or\n\n\"national origin.\"       § 2000e-2(a)(1).       Baxter assumes without\n\nargument that intentional discrimination in pension plan terms\n\nagainst Puerto Ricans would violate Title VII.\n\n\n     2\n      The plaintiffs also challenged Baxter's decision not to\nextend subsidized retiree medical and life insurance benefits, both\nof which are offered under the Domestic Plan, to the Puerto Rico\nPlan.    However, both parties seem to agree on appeal that\nresolution of the issues surrounding the point system necessarily\ndisposes of the same issues with regard to the medical and life\ninsurance benefits. See Ramos, 256 F. Supp. 2d at 133.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f          Baxter is less ready to concede that the Domestic Plan is\n\nmore favorable to employees than is the Puerto Rico Plan.                  It\n\nsuggests that some employees are better off under the latter than\n\nthe former.    But its documents also show that it would have cost\n\nBaxter-PR a substantial sum to switch over to the new point system.\n\nSo we will also assume arguendo (it does not alter the outcome)\n\nthat it would be \"discrimination\" under Title VII to withhold the\n\npoint system if the motive in whole or in part was hostility to\n\nPuerto Ricans.

According to the affidavit of a consultant,\n\nGregory Hansen, who participated in the exercise, the decision to\n\nadopt the point system was made because the prior system created a\n\nstrong disincentive for long serving employees to retire early.\n\nThe politely unspoken inference is that Baxter wanted to encourage\n\nretirements      of   employees    whose      long   service      also    meant    high\n\nsalaries.\n\n            In    all    events,      plaintiffs       do   not     challenge       the\n\nexplanation but only the failure to extend the same courtesy to\n\nemployees of Baxter-PR.        According to Hansen, by the time of a June\n\n6, 1989, meeting of the task force, Baxter had decided to adopt the\n\npoint system for the Domestic Plan as of January 1, 1990.                          When\n\nHansen asked in the meeting whether the system would also be\n\nadopted in Puerto Rico, he was told that there might be a delay\n\nbecause of translation and related problems but that his firm\n\nshould develop an estimate of the increased costs if the Puerto\n\nRico Plan were to be similarly amended.\n\n            Other Baxter documents created at the same time suggest\n\nthat Baxter was inclined to delay any such change in Puerto Rico\n\nuntil, among other things, it could complete a survey of overall\n\nbenefits and compensation for its Puerto Rico operations.                            An\n\naffidavit from Mary Barker, a former Vice President of Benefits\n\nManagement at Baxter, says that Baxter's compensation at different\n\nlocations   around      the   world    differs       depending     upon    \"cost    and\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fcompetitive market conditions\" and that the benefits package in\n\nPuerto Rico   differs   in   various    respects   from   those   in   other\n\nlocations-–some favoring Puerto Rico and some not.\n\n          In all events, later documents and testimony covering the\n\n1990-1993 period show that Baxter created a new task force on\n\ncompensation early in 1993 to review benefits for Puerto Rico\n\nemployees, and it conducted a study during the year.              The study\n\nconcluded that Baxter's \"base salaries in Puerto Rico [were] 93% of\n\nthe comparator group\" and that overall Baxter's \"benefits [were]\n\ngenerally competitive.\"      In addition to the study, the task force\n\nalso priced various enhancements for the Puerto Rico Plan–-the\n\npoint system was estimated to cost $900,000 per year–-but there was\n\n\"no consensus\" among task force members on the question whether to\n\nadopt the point system.\n\n          In her deposition, Mary Barker said that various task\n\nforce proposals, including the possibility of switching to the\n\npoint system, were considered by senior Baxter management in\n\nOctober 1993.   She said that there were cost concerns about new\n\nbenefits in Puerto Rico and that at the time business conditions\n\nwere unfavorable: Baxter's stock price was not doing well and tax-\n\nlaw changes then under review were thought to have potentially\n\nadverse effects on Puerto Rico operations. Among the objectives of\n\nsenior management was to be sure that Puerto Rico costs remained\n\ncompetitive with Baxter's other worldwide operations.         Ultimately,\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthe decision was made not to adopt the point system for the Puerto\n\nRico Plan, although other benefits changes were adopted.\n\n           The following year Baxter created an advisory counsel\n\nmade up of representatives of its business units operating in\n\nPuerto Rico. This council eventually recommended that Baxter adopt\n\nfor Puerto Rico units the point system, or a new 401(k) type\n\ncontribution plan, or both; but Baxter decided not to do either,\n\npartly because of cost and partly because a separate 1995 study of\n\nits   competitors   in   Puerto   Rico   showed   that   Baxter's   pension\n\nbenefits were well above the median.        The same study showed that\n\nBaxter's overall compensation package in Puerto Rico was below the\n\nmedian but this was, importantly, because Baxter did not offer the\n\n401(k) type plan.    Baxter did adopt such a plan for Puerto Rico in\n\n1998.\n\n           Thus far there is nothing ominous in the story.           About\n\nthe most one could say–-if this were all--is that Baxter, although\n\nsometimes following a uniform approach, appears for the most part\n\nto have varied its compensation regimes based on location and that\n\nBaxter considered adopting the point system in Puerto Rico, but\n\nconcluded that it would be costly and was not needed to retain its\n\nemployees.    This shows that Baxter's management were profit-\n\noriented capitalists, but not that they intentionally discriminated\n\nagainst Puerto Ricans within the meaning of Title VII.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f            In attacking this scenario and the district court's grant\n\nof summary judgment, plaintiffs' very able brief presents four main\n\nthemes: that the failure to extend the point system to Puerto Rico\n\ncontradicted a settled Baxter policy of uniformity as to benefits;\n\nthat allegedly inconsistent statements were provided as to certain\n\nevents; that there are suspicious failures by Baxter to produce\n\ndocuments or remember events; and that the district court relied on\n\nfactual    propositions    that       were    fairly    controverted       and   drew\n\ninferences against plaintiffs.\n\n            Plaintiffs' broadest position, and the foundation for\n\nmost of their other arguments, is that Baxter had adopted prior to\n\n1990 a general policy of uniformity of treatment in compensation\n\nfor all employees of Baxter enterprises whether located on the\n\nmainland or in Puerto Rico.       From this it follows, according to the\n\nplaintiffs, that purported cost concerns about extending the point\n\nsystem to    Puerto     Rico   were    pretextual       and   that   a    reasonable\n\ninference from this deceit is an illicit motive.\n\n            Whatever the logic, the premise is wrong.                    It is based\n\nmainly on statements in a Corporate Human Resource Policy and\n\nProcedure Manual adopted in 1988 described as having \"corporate-\n\nwide application.\"        The manual says that \"[u]nless otherwise\n\napproved,\" each Baxter unit is to \"participate\" in employee benefit\n\nprograms    including    retirement      programs       designed     by    Corporate\n\nBenefits.     Plaintiffs       take    this    as   a   commitment        to   uniform\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fcompensation at all locations, making the discrepant treatment of\n\nPuerto Rico a suspicious deviation.\n\n              But the manual, apart from other routine disclaimers,\n\nsays   that     uniform     treatment       is   provided     \"unless    otherwise\n\napproved.\"       The evidence is clear that Baxter did in certain\n\nrespects vary benefits by location both before and after 1990; and\n\nthe history of the Puerto Rico operations vis à vis mainland\n\noperations is a tangled one.                The claim that uniformity was a\n\nstrict policy        from   which    this    case   was   a   unique,   suspicious\n\ndeviation is wrong on the facts and not one that a reasonable jury\n\ncould accept.\n\n              Plaintiffs' second argument is narrower and comes closest\n\nto   making    out   a   conventional       case    against   summary    judgment.\n\nFocusing primarily on the 1990 decision itself, plaintiffs point to\n\none statement, already mentioned, that the extension of the point\n\nsystem to Puerto Rico was being delayed for six months or a year\n\nbecause   of     translation        and   related    problems;    and,    charging\n\n\"pretext,\" plaintiffs contrast this with the indefinite delays that\n\nfollowed and the concern with cost that was given as the reason for\n\ninaction.\n\n              This is a fair argument–-a false reason coupled with\n\nother facts can suggest an illicit real reason, Zapata-Matos, 277\n\nF.3d at 45-–but context here greatly blunts its force.                   The focus\n\nof the 1988-89 task force was on the Domestic Plan, and Hansen in\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fa memorandum discussing the June 6, 1989, implementation meeting\n\nsays that he \"brought up the subject of the Puerto Rico plan and\n\nwhether comparable changes will be made.\" He then says that Baxter\n\nsaid it \"might want to at least delay 6 months and maybe a year\"\n\nbecause of translation and related issues.4\n\n          Then, the formal minutes of the June 28, 1989, task force\n\nmeeting record that Hansen again raised the issue and got the\n\nfollowing reply:\n\n          Judy Coffey-Hedquist explained that, from a\n          time perspective, it would not be possible to\n          implement and communicate changes to the\n          Puerto Rico Plan by January 1, 1990.\n\n          Herb Walker pointed out that it would also be\n          prudent to defer implementation so that the\n          results of several employee surveys on\n          compensation    and     benefits    currently\n          distributed to Puerto Rico employees become\n          available.\n\nA memorandum by Hansen the next day says: \"A survey is being\n\nconducted on compensation and benefits in Puerto Rico.       It was\n\ndecided not to extend the new early retirement or death benefit\n\nprovisions to the Puerto Rico plan currently.\"\n\n          In other words, from the outset, cost and competitiveness\n\nwere at issue.     No juror could reasonably draw from this supposed\n\n\n\n     4\n      There was also an oblique reference in this report to\nconcerns about discrimination, but comparable references in other\ndocuments indicate that this concern involved the risk that\nadoption of the points system in Puerto Rico could have the effect\nof impermissibly favoring highly compensated employees.     See 26\nU.S.C. § 401(a)(4) (2000); Ramos, 256 F. Supp. 2d at 138.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f\"discrepancy\" an inference that Baxter lied about its reasons for\n\nnot extending the point system to Puerto Rico and must have\n\nharbored    animus   toward   Puerto    Ricans.   Even   plaintiffs'\n\nfoundational premise–-Baxter's supposed policy of uniformity–-is\n\nundercut by the documents.\n\n            Next, the plaintiffs say that Baxter failed to produce\n\ndocuments to back up its story and that the failures undercut or\n\ncast doubt on the reasons given by Baxter for its actions.        In\n\nparticular, plaintiffs complain about the absence of the formal\n\nminutes of the June 6, 1989, meeting of the task force; any formal\n\nstudy underpinning the decision to adopt the points system for the\n\nDomestic Plan; any cost or competitive study leading to the refusal\n\nto do so for Puerto Rico; and the results of any Puerto Rico\n\nsurveys on compensation and benefits.\n\n            Starting with the most specific complaint–-the absence of\n\nJune 6, 1989, task force minutes--there is simply no indication\n\nthat such minutes ever existed, or if they did, were deliberately\n\nwithheld.   The task force appears to have been a working group, not\n\na formal administrative unit like the Administrative Committee that\n\nran the pension plans (all of whose minutes were produced). Baxter\n\ndid produce an agenda for the June 6, 1989, task force meeting and\n\nHansen's summary, and, although Baxter did produce minutes for at\n\nleast one other task force meeting, nothing suggests that any\n\nfurther documentary record of the June 6, 1989, meeting exists.\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f            The lack of any formal study of adopting the point system\n\nas part of the Domestic Plan may or may not be surprising, but,\n\nagain, there is no indication that Baxter deliberately withheld any\n\ndocuments in its possession from the plaintiffs.      The point system\n\nwas one of a number of issues considered by the task force; and\n\nanyone familiar with corporate decision-making culture would not be\n\nsurprised that the remnants would be nothing more than agendas,\n\nscattered references in summaries and minutes, and a few memories\n\nsecured by depositions.\n\n            Plaintiffs also point out that a stated reason for\n\ndeferring the point system for Puerto Rico was to await alleged\n\nsurveys of compensation and benefits being conducted in Puerto\n\nRico.    Yet the March 8, 1991, minutes of the Administrative\n\nCommittee suggest that surveys and other studies were underway, and\n\nthere is no dispute that by 1993 Baxter had surveyed employees in\n\nPuerto Rico and also obtained a study of benefits from comparable\n\ncompanies   in   Puerto   Rico–-information   made   available   to   the\n\nplaintiffs.5\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      To bolster their argument, plaintiffs produced the affidavits\nof three long-term Baxter-PR employees, all plaintiffs in this\ncase, who say that they were unaware of any employment surveys\nconducted between 1989 and 1993. However, as the district court\npointed out, \"the fact that plaintiffs in this particular action\ndid not personally know of any such surveys nor [were] advised of\nthe results is not indicative that none were carried out.\" Ramos,\n256 F. Supp. 2d at 140.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f            The   last   \"missing\"    item   is   any   document   formally\n\nexplaining the decision not to extend the point system to Puerto\n\nRico.   But, as with many cases of inaction, there is no reason to\n\nthink that any such formal document existed.            What the documents\n\ntaken together show is an initial decision to defer the issue for\n\nstudy, a later determination that the cost of extension would be\n\nconsiderable, and at least two benefits studies indicating that\n\nBaxter-PR's retirement benefits matched those of other companies in\n\nPuerto Rico.\n\n            This brings us to plaintiffs' final claim, a general-–but\n\nthen elaborately documented-–claim that the district court relied\n\non facts not proved, ignored evidence favorable to plaintiffs, and\n\ndrew inferences in favor of defendants.            An introductory table\n\nprovides one to two dozen examples (depending on how one counts)\n\ntogether with record cites and then refines or restates a number of\n\nthem in text.      This is certainly a helpful way to present the\n\nmaterial.\n\n            The difficulty is that on close examination the examples\n\ngiven tend to dissolve.        The first, and most important, group\n\nreflect plaintiffs' main premise that from the outset Baxter\n\nintended a single retirement regime embracing the mainland and\n\nPuerto Rico, deviating at the last minute for pretextual reasons.\n\nBut we have already explained why the plaintiffs' premise is\n\nfaulty, resting as it does on a misreading of the manual and an\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\foversimplification   of   Baxter's   history   and   practice   as    to\n\nuniformity.   Several other criticisms rest on the absence of\n\ndocuments (e.g., surveys) and the alleged contradictions in reasons\n\ngiven by Baxter in June 1989–-both points already discussed.         And\n\nsome of the examples are just argument: e.g., that Christmas\n\nbonuses were admittedly paid in Puerto Rico and not in the United\n\nStates but were required in Puerto Rico by statute.\n\n          In the end plaintiffs' collection of examples fails\n\nbecause whatever the quibbles, there is simply no evidence that\n\nBaxter management acted out of animus to Puerto Ricans. Plaintiffs\n\nsay in their table that this ignores evidence that a Baxter-PR\n\nofficial was concerned about the fairness of the decision and that\n\nMary Barker was concerned about employee reaction.        But neither\n\ncomment provides a basis for an inference that Baxter management\n\nitself was concerned about anything beyond saving money.6\n\n          Even with reasonable inferences drawn in plaintiffs'\n\nfavor, the district court correctly held that there was no evidence\n\n\n\n     6\n      Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in\nrefusing to consider the affidavit of one Gilda Nevin, a retired\nBaxter employee who transferred from Puerto Rico to Illinois in the\nearly 1980s.    Nevin said that her new colleagues in Illinois\ntreated her poorly because she was Puerto Rican and that Baxter\nunfairly refused to credit her years of service in Puerto Rico\ntoward her pension benefits. Nevin stopped working for Baxter in\n1987, before implementation of the points system was even\ncontemplated, and the district court did not abuse its discretion\nin ruling that her affidavit had little bearing on the issues in\nthis case.

What is left is that part of the evidence that shows that\n\nemployees of Baxter-PR–-most and perhaps almost all of whom are\n\nPuerto Rican-–were      treated    differently      than   Baxter's   mainland\n\nemployees, who we will assume are mostly not Puerto Rican.                  This\n\nbrings us to plaintiffs' alternative disparate impact theory of\n\nviolation.\n\n             Plaintiffs claim that regardless of intent or lack of\n\nracial   discrimination,      Baxter's     dual    plan    approach   has    the\n\nimpermissible effect of disfavoring Puerto Ricans.
