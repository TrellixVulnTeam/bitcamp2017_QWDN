We treat this interlocutory appeal\n\nfrom an order certifying a class in a securities fraud case as a\n\ncompanion case to In re PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig., No. 05-1220,\n\nslip op. (1st Cir. Dec. _, 2005), also decided this day.                  Our\n\ndetermination in PolyMedica of the standard of efficiency to be\n\nused in the application of the fraud-on-the-market theory informs\n\nthe analysis in this case. Defendants-Appellants Xcelera Inc.1, an\n\nInternet holding company, and its directors, Alexander and Gustav\n\nVik (collectively, \"Defendants\"), argue that the district court\n\nerred   in   determining   that   the    market   for   Xcelera   stock   was\n\nefficient during the relevant time period, and certifying the class\n\non that basis.     For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n             Alex Stuebler, Jim Hicks, Jack Ladue, Glover Powell, and\n\nDoug Horan (\"Plaintiffs\") are purchasers of Xcelera stock, who seek\n\nto represent a class of all purchasers of Xcelera stock from April\n\n1, 1999, through August 8, 2000 (the \"Class Period\").2            According\n\n\n1\n  While Plaintiffs (and the case caption) refer to the company\ninvolved in this case as \"Xcelera.com, Inc.,\" we refer to the\ncompany by the name used by Defendants, \"Xcelera Inc.\"\n2\n Plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of all purchasers of\nXcelera stock who purchased stock on the same day or within three\ntrading days after each of Alexander and Gustav Vik's allegedly\ninsider sales, which are said to have taken place on and between\nFebruary 22, 2000, and June 22, 2000.        Certification of the\nsubclass necessarily hinges upon certification of the class. Since\nwe affirm the district court's order certifying the class, and\nsince Defendants do not object to that portion of the district\ncourt's order certifying the subclass, we do not address the\n\n                                   -2-\n\fto Plaintiffs, Defendants issued a press release on April 1, 1999,\n\nstating that Xcelera had acquired a majority interest in Mirror\n\nImage Internet, Inc. (\"Mirror Image\"), an Internet holding company.\n\nMore press releases and television appearances followed throughout\n\nthe Class Period, touting Xcelera's ownership of Mirror Image.\n\nDefendants   allegedly   did   not   disclose,   however,   that   this\n\nacquisition was part of a joint venture with two other companies,\n\nKahnberget Holding, Ltd., and JAM Investments, Ltd. (collectively,\n\n\"JAM\"), both of which had contributed a substantial portion of the\n\nfunds used to acquire the majority interest, $3.24 million, and\n\nwhich were therefore entitled to a significant portion of the\n\nMirror Image stock pursuant to their joint-venture agreement.\n\nDefendants also allegedly did not disclose the risk of dilution3 to\n\nXcelera shareholders should Defendants decide to issue Xcelera\n\nstock in satisfaction of its obligation to JAM.\n\n          Plaintiffs contend that it was not until August 4, 2000\n\n– when Xcelera issued its Annual Report for that year – that\n\nXcelera shareholders first learned that Xcelera might be required\n\nto issue new shares of its stock to \"certain third parties\" in\n\norder to pay for its investment in Mirror Image, and that this may,\n\nin turn, result in a material dilution of Xcelera stock.     That same\n\n\ndistrict court's decision to certify the subclass.\n3\n \"Dilution\" means \"[t]he reduction in the monetary value or voting\npower of stock by increasing the total number of outstanding\nshares.\" Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fday, the price of Xcelera's stock fell by 2.5%, from $12.31 to $12\n\nper share.   Several days later, after a brief rise in stock price\n\non August 7, the price of Xcelera stock fell again, this time by\n\napproximately 16%, from $14 on August 8, 2000, to $11.75 on August\n\n9, 2000.\n\n           On April 2, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended\n\ncomplaint, alleging that Defendants artificially inflated the price\n\nof Xcelera stock during the Class Period by failing to disclose the\n\nownership dispute surrounding the Mirror Image stock and the risk\n\nof dilution of Xcelera stock.      The complaint further alleged that\n\nAlexander and Gustav Vik made insider sales of over 3.2 million\n\nshares of Xcelera stock to the unknowing public during the Class\n\nPeriod, reaping proceeds of over $250 million.             Plaintiffs seek\n\ndamages against Defendants under § 10(b) of the Securities and\n\nExchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) (the \"Exchange Act\") and\n\nRule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5, and\n\nagainst Alexander and Gustav Vik under § 20(a) and § 20A of the\n\nExchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a), § 78t-1.\n\n           On November 12, 2002, Plaintiffs filed a motion for\n\ncertification   of   the   class   and    the   insider   trading   subclass\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fpursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)4 and (b)(3).5             In order to satisfy\n\nRule 23(b)(3)'s requirement that common questions of law and fact\n\npredominate over individual questions, Plaintiffs relied upon the\n\n\"fraud-on-the-market\" presumption of reliance.               Defendants opposed\n\nthe   motion,    arguing    that    Plaintiffs       were   not   entitled     to    a\n\npresumption of reliance because the market was not \"efficient\" – a\n\nprerequisite for presuming reliance.            In support of this position,\n\nDefendants submitted the affidavit of Dr. Matthew P. Richardson, a\n\nprofessor   of    finance    at    New   York   University        and   a   Research\n\nAssociate   of    the   National     Bureau     of   Economic     Research.         He\n\nconcluded that the market for Xcelera stock was not efficient\n\nduring the Class Period.           Plaintiffs responded by submitting the\n\naffidavit of Dr. Scott A. Hakala, director of CBIZ Valuation Group,\n\nInc., a national business and valuation firm, who came to the\n\nopposite conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Defendants do not dispute that the requirements of Rule 23(a) –\nnumerosity, typicality, commonality, and adequacy – have been met;\nthus, we do not address them.\n5\n  Rule 23(b)(3) provides, in relevant part, that \"[a]n action may\nbe maintained as a class action if the court finds that the\nquestions of law or fact common to the members of the class\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\"\nAs we noted in PolyMedica, \"[t]his requirement, although\nreminiscent of the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a), is far\nmore demanding because it tests whether proposed classes are\nsufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\"\nNo. 05-1220, slip op. (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).\n\n                                         -5-\n\f             At Defendants' request, the district court conducted a\n\ntwo-day evidentiary hearing on November 20 and 21, 2003.                  Both\n\nparties presented oral argument, and each expert gave testimony\n\nconcerning the meaning of market efficiency and whether the market\n\nfor Xcelera stock was efficient. Defendants argued that the market\n\nfor a particular stock is efficient if it rapidly and accurately\n\nreflects all material, publicly available information, and that\n\nXcelera's market did not meet these standards.            Plaintiffs, on the\n\nother hand, argued that while efficiency requires that market price\n\nreflect all material, publicly available information \"relatively\n\nrapidly or within a reasonable period of time,\" the market price\n\nneed   not   reflect   such   information       accurately.      According   to\n\nPlaintiffs, the standard of market efficiency that they advocate is\n\nsatisfied by application of the factors set forth in Cammer v.\n\nBloom, 711 F. Supp. 1264 (D.N.J. 1989), which weigh in favor of a\n\nfinding of efficiency in the Xcelera market.\n\n             On September 30, 2004, the district court issued its\n\ndecision     certifying   both   the    class    and   the    insider   trading\n\nsubclass.6     The court credited Plaintiffs' expert analysis which\n\nlargely tracked the Cammer factors, and rejected Defendants' expert\n\nanalysis as focusing too much on whether market price \"perfectly\n\n\n\n6\n  In its decision, the district court also granted Plaintiffs'\nmotion to certify additional class representatives. Defendants do\nnot object to the grant of this motion, and we therefore do not\naddress it.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fand correctly incorporate[d]\" – as opposed to merely reflected –\n\npublicly available information.\n\n          On February 15, 2005, we granted Defendants' petition for\n\npermission to appeal the district court's order pursuant to Rule\n\n23(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.7           Defendants argue\n\nthat the district court erred in adopting a definition of \"market\n\nefficiency\" which did not require that market price rapidly and\n\naccurately reflect all publicly available information.           Defendants\n\nfurther argue that the district court erred in applying only the\n\nCammer factors to determine market efficiency.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          As we stated in PolyMedica,\n\n     [t]he formulation of the proper standard for efficiency\n     is a purely legal question reviewed de novo. Reviewing\n     the application of that standard to the facts of a case\n     involves the review of a mixed question of law and fact.\n     Given the various factors relevant to an efficiency\n     determination, and the abundant evidence that can be\n     developed with respect to each factor, the determination\n     of whether a market is efficient is a fact-dominated\n     inquiry.    Therefore, deferential clear-error review\n     applies to that determination. The ultimate decision to\n     certify a class is, of course, a discretionary one.\n\nNo. 05-1220, slip op. (internal citation omitted).\n\n          In   a   securities   fraud    action   under   §   10(b)   of   the\n\nExchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, plaintiffs are\n\n\n7\n  Rule 23(f) provides, in relevant part, that \"a court of appeals\nmay in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district\ncourt granting or denying class action certification under this\nrule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of\nthe order.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f).\n\n                                   -7-\n\ftypically required to prove that they individually relied on a\n\ndefendant's     misrepresentation.       Id.       Requiring     proof   of\n\nindividualized reliance, of course, would effectively preclude\n\nsecurities fraud class actions under Rule 23(b)(3).              Individual\n\nissues of reliance would necessarily overwhelm the common ones.\n\nThe   fraud-on-the-market    theory   eliminates    the   need    to   prove\n\nindividualized reliance by allowing a rebuttable presumption that\n\nthe plaintiff relied on the \"integrity of the market price\" which\n\nreflected the misrepresentation.         \"Before an investor can be\n\npresumed to have relied upon the integrity of the market price,\n\nhowever, the market must be 'efficient.'\"          Id.    In an efficient\n\nmarket, the defendant's misrepresentations are absorbed into, and\n\nreflected by, the market price.       Investors who rely on the market\n\nprice, therefore, indirectly rely on those misrepresentations,\n\nthereby justifying a presumption of reliance under the fraud-on-\n\nthe-market theory.     Conversely, when a market lacks efficiency,\n\nthere is no assurance that market price reflects the defendant's\n\nmisrepresentations and that investors therefore indirectly relied\n\non those misrepresentations.\n\nA.         Standard of \"Market Efficiency\"\n\n           1.      \"Market Efficiency\" Under PolyMedica\n\n           In PolyMedica, we held that \"an efficient market is one\n\nin which the market price of the stock fully reflects all publicly\n\navailable information.\"     Id.   This definition focuses on whether a\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fmarket is efficient in the informational sense, that is, whether\n\nmarket prices respond rapidly to new information, such that prices\n\nimpound all publicly available information (and misinformation),\n\nthereby justifying a presumption of reliance under the fraud-on-\n\nthe-market theory.\n\n           2.       The District Court's Standard of Efficiency\n\n           According to the district court, an efficient market is\n\none   in   which    \"market   price   reflect[s]   publicly       available\n\ninformation.\" In re: Xcelera.Com Sec. Litig., No. 00-11649-RWZ, at\n\n6 (D. Mass. Sept. 30, 2004) (unpublished opinion). This definition\n\nof market efficiency does not provide explicitly that market price\n\nmust \"fully\" reflect \"all\" available information, the standard set\n\nforth in PolyMedica.     However, the district court's reliance upon\n\nCammer to determine whether the Xcelera market was efficient means\n\nthat it necessarily applied the standard of efficiency used in\n\nCammer, which tracks the definition we adopted in PolyMedica.          See\n\nCammer, 711 F. Supp. at 1281 (stating that an efficient market is\n\none in which \"current price reflects all available information,\"\n\nand citing economic commentator Eugene Fama's definition of market\n\nefficiency as \"[a] market in which prices always 'fully reflect'\n\navailable information\").\n\n           Still,    Defendants   argue   that   the   district    court's\n\ndefinition of an efficient market is incomplete.        Missing from the\n\ncourt's definition, Defendants assert, is a requirement that in an\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fefficient market, \"stock prices rapidly and accurately reflect all\n\npublicly available information.\"               (Emphasis added.)      Because of\n\nthese omissions, Defendants argue, the district court wrongfully\n\nconcluded that Xcelera's market was efficient.\n\n                      a.    Rapidly\n\n           While we agree with Defendants that an efficient market\n\nmust \"rapidly\" reflect all publicly available information, and so\n\nstated in PolyMedica, that characteristic is implicit in the\n\nrequirement that a market \"fully reflect\" all publicly available\n\ninformation.     See PolyMedica, No. 05-1220, slip op. (stating that\n\n\"market price 'fully reflects' all publicly available information\n\nwhen prices respond so quickly to new information that it is\n\nimpossible for traders to make trading profits on the basis of that\n\ninformation\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nTherefore, where, as here, the district court correctly determined\n\nthat   market   price      must   fully    reflect   all   publicly    available\n\ninformation     for   purposes     of     defining   market   efficiency,    the\n\ndistrict court understood that market price must \"rapidly\" reflect\n\nsuch information in an efficient market.              Moreover, the district\n\ncourt's reliance upon Cammer, which emphasized the importance of an\n\nefficient market \"rapidly reflect[ing] new information in price,\"\n\n711 F. Supp. at 1276 n.17, again indicates that the district court\n\nunderstood that an efficient market rapidly absorbs and reflects\n\nnew information.\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f                    b.    Accurately\n\n            Defendants argue that an efficient market must also\n\nrespond to information accurately.            According to their expert\n\nwitness, Richardson, an efficient market \"accurately\" reflects all\n\npublicly available information when \"investors [are] rational and\n\nfac[e] no trading frictions such that stock prices equal their\n\n'fundamental value.'\"      Accuracy, Richardson argues, thus hinges\n\nupon a stock price's consistency with its fundamental value, which,\n\nin turn, hinges upon the market behaving rationally.\n\n            Elaborating       further,      Richardson     explains     that\n\n\"fundamental value is the discounted sum of expected future cash\n\nprofits of the stock.\"     In an efficient market, Richardson states,\n\ninformation should \"tell you something about . . . the expected\n\ncash flow of the asset or the risk of that asset[,] and that\n\ninformation should get incorporated into that price.\"             Richardson\n\nargues that \"fundamental, or true, value\" does not, however, mean\n\n\"ultimate future value,\" such that \"investors [must] be fortune\n\ntellers.\"    Rather, it means a \"fair price\" that \"incorporates all\n\nthe information currently available to investors,\" such that price\n\nadjustments are \"accurate on average:          the prices should neither\n\nunderreact nor overreact to particular news announcements.\"\n\n            But   investors    are   not    always    rational,   Richardson\n\ncontends; the presence of irrational investors in the market causes\n\nprices \"to diverg[e] from fundamentals.\"             The decisions of these\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\firrational investors, Richardson argues, \"begin to move prices away\n\nfrom their fundamental value\" – away from expected risks and\n\nreturns – \"meaning they're not reflecting the information in a\n\nrational way.\" Richardson acknowledges, however, that the presence\n\nof these irrational investors \"is not enough per se to refute the\n\nhypothesis that the market is efficient.\" On the contrary, \"prices\n\nwill eventually adjust until the mispricings disappear,\" so long as\n\nthere are a sufficient number of rational investors active in the\n\nmarket, and provided that these rational investors are not limited\n\nin their ability \"to take advantage of, or 'arbitrage,' these\n\nmispricings\" by \"purchas[ing] the underpriced securities (i.e.,\n\nrelative to fundamental value) and sell[ing] the overpriced ones to\n\nthe irrational investors.\"          Thus, in order \"for prices to not\n\naccurately reflect fundamental information,\" Richardson contends,\n\n\"there   must     be   a   reason   why    asset    prices    diverged    from\n\nfundamentals, e.g., the presence of irrational investors . . . and\n\n[] there must be some limits to arbitrage that prevent rational\n\ncapital from forcing prices and fundamental value to converge.\"\n\n            Not   surprisingly,     Plaintiffs     insist    that   \"accuracy\"\n\nshould be excluded from the definition of efficiency. According to\n\nHakala, their expert, a market is efficient when \"all relevant and\n\npublicly available information is impounded in share price.\"                By\n\nrequiring    that      market   price      \"accurately\"      reflect     public\n\ninformation, Hakala argues that Defendants are advocating \"a higher\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fstandard\" of market efficiency imposed by academics, which demands\n\nthat markets must behave rationally so that stock prices will\n\n\"always   conform       to   some   idealized    fundamental     value       that   is\n\ndemonstrated       in   retrospect.\"          Hakala   contends       that     market\n\nefficiency demands only that market price \"reflects all public\n\ninformation\" so that \"an average investor wo[n't] ordinarily be\n\nable to beat the market . . . . It doesn't say anything about\n\nwhether the market was right or wrong in retrospect. . . .\"\n\nAccording   to     Hakala,     \"[Richardson's]     analysis     confuses       market\n\nefficiency with a level of hyper-rationality or perfect foresight\n\non the part of market participants that is unrealistic and not\n\nrequired for a presumption of fraud-on-the-market.\" This analysis,\n\nHakala contends, \"amounts to second-guessing the market, concluding\n\nthat the market, in retrospect . . . [was] over-valued.\"\n\n            In   response      to   arguments    raised   by    the    parties      in\n\nPolyMedica, we have already resolved this debate in favor of\n\nPlaintiffs. As we explained in PolyMedica, the fraud-on-the-market\n\npresumption of reliance does not depend on the accuracy of the\n\nmarket    price,    and      whether   it   \"mirror[s]    the     best       possible\n\nestimates, in light of all available information, of the actual\n\neconomic values of securities in terms of their expected risks and\n\nreturns.\"    No. 05-1220, slip op. (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted). Rather, this presumption depends on whether the\n\nmarket price of the stock reflects all available information, such\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fthat an investor can be deemed to have indirectly relied on the\n\nmisrepresentation.    Whether the stock was \"worth\" more or less in\n\nsome fundamental value sense, while arguably relevant to the\n\nefficiency inquiry, is not essential to it.\n\n          As we stated in PolyMedica, \"[w]hile fundamental value\n\nefficiency may be the more comprehensive of the two concepts,\n\nencompassing both speed and accuracy, [e]fficiency is not an all-\n\nor-nothing phenomenon.\"      Id. (emphasis in original) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).      We explained that \"for\n\npurposes of establishing the presumption of reliance, therefore,\n\ninvestors need only show that the market was informationally\n\nefficient,\" not fundamental value efficient.     Id.; see also id.\n\n(stating that \"the fraud-on-the-market theory does not require\n\n'proof that the market correctly reflects some 'fundamental value'\n\nof the security.     To apply the fraud-on-the-market theory, it is\n\nsufficient that the market for a security be 'efficient' only in\n\nthe sense that market prices reflect the available information\n\nabout the security'\") (quoting In re Verifone Sec. Litig., 784 F.\n\nSupp. at 1479 n.7).\n\n          Defendants do not, and cannot, cite to any language in\n\nBasic requiring that the market price of a stock must accurately\n\nreflect its fundamental value for purposes of demonstrating market\n\nefficiency.   In fact, as we noted in PolyMedica, the Supreme Court\n\nin Basic declined to explicitly address the meaning of market\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fefficiency    –    much     less   a   fundamental    value   theory       of   market\n\nefficiency – stating that, \"[w]e do not intend conclusively to\n\nadopt any particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly\n\navailable information is reflected in market price.\"                     Id. (quoting\n\nBasic, 485 U.S. at 249 n.28).8\n\n          Defendants contend that the district court, abetted by\n\nPlaintiffs'       expert,    misconstrued       \"accuracy\"    to    mean    that   the\n\nXcelera market must \"correctly predict\" what the fundamental value\n\nof the security (i.e., \"the discounted sum of expected future cash\n\nprofits of the stock\") will be in the future.                  On the contrary,\n\nDefendants argue, \"accuracy\" means only that a stock's price will\n\nreflect its fundamental value \"at any given moment.\"                       This is a\n\ndisingenuous argument.             Like any lawsuit, the securities fraud\n\naction involves the recreation of past events through proof. Proof\n\nof fundamental value \"at any given moment\" would necessarily be a\n\nretrospective analysis which, in the words of Hakala, \"amounts to\n\nsecond-guessing       the     market,    concluding    that        the   market,    in\n\n\n\n8\n  We are unpersuaded by the cases cited by Defendants which\ngenerally allude to stock price's consistency with \"accuracy\" and\n\"value.\" None of these cases specifically hold that a market is\ninefficient where the stock's price fails to \"accurately\" reflect\nall publicly available information, see, e.g., Ross v. Bank South,\nN.A., 885 F.2d 723 (11th Cir. 1989); Hurley v. FDIC, 719 F. Supp.\n27 (D. Mass. 1989), nor do any of these cases analyze whether a\nmarket was inefficient based on the failure of stock price to\nmirror fundamental value, i.e., \"the discounted sum of expected\nfuture cash profits of the stock,\" see, e.g., Gariety v. Grant\nThornton, LLP, 368 F.3d 356 (4th Cir. 2004); Freeman v. Laventhol\n& Horwath, 915 F.2d 193 (6th Cir. 1990).\n\n                                         -15-\n\fretrospect    .     .    .    [was]   over-valued.\"              If   this     retrospective\n\njudgment was that the stock price at a given moment was over-\n\nvalued, that judgment would be tantamount to the conclusion that\n\nthe stock price was a poor predictor of what subsequent analysis\n\nwould reveal about fundamental value at that given moment.\n\n            We find no error in the district court's determination\n\nthat, pursuant to Defendants' definition of market efficiency, \"a\n\nrobust stock market would always present a defense at the class\n\ncertification stage and on the merits that depends on highly\n\nsubjective, retrospective analysis of what people trading in a\n\nstock   should      have      been    thinking.\"           The   court's       reference   to\n\n\"retrospective          analysis\"      is    not    incorrect.           The     present-day\n\nanalysis     of     the      fundamental          value    of     Xcelera's      assets    by\n\nDefendants'        expert      during       the     Class       Period    is    necessarily\n\n\"retrospective.\"             In addition, we find no error in the court's\n\nrejection     of    Defendants'         expert's          \"suggest[ion]        that   market\n\nefficiency is a rare phenomenon.\" Defendants' expert conceded that\n\n\"[t]he Internet sector as a whole, at least the 400 sample firms,\"\n\nwas inefficient \"in aggregate,\" and relied on an economic treatise\n\nwhose author concluded that \"financial markets in most scenarios\n\nare not expected to be efficient.                   Market efficiency only emerges\n\nas an extreme special case, unlikely to hold under plausible\n\ncircumstances.\"         (Citing Andrei Shleifer, Inefficient Markets:                      An\n\nIntroduction to Behavioral Finance 24 (2000).)                           This emphasis on\n\n\n                                             -16-\n\fthe   rarity   of    efficient   markets,     grounded     in   the    concept   of\n\nfundamental value efficiency, would have the likely effect of\n\nmaking it unduly difficult to establish the fraud-on-the-market\n\npresumption of reliance.\n\n           The      district   court   was    right   to   worry      about   these\n\nimplications of Defendants' efficiency arguments; it did not err by\n\nrejecting Defendants' proposed definition of market efficiency\n\nrequiring consistency with fundamental value.               By drawing on the\n\nstandard of efficiency in Cammer and holding that \"a share's market\n\nprice [must] reflect publicly available information, not . . .\n\nperfectly and correctly incorporate it,\" the district court adopted\n\nthe correct standard of efficiency. We must now decide whether the\n\ncourt correctly applied this standard in determining that the\n\nXcelera market was efficient.\n\n                                       III.\n\nA.         Level of Inquiry\n\n           In evaluating whether the Xcelera market was efficient,\n\nthe district court considered the \"persuasive and widely followed\"\n\nfactors enumerated in Cammer.           Xcelera, No. 00-11649-RWZ, at 5.\n\nThese factors are: (1) the stock's average trading volume; (2) the\n\nnumber of securities analysts that followed and reported on the\n\nstock; (3) the presence of market makers and arbitrageurs; (4) the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fcompany's eligibility to file a Form S-3 Registration Statement9;\n\nand   (5)   a    cause-and-effect        relationship,     over   time,   between\n\nunexpected corporate events or financial releases and an immediate\n\nresponse in stock price.           Cammer, 711 F. Supp. at 1286-87.         These\n\nfactors provide useful evidence from which market efficiency may be\n\ninferred,       and    are   therefore    relevant    to   a   district   court's\n\ndetermination of whether a market is efficient.                   As we noted in\n\nPolyMedica, however, these factors are not exhaustive.                    No. 05-\n\n1220, slip op. (citing Unger, 401 F.3d at 323, 325 (noting that\n\nCammer factors are not exhaustive, and are \"an analytical tool,\"\n\nnot \"a checklist\")).\n\n            Crediting Plaintiffs' expert analysis, the district court\n\nconcluded, without further discussion of the factors, \"that the\n\nstock's trading volume was high; Xcelera received the attention of\n\nthe   press      and    analysts    as    well   as    the     participation   of\n\nsophisticated investors; there were no undue limits to arbitrage,\n\nand that the stock price did respond to information.\" Xcelera, No.\n\n00-11649-RWZ, at 5.            Plaintiffs argue that the district court\n\ncorrectly determined that these factors were satisfied and that the\n\nXcelera market was therefore efficient.               Defendants contend that\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Companies permitted by           the SEC to file an S-3 Registration\nStatement, an abbreviated          prospectus requiring fewer disclosures\nthan Forms S-1 or S-2, are         those which meet the $75 million market\ncapitalization requirement         and have filed reports with the SEC for\ntwelve consecutive months.           17 C.F.R. § 239.13 (2003).\n\n                                         -18-\n\fthe district court's concise analysis of market efficiency is\n\ninconsistent with the searching inquiry demanded by Rule 23.\n\n              We disagree. As Plaintiffs point out, the district court\n\nreceived and reviewed hundreds of pages of briefing and exhibits\n\nfocused on the issue of market efficiency, received multiple\n\naffidavits from experts on both sides and heard two days of\n\ntestimony from those experts and arguments from counsel regarding\n\nmarket efficiency. In holding that Xcelera's market was efficient,\n\nthe court specifically credited the testimony of Plaintiffs' expert\n\nover that of Defendants' expert, noting Xcelera's satisfaction of\n\nthe Cammer factors and rejecting Defendants' evidence that market\n\nprice   did    not   \"perfectly   and   correctly\"   incorporate   publicly\n\navailable information. This is not a case where the district court\n\n\"simply presumed the facts in favor of an efficient market\" based\n\non \"bare allegations\" raised in the plaintiff's complaint.           Unger,\n\n401 F.3d at 323, 325.\n\n              Here, the district court properly \"engaged in a case-\n\nspecific analysis that went well beyond the pleadings,\" weighing\n\nthe competing evidence concerning market efficiency and offering a\n\nsuccinct explanation of its determination that the fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket presumption should apply to this class action.         PolyMedica,\n\n05-1220, slip op. (quoting Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray,\n\n208 F.3d 288, 297 (1st Cir. 2000)).          The district court was not\n\nrequired to explain itself in greater detail.          The more important\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fissue is whether the evidence supports its determination to apply\n\nthe presumption.\n\nB.         The Cammer Factors\n\n           1.         Cause-and-Effect Relationship\n\n           Starting with the fifth, and in many ways, the most\n\nimportant, Cammer factor, Plaintiffs contend that the district\n\ncourt correctly found a historical cause-and-effect relationship\n\nbetween company disclosures and an immediate response in stock\n\nprice.     This relationship is, of course, \"the essence of an\n\nefficient market and the foundation for the fraud on the market\n\ntheory.\"   Cammer, 711 F. Supp. at 1287.           In the absence of such a\n\nrelationship, there is little assurance that information is being\n\nabsorbed   into    the   market   and       reflected   in   its   price.    To\n\ndemonstrate     the   existence   of    a     cause-and-effect     relationship\n\nbetween corporate information and stock price, Plaintiffs' expert\n\npresented the results of a sophisticated event study analyzing how\n\nXcelera    stock      price   reacted       to   company-specific     events.10\n\nPlaintiffs' study lists more than forty separate instances, thirty-\n\n\n\n10\n  In addition to company-specific events, the study also analyzed\nhow Xcelera's stock price reacted to information in the industry\nand in the general stock market (the NASDAQ, which is \"the largest\nelectronic, screen-based market in the world\"). PolyMedica, No.\n05-1220, slip op. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nPlaintiffs' expert found that the movements of Xcelera's stock\nprice correlated with the movements of a sampling of other Internet\ncompanies and with the NASDAQ as well, thereby further indicating\nthat \"Xcelera's common stock price is efficiently reacting to\npublic information.\"\n\n                                       -20-\n\fsix of which occurred during the Class Period, in which Xcelera\n\nstock price rose or fell (in several cases, by more than 50%, and\n\nin one case, rose by more than 100%) within one day11 of the release\n\nof company-specific information.\n\n            For instance, on April 1, 1999, Xcelera's stock price\n\nincreased 194% following an announcement that Xcelera had purchased\n\na majority interest in Mirror Image that day; on December 21, 1999,\n\nfollowing   the   announcement   of   Hewlett-Packard's   $32   million\n\ninvestment in Xcelera that day, Xcelera's stock increased 20%; a\n\nglowing report in the Gilder Technology Report on February 12, 2000\n\ncaused Xcelera stock price to increase 42% on that day; and on July\n\n\n11\n  In addition to a one-day window, Plaintiffs' event study lists,\nas a control, the effect of company-specific information over\nlonger windows of two, three, and five days, respectively. For\nexample, following the announcement on March 22, 2000 that Exodus\nwould invest $637.5 million in Mirror Image, Xcelera's stock price\nincreased by 24% on that day. According to the event study, this\ninformation accounted for a 23% increase in price two days after\nthe announcement, a 25% increase after three days, and a 23%\nincrease after five days. Defendants argue that the two- and five-\nday (and presumably, the three-day) windows are inconsistent with\nthe requirement that an efficient market must rapidly reflect all\npublicly available information. However, because Plaintiffs' event\nstudy captures the same-day reaction of Xcelera's stock price to\ncompany-specific events, Defendants' arguments concerning the\nmulti-day windows are unavailing. See Jonathan R. Macey et al.,\nLessons from Financial Economics:      Materiality, Reliance, and\nExtending the Reach of Basic v. Levinson, 77 Va. L. Rev. 1017, 1031\n(1991) (stating that \"financial economists often define the event\nperiod as the two-day period consisting of the announcement day and\nthe following day\"); see also Lehocky v. Tidel Techs., Inc., 220\nF.R.D. 491, 506-07 (S.D. Tex. 2004) (concluding that plaintiff's\nexpert's event study using two-day window was \"sufficient to\ndemonstrate, for class certification purposes, that a cause and\neffect relationship between company-specific announcements and\nstock price may exist\").\n\n                                 -21-\n\f13, 2000, the day Lazard Freres released a negative analyst report\n\non Xcelera, the stock price dropped 19%.             Conversely, Plaintiffs'\n\nexpert also found that re-releases of old information, such as\n\nsecondary announcements about acquisitions or new investments,\n\nresulted in only a modest stock price reaction or no reaction at\n\nall.    Based on these findings, Plaintiffs' expert concluded that\n\nthe    Xcelera    market     reacted    strongly     –    both   positively    and\n\nnegatively – to new information concerning the company (including,\n\nbut not limited to, disclosures at issue in this case).\n\n            Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' reliance upon various\n\nnews events to demonstrate this cause-and-effect relationship was\n\nan exercise in post-hoc logic.                In support of this argument,\n\nDefendants cite to the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Unger, in which\n\nthe    court     concluded    that     such   post-hoc     reasoning,      without\n\nsupporting expert statistical analysis, failed to take into account\n\nthe many other factors that could affect stock price.                   401 F.3d at\n\n324.   In that case, however, the plaintiffs offered only \"sketchy\"\n\nevidence of a cause-and-effect relationship, including \"one-sided\n\naffidavits, and unexplained Internet printouts,\" and provided no\n\nexpert statistical evidence whatsoever.             Id. at 320, 325.\n\n            Plaintiffs       argue   that     in   this    case,   by    contrast,\n\nPlaintiffs' expert submitted an event study which \"sought to\n\nidentify all or nearly all of the news and information\" pertaining\n\nto Xcelera – whether \"statistically significant\" or not – \"in the\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\fform of published articles, press releases, reports, news bulletins\n\nand financial filings of Xcelera,\" for the proposed Class Period.\n\nAs noted above, in addition to this company-specific information,\n\nPlaintiffs' event study included a determination of how Xcelera\n\nstock    price   reacted   to   general-market     and   industry-specific\n\ninformation, the kind of information the court found lacking in\n\nUnger.    Id. at 325 (stating that statistical evidence touching on\n\n\"the daily market average; national, local and industry-specific\n\neconomic news; [and] competitors' activities\" may be helpful to\n\ndetermination of efficiency).         Plaintiffs' expert also supported\n\nhis event study with two affidavits, and provided testimony at a\n\ntwo-day hearing devoted, in part, to the findings of the event\n\nstudy.\n\n            2.      The Stock's Average Trading Volume\n\n            Plaintiffs presented evidence that the average weekly\n\ntrading    volume   for    Xcelera   stock,    that   is,   the   number   of\n\noutstanding shares being traded on a weekly basis, was high.                A\n\nhigh average weekly trading volume suggests market efficiency since\n\nit implies \"significant investor interest in the company\" and \"a\n\nlikelihood that many investors are executing trades on the basis of\n\nnewly available or disseminated corporate information.\"             Cammer,\n\n711 F. Supp. at 1286.        Plaintiffs demonstrated that the average\n\ndaily trading volume for Xcelera stock exceeded 1,000,000 shares\n\nper day throughout the Class Period.          Put another way, the average\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fdaily trading volume represented more than 4% of approximately 27.5\n\nmillion total outstanding shares – well above the 1% or 2% figures\n\nsuggested by several courts as the benchmark for supporting a\n\npresumption of efficiency.      See, e.g., O'Neil v. Apel, 165 F.R.D.\n\n479, 508 (W.D. Mich. 1996); Cammer, 711 F. Supp. at 1293.\n\n            Defendants argue that Plaintiffs overstate the trading\n\nvolume of Xcelera shares by using split-adjusted shares12 as opposed\n\nto the smaller number of actual (unadjusted) shares. For instance,\n\nDefendants object to Plaintiffs' calculation of the daily trading\n\nvolume for August 10, 1999 using the 9,600 split-adjusted shares\n\ntraded that day, instead of the only 400 unadjusted shares traded\n\nthat day.        Yet Defendants do not cite any authority for the\n\nproposition that Plaintiffs may not adjust for stock splits in\n\norder to derive a uniform trading volume for the Class Period.\n\n            3.       Number of Securities Analysts\n\n            Both   parties   agree   that   the   greater   the   number   of\n\nsecurities analysts following and reporting on a company's stock,\n\n\n12\n  Xcelera's stock underwent several stock splits throughout the\nClass Period. A stock split refers to \"[t]he issuance of two or\nmore new shares in exchange for each old share without changing the\nproportional ownership interests of each shareholder,\" thereby\n\"lower[ing] the price per share and thus mak[ing] the stock more\nattractive to potential investors.\" Black's Law Dictionary (8th\ned. 2004). For example, Xcelera's 2-for-1 stock split on September\n30, 1999 would have given an owner of 100 shares of Xcelera stock\na total of 200 shares, or two shares for each share previously\nowned.   In order to establish a uniform trading volume for the\nClass Period, which contained multiple stock splits, Plaintiffs\nadjusted their calculation of trading volume by taking into account\nall splits that had occurred over the Class Period.\n\n                                     -24-\n\fthe greater the likelihood that information released by a company\n\nis being relied upon by investors.          As the court in Cammer noted,\n\nthe existence of a significant number of analysts implies that\n\ncompany reports are \"closely reviewed by investment professionals,\n\nwho   would    in   turn    make   buy/sell   recommendations    to    client\n\ninvestors.\"      711 F. Supp. at 1286.        The parties also agree that\n\nonly one analyst followed Xcelera's stock and issued only one\n\nreport during the Class Period – far fewer than the fifteen\n\nresearch reports on the company at issue in Cammer, whose market\n\nwas found to be efficient, id. at 183.\n\n              Defendants argue that one analyst is not enough, see\n\nO'Neil, 165 F.R.D. at 501 (stating that \"[m]ajor corporations are\n\nclosely followed by hundreds of securities analysts throughout the\n\ncountry\"), and that the news coverage relied upon by Plaintiffs was\n\nmore \"journalistic commentary\" than the kind of \"analysis that\n\nwould help investors understand the published information about the\n\ncompany and invest on that basis.\"          In addition, Defendants argue\n\nthat the Xcelera market lacked the presence of sophisticated\n\ninstitutional investors who \"search out, distill, trade on, and\n\ndisseminate information affecting an issuer\" and who are thus vital\n\nto an efficient market.       See Lehocky, 220 F.R.D. at 508 (crediting\n\nplaintiff's      expert's    assertion      that   \"there   is   a    general\n\nunderstanding that a high level of institutional interest in a\n\nsecurity serves to increase the efficiency of the market\").\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\f            Notwithstanding    the   presence    of   only    one    securities\n\nanalyst, Plaintiffs contend that information about Xcelera was\n\nwidely     distributed    through    \"news    articles,      press    releases,\n\ntelevision interviews and the Company's SEC filings,\" and indirect\n\ncoverage from numerous influential brokerage firms reporting on\n\nother Internet and technology stocks.              This media attention,\n\nPlaintiffs argue, more than made up for the lack of securities\n\nanalysts.     See Cheney v. Cyberguard Corp., 213 F.R.D. 484, 499\n\n(S.D. Fla. 2003) (stating that significant number of news items\n\nfeaturing defendant company \"indicat[ed] that information regarding\n\n[the company] may have been widely distributed, which would support\n\na finding of efficiency\"). In addition, in response to Defendants'\n\ncharge that the Xcelera market lacked institutional investors,\n\nPlaintiffs point to the fact that two major institutions – Hewlett\n\nPackard and Exodus Communications – made significant investments in\n\nXcelera, and that for the last six months of the Class Period, at\n\nleast    thirty   other   institutional      investors    also   invested    in\n\nXcelera.\n\n            4.      Number of Market-Makers and Arbitrageurs\n\n            A market-maker is \"[o]ne who helps establish a market for\n\nsecurities by reporting bid-and-asked quotations\" (the price a\n\nbuyer will pay for a security and the price a seller will sell a\n\nsecurity), Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004), and who \"stand[s]\n\nready to buy or sell at these publicly quoted prices,\" Lehocky, 220\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fF.R.D. at 508 n.24.    According to Plaintiffs' expert, a market-\n\nmaker,   more   particularly,   \"is   a   brokerage   firm   or   special\n\nsecurities firm that actively buys and sells stocks on its own\n\naccount with the intention of holding them for a relatively short\n\nperiod of time so as to make a market.\"\n\n           While the court in Cammer found that market-makers (and\n\narbitrageurs13) contribute to market efficiency by \"react[ing]\n\nswiftly to company news and reported financial results by buying or\n\nselling stock and driving it to a changed price level,\" 711 F.\n\nSupp. at 1287, Defendants argue that the mere existence of market-\n\nmakers, without more, is not meaningful. See O'Neil, 165 F.R.D. at\n\n502 (stating that \"it is impossible to accord much significance to\n\nthe number of market makers, until one knows the volume of shares\n\nthat they committed to trade, the volume of shares they actually\n\ntraded, and the prices at which they did so\"); see also id. (noting\n\nthat \"the economic literature has criticized reliance upon the\n\nnumber of marker makers as an indicator of efficiency,\" and citing\n\nstudy which found \"no empirical correlation between the number of\n\nmarket makers and the efficiency of the market\").             Defendants\n\n\n13\n   Neither Cammer nor other courts addressing this factor\ndistinguish between market-makers and arbitrageurs, but instead\nrefer to the two somewhat interchangeably.        As we noted in\nPolyMedica, \"arbitrageurs\" are professional investors who exploit\nprice differences in different markets by buying and selling\nidentical securities in those markets. Id. While arbitrageurs are\ndistinct from market-makers, who seek to facilitate trading in a\nparticular security, both play an important role in keeping markets\nefficient.\n\n                                 -27-\n\fcontend that Plaintiffs' evidence establishes only the presence of\n\nmarket-makers in the Xcelera market, not whether they in fact\n\ncontributed to market efficiency by \"buying or selling Xcelera's\n\nstock and driving it to a price reflective of all information\n\nbearing on value.\"14\n\n          Plaintiffs contend that more than twenty market-makers\n\nparticipated in the market for Xcelera stock, with seven market-\n\nmakers trading over one million shares each in the final quarter of\n\nthe Class Period.      They say that this evidence demonstrates not\n\nonly that there was a sufficient number of market-makers present to\n\nfacilitate trading, see, e.g., Cheney, 213 F.R.D. 484, 500 (S.D.\n\nFla. 2003) (holding that presence of between fifteen and nineteen\n\nmarket-makers weighed in favor of finding of market efficiency)\n\n(citing Cammer, 711 F. Supp. at 1283 n.30 (finding that presence of\n\neleven market-makers weighed in favor of efficiency)), but also\n\n\n\n\n14\n  In addition, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs offered no evidence\nwhatsoever for the presence of arbitrageurs in the Xcelera market.\nDefendants contend that the absence of arbitrageurs demonstrates\nthat there were limits on the ability of rational investors to\nengage in short sales, thereby \"push[ing] prices to incorporate all\npublicly available information.\" Plaintiffs argue that Defendants'\nevidence of constraints on short sales relates to rationality, not\nefficiency, and thus has no place in the Cammer analysis.       (We\naddress below Defendants' evidence of irrationality in the Xcelera\nmarket).   In any event, Plaintiffs contend, \"during the Class\nPeriod investors were able to and did sell Xcelera's shares short,\nand the number of people shorting Xcelera stock grew\" during most\nof the Class Period.\n\n                                 -28-\n\fthat   these   market-makers   were   in   fact   conducting   trades   in\n\nsignificant volume.15\n\nC.         The District Court's Fraud-on-the-Market Determination\n\n           Although Defendants insist that the evidence we have\n\nsummarized here did not support the district court's finding of an\n\nefficient market on the basis of the Cammer factors, we disagree.\n\nAs we have already noted, \"the determination of whether a market is\n\nefficient is a fact-dominated inquiry.            Therefore, deferential\n\nclear-error review applies to that determination.\"          The district\n\ncourt was entitled to resolve the evidentiary conflicts in favor of\n\nPlaintiffs.     There was no clear error in the district court's\n\nevaluation of the evidence under Cammer.\n\n           Anticipating the obstacles posed by clear-error review,\n\nDefendants attempt to inject into the clear-error analysis an\n\nargument that is more akin to a claim of legal error.          Defendants\n\nargue that even if the Cammer factors were met, the district court\n\nshould have concluded that Xcelera's market was inefficient based\n\non other factors rejected by the court.       According to Defendants,\n\nthe district court erroneously applied the Cammer factors in\n\n\n\n15\n  While listing \"eligibility to file an S-3 Registration Statement\"\nas one of the five factors \"that could give rise to an inference of\nan efficient market,\" the district court chose not to address this\nCammer factor. Although both parties invoke this factor in support\nof their respective positions, the district court did not err in\nforegoing analysis of this factor in favor of Cammer's other\nfactors, and, therefore, we need not reach the parties' arguments\nregarding this factor.\n\n                                 -29-\n\fisolation, rather than viewing them as part of a broader analysis\n\nof the structure of the Xcelera market.          \"[T]he ultimate question\n\nof market efficiency,\" Defendants argue, \"is structural, and [the\n\nCammer factors] are only partial indicators of market structure.\"\n\nIn order to determine whether the Xcelera market was efficient,\n\nDefendants argue that the district court should have analyzed\n\nwhether Xcelera's market behaved \"rationally\".\n\n            Defendants contend that Xcelera's market was dominated by\n\nirrational investors \"not basing their decisions on analysis . . .\n\nof the fundamental value of the stock in light of all currently\n\navailable     information.\"         Defendants    further    contend   that\n\nconstraints    on   short   sales   in   the   Xcelera   market   prevented\n\narbitrageurs from acting on analyses that \"push[] prices into line\n\nwith all information bearing on the security's fundamental value.\"16\n\nLastly,   Defendants   argue   that      Xcelera's   stock   price   behaved\n\nirrationally – reaching levels \"that were orders of magnitude too\n\n\n\n16\n  Defendants offer several pieces of evidence in support of the\nexistence of limits on capacity for arbitrage, including: high\ncosts of borrowing Xcelera stock to sell short (i.e., low \"rebate\nrates\"); violations of put-call parity in the options market,\nwhich, according to Defendants, \"necessarily imply a limit to\narbitrage and, in particular, a short sales constraint\"; a \"high\nturnover\" of individual investors, indicating that investors were\nbuying and selling Xcelera stock within a relatively brief time,\nand thereby not loaning their shares to short-sellers; a high level\nof existing short interest, which, Defendants argue, implies\nconstraints on other would-be short-sellers; a high bid-ask spread,\nsuggesting that stock is too expensive to trade; and high risks\nfaced by short-sellers in light of the rapid rise in Xcelera's\nstock price during the Class Period.\n\n                                     -30-\n\fhigh, based on any possible range of future earnings growth, to be\n\nconsistent     with    an    efficient   market\";    reacting   to   \"minor\"\n\ndevelopments in ways greatly disproportionate to the economic\n\nsignificance    of    such    developments;   and   \"fluctuat[ing]   wildly\"\n\nthroughout the Class Period.17\n\n          As we stated in PolyMedica,\n\n     [t]he question of how much evidence of efficiency is\n     necessary in order for a court to accept the fraud-on-\n     the-market presumption of reliance at the class-\n     certification stage is . . . one of degree.      District\n     courts must draw these lines sensibly, mindful of the\n     fact that while evidence of fundamental value may be\n     relevant   to   the    determination   of   informational\n     efficiency, other more accessible and manageable evidence\n     may be sufficient at the certification stage to establish\n     the basic facts that permit a court to apply the fraud-\n     on-the-market presumption.\n\nNo. 05-1220, slip op.         Here, focusing on the Cammer factors, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that Plaintiffs demonstrated the basic\n\nfacts necessary to justify a presumption of reliance at the class-\n\ncertification stage.         The court's determination that \"Defendant's\n\n[sic] expert focuses too much on the rationality of the market, as\n\nopposed to its efficiency,\" was an appropriate exercise of its\n\ndiscretion.    Xcelera, No. 00-11649-RWZ, at 5.        As discussed above,\n\n\n17\n   In order to demonstrate that Xcelera's stock price behaved\nirrationally, Defendants offered the following: a comparison of\nthe price movements of Xcelera stock and those of the Dow Jones and\nother Internet stocks from the same period; an analysis of whether\nXcelera's stock \"could reasonably be said to reflect the\nfundamental value of [its] assets\"; evidence of \"extraordinarily\nhigh\" volatility in Xcelera's stock price; and an analysis of\ncompany-specific events to which Xcelera's stock price failed to\nrespond rationally.\n\n                                     -31-\n\ffor purposes of establishing the fraud-on-the-market presumption of\n\nreliance, market efficiency does not require that a market be\n\n\"rational,      i.e.,   consistent      with   fundamental     value.\"      While\n\nevidence   of    irrationality     in    the   Xcelera     market   –   i.e.,   the\n\npresence of irrational investors and limits to arbitrage which\n\nprevented market price from reflecting fundamental value – may have\n\nbeen   \"relevant        to   the   extent      it     raises   questions    about\n\ninformational efficiency,\" the district court did not err in\n\nfinding \"other more accessible and manageable evidence\" sufficient\n\nto establish the presumption of reliance.\n\n           The district court's consideration of four of the Cammer\n\nfactors, and its rejection of the rationality factors advanced by\n\nDefendants, was thus proper for purposes of determining market\n\nefficiency.      Because there is no \"magic number\" of factors for\n\ndetermining efficiency, we leave it to the district court in the\n\nfirst instance to decide which factors and how many factors it will\n\nconsider, emphasizing that the ultimate efficiency determination is\n\nsubject to clear error review.            Obviously, if the district court\n\nconsiders too few factors or too little evidence, the determination\n\nwill not survive clear error review.                That did not happen here.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\f                               IV.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court's order\n\ncertifying the class and the insider trading subclass is affirmed.\n\nCosts are taxed against Defendants.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -33-\n\f",

Sec. Litig.,</i> ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2005), also decided this day. Our determination in <i>PolyMedica</i> of the standard of efficiency to be used in the application of the fraud-on-the-market theory informs the analysis in this case. Defendants-Appellants Xcelera Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, an Internet holding company, and its directors, Alexander and Gustav Vik (collectively, \"Defendants\"), argue that the district court erred in determining that the market for Xcelera stock was efficient during the relevant time period, and certifying the class on that basis. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alex Stuebler, Jim Hicks, Jack Ladue, Glover Powell, and Doug Horan (\"Plaintiffs\") are purchasers of Xcelera stock, who seek to represent a class of all purchasers of Xcelera stock from April 1, 1999, through August 8, 2000 (the \"Class Period\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> According to Plaintiffs, Defendants issued a press release on April 1, 1999, stating that Xcelera had acquired a majority interest in Mirror Image Internet, Inc. (\"Mirror Image\"), an Internet holding company. More press releases and television appearances followed throughout the Class Period, touting Xcelera's ownership of Mirror Image. Defendants allegedly did not disclose, however, that this acquisition was part of a joint venture with two other companies, Kahnberget Holding, Ltd., and JAM Investments, Ltd. (collectively, \"JAM\"), both of which had contributed a substantial portion of the funds used to acquire the majority interest, $3.24 million, and which were therefore entitled to a significant portion of the Mirror Image stock pursuant to their joint-venture agreement. Defendants also allegedly did not disclose the risk of dilution<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to Xcelera shareholders should Defendants decide to issue Xcelera stock in satisfaction of its obligation to JAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that it was not until August 4, 2000 &#8212; when Xcelera issued its Annual Report for that year &#8212; that Xcelera shareholders first learned that Xcelera might be required to issue new shares of its stock to \"certain third parties\" in order to pay for its investment in Mirror Image, and that this may, in turn, result in a material dilution of Xcelera stock. That same day, the price of Xcelera's stock fell by 2.5%, from $12.31 to $12 per share. Several days later, after a brief rise in stock price on August 7, the price of Xcelera stock fell again, this time by approximately 16%, from $14 on August 8, 2000, to $11.75 on August 9, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 2, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, alleging that Defendants artificially inflated the price of Xcelera stock during the Class Period by failing to disclose the ownership dispute surrounding the Mirror Image stock and the risk of dilution of Xcelera stock. The complaint further alleged that Alexander and Gustav Vik made insider sales of over 3.2 million shares of Xcelera stock to the unknowing public during the Class Period, reaping proceeds of over $250 million. Plaintiffs seek damages against Defendants under &#167; 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b) (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5, and against Alexander and Gustav Vik under &#167; 20(a) and &#167; 20A of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a), &#167; 78t-1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 12, 2002, Plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of the class and the insider trading subclass pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and (b)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In order to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirement that common questions of law and fact predominate over individual questions, Plaintiffs relied upon the \"fraud-on-the-market\" presumption of reliance. Defendants opposed the motion, arguing that Plaintiffs were not entitled to a presumption of reliance because the market was not \"efficient\" &#8212; a prerequisite for presuming reliance. In support of this position, Defendants submitted the affidavit of Dr. Matthew P. Richardson, a professor of finance at New York University and a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. He concluded that the market for Xcelera stock was not efficient during the Class Period. Plaintiffs responded by submitting the affidavit of Dr. Scott A. Hakala, director of CBIZ Valuation Group, Inc., a national business and valuation firm, who came to the opposite conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Defendants' request, the district court conducted a two-day evidentiary hearing on November 20 and 21, 2003. Both parties presented oral argument, and each expert gave testimony concerning the meaning of market efficiency and whether the market for Xcelera stock was efficient. Defendants argued that the market for a particular stock is efficient if it rapidly <i>and accurately</i> reflects all material, publicly available information, and that Xcelera's market did not meet these standards. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argued that while efficiency requires that market price reflect all material, publicly available information \"relatively rapidly or within a reasonable period of time,\" the market price need not reflect such information accurately. According to Plaintiffs, the standard of market efficiency that they advocate is satisfied by application of the factors set forth in <i>Cammer v. Bloom,</i> 711 F.Supp. 1264 (D.N.J.1989), which weigh in favor of a finding of efficiency in the Xcelera market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 2004, the district court issued its decision certifying both the class and the insider trading subclass.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court credited Plaintiffs' expert analysis which largely tracked the <i>Cammer</i> factors, and rejected Defendants' expert analysis as focusing too much on whether market price \"perfectly and correctly incorporate[d]\" &#8212; as opposed to merely reflected &#8212; publicly available information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 2005, we granted Defendants' petition for permission to appeal the district court's order pursuant to Rule 23(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Defendants argue that the district court erred in adopting a definition of \"market efficiency\" which did not require that market price rapidly <i>and accurately</i> reflect all publicly available information. Defendants further argue that the district court erred in applying only the <i>Cammer</i> factors to determine market efficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in <i>PolyMedica,</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he formulation of the proper standard for efficiency is a purely legal question reviewed <i>de novo.</i> Reviewing the application of that standard to the facts of a case involves the review of a mixed question of law and fact. Given the various factors relevant to an efficiency determination, and the abundant evidence that can be developed with respect to each factor, the determination of whether a market is efficient is a fact-dominated inquiry. Therefore, deferential clear-error review applies to that determination. The ultimate decision to certify a class is, of course, a discretionary one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">___ F.3d at ___ (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a securities fraud action under &#167; 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, plaintiffs are typically required to prove that they individually relied on a defendant's misrepresentation. <i>Id.</i> Requiring proof of individualized reliance, of course, would effectively preclude securities fraud class actions under Rule 23(b)(3). Individual issues of reliance would necessarily overwhelm the common ones. The fraud-on-the-market theory eliminates the need to prove individualized reliance by allowing a rebuttable presumption that the plaintiff relied on the \"integrity of the market price\" which reflected the misrepresentation. \"Before an investor can be presumed to have relied upon the integrity of the market price, however, the market must be `efficient.'\" <i>Id.</i> In an efficient market, the defendant's misrepresentations are absorbed into, and reflected by, the market price. Investors who rely on the market price, therefore, indirectly rely on those misrepresentations, thereby justifying a presumption of reliance under the fraud-on-the-market theory. Conversely, when a market lacks efficiency, there is no assurance that market price reflects the defendant's misrepresentations and that investors therefore indirectly relied on those misrepresentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

Litig.,</i> No. 00-11649-RWZ, at 6 (D.Mass. Sept. 30, 2004) (unpublished opinion). This definition of market efficiency does not provide explicitly that market price must \"fully\" reflect \"all\" available information, the standard set forth in <i>PolyMedica.</i> However, the district court's reliance upon <i>Cammer</i> to determine whether the Xcelera market was efficient means that it necessarily applied the standard of efficiency used in <i>Cammer,</i> which tracks the definition we adopted in <i>PolyMedica. See Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1281 (stating that an efficient market is one in which \"current price reflects all available information,\" and citing economic commentator Eugene Fama's definition of market efficiency as \"[a] market in which prices always `fully reflect' available information\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, Defendants argue that the district court's definition of an efficient market is incomplete. Missing from the court's definition, Defendants assert, is a requirement that in an efficient market, \"stock prices <i>rapidly</i> and <i>accurately</i> reflect all publicly available information.\" (Emphasis added.) Because of these omissions, Defendants argue, the district court wrongfully concluded that Xcelera's market was efficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

Therefore, where, as here, the district court correctly determined that market price must fully reflect all publicly available information for purposes of defining market efficiency, the district court understood that market price must \"rapidly\" reflect such information in an efficient market. Moreover, the district court's reliance upon <i>Cammer,</i> which emphasized the importance of an efficient market \"rapidly reflect[ing] new information in price,\" 711 F.Supp. at 1276 n. 17, again indicates that the district court understood that an efficient market rapidly absorbs and reflects new information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Accurately</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that an efficient market must also respond to information accurately. According to their expert witness, Richardson, an efficient market \"accurately\" reflects all publicly available information when \"investors [are] rational and fac[e] no trading frictions such that stock prices equal their `fundamental value.'\" Accuracy, Richardson argues, thus hinges upon a stock price's consistency with its fundamental value, which, in turn, hinges upon the market behaving rationally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elaborating further, Richardson explains that \"fundamental value is the discounted sum of expected future cash profits of the stock.\" In an efficient market, Richardson states, information should \"tell you something about ... the expected cash flow of the asset or the risk of that asset[,] and that information should get incorporated into that price.\" Richardson argues that \"fundamental, or true, value\" does not, however, mean \"ultimate future value,\" such that \"investors [must] be fortune tellers.\" Rather, it means a \"fair price\" that \"incorporates all the information currently available to investors,\" such that price adjustments are \"accurate on average: the prices should neither underreact nor overreact to particular news announcements.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But investors are not always rational, Richardson contends; the presence of irrational investors in the market causes prices \"to diverg[e] from fundamentals.\" The decisions of these irrational investors, Richardson argues, \"begin to move prices away from their fundamental value\" &#8212; away from expected risks and returns &#8212; \"meaning they're not reflecting the information in a rational way.\" Richardson acknowledges, however, that the presence of these irrational investors \"is not enough per se to refute the hypothesis that the market is efficient.\" On the contrary, \"prices will eventually adjust until the mispricings disappear,\" so long as there are a sufficient number of rational investors active in the market, and provided that these rational investors are not limited in their ability \"to take advantage of, or `arbitrage,' these mispricings\" by \"purchas[ing] the underpriced securities (i.e., relative to fundamental value) and sell[ing] the overpriced ones to the irrational investors.\" Thus, in order \"for prices to not accurately reflect fundamental information,\" Richardson contends, \"there must be a reason why asset prices diverged from fundamentals, e.g., the presence of irrational investors ... and [] there must be some limits to arbitrage that prevent rational capital from forcing prices and fundamental value to converge.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Plaintiffs insist that \"accuracy\" should be excluded from the definition of efficiency. According to Hakala, their expert, a market is efficient when \"all relevant and publicly available information is impounded in share price.\" By requiring that market price \"accurately\" reflect public information, Hakala argues that Defendants are advocating \"a higher standard\" of market efficiency imposed by academics, which demands that markets must behave rationally so that stock prices will \"always conform to some idealized fundamental value that is demonstrated in retrospect.\" Hakala contends that market efficiency demands only that market price \"reflects all public information\" so that \"an average investor wo[n't] ordinarily be able to beat the market.... It doesn't say anything about whether the market was right or wrong in retrospect....\" According to Hakala, \"[Richardson's] analysis confuses market efficiency with a level of hyper-rationality or perfect foresight on the part of market participants that is unrealistic and not required for a presumption of fraud-on-the-market.\" This analysis, Hakala contends, \"amounts to second-guessing the market, concluding that the market, in retrospect ... [was] over-valued.\" In response to arguments raised by the parties in <i>PolyMedica,</i> we have already resolved this debate in favor of Plaintiffs. As we explained in <i>PolyMedica,</i> the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance does not depend on the accuracy of the market price, and whether it \"mirror[s] the best possible estimates, in light of all available information, of the actual economic values of securities in terms of their expected risks and returns.\" ___ F.3d at ___. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, this presumption depends on whether the market price of the stock reflects all available information, such that an investor can be deemed to have indirectly relied on the misrepresentation. Whether the stock was \"worth\" more or less in some fundamental value sense, while arguably relevant to the efficiency inquiry, is not essential to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in <i>PolyMedica,</i> \"[w]hile fundamental value efficiency may be the more comprehensive of the two concepts, encompassing both speed <i>and</i> accuracy, [e]fficiency is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We explained that \"for purposes of establishing the presumption of reliance, therefore, investors need only show that the market was informationally efficient,\" not fundamental value efficient. <i>Id.; see also id.</i> (stating that \"the fraud-on-the-market theory does not require `proof that the market correctly reflects' some `fundamental value' of the security. To apply the fraud-on-the-market theory, it is sufficient that the market for a security be `efficient' only in the sense that market prices reflect the available information about the security'\") (quoting <i>In re VeriFone Sec.

In fact, as we noted in <i>PolyMedica,</i> the Supreme Court in <i>Basic</i> declined to explicitly address the meaning of market efficiency &#8212; much less a fundamental value theory of market efficiency &#8212; stating that, \"[w]e do not intend conclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Basic,</i> 485 U.S. at 249 n. 28, 108 S.Ct. 978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the district court, abetted by Plaintiffs' expert, misconstrued \"accuracy\" to mean that the Xcelera market must \"correctly predict\" what the fundamental value of the security (i.e., \"the discounted sum of expected future cash profits of the stock\") will be in the future. On the contrary, Defendants argue, \"accuracy\" means only that a stock's price will reflect its fundamental value \"at any given moment.\" This is a disingenuous argument. Like any lawsuit, the securities fraud action involves the recreation of past events through proof. Proof of fundamental value \"at any given moment\" would necessarily be a retrospective analysis which, in the words of Hakala, \"amounts to second-guessing the market, concluding that the market, in retrospect ... [was] over-valued.\" If this retrospective judgment was that the stock price at a given moment was over-valued, that judgment would be tantamount to the conclusion that the stock price was a poor predictor of what subsequent analysis would reveal about fundamental value at that given moment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the district court's determination that, pursuant to Defendants' definition of market efficiency, \"a robust stock market would always present a defense at the class certification stage and on the merits that depends on highly subjective, retrospective analysis of what people trading in a stock should have been thinking.\" The court's reference to \"retrospective analysis\" is not incorrect. The present-day analysis of the fundamental value of Xcelera's assets by Defendants' expert during the Class Period is necessarily \"retrospective.\" In addition, we find no error in the court's rejection of Defendants' expert's \"suggest[ion] that market efficiency is a rare phenomenon.\" Defendants' expert conceded that \"[t]he Internet sector as a whole, at least the 400 sample firms,\" was inefficient \"in aggregate,\" and relied on an economic treatise whose author concluded that \"financial markets in most scenarios are not expected to be efficient. Market efficiency only emerges as an extreme special case, unlikely to hold under plausible circumstances.\" (Citing Andrei Shleifer, <i>Inefficient Markets: An Introduction to Behavioral Finance</i> 24 (2000).) This emphasis on the rarity of efficient markets, grounded in the concept of fundamental value efficiency, would have the likely effect of making it unduly difficult to establish the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was right to worry about these implications of Defendants' efficiency arguments; it did not err by rejecting Defendants' proposed definition of market efficiency requiring consistency with fundamental value. By drawing on the standard of efficiency in <i>Cammer</i> and holding that \"a share's market price [must] reflect publicly available information, not ... perfectly and correctly incorporate it,\" the district court adopted the correct standard of efficiency. We must now decide whether the court correctly applied this standard in determining that the Xcelera market was efficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Level of Inquiry</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating whether the Xcelera market was efficient, the district court considered the \"persuasive and widely followed\" factors enumerated in <i>Cammer. Xcelera,</i> No. 00-11649-RWZ, at 5. These factors are: (1) the stock's average trading volume; (2) the number of securities analysts that followed and reported on the stock; (3) the presence of market makers and arbitrageurs; (4) the company's eligibility to file a Form S-3 Registration Statement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>; and (5) a cause-and-effect relationship, over time, between unexpected corporate events or financial releases and an immediate response in stock price. <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1286-87. These factors provide useful evidence from which market efficiency may be inferred, and are therefore relevant to a district court's determination of whether a market is efficient. As we noted in <i>PolyMedica,</i> however, these factors are not exhaustive. ___ F.3d at ___ (citing <i>Unger,</i> 401 F.3d at 323, 325 (noting that <i>Cammer</i> factors are not exhaustive, and are \"an analytical tool,\" not \"a checklist\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crediting Plaintiffs' expert analysis, the district court concluded, without further discussion of the factors, \"that the stock's trading volume was high; Xcelera received the attention of the press and analysts as well as the participation of sophisticated investors; there were no undue limits to arbitrage, and that the stock price did respond to information.\" <i>Xcelera,</i> No. 2002 WL 745835 at 5. Plaintiffs argue that the district court correctly determined that these factors were satisfied and that the Xcelera market was therefore efficient. Defendants contend that the district court's concise analysis of market efficiency is inconsistent with the searching inquiry demanded by Rule 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. As Plaintiffs point out, the district court received and reviewed hundreds of pages of briefing and exhibits focused on the issue of market efficiency, received multiple affidavits from experts on both sides and heard two days of testimony from those experts and arguments from counsel regarding market efficiency. In holding that Xcelera's market was efficient, the court specifically credited the testimony of Plaintiffs' expert over that of Defendants' expert, noting Xcelera's satisfaction of the <i>Cammer</i> factors and rejecting Defendants' evidence that market price did not \"perfectly and correctly\" incorporate publicly available information. This is not a case where the district court \"simply presumed the facts in favor of an efficient market\" based on \"bare allegations\" raised in the plaintiff's complaint. <i>Unger,</i> 401 F.3d at 323, 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court properly \"engaged in a case-specific analysis that went well beyond the pleadings,\" weighing the competing evidence concerning market efficiency and offering a succinct explanation of its determination that the fraud-on-the-market presumption should apply to this class action. <i>PolyMedica,</i> 2005 WL 3384083 (quoting <i>Waste Mgmt. Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray,</i> 208 F.3d 288, 297 (1st Cir.2000)). The district court was not required to explain itself in greater detail. The more important issue is whether the evidence supports its determination to apply the presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The <i>Cammer</i> Factors</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Cause-and-Effect Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the fifth, and in many ways, the most important, <i>Cammer</i> factor, Plaintiffs contend that the district court correctly found a historical cause-and-effect relationship between company disclosures and an immediate response in stock price. This relationship is, of course, \"the essence of an efficient market and the foundation for the fraud on the market theory.\" <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1287. In the absence of such a relationship, there is little assurance that information is being absorbed into the market and reflected in its price. To demonstrate the existence of a cause-and-effect relationship between corporate information and stock price, Plaintiffs' expert presented the results of a sophisticated event study analyzing how Xcelera stock price reacted to company-specific events.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Plaintiffs' study lists more than forty separate instances, thirty-six of which occurred during the Class Period, in which Xcelera stock price rose or fell (in several cases, by more than 50%, and in one case, rose by more than 100%) within one day<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> of the release of company-specific information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For instance, on April 1, 1999, Xcelera's stock price increased 194% following an announcement that Xcelera had purchased a majority interest in Mirror Image that day; on December 21, 1999, following the announcement of Hewlett-Packard's $32 million investment in Xcelera that day, Xcelera's stock increased 20%; a glowing report in the Gilder Technology Report on February 12, 2000 caused Xcelera stock price to increase 42% on that day; and on July 13, 2000, the day Lazard Freres released a negative analyst report on Xcelera, the stock price dropped 19%. Conversely, Plaintiffs' expert also found that re-releases of old information, such as secondary announcements about acquisitions or new investments, resulted in only a modest stock price reaction or no reaction at all. Based on these findings, Plaintiffs' expert concluded that the Xcelera market reacted strongly &#8212; both positively and negatively &#8212; to new information concerning the company (including, but not limited to, disclosures at issue in this case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' reliance upon various news events to demonstrate this cause-and-effect relationship was an exercise in post-hoc logic. In support of this argument, Defendants cite to the Fifth Circuit's decision in <i>Unger,</i> in which the court concluded that such post-hoc reasoning, without supporting expert statistical analysis, failed to take into account the many other factors that could affect stock price. 401 F.3d at 324. In that case, however, the plaintiffs offered only \"sketchy\" evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship, including \"one-sided affidavits, and unexplained Internet printouts,\" and provided no expert statistical evidence whatsoever. <i>Id.</i> at 320, 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that in this case, by contrast, Plaintiffs' expert submitted an event study which \"sought to identify all or nearly all of the news and information\" pertaining to Xcelera &#8212; whether \"statistically significant\" or not &#8212; \"in the form of published articles, press releases, reports, news bulletins and financial filings of Xcelera,\" for the proposed Class Period. As noted above, in addition to this company-specific information, Plaintiffs' event study included a determination of how Xcelera stock price reacted to general-market and industry-specific information, the kind of information the court found lacking in <i>Unger. Id.</i> at 325 (stating that statistical evidence touching on \"the daily market average; national, local and industry-specific economic news; [and] competitors' activities\" may be helpful to determination of efficiency). Plaintiffs' expert also supported his event study with two affidavits, and provided testimony at a two-day hearing devoted, in part, to the findings of the event study.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Stock's Average Trading Volume</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs presented evidence that the average weekly trading volume for Xcelera stock, that is, the number of outstanding shares being traded on a weekly basis, was high. A high average weekly trading volume suggests market efficiency since it implies \"significant investor interest in the company\" and \"a likelihood that many investors are executing trades on the basis of newly available or disseminated corporate information.\" <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1286. Plaintiffs demonstrated that the average daily trading volume for Xcelera stock exceeded 1,000,000 shares per day throughout the Class Period. Put another way, the average daily trading volume represented more than 4% of approximately 27.5 million total outstanding shares &#8212; well above the 1% or 2% figures suggested by several courts as the benchmark for supporting a presumption of efficiency. <i>See, e.g., O'Neil v. Appel,</i> 165 F.R.D. 479, 508 (W.D.Mich.1996); <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1293.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs overstate the trading volume of Xcelera shares by using split-adjusted shares<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> as opposed to the smaller number of actual (unadjusted) shares. For instance, Defendants object to Plaintiffs' calculation of the daily trading volume for August 10, 1999 using the 9,600 split-adjusted shares traded that day, instead of the only 400 unadjusted shares traded that day. Yet Defendants do not cite any authority for the proposition that Plaintiffs may not adjust for stock splits in order to derive a uniform trading volume for the Class Period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Number of Securities Analysts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties agree that the greater the number of securities analysts following and reporting on a company's stock, the greater the likelihood that information released by a company is being relied upon by investors. As the court in <i>Cammer</i> noted, the existence of a significant number of analysts implies that company reports are \"closely reviewed by investment professionals, who would in turn make buy/sell recommendations to client investors.\" 711 F.Supp. at 1286. The parties also agree that only one analyst followed Xcelera's stock and issued only one report during the Class Period &#8212; far fewer than the fifteen research reports on the company at issue in <i>Cammer,</i> whose market was found to be efficient, <i>id.</i> at 1283.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that one analyst is not enough, <i>see O'Neil,</i> 165 F.R.D. at 501 (stating that \"[m]ajor corporations are closely followed by hundreds of securities analysts throughout the country\"), and that the news coverage relied upon by Plaintiffs was more \"journalistic commentary\" than the kind of \"analysis that would help investors understand the published information about the company and invest on that basis.\" In addition, Defendants argue that the Xcelera market lacked the presence of sophisticated institutional investors who \"search out, distill, trade on, and disseminate information affecting an issuer\" and who are thus vital to an efficient market. <i>See Lehocky,</i> 220 F.R.D. at 508 (crediting plaintiff's expert's assertion that \"there is a general understanding that a high level of institutional interest in a security serves to increase the efficiency of the market\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the presence of only one securities analyst, Plaintiffs contend that information about Xcelera was widely distributed through \"news articles, press releases, television interviews and the Company's SEC filings,\" and indirect coverage from numerous influential brokerage firms reporting on other Internet and technology stocks. This media attention, Plaintiffs argue, more than made up for the lack of securities analysts. <i>See Cheney v. Cyberguard Corp.,</i> 213 F.R.D. 484, 499 (S.D.Fla.2003) (stating that significant number of news items featuring defendant company \"indicat[ed] that information regarding [the company] may have been widely distributed, which would support a finding of efficiency\"). In addition, in response to Defendants' charge that the Xcelera market lacked institutional investors, Plaintiffs point to the fact that two major institutions &#8212; Hewlett Packard and Exodus Communications &#8212; made significant investments in Xcelera, and that for the last six months of the Class Period, at least thirty other institutional investors also invested in Xcelera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Number of Market-Makers and Arbitrageurs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A market-maker is \"[o]ne who helps establish a market for securities by reporting bid-and-asked quotations\" (the price a buyer will pay for a security and the price a seller will sell a security), Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed.2004), and who \"stand[s] ready to buy or sell at these publicly quoted prices,\" <i>Lehocky,</i> 220 F.R.D. at 508 n. 24. According to Plaintiffs' expert, a market-maker, more particularly, \"is a brokerage firm or special securities firm that actively buys and sells stocks on its own account with the intention of holding them for a relatively short period of time so as to make a market.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the court in <i>Cammer</i> found that market-makers (and arbitrageurs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>) contribute to market efficiency by \"react[ing] swiftly to company news and reported financial results by buying or selling stock and driving it to a changed price level,\" 711 F.Supp. at 1287, Defendants argue that the mere existence of market-makers, without more, is not meaningful. <i>See O'Neil,</i> 165 F.R.D. at 502 (stating that \"it is impossible to accord much significance to the number of market makers, until one knows the volume of shares that they committed to trade, the volume of shares they actually traded, and the prices at which they did so\"); <i>see also id.</i> (noting that \"the economic literature has criticized reliance upon the number of marker makers as an indicator of efficiency,\" and citing study which found \"no empirical correlation between the number of market makers and the efficiency of the market\"). Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' evidence establishes only the presence of market-makers in the Xcelera market, not whether they in fact contributed to market efficiency by \"buying or selling Xcelera's stock and driving it to a price reflective of all information bearing on value.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that more than twenty market-makers participated in the market for Xcelera stock, with seven market-makers trading over one million shares each in the final quarter of the Class Period. They say that this evidence demonstrates not only that there was a sufficient number of market-makers present to facilitate trading, <i>see, e.g., Cheney,</i> 213 F.R.D. 484, 500 (S.D.Fla.2003) (holding that presence of between fifteen and nineteen market-makers weighed in favor of finding of market efficiency) (citing <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1283 n. 30 (finding that presence of eleven market-makers weighed in favor of efficiency)), but also that these market-makers were in fact conducting trades in significant volume.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

As we have already noted, \"the determination of whether a market is efficient is a fact-dominated inquiry. Therefore, deferential clear-error review applies to that determination.\" The district court was entitled to resolve the evidentiary conflicts in favor of Plaintiffs.

Defendants argue that even if the <i>Cammer</i> factors were met, the district court should have concluded that Xcelera's market was inefficient based on other factors rejected by the court. According to Defendants, the district court erroneously applied the <i>Cammer</i> factors in isolation, rather than viewing them as part of a broader analysis of the structure of the Xcelera market. \"[T]he ultimate question of market efficiency,\" Defendants argue, \"is structural, and [the <i>Cammer</i> factors] are only partial indicators of market structure.\" In order to determine whether the Xcelera market was efficient, Defendants argue that the district court should have analyzed whether Xcelera's market behaved \"rationally\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that Xcelera's market was dominated by irrational investors \"not basing their decisions on analysis... of the fundamental value of the stock in light of all currently available information.\" Defendants further contend that constraints on short sales in the Xcelera market prevented arbitrageurs from acting on analyses that \"push[] prices into line with all information bearing on the security's fundamental value.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Lastly, Defendants argue that Xcelera's stock price behaved irrationally &#8212; reaching levels \"that were orders of magnitude too high, based on any possible range of future earnings growth, to be consistent with an efficient market\"; reacting to \"minor\" developments in ways greatly disproportionate to the economic significance of such developments; and \"fluctuat[ing] wildly\" throughout the Class Period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in <i>PolyMedica,</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he question of how much evidence of efficiency is necessary in order for a court to accept the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance at the class-certification stage is ... one of degree. District courts must draw these lines sensibly, mindful of the fact that while evidence of fundamental value may be relevant to the determination of informational efficiency, other more accessible and manageable evidence may be sufficient at the certification stage to establish the basic facts that permit a court to apply the fraud-on-the-market presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">___ F.3d at ___. Here, focusing on the <i>Cammer</i> factors, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs demonstrated the basic facts necessary to justify a presumption of reliance at the class-certification stage. The court's determination that \"Defendant's [sic] expert focuses too much on the rationality of the market, as opposed to its efficiency,\" was an appropriate exercise of its discretion. <i>Xcelera,</i> 2002 WL 745835 at 5. As discussed above, for purposes of establishing the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance, market efficiency does not require that a market be \"rational, i.e., consistent with fundamental value.\" While evidence of irrationality in the Xcelera market &#8212; i.e., the presence of irrational investors and limits to arbitrage which prevented market price from reflecting fundamental value &#8212; may have been \"relevant to the extent it raises questions about informational efficiency,\" the district court did not err in finding \"other more accessible and manageable evidence\" sufficient to establish the presumption of reliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's consideration of four of the <i>Cammer</i> factors, and its rejection of the rationality factors advanced by Defendants, was thus proper for purposes of determining market efficiency. Because there is no \"magic number\" of factors for determining efficiency, we leave it to the district court in the first instance to decide which factors and how many factors it will consider, emphasizing that the ultimate efficiency determination is subject to clear error review. Obviously, if the district court considers too few factors or too little evidence, the determination will not survive clear error review.

For example, Xcelera's 2-for-1 stock split on September 30, 1999 would have given an owner of 100 shares of Xcelera stock a total of 200 shares, or two shares for each share previously owned.

Defendants-Appellants Xcelera Inc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, an Internet holding company, and its directors, Alexander and Gustav Vik (collectively, \"Defendants\"), argue that the district court erred in determining that the market for Xcelera stock was efficient during the relevant time period, and certifying the class on that basis.

(\"Mirror Image\"), an Internet holding company. More press releases and television appearances followed throughout the Class Period, touting Xcelera's ownership of Mirror Image. Defendants allegedly did not disclose, however, that this acquisition was part of a joint venture with two other companies, Kahnberget Holding, Ltd., and JAM Investments, Ltd. (collectively, \"JAM\"), both of which had contributed a substantial portion of the funds used to acquire the majority interest, $3.24 million, and which were therefore entitled to a significant portion of the Mirror Image stock pursuant to their joint-venture agreement. Defendants also allegedly did not disclose the risk of dilution<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to Xcelera shareholders should Defendants decide to issue Xcelera stock in satisfaction of its obligation to JAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that it was not until August 4, 2000 &#8212; when Xcelera issued its Annual Report for that year &#8212; that Xcelera shareholders first learned that Xcelera might be required to issue new shares of its stock to \"certain third parties\" in order to pay for its investment in Mirror Image, and that this may, in turn, result in a material dilution of Xcelera stock. That same day, the price of Xcelera's stock fell by 2.5%, from $12.31 to $12 per share. Several days later, after a brief rise in stock price on August 7, the price of Xcelera stock fell again, this time by approximately 16%, from $14 on August 8, 2000, to $11.75 on August 9, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 2, 2001, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, alleging that Defendants artificially inflated the price of Xcelera stock during the Class Period by failing to disclose the ownership dispute surrounding the Mirror Image stock and the risk of dilution of Xcelera stock. The complaint further alleged that Alexander and Gustav Vik made insider sales of over 3.2 million shares of Xcelera stock to the unknowing public during the Class Period, reaping proceeds of over $250 million. Plaintiffs seek damages against Defendants under &#167; 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b) (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5, and against Alexander and Gustav Vik under &#167; 20(a) and &#167; 20A of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a), &#167; 78t-1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 12, 2002, Plaintiffs filed a motion for certification of the class and the insider trading subclass pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and (b)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In order to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3)'s requirement that common questions of law and fact predominate over individual questions, Plaintiffs relied upon the \"fraud-on-the-market\" presumption of reliance. Defendants opposed the motion, arguing that Plaintiffs were not entitled to a presumption of reliance because the market was not \"efficient\" &#8212; a prerequisite for presuming reliance. In support of this position, Defendants submitted the affidavit of Dr. Matthew P.

Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argued that while efficiency requires that market price reflect all material, publicly available information \"relatively rapidly or within a reasonable period of time,\" the market price need not reflect such information accurately.

Given the various factors relevant to an efficiency determination, and the abundant evidence that can be developed with respect to each factor, the determination of whether a market is efficient is a fact-dominated inquiry.

Individual issues of reliance would necessarily overwhelm the common ones. The fraud-on-the-market theory eliminates the need to prove individualized reliance by allowing a rebuttable presumption that the plaintiff relied on the \"integrity of the market price\" which reflected the misrepresentation. \"Before an investor can be presumed to have relied upon the integrity of the market price, however, the market must be `efficient.'\" <i>Id.</i> In an efficient market, the defendant's misrepresentations are absorbed into, and reflected by, the market price. Investors who rely on the market price, therefore, indirectly rely on those misrepresentations, thereby justifying a presumption of reliance under the fraud-on-the-market theory. Conversely, when a market lacks efficiency, there is no assurance that market price reflects the defendant's misrepresentations and that investors therefore indirectly relied on those misrepresentations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The District Court's Standard of Efficiency</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the district court, an efficient market is one in which \"market price reflect[s] publicly available information.\" <i>In re: Xcelera.Com Sec. Litig.,</i> No. 00-11649-RWZ, at 6 (D.Mass. Sept. 30, 2004) (unpublished opinion). This definition of market efficiency does not provide explicitly that market price must \"fully\" reflect \"all\" available information, the standard set forth in <i>PolyMedica.</i> However, the district court's reliance upon <i>Cammer</i> to determine whether the Xcelera market was efficient means that it necessarily applied the standard of efficiency used in <i>Cammer,</i> which tracks the definition we adopted in <i>PolyMedica. See Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1281 (stating that an efficient market is one in which \"current price reflects all available information,\" and citing economic commentator Eugene Fama's definition of market efficiency as \"[a] market in which prices always `fully reflect' available information\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, Defendants argue that the district court's definition of an efficient market is incomplete. Missing from the court's definition, Defendants assert, is a requirement that in an efficient market, \"stock prices <i>rapidly</i> and <i>accurately</i> reflect all publicly available information.\" (Emphasis added.) Because of these omissions, Defendants argue, the district court wrongfully concluded that Xcelera's market was efficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

Therefore, where, as here, the district court correctly determined that market price must fully reflect all publicly available information for purposes of defining market efficiency, the district court understood that market price must \"rapidly\" reflect such information in an efficient market. Moreover, the district court's reliance upon <i>Cammer,</i> which emphasized the importance of an efficient market \"rapidly reflect[ing] new information in price,\" 711 F.Supp. at 1276 n. 17, again indicates that the district court understood that an efficient market rapidly absorbs and reflects new information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Accurately</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that an efficient market must also respond to information accurately. According to their expert witness, Richardson, an efficient market \"accurately\" reflects all publicly available information when \"investors [are] rational and fac[e] no trading frictions such that stock prices equal their `fundamental value.'\" Accuracy, Richardson argues, thus hinges upon a stock price's consistency with its fundamental value, which, in turn, hinges upon the market behaving rationally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elaborating further, Richardson explains that \"fundamental value is the discounted sum of expected future cash profits of the stock.\" In an efficient market, Richardson states, information should \"tell you something about ... the expected cash flow of the asset or the risk of that asset[,] and that information should get incorporated into that price.\" Richardson argues that \"fundamental, or true, value\" does not, however, mean \"ultimate future value,\" such that \"investors [must] be fortune tellers.\" Rather, it means a \"fair price\" that \"incorporates all the information currently available to investors,\" such that price adjustments are \"accurate on average: the prices should neither underreact nor overreact to particular news announcements.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But investors are not always rational, Richardson contends; the presence of irrational investors in the market causes prices \"to diverg[e] from fundamentals.\" The decisions of these irrational investors, Richardson argues, \"begin to move prices away from their fundamental value\" &#8212; away from expected risks and returns &#8212; \"meaning they're not reflecting the information in a rational way.\" Richardson acknowledges, however, that the presence of these irrational investors \"is not enough per se to refute the hypothesis that the market is efficient.\" On the contrary, \"prices will eventually adjust until the mispricings disappear,\" so long as there are a sufficient number of rational investors active in the market, and provided that these rational investors are not limited in their ability \"to take advantage of, or `arbitrage,' these mispricings\" by \"purchas[ing] the underpriced securities (i.e., relative to fundamental value) and sell[ing] the overpriced ones to the irrational investors.\" Thus, in order \"for prices to not accurately reflect fundamental information,\" Richardson contends, \"there must be a reason why asset prices diverged from fundamentals, e.g., the presence of irrational investors ... and [] there must be some limits to arbitrage that prevent rational capital from forcing prices and fundamental value to converge.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, Plaintiffs insist that \"accuracy\" should be excluded from the definition of efficiency. According to Hakala, their expert, a market is efficient when \"all relevant and publicly available information is impounded in share price.\" By requiring that market price \"accurately\" reflect public information, Hakala argues that Defendants are advocating \"a higher standard\" of market efficiency imposed by academics, which demands that markets must behave rationally so that stock prices will \"always conform to some idealized fundamental value that is demonstrated in retrospect.\" Hakala contends that market efficiency demands only that market price \"reflects all public information\" so that \"an average investor wo[n't] ordinarily be able to beat the market.... It doesn't say anything about whether the market was right or wrong in retrospect....\" According to Hakala, \"[Richardson's] analysis confuses market efficiency with a level of hyper-rationality or perfect foresight on the part of market participants that is unrealistic and not required for a presumption of fraud-on-the-market.\" This analysis, Hakala contends, \"amounts to second-guessing the market, concluding that the market, in retrospect ... [was] over-valued.\" In response to arguments raised by the parties in <i>PolyMedica,</i> we have already resolved this debate in favor of Plaintiffs. As we explained in <i>PolyMedica,</i> the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance does not depend on the accuracy of the market price, and whether it \"mirror[s] the best possible estimates, in light of all available information, of the actual economic values of securities in terms of their expected risks and returns.\" ___ F.3d at ___. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, this presumption depends on whether the market price of the stock reflects all available information, such that an investor can be deemed to have indirectly relied on the misrepresentation. Whether the stock was \"worth\" more or less in some fundamental value sense, while arguably relevant to the efficiency inquiry, is not essential to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in <i>PolyMedica,</i> \"[w]hile fundamental value efficiency may be the more comprehensive of the two concepts, encompassing both speed <i>and</i> accuracy, [e]fficiency is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We explained that \"for purposes of establishing the presumption of reliance, therefore, investors need only show that the market was informationally efficient,\" not fundamental value efficient. <i>Id.; see also id.</i> (stating that \"the fraud-on-the-market theory does not require `proof that the market correctly reflects' some `fundamental value' of the security. To apply the fraud-on-the-market theory, it is sufficient that the market for a security be `efficient' only in the sense that market prices reflect the available information about the security'\") (quoting <i>In re VeriFone Sec.

In fact, as we noted in <i>PolyMedica,</i> the Supreme Court in <i>Basic</i> declined to explicitly address the meaning of market efficiency &#8212; much less a fundamental value theory of market efficiency &#8212; stating that, \"[w]e do not intend conclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and completely publicly available information is reflected in market price.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Basic,</i> 485 U.S. at 249 n. 28, 108 S.Ct. 978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that the district court, abetted by Plaintiffs' expert, misconstrued \"accuracy\" to mean that the Xcelera market must \"correctly predict\" what the fundamental value of the security (i.e., \"the discounted sum of expected future cash profits of the stock\") will be in the future. On the contrary, Defendants argue, \"accuracy\" means only that a stock's price will reflect its fundamental value \"at any given moment.\" This is a disingenuous argument. Like any lawsuit, the securities fraud action involves the recreation of past events through proof. Proof of fundamental value \"at any given moment\" would necessarily be a retrospective analysis which, in the words of Hakala, \"amounts to second-guessing the market, concluding that the market, in retrospect ... [was] over-valued.\" If this retrospective judgment was that the stock price at a given moment was over-valued, that judgment would be tantamount to the conclusion that the stock price was a poor predictor of what subsequent analysis would reveal about fundamental value at that given moment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the district court's determination that, pursuant to Defendants' definition of market efficiency, \"a robust stock market would always present a defense at the class certification stage and on the merits that depends on highly subjective, retrospective analysis of what people trading in a stock should have been thinking.\" The court's reference to \"retrospective analysis\" is not incorrect. The present-day analysis of the fundamental value of Xcelera's assets by Defendants' expert during the Class Period is necessarily \"retrospective.\" In addition, we find no error in the court's rejection of Defendants' expert's \"suggest[ion] that market efficiency is a rare phenomenon.\" Defendants' expert conceded that \"[t]he Internet sector as a whole, at least the 400 sample firms,\" was inefficient \"in aggregate,\" and relied on an economic treatise whose author concluded that \"financial markets in most scenarios are not expected to be efficient. Market efficiency only emerges as an extreme special case, unlikely to hold under plausible circumstances.\" (Citing Andrei Shleifer, <i>Inefficient Markets: An Introduction to Behavioral Finance</i> 24 (2000).) This emphasis on the rarity of efficient markets, grounded in the concept of fundamental value efficiency, would have the likely effect of making it unduly difficult to establish the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was right to worry about these implications of Defendants' efficiency arguments; it did not err by rejecting Defendants' proposed definition of market efficiency requiring consistency with fundamental value. By drawing on the standard of efficiency in <i>Cammer</i> and holding that \"a share's market price [must] reflect publicly available information, not ... perfectly and correctly incorporate it,\" the district court adopted the correct standard of efficiency. We must now decide whether the court correctly applied this standard in determining that the Xcelera market was efficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Level of Inquiry</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating whether the Xcelera market was efficient, the district court considered the \"persuasive and widely followed\" factors enumerated in <i>Cammer. Xcelera,</i> No. 00-11649-RWZ, at 5. These factors are: (1) the stock's average trading volume; (2) the number of securities analysts that followed and reported on the stock; (3) the presence of market makers and arbitrageurs; (4) the company's eligibility to file a Form S-3 Registration Statement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>; and (5) a cause-and-effect relationship, over time, between unexpected corporate events or financial releases and an immediate response in stock price. <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1286-87. These factors provide useful evidence from which market efficiency may be inferred, and are therefore relevant to a district court's determination of whether a market is efficient. As we noted in <i>PolyMedica,</i> however, these factors are not exhaustive. ___ F.3d at ___ (citing <i>Unger,</i> 401 F.3d at 323, 325 (noting that <i>Cammer</i> factors are not exhaustive, and are \"an analytical tool,\" not \"a checklist\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crediting Plaintiffs' expert analysis, the district court concluded, without further discussion of the factors, \"that the stock's trading volume was high; Xcelera received the attention of the press and analysts as well as the participation of sophisticated investors; there were no undue limits to arbitrage, and that the stock price did respond to information.\" <i>Xcelera,</i> No. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">745835</span></span> at 5. Plaintiffs argue that the district court correctly determined that these factors were satisfied and that the Xcelera market was therefore efficient. Defendants contend that the district court's concise analysis of market efficiency is inconsistent with the searching inquiry demanded by Rule 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. As Plaintiffs point out, the district court received and reviewed hundreds of pages of briefing and exhibits focused on the issue of market efficiency, received multiple affidavits from experts on both sides and heard two days of testimony from those experts and arguments from counsel regarding market efficiency. In holding that Xcelera's market was efficient, the court specifically credited the testimony of Plaintiffs' expert over that of Defendants' expert, noting Xcelera's satisfaction of the <i>Cammer</i> factors and rejecting Defendants' evidence that market price did not \"perfectly and correctly\" incorporate publicly available information. This is not a case where the district court \"simply presumed the facts in favor of an efficient market\" based on \"bare allegations\" raised in the plaintiff's complaint. <i>Unger,</i> 401 F.3d at 323, 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court properly \"engaged in a case-specific analysis that went well beyond the pleadings,\" weighing the competing evidence concerning market efficiency and offering a succinct explanation of its determination that the fraud-on-the-market presumption should apply to this class action. <i>PolyMedica,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3384083</span></span> (quoting <i>Waste Mgmt.

The district court was not required to explain itself in greater detail. The more important issue is whether the evidence supports its determination to apply the presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The <i>Cammer</i> Factors</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Cause-and-Effect Relationship</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the fifth, and in many ways, the most important, <i>Cammer</i> factor, Plaintiffs contend that the district court correctly found a historical cause-and-effect relationship between company disclosures and an immediate response in stock price. This relationship is, of course, \"the essence of an efficient market and the foundation for the fraud on the market theory.\" <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1287. In the absence of such a relationship, there is little assurance that information is being absorbed into the market and reflected in its price. To demonstrate the existence of a cause-and-effect relationship between corporate information and stock price, Plaintiffs' expert presented the results of a sophisticated event study analyzing how Xcelera stock price reacted to company-specific events.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Plaintiffs' study lists more than forty separate instances, thirty-six of which occurred during the Class Period, in which Xcelera stock price rose or fell (in several cases, by more than 50%, and in one case, rose by more than 100%) within one day<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> of the release of company-specific information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For instance, on April 1, 1999, Xcelera's stock price increased 194% following an announcement that Xcelera had purchased a majority interest in Mirror Image that day; on December 21, 1999, following the announcement of Hewlett-Packard's $32 million investment in Xcelera that day, Xcelera's stock increased 20%; a glowing report in the Gilder Technology Report on February 12, 2000 caused Xcelera stock price to increase 42% on that day; and on July 13, 2000, the day Lazard Freres released a negative analyst report on Xcelera, the stock price dropped 19%. Conversely, Plaintiffs' expert also found that re-releases of old information, such as secondary announcements about acquisitions or new investments, resulted in only a modest stock price reaction or no reaction at all. Based on these findings, Plaintiffs' expert concluded that the Xcelera market reacted strongly &#8212; both positively and negatively &#8212; to new information concerning the company (including, but not limited to, disclosures at issue in this case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' reliance upon various news events to demonstrate this cause-and-effect relationship was an exercise in post-hoc logic. In support of this argument, Defendants cite to the Fifth Circuit's decision in <i>Unger,</i> in which the court concluded that such post-hoc reasoning, without supporting expert statistical analysis, failed to take into account the many other factors that could affect stock price. 401 F.3d at 324. In that case, however, the plaintiffs offered only \"sketchy\" evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship, including \"one-sided affidavits, and unexplained Internet printouts,\" and provided no expert statistical evidence whatsoever. <i>Id.</i> at 320, 325.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that in this case, by contrast, Plaintiffs' expert submitted an event study which \"sought to identify all or nearly all of the news and information\" pertaining to Xcelera &#8212; whether \"statistically significant\" or not &#8212; \"in the form of published articles, press releases, reports, news bulletins and financial filings of Xcelera,\" for the proposed Class Period. As noted above, in addition to this company-specific information, Plaintiffs' event study included a determination of how Xcelera stock price reacted to general-market and industry-specific information, the kind of information the court found lacking in <i>Unger. Id.</i> at 325 (stating that statistical evidence touching on \"the daily market average; national, local and industry-specific economic news; [and] competitors' activities\" may be helpful to determination of efficiency). Plaintiffs' expert also supported his event study with two affidavits, and provided testimony at a two-day hearing devoted, in part, to the findings of the event study.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Stock's Average Trading Volume</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs presented evidence that the average weekly trading volume for Xcelera stock, that is, the number of outstanding shares being traded on a weekly basis, was high. A high average weekly trading volume suggests market efficiency since it implies \"significant investor interest in the company\" and \"a likelihood that many investors are executing trades on the basis of newly available or disseminated corporate information.\" <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1286. Plaintiffs demonstrated that the average daily trading volume for Xcelera stock exceeded 1,000,000 shares per day throughout the Class Period. Put another way, the average daily trading volume represented more than 4% of approximately 27.5 million total outstanding shares &#8212; well above the 1% or 2% figures suggested by several courts as the benchmark for supporting a presumption of efficiency. <i>See, e.g., O'Neil v. Appel,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></span>, 508 (W.D.Mich.1996); <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1293.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs overstate the trading volume of Xcelera shares by using split-adjusted shares<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> as opposed to the smaller number of actual (unadjusted) shares. For instance, Defendants object to Plaintiffs' calculation of the daily trading volume for August 10, 1999 using the 9,600 split-adjusted shares traded that day, instead of the only 400 unadjusted shares traded that day. Yet Defendants do not cite any authority for the proposition that Plaintiffs may not adjust for stock splits in order to derive a uniform trading volume for the Class Period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Number of Securities Analysts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties agree that the greater the number of securities analysts following and reporting on a company's stock, the greater the likelihood that information released by a company is being relied upon by investors. As the court in <i>Cammer</i> noted, the existence of a significant number of analysts implies that company reports are \"closely reviewed by investment professionals, who would in turn make buy/sell recommendations to client investors.\" 711 F.Supp. at 1286. The parties also agree that only one analyst followed Xcelera's stock and issued only one report during the Class Period &#8212; far fewer than the fifteen research reports on the company at issue in <i>Cammer,</i> whose market was found to be efficient, <i>id.</i> at 1283.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that one analyst is not enough, <i>see O'Neil,</i> 165 F.R.D. at 501 (stating that \"[m]ajor corporations are closely followed by hundreds of securities analysts throughout the country\"), and that the news coverage relied upon by Plaintiffs was more \"journalistic commentary\" than the kind of \"analysis that would help investors understand the published information about the company and invest on that basis.\" In addition, Defendants argue that the Xcelera market lacked the presence of sophisticated institutional investors who \"search out, distill, trade on, and disseminate information affecting an issuer\" and who are thus vital to an efficient market. <i>See Lehocky,</i> 220 F.R.D. at 508 (crediting plaintiff's expert's assertion that \"there is a general understanding that a high level of institutional interest in a security serves to increase the efficiency of the market\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the presence of only one securities analyst, Plaintiffs contend that information about Xcelera was widely distributed through \"news articles, press releases, television interviews and the Company's SEC filings,\" and indirect coverage from numerous influential brokerage firms reporting on other Internet and technology stocks. This media attention, Plaintiffs argue, more than made up for the lack of securities analysts. <i>See Cheney v.

In addition, in response to Defendants' charge that the Xcelera market lacked institutional investors, Plaintiffs point to the fact that two major institutions &#8212; Hewlett Packard and Exodus Communications &#8212; made significant investments in Xcelera, and that for the last six months of the Class Period, at least thirty other institutional investors also invested in Xcelera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4.

According to Plaintiffs' expert, a market-maker, more particularly, \"is a brokerage firm or special securities firm that actively buys and sells stocks on its own account with the intention of holding them for a relatively short period of time so as to make a market.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the court in <i>Cammer</i> found that market-makers (and arbitrageurs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>) contribute to market efficiency by \"react[ing] swiftly to company news and reported financial results by buying or selling stock and driving it to a changed price level,\" 711 F.Supp. at 1287, Defendants argue that the mere existence of market-makers, without more, is not meaningful. <i>See O'Neil,</i> 165 F.R.D. at 502 (stating that \"it is impossible to accord much significance to the number of market makers, until one knows the volume of shares that they committed to trade, the volume of shares they actually traded, and the prices at which they did so\"); <i>see also id.</i> (noting that \"the economic literature has criticized reliance upon the number of marker makers as an indicator of efficiency,\" and citing study which found \"no empirical correlation between the number of market makers and the efficiency of the market\"). Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' evidence establishes only the presence of market-makers in the Xcelera market, not whether they in fact contributed to market efficiency by \"buying or selling Xcelera's stock and driving it to a price reflective of all information bearing on value.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs contend that more than twenty market-makers participated in the market for Xcelera stock, with seven market-makers trading over one million shares each in the final quarter of the Class Period. They say that this evidence demonstrates not only that there was a sufficient number of market-makers present to facilitate trading, <i>see, e.g., Cheney,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></span>, 500 (S.D.Fla.2003) (holding that presence of between fifteen and nineteen market-makers weighed in favor of finding of market efficiency) (citing <i>Cammer,</i> 711 F.Supp. at 1283 n. 30 (finding that presence of eleven market-makers weighed in favor of efficiency)), but also that these market-makers were in fact conducting trades in significant volume.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

As we have already noted, \"the determination of whether a market is efficient is a fact-dominated inquiry. Therefore, deferential clear-error review applies to that determination.\" The district court was entitled to resolve the evidentiary conflicts in favor of Plaintiffs. There was no clear error in the district court's evaluation of the evidence under <i>Cammer.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anticipating the obstacles posed by clear-error review, Defendants attempt to inject into the clear-error analysis an argument that is more akin to a claim of legal error. Defendants argue that even if the <i>Cammer</i> factors were met, the district court should have concluded that Xcelera's market was inefficient based on other factors rejected by the court. According to Defendants, the district court erroneously applied the <i>Cammer</i> factors in isolation, rather than viewing them as part of a broader analysis of the structure of the Xcelera market. \"[T]he ultimate question of market efficiency,\" Defendants argue, \"is structural, and [the <i>Cammer</i> factors] are only partial indicators of market structure.\" In order to determine whether the Xcelera market was efficient, Defendants argue that the district court should have analyzed whether Xcelera's market behaved \"rationally\".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants contend that Xcelera's market was dominated by irrational investors \"not basing their decisions on analysis... of the fundamental value of the stock in light of all currently available information.\" Defendants further contend that constraints on short sales in the Xcelera market prevented arbitrageurs from acting on analyses that \"push[] prices into line with all information bearing on the security's fundamental value.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Lastly, Defendants argue that Xcelera's stock price behaved irrationally &#8212; reaching levels \"that were orders of magnitude too high, based on any possible range of future earnings growth, to be consistent with an efficient market\"; reacting to \"minor\" developments in ways greatly disproportionate to the economic significance of such developments; and \"fluctuat[ing] wildly\" throughout the Class Period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in <i>PolyMedica,</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he question of how much evidence of efficiency is necessary in order for a court to accept the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance at the class-certification stage is ... one of degree. District courts must draw these lines sensibly, mindful of the fact that while evidence of fundamental value may be relevant to the determination of informational efficiency, other more accessible and manageable evidence may be sufficient at the certification stage to establish the basic facts that permit a court to apply the fraud-on-the-market presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">___ F.3d at ___. Here, focusing on the <i>Cammer</i> factors, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs demonstrated the basic facts necessary to justify a presumption of reliance at the class-certification stage. The court's determination that \"Defendant's [sic] expert focuses too much on the rationality of the market, as opposed to its efficiency,\" was an appropriate exercise of its discretion. <i>Xcelera,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">745835</span></span> at 5. As discussed above, for purposes of establishing the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance, market efficiency does not require that a market be \"rational, i.e., consistent with fundamental value.\" While evidence of irrationality in the Xcelera market &#8212; i.e., the presence of irrational investors and limits to arbitrage which prevented market price from reflecting fundamental value &#8212; may have been \"relevant to the extent it raises questions about informational efficiency,\" the district court did not err in finding \"other more accessible and manageable evidence\" sufficient to establish the presumption of reliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's consideration of four of the <i>Cammer</i> factors, and its rejection of the rationality factors advanced by Defendants, was thus proper for purposes of determining market efficiency. Because there is no \"magic number\" of factors for determining efficiency, we leave it to the district court in the first instance to decide which factors and how many factors it will consider, emphasizing that the ultimate efficiency determination is subject to clear error review. Obviously, if the district court considers too few factors or too little evidence, the determination will not survive clear error review. That did not happen here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's order certifying the class and the insider trading subclass is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are taxed against Defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While Plaintiffs (and the case caption) refer to the company involved in this case as \"Xcelera.com, Inc.,\" we refer to the company by the name used by Defendants, \"Xcelera Inc.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of all purchasers of Xcelera stock who purchased stock on the same day or within three trading days after each of Alexander and Gustav Vik's allegedly insider sales, which are said to have taken place on and between February 22, 2000, and June 22, 2000.

According to the event study, this information accounted for a 23% increase in price two days after the announcement, a 25% increase after three days, and a 23% increase after five days. Defendants argue that the two &#8212; and five-day (and presumably, the three-day) windows are inconsistent with the requirement that an efficient market must rapidly reflect all publicly available information. However, because Plaintiffs' event study captures the same-day reaction of Xcelera's stock price to company-specific events, Defendants' arguments concerning the multi-day windows are unavailing<i>See</i> Jonathan R. Macey et al., <i>Lessons from Financial Economics: Materiality, Reliance, and Extending the Reach of Basic v. Levinson,</i> 77 Va.

For example, Xcelera's 2-for-1 stock split on September 30, 1999 would have given an owner of 100 shares of Xcelera stock a total of 200 shares, or two shares for each share previously owned.

As we noted in <i>PolyMedica,</i> \"arbitrageurs\" are professional investors who exploit price differences in different markets by buying and selling identical securities in those markets. <i>Id.</i> While arbitrageurs are distinct from market-makers, who seek to facilitate trading in a particular security, both play an important role in keeping markets efficient.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> In addition, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs offered no evidence whatsoever for the presence of arbitrageurs in the Xcelera market. Defendants contend that the absence of arbitrageurs demonstrates that there were limits on the ability of rational investors to engage in short sales, thereby \"push[ing] prices to incorporate all publicly available information.\" Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' evidence of constraints on short sales relates to rationality, not efficiency, and thus has no place in the<i>Cammer</i> analysis.
