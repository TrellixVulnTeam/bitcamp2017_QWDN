Since 1989, Maine has required all\n\nhospitals to provide free medical services to certain low income\n\npatients under a set of statutes and regulations collectively known\n\nas \"free care laws.\"    See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, §§ 1715,\n\n1716; 10-144-150 Me. Code R. § 1.01 et seq.   Maine's free care laws\n\ndo not reimburse the hospitals for their expenses incurred in\n\ndelivering care to low income patients, and the amount of free care\n\nthat the hospitals must provide is not limited under the statute.\n\n          Separately, Maine pays for the medical treatment provided\n\nto some low income patients through its Medicaid program, called\n\n\"MaineCare.\"   Yet the MaineCare reimbursements fall well below the\n\nhospitals' actual cost of providing medical services.\n\n          Plaintiff Franklin Memorial Hospital (\"FMH\") is a non-\n\nprofit, general acute care hospital located in Farmington, Maine\n\nwith a tradition of voluntarily providing free and reduced price\n\nmedical care to low income patients.     FMH sued Brenda M. Harvey,\n\nthe Maine official charged with enforcing the state's free care\n\nlaws and administering MaineCare.     In a two-count complaint, FMH\n\nsought a declaratory judgment that both Maine's free care laws and\n\nMaineCare are unconstitutional takings of property.    The district\n\ncourt dismissed the count relating to MaineCare and granted summary\n\njudgment to the state official on FMH's takings challenge to the\n\nfree care laws.   We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f                                     I.\n\n            Since July 1, 2007, Maine's free care laws have required\n\nhospitals    to   provide   free   medically   necessary   inpatient   and\n\noutpatient hospital services to Maine residents who earn incomes at\n\nor below 150% of the federal poverty level.1         See 10-144-150 Me.\n\nCode R. §§ 1.01(A), 1.02(C). Under the regulations, \"[n]o hospital\n\nshall deny services to any Maine resident solely because of the\n\ninability of the individual to pay for those services.\"                Id.\n\n§ 1.01(A).    Compliance with the free care laws is not a condition\n\nfor having a license to operate a hospital in Maine.        Instead, the\n\nstate obtains compliance with its free care requirement through a\n\nsystem of fines and enforcement suits brought by the state's\n\nattorney general or any affected patient.        See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 22, § 1715(2).     Maine's free care laws do provide relief to\n\n\n\n     1\n          This is a change from Maine's prior free care scheme,\nwhich set the income qualification at 100% of the federal poverty\nlevel.\n          Historically, Maine law required local towns, not the\nmedical care providers, to bear the cost of medical treatment for\ntheir indigent residents. See Me. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, § 23 (1871)\n(\"A person residing in a place not incorporated, may provide relief\nand medical aid for any person sick, wounded, or dangerously\ninjured, residing in such place . . . and recover the amount\nnecessarily expended of the town where such person had a settlement\n. . . .\"); see also Hutchinson v. Inhabitants of Carthage, 73 A.\n825 (1909) (ordering payment by the town for the cost of medical\ncare rendered to an indigent family with measles).         In 1973,\nMaine's pauper laws were revised and replaced with a system of\nmunicipal    general    assistance    programs,   which    required\nmunicipalities to pay the cost of certain medical expenses for\ntheir indigent residents.      See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22,\n§§ 4301, 4313. These laws remain in effect today.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fhospitals for which compliance with the regulations would have\n\nruinous financial consequences.    Specifically, in any legal action\n\nbrought to enforce Maine's free care laws, the hospital may avoid\n\nliability by showing that its \"economic viability . . . would be\n\njeopardized by compliance.\"   Id. § 1715(2)(D).\n\n          The parties agree that Maine's free care laws are unique\n\nin that\n\n          (1) the laws mandate that a hospital provide\n          free/uncompensated care to persons deemed\n          eligible by the state through a penalty\n          enforcement scheme, (2) the hospital is not\n          reimbursed any amount for the provision of\n          care, [and (3)] the provision of free care is\n          not a license condition or is not linked to\n          the state's certificate of need process.\n\nTo the parties knowledge, no other state has a system of free care\n\nwith each of those three features.2\n\n          FMH operates in one of the poorest counties in Maine, and\n\nthe amount of free medical services it provides in compliance with\n\n\n\n     2\n          Other states, however, have laws that, although not\nidentical to Maine's scheme, require hospitals to give free medical\ncare to low income patients. Rhode Island, for example, requires\n\"[a]ll licensed hospitals . . . as a condition of initial and/or\ncontinued licensure . . . [to] meet the statewide community needs\nfor the provision of charitable care.\"            R.I. Gen. Laws\n§ 23-17.14-15(a). The Rhode Island regulations, in turn, state\nthat \"[h]ospitals shall provide full charity care (i.e., a 100%\ndiscount) to patients/guarantors whose annual income is up to and\nincluding 200% of the Federal Poverty Levels, taking into\nconsideration family unit size.\" 14-90-28 R.I. Code R. § 11.3(c).\nRhode Island's free care requirements are enforceable by the\nstate's attorney general, and noncompliance may result in\nrevocation of the hospital's license, up to a $1 million fine, and\n5 years in prison. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 23-17.14-30.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fMaine's free care laws has grown over the past several years.              In\n\n2004, FMH provided $131,280 in mandatory free care.                During the\n\neleven months preceding May 31, 2008, FMH spent $890,212 to meet\n\nits free care obligations.3\n\n            Still, these expenditures represent only a small fraction\n\nof FMH's overall budget. Indeed, the roughly $661,000 in mandatory\n\nfree care that FMH provided during fiscal year 2007 amounted to\n\nonly 0.51% of the hospital's gross revenues for that year, and FMH\n\nhas not alleged that the level of free care that it currently\n\nprovides threatens its continued economic viability.\n\n            Although   Maine   provides    no   payment   for   the   medical\n\nservices rendered in compliance with its free care laws, FMH\n\nrecovers some of the costs it incurs in treating certain low income\n\npatients through reimbursements from the MaineCare program.                Yet\n\nreimbursements through MaineCare fall well short of FMH's actual\n\ncosts in treating patients.      For example, in fiscal year 2007, FMH\n\nreceived reimbursement under MaineCare at a rate of $2646.95 per\n\ndischarge   for   inpatient    services,   but   FMH's    actual    cost   per\n\ndischarge had historically been approximately $4796.            MaineCare's\n\nreimbursement rate for outpatient services is more favorable to FMH\n\nbut still only covers 89.7% of the hospital's outpatient costs.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          FMH has not received funds under the Hill-Burton Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 291 et seq., and so is not subject to that statute's free\ncare requirements.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f              On August 21, 2007, FMH sued Harvey in her capacity as\n\nthe Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human\n\nServices, seeking a declaratory judgment that both Maine's free\n\ncare   laws    and   the   MaineCare   program    constitute   uncompensated\n\ntakings of property.       On October 22, 2007, Harvey filed a motion to\n\ndismiss the count in FMH's complaint relating to the MaineCare\n\nprogram. The district court granted Harvey's motion to dismiss the\n\nMaineCare count on January 28, 2008, holding that FMH could not\n\nstate a takings claim because it voluntarily participates in the\n\nMaineCare program.         The parties filed cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment on the remaining count relating to Maine's free care laws.\n\nOn September 24, 2008, a magistrate judge recommended granting\n\nHarvey's motion for summary judgment.               The magistrate judge,\n\napplying an ad hoc analysis, held that Maine's free care laws did\n\nnot constitute a regulatory taking.              On November 14, 2008, the\n\ndistrict court adopted the magistrate judge's recommended decision\n\nand granted Harvey's motion for summary judgment.                FMH timely\n\nappealed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n              We first address FMH's takings challenge to Maine's free\n\ncare laws, which the district court rejected on summary judgment.\n\nWe review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,\n\ndrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fSee Sullivan v. City of Springfield, 561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\n             The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies\n\nto the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the\n\ntaking      of   private    property       for     public     use   without    just\n\ncompensation.       Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 536\n\n(2005). Although physical occupation of a person's property is the\n\nparadigmatic taking, the Constitution also guards against certain\n\nuncompensated regulatory interferences with a property owner's\n\ninterest in his property.             Id. at 537.           Here, the challenged\n\ngovernment       action,   which    does     not   directly    appropriate    FMH's\n\nproperty but rather regulates how FMH may use it, is properly\n\nanalyzed under the law of regulatory takings, not the law of\n\nphysical takings.      See Philip Morris, Inc. v. Reilly, 312 F.3d 24,\n\n33 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (\"A physical taking occurs either when\n\nthere is a condemnation or a physical appropriation of property.\");\n\nid.   (\"A    regulatory     taking     transpires      when    some   significant\n\nrestriction is placed upon an owner's use of his property for which\n\n'justice     and   fairness'       require    that   compensation     be   given.\"\n\n(quoting Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962))).\n\n             The Supreme Court's regulatory takings jurisprudence has\n\neschewed bright-line rules.            Indeed, in contrast to the law of\n\nphysical takings, which typically \"involves the straightforward\n\napplication of per se rules,\" Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fTahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 322 (2002), \"regulatory\n\ntakings jurisprudence . . . is characterized by 'essentially ad\n\nhoc, factual inquiries,'\" id. (quoting Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v.\n\nCity of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978)), \"designed to allow\n\n'careful   examination     and   weighing   of   all   the   relevant\n\ncircumstances,'\" id. (quoting Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S.\n\n606, 636 (2001) (O'Connor, J., concurring)).\n\n           Still, the Supreme Court has identified \"two categories\n\nof regulatory action that generally will be deemed per se takings.\"\n\nLingle, 544 U.S. at 538.     \"First, where [the] government requires\n\nan owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property --\n\nhowever minor -- it must provide just compensation.\"         Id.   The\n\nCourt cited, as an example, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV\n\nCorp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982), where a \"state law requiring landlords\n\nto permit cable companies to install cable facilities in apartment\n\nbuildings effected a taking.\"     Lingle, 544 U.S. at 538.    Second,\n\nthe Court has held that per se regulatory takings occur where the\n\n\"regulations completely deprive an owner of 'all economically\n\nbeneficial us[e]' of her property.\"     Id. (emphasis and alteration\n\nin original) (quoting Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003,\n\n1019 (1992)).   Neither of these situations is presented here.\n\nA.         Per Se Analysis\n\n           FMH argues that Maine's free care laws fall under the\n\nfirst category of per se takings because \"FMH is required to admit\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fand house (and board) patients who need admission to a hospital for\n\nfree.\"       In its view, \"[t]here is no difference in the government\n\noccupying a room or the government ordering that a room be made\n\navailable to someone it designates.\"             And FMH contends that \"this\n\ncase involves laws that force FMH to give its real property\n\n(hospital rooms) away for free.\"4             Additionally, FMH stresses that\n\nMaine's free care laws require it to give away its personal\n\nproperty to the extent that it must purchase and freely provide\n\nexpensive medicines and medical supplies to low income patients.\n\nThus, in FMH's view, Maine's free care laws are not a form of price\n\ncontrol but instead direct the transfer of property from the\n\nhospitals to low income patients.\n\n               The   Supreme   Court,    however,      has   recognized    that\n\nregulations of this sort do not effect a per se taking.            See Yee v.\n\nCity of Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 527-28 (1992).               Yee rejected a\n\ntakings challenge to a rent control ordinance for mobile home\n\nparks.       It held that the ordinance did not require the property\n\nowner to continue to use his land as a mobile home park and so did\n\nnot infringe his right to exclude others from the property.               Id. at\n\n528.       That is, because the property owner remained free to exclude\n\n\n       4\n          Admittedly, this is not a permanent physical invasion of\nFMH's real property, but rather periodic and intermittent. But the\ntemporary nature of the intrusion does not resolve the question of\nwhether the free care laws violate the Constitution, for even\ntemporary takings require just compensation.     See First English\nEvangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles,\n482 U.S. 304, 318-19 (1987).\n\n                                        -9-\n\fothers from his property if he ceased using his property as a\n\nmobile home park, the Supreme Court found that ordinance did not\n\nrequire the occupation of the property by unwanted tenants.                  Here\n\ntoo, FMH is not required to serve low income patients; it may\n\nchoose to stop using its property as a hospital, which is what\n\nmakes it subject to Maine's free care laws.\n\n            Moreover, the second category of per se taking is not\n\npresented   on    these    facts.    There   is   no   allegation     that    the\n\nregulations      remove    all   economically     beneficial   uses    of     the\n\nproperty; FMH merely says that it faces higher operating costs as\n\na result of the free care laws.\n\nB.          Ad Hoc Analysis\n\n            Because the challenged government action does not fall\n\nunder either category of regulatory taking invoking a per se rule,\n\nwe apply an ad hoc analysis.         Our analysis is guided by the three\n\nPenn Central factors: (1) \"[t]he economic impact of the regulation\n\non the claimant\"; (2) \"the extent to which the regulation has\n\ninterfered with distinct investment-backed expectations\"; and (3)\n\n\"the character of the government action.\"5                 438 U.S. at 124.\n\n\"[T]he   Penn    Central   inquiry   turns   in    large   part,   albeit     not\n\nexclusively, upon the magnitude of a regulation's economic impact\n\n\n\n     5\n          We are bound by the Penn Central factors but note that\nthe Penn Central analysis has been the subject of some academic\ncriticism. See, e.g., R.A. Epstein, From Penn Central to Lingle:\nThe Long Backwards Road, 40 J. Marshall L. Rev. 602 (2007).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fand the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property\n\ninterests.\"         Lingle, 544 U.S. at 540.       Ultimately, this inquiry\n\n\"aims    to    identify     regulatory   actions       that    are      functionally\n\nequivalent to the classic taking in which the government directly\n\nappropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.\"\n\nId. at 539.\n\n              1.       Economic Impact of the Regulations\n\n              In response to those three factors, FMH argues that the\n\neconomic impact of the regulations is severe because \"[t]he amount\n\nof goods and services being confiscated by the State under the Free\n\nCare Laws [is] significant and potentially unlimited.\"                       And the\n\ncost of providing medical care is undisputably high.                    According to\n\nFMH, each inpatient on average requires \"approximately $1,200 in\n\nmedical goods, such as medical and surgical supplies, pharmacy\n\ndrugs, anesthesia gases, and intravenous therapy supplies, about\n\n$1,700 in room and board services, and . . . about $1,800 for\n\ndoctors, nurses, and other staff to provide care to the client.\"\n\nMoreover, the financial burden on FMH under Maine's free care laws\n\nhas     increased     nearly   five    fold    since    2006       under    the     new\n\nregulations.\n\n              Yet    the   potentially   harsh   economic          consequences     to\n\nhospitals of Maine's free care laws are ameliorated somewhat by the\n\nstatutory defense to enforcement of the free care requirements\n\nagainst    hospitals       whose   \"economic   viability       .    .   .   would   be\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fjeopardized       by    compliance.\"     Me.    Rev.    Stat.   Ann.   tit.    22,\n\n§ 1715(2)(D).          And there is no allegation that FMH is presently\n\nfacing any threat to its economic viability on account of the free\n\ncare laws.6       We do not suggest that there can never be a taking\n\nbased upon an adverse economic effect short of jeopardizing the\n\neconomic viability of a plaintiff; we only note that this case is\n\nnot at that end of the spectrum.\n\n            We do agree with one of FMH's arguments regarding how to\n\nassess the economic impact of the regulation.                   The magistrate\n\njudge's recommended decision speculated that \"[i]t is not difficult\n\nto imagine, for example, that Franklin Memorial's revenue from\n\nother    public    programs,    or   better    yet,    the   profits   from   such\n\nprograms, exceeds the financial burden imposed by Maine's Free Care\n\nLaws.\"    This factor is not relevant to the question of whether\n\nMaine's free care laws constitute a taking and plays no part in our\n\nanalysis.\n\n            2.          Effect on FMH's Investment-Backed Expectations\n\n            As for FMH's investment-backed expectations, we first\n\nreject an argument made by the defendant.                    Harvey argues the\n\nhospital's non-profit status eliminates any influence this factor\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          Our case does not involve a hospital whose claim that its\neconomic viability would be jeopardized by compliance with the free\ncare laws has been rejected by state authorities.\n\n                                       -12-\n\fhas in FMH's favor.7          We disagree very much with Harvey's proposed\n\ncategorical approach.           While there may be differences in degree\n\nbetween expectations for for-profit institutions and non-profit\n\ninstitutions, there is no categorical exclusion of non-profit\n\ninstitutions from this prong of the analysis.               Like a for-profit\n\ninstitution, FMH acquires property with the expectation that it may\n\nuse it for a particular purpose.              Indeed, Maine law expressly\n\nrecognizes the right of non-profit corporations to acquire, own,\n\nuse, improve, and convey property like any other property owner.8\n\nSee Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 13-B, § 202(1)(I).             To the extent that\n\nMaine's free care laws may force FMH to use its property in ways\n\nthat       it   would   not   otherwise,   they   may   interfere   with   FMH's\n\ninvestment-backed expectations.\n\n\n\n       7\n          Harvey also argues that we should adopt a new test for\ncharitable organizations, which finds a taking only where the\nregulation interferes with the organization's charitable purpose.\nWe reject Harvey's invitation to adopt such a standard and adhere\nto the usual regulatory takings analysis under Penn Central.\n       8\n          Maine law does not forbid a non-profit entity from\nearning a return on its investment. It merely restricts how non-\nprofits may dispose of any profits they earn. For example, a non-\nprofit may not pay dividends or distribute its profits to its\nmembers, directors, or officers.        See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\ntit. 13-B, § 407. And upon dissolution or liquidation of a non-\nprofit, the entity's assets must go to an organization involved in\n\"substantially similar\" activities. Id.\n          Moreover, as a non-profit hospital, FMH is considered a\n\"public charity,\" subject to additional regulations. See Me. Rev.\nStat. Ann. tit. 5, § 194-A(2) (\"Any nonprofit hospital and medical\nservice organization is a charitable and benevolent institution and\na public charity and its assets are held for the purpose of\nfulfilling the charitable purposes of the organization.\").\n\n                                       -13-\n\f          It is true that FMH's investment-backed expectations are\n\ntempered by the fact that it operates in the highly regulated\n\nhospital industry.9   See United Wire, Metal & Mach. Health &\n\nWelfare Fund v. Morristown Mem'l Hosp., 995 F.2d 1179, 1191 (3d\n\nCir. 1993) (rejecting a takings challenge to New Jersey's system of\n\nsetting hospital billing rates, in part, because the plaintiffs'\n\ninvestment-backed expectations were reduced by \"the historically\n\nheavy and constant regulation of health care\" in the state).   And\n\nthe Supreme Court has recognized that heavy government regulation\n\nmay diminish a property owner's expectations.   See Lucas, 505 U.S.\n\nat 1027-28 (\"It seems to us that the property owner necessarily\n\nexpects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to\n\ntime, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate\n\nexercise of its police powers . . . .   And in the case of personal\n\nproperty, by reason of the State's traditionally high degree of\n\ncontrol over commercial dealings, he ought to be aware of the\n\n\n     9\n          Despite the second and third prongs of the ad hoc test,\nit is also true that the extent to which Maine's free care laws\n\"substantially advance legitimate state interests,\" Agins v. City\nof Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260 (1980), abrogated by Lingle, 544 U.S.\nat 541-42, plays no part in our analysis. As Lingle recognized,\nthis factor sounds in due process, 544 U.S. at 542, and although\nthere is some overlap between the protections of substantive due\nprocess and the law of takings, see Goldblatt, 369 U.S. at 594\n(recognizing, in the context of a due process challenge, that a\nregulation may be \"so onerous to as to constitute a taking which\nconstitutionally requires compensation\"), consideration of whether\na regulation substantially advances a legitimate state interest \"is\nnot a valid method of discerning whether private property has been\n'taken' for purposes of the Fifth Amendment,\" Lingle, 544 U.S. at\n542. FMH has not raised a due process challenge.\n\n                               -14-\n\fpossibility that new regulations might even render his property\n\neconomically worthless . . . .\").\n\n           3.       The Character of the Government Action\n\n           The third Penn Central factor -- the character of the\n\ngovernment action -- strongly favors finding no taking here. Under\n\nPenn Central, \"[a] 'taking' may more readily be found when the\n\ninterference with property can be characterized as a physical\n\ninvasion by government than when interference arises from some\n\npublic program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life\n\nto promote the common good.\"         438 U.S. at 124 (citation omitted).\n\nThus, in Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 716 (1987), the Supreme\n\nCourt   found   a   taking   where   the    character   of   the   government\n\nregulation was \"extraordinary\" in that it completely extinguished\n\nthe property owner's right to pass on the property to his heirs.\n\nBy contrast, the free care laws adjust the benefits and burdens of\n\neconomic life but leave the core rights of property ownership\n\nintact.   Maine's free care laws merely require that hospitals not\n\nrefuse to treat patients based on their ability to pay and that\n\nthey provide those services freely to those with incomes at or\n\nbelow 150% of the federal poverty level.         FMH may otherwise set the\n\nterms on which it provides access to its facilities and services.\n\nThus, on these facts, we hold that Maine's free care laws do not\n\neffect a taking.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f                                          III.\n\n             FMH    separately      challenges      the    reimbursement         rate   it\n\nreceives under the MaineCare program as an unconstitutional taking.\n\nThe district court dismissed this count, and we review de novo the\n\ngrant of a motion to dismiss, assuming the truth of all well-\n\npleaded     facts    in    the    complaint       and     drawing     all   reasonable\n\ninferences in FMH's favor. Vernet v. Serrano-Torres, 566 F.3d 254,\n\n258 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n             Of     course,      where     a      property       owner      voluntarily\n\nparticipates        in    a    regulated        program,        there     can     be    no\n\nunconstitutional taking.            See Garelick v. Sullivan, 987 F.2d 913,\n\n916   (2d   Cir.    1993)      (\"[W]here    a    service     provider       voluntarily\n\nparticipates in a price-regulated program or activity, there is no\n\nlegal compulsion to provide service and thus there can be no\n\ntaking.\"); cf. Yee, 503 U.S. at 527-28 (finding no taking because\n\nthe property owner voluntarily engaged in the regulated conduct).\n\nFMH's   essential        argument    is    that    it     has    no     choice   but    to\n\nparticipate in MaineCare because otherwise it would be forced to\n\ntreat low income patients without any compensation at all under the\n\nstate's free care laws.\n\n             Under the Maine free care laws, an individual who has\n\ninsurance or is eligible for coverage by a state or federal medical\n\nassistance program, like MaineCare, is generally not eligible to\n\nreceive free care.            See 10-144-150 Me. Code R. § 1.05(B)(1)(b).\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fBut there is an exception to this rule: if a patient meets the\n\nincome requirements to receive free care but has insurance or is\n\neligible for state or federal medical assistance, the hospital must\n\ntreat the patient and \"any amount remaining due after payment by\n\nthe insurer or medical assistance program will be considered free\n\ncare.\"   Id. § 1.05(B)(2).      That is, the treating hospital bears the\n\nmedical costs for treating low income patients beyond what is\n\ncovered by insurance or a government-funded medical assistance\n\nplan.\n\n            FMH   reads   the      regulation,     10-144-150   Me.     Code   R.\n\n§ 1.05(B), to require that if a hospital opts out of MaineCare, it\n\nmust pay the entire cost of treating patients who are eligible for\n\nMaineCare.     Thus, in FMH's view, hospitals must choose between\n\nreceiving inadequate reimbursement by participating in MaineCare or\n\nreceiving no reimbursement at all.\n\n            Harvey, however, offers a different reading.              She argues\n\nthat the regulation's use of the phrase \"any amount remaining due\n\nafter payment by the insurer or medical assistance program\" really\n\nmeans \"any amount not covered by insurance or medical assistance\n\nprogram.\"      Under this reading, if a hospital did not accept\n\ncoverage from a particular insurer or government program, it could\n\nstill obtain compensation by billing the patient directly for up to\n\nthe   amount   that   would   be    covered   by   the   insurer   or    medical\n\nassistance program.       Harvey defends this reading because the\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fregulation's drafters worked from \"the assumption that the hospital\n\nparticipates in, and would receive some payment from, the insurer\n\nor medical assistance program.\"             Harvey says this assumption is\n\nreasonable because, to the state's knowledge, every hospital in\n\nMaine participates in MaineCare.\n\n           We   owe   some        deference     to   an    agency's    reasonable\n\ninterpretations of its own regulations.                   See Massachusetts v.\n\nUnited States, 522 F.3d 115, 127 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"This court must\n\nalso be mindful of the substantial deference required when an\n\nagency adopts reasonable interpretations of regulations of its own\n\ncreation.\").    Yet our level of deference is reduced to the extent\n\nthat the agency's interpretation is merely a litigation position.\n\nSee Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of the\n\nArmy, 398 F.3d 105, 112 n.5 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Regardless of the level of deference we give Harvery's\n\ninterpretation, we accept it as reasonable.               Indeed, we view it as\n\na judicial admission, which will have some binding effect on the\n\nstate.10   See Massachusetts, 522 F.3d at 118 (binding the Nuclear\n\nRegulatory   Commission      to    its    litigation      position).     Allowing\n\nhospitals that opt out of MaineCare to seek compensation for the\n\nmedical services they provide advances the state's broader goal of\n\nmaking health care widely accessible.                And reading \"payment\" as\n\n\n     10\n          Nothing in this opinion precludes defendant from moving\nto revise the literal language of the regulation to make it conform\nwith the position taken in court.\n\n                                         -18-\n\fsynonymous    with   \"coverage\"   is   sensible    given   the   background\n\nunderstanding that all Maine hospitals participate in MaineCare.\n\n           Accepting Harvey's reading of the regulation, there is no\n\ncoercive     financial   incentive     to   participate    in    MaineCare.\n\nHospitals are not left with accepting MaineCare's reimbursement\n\nrates to avoid receiving nothing at all.          Therefore, we hold that\n\nFMH's participation in MaineCare is voluntary and reject its\n\ntakings challenge on that basis.\n\n                                     IV.\n\n           In the end, FMH's objection to Maine's free care laws and\n\nMaineCare program is a dispute with the policy choices made by the\n\nstate's political branches. As such, FMH's better course of action\n\nis to seek redress through the state's political process.\n\n           The district court's judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\f",

Mills, Attorney General, and Paul Stern, Deputy Attorney General, were on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, EBEL<sup>[*]</sup> and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Since 1989, Maine has required all hospitals to provide free medical services to certain low income patients under a set of statutes and regulations collectively known as \"free care laws.\" <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, §§ 1715, 1716; XX-XXX-XXX Me.Code R. § 1.01 et seq. Maine's free care laws do not reimburse the hospitals for their expenses incurred in delivering care to low income patients, and the amount of free care that the hospitals must provide is not limited under the statute.</p>\n<p>Separately, Maine pays for the medical treatment provided to some low income patients through its Medicaid program, called \"MaineCare.\" Yet the MaineCare reimbursements fall well below the hospitals' actual cost of providing medical services.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Franklin Memorial Hospital (\"FMH\") is a non-profit, general acute care hospital located in Farmington, Maine with a tradition of voluntarily providing free and reduced price medical care to low income patients. FMH sued Brenda M. Harvey, the Maine official charged with enforcing the state's free care laws and administering MaineCare. In a two-count complaint, FMH sought a declaratory judgment that both Maine's free care laws and MaineCare are unconstitutional takings of property. The district court dismissed the count relating to MaineCare and granted summary judgment to the state official on FMH's takings challenge to the free care laws. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Since July 1, 2007, Maine's free care laws have required hospitals to provide free medically necessary inpatient and outpatient hospital services to Maine residents who earn incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty level.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See</i> XX-XXX-XXX Me.Code R. §§ 1.01(A), 1.02(C). Under the regulations, \"[n]o hospital shall deny services to any Maine resident solely because of the inability of the individual to pay for those services.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1.01(A). Compliance with the free care laws is not a condition for having a license to operate a hospital in Maine. Instead, the state obtains compliance with its free care requirement through a system of fines and enforcement suits brought by the state's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> attorney general or any affected patient. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1715(2). Maine's free care laws do provide relief to hospitals for which compliance with the regulations would have ruinous financial consequences. Specifically, in any legal action brought to enforce Maine's free care laws, the hospital may avoid liability by showing that its \"economic viability ... would be jeopardized by compliance.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1715(2)(D).</p>\n<p>The parties agree that Maine's free care laws are unique in that</p>\n<blockquote>(1) the laws mandate that a hospital provide free/uncompensated care to persons deemed eligible by the state through a penalty enforcement scheme, (2) the hospital is not reimbursed any amount for the provision of care, [and (3)] the provision of free care is not a license condition or is not linked to the state's certificate of need process.</blockquote>\n<p>To the parties knowledge, no other state has a system of free care with each of those three features.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>FMH operates in one of the poorest counties in Maine, and the amount of free medical services it provides in compliance with Maine's free care laws has grown over the past several years. In 2004, FMH provided $131,280 in mandatory free care. During the eleven months preceding May 31, 2008, FMH spent $890,212 to meet its free care obligations.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Still, these expenditures represent only a small fraction of FMH's overall budget. Indeed, the roughly $661,000 in mandatory free care that FMH provided during fiscal year 2007 amounted to only 0.51% of the hospital's gross revenues for that year, and FMH has not alleged that the level of free care that it currently provides threatens its continued economic viability.</p>\n<p>Although Maine provides no payment for the medical services rendered in compliance with its free care laws, FMH recovers some of the costs it incurs in treating certain low income patients through reimbursements from the MaineCare program. Yet reimbursements through MaineCare fall well short of FMH's actual costs in treating patients. For example, in fiscal year 2007, FMH received reimbursement under MaineCare at a rate of $2646.95 per discharge for inpatient services, but FMH's actual cost per discharge had historically been approximately $4796. MaineCare's reimbursement rate for outpatient services is more favorable to FMH but still only covers 89.7% of the hospital's outpatient costs.</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2007, FMH sued Harvey in her capacity as the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, seeking a declaratory judgment that both Maine's free care laws and the MaineCare program constitute uncompensated takings of property. On October 22, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> 2007, Harvey filed a motion to dismiss the count in FMH's complaint relating to the MaineCare program. The district court granted Harvey's motion to dismiss the MaineCare count on January 28, 2008, holding that FMH could not state a takings claim because it voluntarily participates in the MaineCare program. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the remaining count relating to Maine's free care laws. On September 24, 2008, a magistrate judge recommended granting Harvey's motion for summary judgment. The magistrate judge, applying an ad hoc analysis, held that Maine's free care laws did not constitute a regulatory taking. On November 14, 2008, the district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommended decision and granted Harvey's motion for summary judgment. FMH timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We first address FMH's takings challenge to Maine's free care laws, which the district court rejected on summary judgment. We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>See </i><i>Sullivan v. City of Springfield,</i> 561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. <i>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.,</i> 544 U.S. 528, 536, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876 (2005). Although physical occupation of a person's property is the paradigmatic taking, the Constitution also guards against certain uncompensated regulatory interferences with a property owner's interest in his property. <i>Id.</i> at 537, 125 S.Ct. 2074. Here, the challenged government action, which does not directly appropriate FMH's property but rather regulates how FMH may use it, is properly analyzed under the law of regulatory takings, not the law of physical takings. <i>See </i><i>Philip Morris, Inc. v. Reilly,</i> 312 F.3d 24, 33 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc) (\"A physical taking occurs either when there is a condemnation or a physical appropriation of property.\"); <i>id.</i> (\"A regulatory taking transpires when some significant restriction is placed upon an owner's use of his property for which `justice and fairness' require that compensation be given.\" (quoting <i>Goldblatt v. Hempstead,</i> 369 U.S. 590, 594, 82 S.Ct. 987, 8 L.Ed.2d 130 (1962))).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court's regulatory takings jurisprudence has eschewed bright-line rules. Indeed, in contrast to the law of physical takings, which typically \"involves the straightforward application of <i>per se</i> rules,\" <i>Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency,</i> 535 U.S. 302, 322, 122 S.Ct. 1465, 152 L.Ed.2d 517 (2002), \"regulatory takings jurisprudence... is characterized by `essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,'\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. City of New York,</i> 438 U.S. 104, 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978)), \"designed to allow `careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances,'\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island,</i> 533 U.S. 606, 636, 121 S.Ct. 2448, 150 L.Ed.2d 592 (2001) (O'Connor, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p>Still, the Supreme Court has identified \"two categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed <i>per se</i> takings.\" <i>Lingle,</i> 544 U.S. at 538, 125 S.Ct. 2074. \"First, where [the] government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her propertyhowever minorit must provide just compensation.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court cited, as an example, <i>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,</i> 458 U.S. 419, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982), where a \"state law <span class=\"star-pagination\">*126</span> requiring landlords to permit cable companies to install cable facilities in apartment buildings effected a taking.\" <i>Lingle,</i> 544 U.S. at 538, 125 S.Ct. 2074. Second, the Court has held that per se regulatory takings occur where the \"regulations completely deprive an owner of `<i>all</i> economically beneficial us[e]' of her property.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis and alteration in original) (quoting <i>Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council,</i> 505 U.S. 1003, 1019, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992)). Neither of these situations is presented here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Per Se Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>FMH argues that Maine's free care laws fall under the first category of per se takings because \"FMH is required to admit and house (and board) patients who need admission to a hospital for free.\" In its view, \"[t]here is no difference in the government occupying a room or the government ordering that a room be made available to someone it designates.\" And FMH contends that \"this case involves laws that force FMH to give its real property (hospital rooms) away for free.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Additionally, FMH stresses that Maine's free care laws require it to give away its personal property to the extent that it must purchase and freely provide expensive medicines and medical supplies to low income patients. Thus, in FMH's view, Maine's free care laws are not a form of price control but instead direct the transfer of property from the hospitals to low income patients.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court, however, has recognized that regulations of this sort do not effect a per se taking. <i>See </i><i>Yee v. City of Escondido,</i> 503 U.S. 519, 527-28, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992). <i>Yee</i> rejected a takings challenge to a rent control ordinance for mobile home parks. It held that the ordinance did not require the property owner to continue to use his land as a mobile home park and so did not infringe his right to exclude others from the property. <i>Id.</i> at 528, 112 S.Ct. 1522. That is, because the property owner remained free to exclude others from his property if he ceased using his property as a mobile home park, the Supreme Court found that ordinance did not <i>require</i> the occupation of the property by unwanted tenants. Here too, FMH is not required to serve low income patients; it may choose to stop using its property as a hospital, which is what makes it subject to Maine's free care laws.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the second category of per se taking is not presented on these facts. There is no allegation that the regulations remove <i>all</i> economically beneficial uses of the property; FMH merely says that it faces higher operating costs as a result of the free care laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Ad Hoc Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because the challenged government action does not fall under either category of regulatory taking invoking a per se rule, we apply an ad hoc analysis. Our analysis is guided by the three <i>Penn Central</i> factors: (1) \"[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant\"; (2) \"the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations\"; and (3) \"the character of the government action.\"<sup>[5]</sup> 438 U.S. at 124, 98 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> S.Ct. 2646. \"[T]he <i>Penn Central</i> inquiry turns in large part, albeit not exclusively, upon the magnitude of a regulation's economic impact and the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests.\" <i>Lingle,</i> 544 U.S. at 540, 125 S.Ct. 2074. Ultimately, this inquiry \"aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which the government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 539, 125 S.Ct. 2074.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Economic Impact of the Regulations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In response to those three factors, FMH argues that the economic impact of the regulations is severe because \"[t]he amount of goods and services being confiscated by the State under the Free Care Laws [is] significant and potentially unlimited.\" And the cost of providing medical care is undisputably high. According to FMH, each inpatient on average requires \"approximately $1,200 in medical goods, such as medical and surgical supplies, pharmacy drugs, anesthesia gases, and intravenous therapy supplies, about $1,700 in room and board services, and ... about $1,800 for doctors, nurses, and other staff to provide care to the client.\" Moreover, the financial burden on FMH under Maine's free care laws has increased nearly five fold since 2006 under the new regulations.</p>\n<p>Yet the potentially harsh economic consequences to hospitals of Maine's free care laws are ameliorated somewhat by the statutory defense to enforcement of the free care requirements against hospitals whose \"economic viability ... would be jeopardized by compliance.\" Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1715(2)(D). And there is no allegation that FMH is presently facing any threat to its economic viability on account of the free care laws.<sup>[6]</sup> We do not suggest that there can never be a taking based upon an adverse economic effect short of jeopardizing the economic viability of a plaintiff; we only note that this case is not at that end of the spectrum.</p>\n<p>We do agree with one of FMH's arguments regarding how to assess the economic impact of the regulation. The magistrate judge's recommended decision speculated that \"[i]t is not difficult to imagine, for example, that Franklin Memorial's revenue from other public programs, or better yet, the profits from such programs, exceeds the financial burden imposed by Maine's Free Care Laws.\" This factor is not relevant to the question of whether Maine's free care laws constitute a taking and plays no part in our analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Effect on FMH's Investment-Backed Expectations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As for FMH's investment-backed expectations, we first reject an argument made by the defendant. Harvey argues the hospital's non-profit status eliminates any influence this factor has in FMH's favor.<sup>[7]</sup> We disagree very much with Harvey's proposed categorical approach. While there may be differences in degree between expectations for for-profit institutions and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> non-profit institutions, there is no categorical exclusion of non-profit institutions from this prong of the analysis. Like a for-profit institution, FMH acquires property with the expectation that it may use it for a particular purpose. Indeed, Maine law expressly recognizes the right of non-profit corporations to acquire, own, use, improve, and convey property like any other property owner.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 13-B, § 202(1)(I). To the extent that Maine's free care laws may force FMH to use its property in ways that it would not otherwise, they may interfere with FMH's investment-backed expectations.</p>\n<p>It is true that FMH's investment-backed expectations are tempered by the fact that it operates in the highly regulated hospital industry.<sup>[9]</sup><i>See </i><i>United Wire, Metal &amp; Mach. Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Morristown Mem'l Hosp.,</i> 995 F.2d 1179, 1191 (3d Cir.1993) (rejecting a takings challenge to New Jersey's system of setting hospital billing rates, in part, because the plaintiffs' investment-backed expectations were reduced by \"the historically heavy and constant regulation of health care\" in the state). And the Supreme Court has recognized that heavy government regulation may diminish a property owner's expectations. <i>See </i><i>Lucas,</i> 505 U.S. at 1027-28, 112 S.Ct. 2886 (\"It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers.... And in the case of personal property, by reason of the State's traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be aware of the possibility that new regulations might even render his property economically worthless....\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Character of the Government Action</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The third <i>Penn Central</i> factorthe character of the government action strongly favors finding no taking here. Under <i>Penn Central,</i> \"[a] `taking' may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government than when interference arises from some public <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.\" 438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646 (citation omitted). Thus, in <i>Hodel v. Irving,</i> 481 U.S. 704, 716, 107 S.Ct. 2076, 95 L.Ed.2d 668 (1987), the Supreme Court found a taking where the character of the government regulation was \"extraordinary\" in that it completely extinguished the property owner's right to pass on the property to his heirs. By contrast, the free care laws adjust the benefits and burdens of economic life but leave the core rights of property ownership intact. Maine's free care laws merely require that hospitals not refuse to treat patients based on their ability to pay and that they provide those services freely to those with incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty level. FMH may otherwise set the terms on which it provides access to its facilities and services. Thus, on these facts, we hold that Maine's free care laws do not effect a taking.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>FMH separately challenges the reimbursement rate it receives under the MaineCare program as an unconstitutional taking. The district court dismissed this count, and we review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss, assuming the truth of all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in FMH's favor. <i>Vernet v. Serrano-Torres,</i> 566 F.3d 254, 258 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Of course, where a property owner voluntarily participates in a regulated program, there can be no unconstitutional taking. <i>See </i><i>Garelick v. Sullivan,</i> 987 F.2d 913, 916 (2d Cir.1993) (\"[W]here a service provider voluntarily participates in a price-regulated program or activity, there is no legal compulsion to provide service and thus there can be no taking.\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Yee,</i> 503 U.S. at 527-28, 112 S.Ct. 1522 (finding no taking because the property owner voluntarily engaged in the regulated conduct). FMH's essential argument is that it has no choice but to participate in MaineCare because otherwise it would be forced to treat low income patients without any compensation at all under the state's free care laws.</p>\n<p>Under the Maine free care laws, an individual who has insurance or is eligible for coverage by a state or federal medical assistance program, like MaineCare, is generally not eligible to receive free care. <i>See</i> XX-XXX-XXX Me.Code R. § 1.05(B)(1)(b). But there is an exception to this rule: if a patient meets the income requirements to receive free care but has insurance or is eligible for state or federal medical assistance, the hospital must treat the patient and \"any amount remaining due after payment by the insurer or medical assistance program will be considered free care.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1.05(B)(2). That is, the treating hospital bears the medical costs for treating low income patients beyond what is covered by insurance or a government-funded medical assistance plan.</p>\n<p>FMH reads the regulation, XX-XXX-XXX Me.Code R. § 1.05(B), to require that if a hospital opts out of MaineCare, it must pay the entire cost of treating patients who are eligible for MaineCare. Thus, in FMH's view, hospitals must choose between receiving inadequate reimbursement by participating in MaineCare or receiving no reimbursement at all.</p>\n<p>Harvey, however, offers a different reading. She argues that the regulation's use of the phrase \"any amount remaining due after payment by the insurer or medical assistance program\" really means \"any amount not <i>covered</i> by insurance or medical assistance program.\" Under this reading, if a hospital did not accept coverage from a particular insurer or government program, it could still obtain compensation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> by billing the patient directly for up to the amount that would be covered by the insurer or medical assistance program. Harvey defends this reading because the regulation's drafters worked from \"the assumption that the hospital participates in, and would receive some payment from, the insurer or medical assistance program.\" Harvey says this assumption is reasonable because, to the state's knowledge, every hospital in Maine participates in MaineCare.</p>\n<p>We owe some deference to an agency's reasonable interpretations of its own regulations. <i>See </i><i>Massachusetts v. United States,</i> 522 F.3d 115, 127 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"This court must also be mindful of the substantial deference required when an agency adopts reasonable interpretations of regulations of its own creation.\"). Yet our level of deference is reduced to the extent that the agency's interpretation is merely a litigation position. <i>See </i><i>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of the Army,</i> 398 F.3d 105, 112 n. 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Regardless of the level of deference we give Harvery's interpretation, we accept it as reasonable. Indeed, we view it as a judicial admission, which will have some binding effect on the state.<sup>[10]</sup><i>See </i><i>Massachusetts,</i> 522 F.3d at 118 (binding the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to its litigation position). Allowing hospitals that opt out of MaineCare to seek compensation for the medical services they provide advances the state's broader goal of making health care widely accessible. And reading \"payment\" as synonymous with \"coverage\" is sensible given the background understanding that all Maine hospitals participate in MaineCare.</p>\n<p>Accepting Harvey's reading of the regulation, there is no coercive financial incentive to participate in MaineCare. Hospitals are not left with accepting MaineCare's reimbursement rates to avoid receiving nothing at all. Therefore, we hold that FMH's participation in MaineCare is voluntary and reject its takings challenge on that basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>In the end, FMH's objection to Maine's free care laws and MaineCare program is a dispute with the policy choices made by the state's political branches. As such, FMH's better course of action is to seek redress through the state's political process.</p>\n<p>The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  This is a change from Maine's prior free care scheme, which set the income qualification at 100% of the federal poverty level.\n</p>\n<p>Historically, Maine law required local towns, not the medical care providers, to bear the cost of medical treatment for their indigent residents. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. ch. 24, § 23 (1871) (\"A person residing in a place not incorporated, may provide relief and medical aid for any person sick, wounded, or dangerously injured, residing in such place ... and recover the amount necessarily expended of the town where such person had a settlement....\"); <i>see also Hutchinson v. Inhabitants of Carthage,</i> 105 Me. 134, 73 A. 825 (1909) (ordering payment by the town for the cost of medical care rendered to an indigent family with measles). In 1973, Maine's pauper laws were revised and replaced with a system of municipal general assistance programs, which required municipalities to pay the cost of certain medical expenses for their indigent residents. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, §§ 4301, 4313. These laws remain in effect today.</p>\n<p>[2]  Other states, however, have laws that, although not identical to Maine's scheme, require hospitals to give free medical care to low income patients. Rhode Island, for example, requires \"[a]ll licensed hospitals ... as a condition of initial and/or continued licensure... [to] meet the statewide community needs for the provision of charitable care.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 23-17.14-15(a). The Rhode Island regulations, in turn, state that \"[h]ospitals shall provide full charity care (i.e., a 100% discount) to patients/guarantors whose annual income is up to and including 200% of the Federal Poverty Levels, taking into consideration family unit size.\" 14-90-28 R.I.Code R. § 11.3(c). Rhode Island's free care requirements are enforceable by the state's attorney general, and noncompliance may result in revocation of the hospital's license, up to a $1 million fine, and 5 years in prison. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 23-17.14-30.</p>\n<p>[3]  FMH has not received funds under the Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. § 291 et seq., and so is not subject to that statute's free care requirements.</p>\n<p>[4]  Admittedly, this is not a permanent physical invasion of FMH's real property, but rather periodic and intermittent. But the temporary nature of the intrusion does not resolve the question of whether the free care laws violate the Constitution, for even temporary takings require just compensation. <i>See </i><i>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles,</i> 482 U.S. 304, 318-19, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987).</p>\n<p>[5]  We are bound by the <i>Penn Central</i> factors but note that the <i>Penn Central</i> analysis has been the subject of some academic criticism. <i>See, e.g.,</i> R.A. Epstein, <i>From</i> Penn Central <i>to</i> Lingle: <i>The Long Backwards Road,</i> 40 J. Marshall L.Rev. 602 (2007).</p>\n<p>[6]  Our case does not involve a hospital whose claim that its economic viability would be jeopardized by compliance with the free care laws has been rejected by state authorities.</p>\n<p>[7]  Harvey also argues that we should adopt a new test for charitable organizations, which finds a taking only where the regulation interferes with the organization's charitable purpose. We reject Harvey's invitation to adopt such a standard and adhere to the usual regulatory takings analysis under <i>Penn Central.</i></p>\n<p>[8]  Maine law does not forbid a non-profit entity from earning a return on its investment. It merely restricts how non-profits may dispose of any profits they earn. For example, a non-profit may not pay dividends or distribute its profits to its members, directors, or officers. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 13-B, § 407. And upon dissolution or liquidation of a non-profit, the entity's assets must go to an organization involved in \"substantially similar\" activities. <i>Id.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, as a non-profit hospital, FMH is considered a \"public charity,\" subject to additional regulations. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, § 194-A(2) (\"Any nonprofit hospital and medical service organization is a charitable and benevolent institution and a public charity and its assets are held for the purpose of fulfilling the charitable purposes of the organization.\").</p>\n<p>[9]  Despite the second and third prongs of the ad hoc test, it is also true that the extent to which Maine's free care laws \"substantially advance legitimate state interests,\" <i>Agins v. City of Tiburon,</i> 447 U.S. 255, 260, 100 S.Ct. 2138, 65 L.Ed.2d 106 (1980), <i>abrogated by </i><i>Lingle,</i> 544 U.S. at 541-42, 125 S.Ct. 2074, plays no part in our analysis. As <i>Lingle</i> recognized, this factor sounds in due process, 544 U.S. at 542, 125 S.Ct. 2074, and although there is some overlap between the protections of substantive due process and the law of takings, <i>see </i><i>Goldblatt,</i> 369 U.S. at 594, 82 S.Ct. 987 (recognizing, in the context of a due process challenge, that a regulation may be \"so onerous to as to constitute a taking which constitutionally requires compensation\"), consideration of whether a regulation substantially advances a legitimate state interest \"is not a valid method of discerning whether private property has been `taken' for purposes of the Fifth Amendment,\" <i>Lingle,</i> 544 U.S. at 542, 125 S.Ct. 2074. FMH has not raised a due process challenge.</p>\n<p>[10]  Nothing in this opinion precludes defendant from moving to revise the literal language of the regulation to make it conform with the position taken in court.</p>\n\n</div>",

Ann. tit. 22, §§ 1715, 1716; XX-XXX-XXX Me.Code R. § 1.01 et seq. Maine's free care laws do not reimburse the hospitals for their expenses incurred in delivering care to low income patients, and the amount of free care that the hospitals must provide is not limited under the statute.</p>\n<p>Separately, Maine pays for the medical treatment provided to some low income patients through its Medicaid program, called \"MaineCare.\" Yet the MaineCare reimbursements fall well below the hospitals' actual cost of providing medical services.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Franklin Memorial Hospital (\"FMH\") is a non-profit, general acute care hospital located in Farmington, Maine with a tradition of voluntarily providing free and reduced price medical care to low income patients. FMH sued Brenda M. Harvey, the Maine official charged with enforcing the state's free care laws and administering MaineCare. In a two-count complaint, FMH sought a declaratory judgment that both Maine's free care laws and MaineCare are unconstitutional takings of property. The district court dismissed the count relating to MaineCare and granted summary judgment to the state official on FMH's takings challenge to the free care laws. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Since July 1, 2007, Maine's free care laws have required hospitals to provide free medically necessary inpatient and outpatient hospital services to Maine residents who earn incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty level.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See</i> XX-XXX-XXX Me.Code R. §§ 1.01(A), 1.02(C). Under the regulations, \"[n]o hospital shall deny services to any Maine resident solely because of the inability of the individual to pay for those services.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1.01(A). Compliance with the free care laws is not a condition for having a license to operate a hospital in Maine. Instead, the state obtains compliance with its free care requirement through a system of fines and enforcement suits brought by the state's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*124</span> attorney general or any affected patient. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1715(2). Maine's free care laws do provide relief to hospitals for which compliance with the regulations would have ruinous financial consequences. Specifically, in any legal action brought to enforce Maine's free care laws, the hospital may avoid liability by showing that its \"economic viability ... would be jeopardized by compliance.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1715(2)(D).</p>\n<p>The parties agree that Maine's free care laws are unique in that</p>\n<blockquote>(1) the laws mandate that a hospital provide free/uncompensated care to persons deemed eligible by the state through a penalty enforcement scheme, (2) the hospital is not reimbursed any amount for the provision of care, [and (3)] the provision of free care is not a license condition or is not linked to the state's certificate of need process.</blockquote>\n<p>To the parties knowledge, no other state has a system of free care with each of those three features.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>FMH operates in one of the poorest counties in Maine, and the amount of free medical services it provides in compliance with Maine's free care laws has grown over the past several years. In 2004, FMH provided $131,280 in mandatory free care. During the eleven months preceding May 31, 2008, FMH spent $890,212 to meet its free care obligations.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Still, these expenditures represent only a small fraction of FMH's overall budget. Indeed, the roughly $661,000 in mandatory free care that FMH provided during fiscal year 2007 amounted to only 0.51% of the hospital's gross revenues for that year, and FMH has not alleged that the level of free care that it currently provides threatens its continued economic viability.</p>\n<p>Although Maine provides no payment for the medical services rendered in compliance with its free care laws, FMH recovers some of the costs it incurs in treating certain low income patients through reimbursements from the MaineCare program. Yet reimbursements through MaineCare fall well short of FMH's actual costs in treating patients. For example, in fiscal year 2007, FMH received reimbursement under MaineCare at a rate of $2646.95 per discharge for inpatient services, but FMH's actual cost per discharge had historically been approximately $4796. MaineCare's reimbursement rate for outpatient services is more favorable to FMH but still only covers 89.7% of the hospital's outpatient costs.</p>\n<p>On August 21, 2007, FMH sued Harvey in her capacity as the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, seeking a declaratory judgment that both Maine's free care laws and the MaineCare program constitute uncompensated takings of property. On October 22, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*125</span> 2007, Harvey filed a motion to dismiss the count in FMH's complaint relating to the MaineCare program. The district court granted Harvey's motion to dismiss the MaineCare count on January 28, 2008, holding that FMH could not state a takings claim because it voluntarily participates in the MaineCare program. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the remaining count relating to Maine's free care laws. On September 24, 2008, a magistrate judge recommended granting Harvey's motion for summary judgment. The magistrate judge, applying an ad hoc analysis, held that Maine's free care laws did not constitute a regulatory taking. On November 14, 2008, the district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommended decision and granted Harvey's motion for summary judgment. FMH timely appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We first address FMH's takings challenge to Maine's free care laws, which the district court rejected on summary judgment. We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <i>See </i><i>Sullivan v.

Second, the Court has held that per se regulatory takings occur where the \"regulations completely deprive an owner of `<i>all</i> economically beneficial us[e]' of her property.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis and alteration in original) (quoting <i>Lucas v. S.C.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span> (1992)). Neither of these situations is presented here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Per Se Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>FMH argues that Maine's free care laws fall under the first category of per se takings because \"FMH is required to admit and house (and board) patients who need admission to a hospital for free.\" In its view, \"[t]here is no difference in the government occupying a room or the government ordering that a room be made available to someone it designates.\" And FMH contends that \"this case involves laws that force FMH to give its real property (hospital rooms) away for free.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Additionally, FMH stresses that Maine's free care laws require it to give away its personal property to the extent that it must purchase and freely provide expensive medicines and medical supplies to low income patients. Thus, in FMH's view, Maine's free care laws are not a form of price control but instead direct the transfer of property from the hospitals to low income patients.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court, however, has recognized that regulations of this sort do not effect a per se taking. <i>See </i><i>Yee v. City of Escondido,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112719\"><a href=\"/opinion/112719/yee-v-escondido/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span>, 527-28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112719\"><a href=\"/opinion/112719/yee-v-escondido/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span> (1992). <i>Yee</i> rejected a takings challenge to a rent control ordinance for mobile home parks. It held that the ordinance did not require the property owner to continue to use his land as a mobile home park and so did not infringe his right to exclude others from the property. <i>Id.</i> at 528, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112719\"><a href=\"/opinion/112719/yee-v-escondido/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1522</span></a></span>. That is, because the property owner remained free to exclude others from his property if he ceased using his property as a mobile home park, the Supreme Court found that ordinance did not <i>require</i> the occupation of the property by unwanted tenants. Here too, FMH is not required to serve low income patients; it may choose to stop using its property as a hospital, which is what makes it subject to Maine's free care laws.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the second category of per se taking is not presented on these facts. There is no allegation that the regulations remove <i>all</i> economically beneficial uses of the property; FMH merely says that it faces higher operating costs as a result of the free care laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Ad Hoc Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because the challenged government action does not fall under either category of regulatory taking invoking a per se rule, we apply an ad hoc analysis. Our analysis is guided by the three <i>Penn Central</i> factors: (1) \"[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant\"; (2) \"the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations\"; and (3) \"the character of the government action.\"<sup>[5]</sup> 438 U.S. at 124, 98 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*127</span> S.Ct. 2646. \"[T]he <i>Penn Central</i> inquiry turns in large part, albeit not exclusively, upon the magnitude of a regulation's economic impact and the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests.\" <i>Lingle,</i> 544 U.S. at 540, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142894\"><a href=\"/opinion/142894/lingle-v-chevron-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2074</span></a></span>. Ultimately, this inquiry \"aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which the government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 539, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142894\"><a href=\"/opinion/142894/lingle-v-chevron-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2074</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Economic Impact of the Regulations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In response to those three factors, FMH argues that the economic impact of the regulations is severe because \"[t]he amount of goods and services being confiscated by the State under the Free Care Laws [is] significant and potentially unlimited.\" And the cost of providing medical care is undisputably high. According to FMH, each inpatient on average requires \"approximately $1,200 in medical goods, such as medical and surgical supplies, pharmacy drugs, anesthesia gases, and intravenous therapy supplies, about $1,700 in room and board services, and ... about $1,800 for doctors, nurses, and other staff to provide care to the client.\" Moreover, the financial burden on FMH under Maine's free care laws has increased nearly five fold since 2006 under the new regulations.</p>\n<p>Yet the potentially harsh economic consequences to hospitals of Maine's free care laws are ameliorated somewhat by the statutory defense to enforcement of the free care requirements against hospitals whose \"economic viability ... would be jeopardized by compliance.\" Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1715(2)(D). And there is no allegation that FMH is presently facing any threat to its economic viability on account of the free care laws.<sup>[6]</sup> We do not suggest that there can never be a taking based upon an adverse economic effect short of jeopardizing the economic viability of a plaintiff; we only note that this case is not at that end of the spectrum.</p>\n<p>We do agree with one of FMH's arguments regarding how to assess the economic impact of the regulation. The magistrate judge's recommended decision speculated that \"[i]t is not difficult to imagine, for example, that Franklin Memorial's revenue from other public programs, or better yet, the profits from such programs, exceeds the financial burden imposed by Maine's Free Care Laws.\" This factor is not relevant to the question of whether Maine's free care laws constitute a taking and plays no part in our analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Effect on FMH's Investment-Backed Expectations</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As for FMH's investment-backed expectations, we first reject an argument made by the defendant. Harvey argues the hospital's non-profit status eliminates any influence this factor has in FMH's favor.<sup>[7]</sup> We disagree very much with Harvey's proposed categorical approach. While there may be differences in degree between expectations for for-profit institutions and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*128</span> non-profit institutions, there is no categorical exclusion of non-profit institutions from this prong of the analysis. Like a for-profit institution, FMH acquires property with the expectation that it may use it for a particular purpose. Indeed, Maine law expressly recognizes the right of non-profit corporations to acquire, own, use, improve, and convey property like any other property owner.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 13-B, § 202(1)(I). To the extent that Maine's free care laws may force FMH to use its property in ways that it would not otherwise, they may interfere with FMH's investment-backed expectations.</p>\n<p>It is true that FMH's investment-backed expectations are tempered by the fact that it operates in the highly regulated hospital industry.<sup>[9]</sup><i>See </i><i>United Wire, Metal &amp; Mach. Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Morristown Mem'l Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></span>, 1191 (3d Cir.1993) (rejecting a takings challenge to New Jersey's system of setting hospital billing rates, in part, because the plaintiffs' investment-backed expectations were reduced by \"the historically heavy and constant regulation of health care\" in the state). And the Supreme Court has recognized that heavy government regulation may diminish a property owner's expectations. <i>See </i><i>Lucas,</i> 505 U.S. at 1027-28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112787\"><a href=\"/opinion/112787/lucas-v-south-carolina-coastal-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2886</span></a></span> (\"It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers.... And in the case of personal property, by reason of the State's traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be aware of the possibility that new regulations might even render his property economically worthless....\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>The Character of the Government Action</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The third <i>Penn Central</i> factorthe character of the government action strongly favors finding no taking here. Under <i>Penn Central,</i> \"[a] `taking' may more readily be found when the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government than when interference arises from some public <span class=\"star-pagination\">*129</span> program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.\" 438 U.S. at 124, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109924\"><a href=\"/opinion/109924/penn-central-transp-co-v-new-york-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2646</span></a></span> (citation omitted). Thus, in <i>Hodel v. Irving,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111887\"><a href=\"/opinion/111887/hodel-v-irving/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span>, 716, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111887\"><a href=\"/opinion/111887/hodel-v-irving/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1987), the Supreme Court found a taking where the character of the government regulation was \"extraordinary\" in that it completely extinguished the property owner's right to pass on the property to his heirs. By contrast, the free care laws adjust the benefits and burdens of economic life but leave the core rights of property ownership intact. Maine's free care laws merely require that hospitals not refuse to treat patients based on their ability to pay and that they provide those services freely to those with incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty level. FMH may otherwise set the terms on which it provides access to its facilities and services. Thus, on these facts, we hold that Maine's free care laws do not effect a taking.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>FMH separately challenges the reimbursement rate it receives under the MaineCare program as an unconstitutional taking. The district court dismissed this count, and we review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss, assuming the truth of all well-pleaded facts in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in FMH's favor. <i>Vernet v. Serrano-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203827\"><a href=\"/opinion/203827/vernet-v-serrano-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 258 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>Of course, where a property owner voluntarily participates in a regulated program, there can be no unconstitutional taking. <i>See </i><i>Garelick v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601788\"><a href=\"/opinion/601788/40-socsecrepser-327-medicare-medicaid-guide-p-41116-medicare/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span>, 916 (2d Cir.1993) (\"[W]here a service provider voluntarily participates in a price-regulated program or activity, there is no legal compulsion to provide service and thus there can be no taking.\"); <i>cf. </i><i>Yee,</i> 503 U.S. at 527-28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112719\"><a href=\"/opinion/112719/yee-v-escondido/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1522</span></a></span> (finding no taking because the property owner voluntarily engaged in the regulated conduct). FMH's essential argument is that it has no choice but to participate in MaineCare because otherwise it would be forced to treat low income patients without any compensation at all under the state's free care laws.</p>\n<p>Under the Maine free care laws, an individual who has insurance or is eligible for coverage by a state or federal medical assistance program, like MaineCare, is generally not eligible to receive free care. <i>See</i> XX-XXX-XXX Me.Code R. § 1.05(B)(1)(b). But there is an exception to this rule: if a patient meets the income requirements to receive free care but has insurance or is eligible for state or federal medical assistance, the hospital must treat the patient and \"any amount remaining due after payment by the insurer or medical assistance program will be considered free care.\" <i>Id.</i> § 1.05(B)(2). That is, the treating hospital bears the medical costs for treating low income patients beyond what is covered by insurance or a government-funded medical assistance plan.</p>\n<p>FMH reads the regulation, XX-XXX-XXX Me.Code R. § 1.05(B), to require that if a hospital opts out of MaineCare, it must pay the entire cost of treating patients who are eligible for MaineCare. Thus, in FMH's view, hospitals must choose between receiving inadequate reimbursement by participating in MaineCare or receiving no reimbursement at all.</p>\n<p>Harvey, however, offers a different reading. She argues that the regulation's use of the phrase \"any amount remaining due after payment by the insurer or medical assistance program\" really means \"any amount not <i>covered</i> by insurance or medical assistance program.\" Under this reading, if a hospital did not accept coverage from a particular insurer or government program, it could still obtain compensation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*130</span> by billing the patient directly for up to the amount that would be covered by the insurer or medical assistance program. Harvey defends this reading because the regulation's drafters worked from \"the assumption that the hospital participates in, and would receive some payment from, the insurer or medical assistance program.\" Harvey says this assumption is reasonable because, to the state's knowledge, every hospital in Maine participates in MaineCare.</p>\n<p>We owe some deference to an agency's reasonable interpretations of its own regulations. <i>See </i><i>Massachusetts v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203230\"><a href=\"/opinion/203230/massachusetts-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 127 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"This court must also be mindful of the substantial deference required when an agency adopts reasonable interpretations of regulations of its own creation.\"). Yet our level of deference is reduced to the extent that the agency's interpretation is merely a litigation position. <i>See </i><i>Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of the Army,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201450\"><a href=\"/opinion/201450/alliance-nan-sound-v-us-dept-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 112 n. 5 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Regardless of the level of deference we give Harvery's interpretation, we accept it as reasonable. Indeed, we view it as a judicial admission, which will have some binding effect on the state.<sup>[10]</sup><i>See </i><i>Massachusetts,</i> 522 F.3d at 118 (binding the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to its litigation position). Allowing hospitals that opt out of MaineCare to seek compensation for the medical services they provide advances the state's broader goal of making health care widely accessible. And reading \"payment\" as synonymous with \"coverage\" is sensible given the background understanding that all Maine hospitals participate in MaineCare.</p>\n<p>Accepting Harvey's reading of the regulation, there is no coercive financial incentive to participate in MaineCare. Hospitals are not left with accepting MaineCare's reimbursement rates to avoid receiving nothing at all. Therefore, we hold that FMH's participation in MaineCare is voluntary and reject its takings challenge on that basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>In the end, FMH's objection to Maine's free care laws and MaineCare program is a dispute with the policy choices made by the state's political branches. As such, FMH's better course of action is to seek redress through the state's political process.</p>\n<p>The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  This is a change from Maine's prior free care scheme, which set the income qualification at 100% of the federal poverty level.\n</p>\n<p>Historically, Maine law required local towns, not the medical care providers, to bear the cost of medical treatment for their indigent residents. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. ch. 24, § 23 (1871) (\"A person residing in a place not incorporated, may provide relief and medical aid for any person sick, wounded, or dangerously injured, residing in such place ... and recover the amount necessarily expended of the town where such person had a settlement....\"); <i>see also Hutchinson v. Inhabitants of Carthage,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Me.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></span> (1909) (ordering payment by the town for the cost of medical care rendered to an indigent family with measles). In 1973, Maine's pauper laws were revised and replaced with a system of municipal general assistance programs, which required municipalities to pay the cost of certain medical expenses for their indigent residents. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, §§ 4301, 4313. These laws remain in effect today.</p>\n<p>[2]  Other states, however, have laws that, although not identical to Maine's scheme, require hospitals to give free medical care to low income patients. Rhode Island, for example, requires \"[a]ll licensed hospitals ... as a condition of initial and/or continued licensure... [to] meet the statewide community needs for the provision of charitable care.\" R.I. Gen. Laws § 23-17.14-15(a). The Rhode Island regulations, in turn, state that \"[h]ospitals shall provide full charity care (i.e., a 100% discount) to patients/guarantors whose annual income is up to and including 200% of the Federal Poverty Levels, taking into consideration family unit size.\" 14-90-28 R.I.Code R. § 11.3(c). Rhode Island's free care requirements are enforceable by the state's attorney general, and noncompliance may result in revocation of the hospital's license, up to a $1 million fine, and 5 years in prison. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 23-17.14-30.</p>\n<p>[3]  FMH has not received funds under the Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. § 291 et seq., and so is not subject to that statute's free care requirements.</p>\n<p>[4]  Admittedly, this is not a permanent physical invasion of FMH's real property, but rather periodic and intermittent. But the temporary nature of the intrusion does not resolve the question of whether the free care laws violate the Constitution, for even temporary takings require just compensation. <i>See </i><i>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111912\"><a href=\"/opinion/111912/first-lutheran-church-v-los-angeles-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 318-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111912\"><a href=\"/opinion/111912/first-lutheran-church-v-los-angeles-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Epstein, <i>From</i> Penn Central <i>to</i> Lingle: <i>The Long Backwards Road,</i> 40 J. Marshall L.Rev. 602 (2007).</p>\n<p>[6]  Our case does not involve a hospital whose claim that its economic viability would be jeopardized by compliance with the free care laws has been rejected by state authorities.</p>\n<p>[7]  Harvey also argues that we should adopt a new test for charitable organizations, which finds a taking only where the regulation interferes with the organization's charitable purpose. We reject Harvey's invitation to adopt such a standard and adhere to the usual regulatory takings analysis under <i>Penn Central.</i></p>\n<p>[8]  Maine law does not forbid a non-profit entity from earning a return on its investment. It merely restricts how non-profits may dispose of any profits they earn. For example, a non-profit may not pay dividends or distribute its profits to its members, directors, or officers. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 13-B, § 407. And upon dissolution or liquidation of a non-profit, the entity's assets must go to an organization involved in \"substantially similar\" activities. <i>Id.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, as a non-profit hospital, FMH is considered a \"public charity,\" subject to additional regulations. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat.
