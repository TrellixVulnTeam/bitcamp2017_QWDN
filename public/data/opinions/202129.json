After an evidentiary hearing, the\n\ndistrict court preliminarily enjoined defendant-appellant M.V.\n\nTrading Corp. (M.V.) from advertising, distributing, or selling\n\ncookies or crackers in Puerto Rico under the trade name \"Ricas\" on\n\nthe ground that such activities would likely infringe a registered\n\ntrademark    held    by   plaintiff-appellee   Borinquen   Biscuit   Corp.\n\n(Borinquen).        M.V. appeals.    See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).       We\n\naffirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n     Borinquen is a manufacturer and distributor of \"galletas.\"\n\nThere is no precise English equivalent of this Spanish word;\n\n\"galleta\" (or, in the plural, \"galletas\") encompasses all types of\n\ncrackers, cookies, and biscuits.       Since 1976, Borinquen has sold a\n\nround, yellowish, semi-sweet galleta in Puerto Rico under the\n\nfederally registered trademark \"RICA.\"         This galleta resembles a\n\ncookie.     Borinquen acquired the recipe for the product and the\n\nrights to the mark from Sunland Biscuit Company (Sunland), which\n\nhad sold the galleta in Puerto Rico under that mark since 1962.\n\nSunland officially registered the mark on the principal register of\n\nthe Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) in 1969.               The federal\n\nregistration states that \"the Spanish word 'Rica' may be translated\n\nas 'rich.'\"\n\n     Borinquen's \"RICA\" has always borne a logo that consists of a\n\nred circle encompassing the white-lettered phrase \"Galletas RICA\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fSunland.\"      Borinquen registered both the mark \"RICA\" and the\n\nproduct's logo with the Puerto Rico Department of State in 2000.\n\nIt currently sells the product in predominately red-and-white\n\npackaging, with the circular logo centered against a background\n\nconsisting of rows of the galletas.\n\n      While    other    firms   have    registered     \"rica\"    trademarks   for\n\ndifferent kinds of products (e.g., bananas, brown sugar, and\n\ntobacco), Borinquen's \"RICA\" is the only cookie, cracker, or\n\nbiscuit registered under that name in the United States. Moreover,\n\nuntil the events at issue here, Borinquen was the only company to\n\nuse   the     word   \"rica\"     in    connection   with    the    marketing    or\n\ndistribution of galletas in Puerto Rico.\n\n      The tectonic plates shifted in April of 2003, when M.V. began\n\nselling a round, yellowish, salty galleta bearing the name \"Nestlé\n\nRicas.\"     This galleta, which resembles a cracker, is manufactured\n\nby Nestlé Ecuador and imported by M.V.             The product logo consists\n\nof a white oval with the name \"Ricas\" centered in red letters and\n\nwith a red square in the upper right-hand corner of the oval\n\nbearing the white-lettered brand name \"Nestlé.\"                 M.V.'s packaging\n\nis mostly red and white, albeit with some yellow and blue design.\n\nThe logo is centered in the upper half of the box against a\n\nbackground of scattered galletas.\n\n      In or around the summer of 2004, Borinquen learned that M.V.\n\nwas   marketing      Nestlé   Ricas    in   earnest.     Since    both   parties'\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fgalletas       were    being    sold     in    Puerto     Rican   supermarkets   and\n\nconvenience stores, this was a matter of considerable concern.\n\nBorinquen informed M.V. that it believed M.V.'s distribution of\n\ngalletas under the name \"Ricas\" infringed its registered trademark\n\nand asked M.V. to cease and desist.\n\n     When M.V. refused, Borinquen filed suit for damages and\n\ninjunctive relief in the federal district court. In its complaint,\n\nBorinquen alleged that M.V.'s use of the \"Ricas\" mark, coupled with\n\nsimilarities in trade dress, infringed its trademark and trade\n\ndress       rights    under    federal   law.       See   15   U.S.C.   §§   1114(1),\n\n1125(a).1      M.V. denied the essential allegations of the complaint\n\nand counterclaimed for cancellation of Borinquen's \"RICA\" mark.\n\n     Coincident with the institution of suit, Borinquen moved for\n\na preliminary injunction.           M.V. opposed that motion.           The district\n\ncourt held an evidentiary hearing on May 31 and June 7, 2005.                     The\n\npresident of each company testified about the advertising and sales\n\nhistory of his product.            In addition, each side presented expert\n\ntestimony anent the likelihood of confusion.                   The expert witnesses\n\napproached the problem from different directions.                       Borinquen's\n\nwitness (an expert in advertising and brand recognition) polled\n\nothers in his field and concluded that confusion was probable.\n\nM.V.'s witness (an expert in market research) conducted a survey of\n\n\n        1\n      Borinquen also brought a dilution claim under 15 U.S.C. §\n1125(c). That claim was not pressed at the preliminary injunction\nstage, so we make no further mention of it.\n\n                                              -4-\n\f100 consumers in metropolitan areas and concluded that consumers\n\ncould recognize differences in the packaging of the two products.\n\nOn that basis, she hypothesized that the marketing of Nestlé Ricas\n\ncreated no likelihood of confusion.\n\n      On September 6, 2005, the district court issued a preliminary\n\ninjunction that enjoined M.V. from advertising, distributing, or\n\nselling any cookies or crackers in Puerto Rico under the name\n\n\"Ricas.\"       Borinquen Biscuit Corp. v. M.V. Trading Corp., No. 04-\n\n2070, slip op. at 12 (D.P.R. Sept. 6, 2005) (D. Ct. Op.).                      The\n\ncourt concluded, inter alia, that Borinquen was likely to succeed\n\nin establishing both that its \"RICA\" mark was entitled to federal\n\ntrademark protection and that M.V.'s use of the \"Ricas\" mark was\n\nlikely to foment consumer confusion.                This interlocutory appeal\n\nensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n      On appeal, M.V. advances two principal assignments of error.\n\nFirst,    it    charges     that   the   district    court    blundered   in   not\n\nrequiring Borinquen to establish that the \"RICA\" mark had acquired\n\nsecondary meaning.          Second, it maintains that the district court\n\nmistakenly concluded that M.V.'s product was likely to cause\n\nconsumer       confusion.      After     delineating    the    legal   standards\n\napplicable to grants of preliminary injunctive relief, we address\n\neach of these claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f            A.   The Preliminary Injunction Standard.\n\n     The preliminary injunction standard is familiar.       Before\n\ngranting this type of relief, a nisi prius court must consider (1)\n\nthe likelihood of the movant's success on the merits; (2) the\n\nanticipated incidence of irreparable harm if the injunction is\n\ndenied; (3) the balance of relevant equities (i.e., the hardship\n\nthat will befall the nonmovant if the injunction issues contrasted\n\nwith the hardship that will befall the movant if the injunction\n\ndoes not issue); and (4) the impact, if any, of the court's action\n\non the public interest.   Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat,\n\nInc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996); Narragansett Indian Tribe v.\n\nGuilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1991).   While all these factors\n\nmust be weighed, the cynosure of this four-part test is more often\n\nthan not the movant's likelihood of success on the merits.     See\n\nWeaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"The sine qua\n\nnon of [the four-factor] formulation is whether the plaintiffs are\n\nlikely to succeed on the merits.\"). The importance of that inquiry\n\nis magnified in trademark cases because the resolution of the other\n\nthree factors will depend in large part on whether the movant is\n\nlikely to succeed in establishing infringement.   See Keds Corp. v.\n\nRenee Int'l Trading Corp., 888 F.2d 215, 220 (1st Cir. 1989); see\n\nalso I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (noting that irreparable harm can be assumed if a trademark\n\nholder demonstrates that it is likely to succeed in establishing\n\n\n                                -6-\n\finfringement).     This emphasis on likelihood of success is fully\n\nconsistent with the tenet that, as a matter of public policy,\n\ntrademarks should be protected against infringing uses.                See\n\nVolkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Wheeler, 814 F.2d 812, 820\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).\n\n     A   trial   court's   conclusions    on   these   factors   and   its\n\ndeterminations     regarding   their     relative   weighting    engender\n\ndeferential appellate review.      See Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16.\n\nThus, a decision to grant a preliminary injunction will stand\n\nunless the court \"mistook the law, clearly erred in its factual\n\nassessments, or otherwise abused its discretion in granting the\n\ninterim relief.\"     McGuire v. Reilly, 260 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n     On appeal, M.V. does not challenge the district court's\n\ndeterminations regarding the last three components of the four-part\n\npreliminary injunction framework.       Consequently, we need consider\n\nhere only the first of the four factors: likelihood of success.\n\n                      B.   Likelihood of Success.\n\n     Before a party can succeed in an infringement action, it must\n\ndemonstrate both that its mark merits protection and that the\n\nallegedly infringing use is likely to result in consumer confusion.\n\nBoston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., 9 F.3d 175, 180 (1st\n\nCir. 1993). For purposes of a preliminary injunction, however, the\n\ntrademark holder need only show a likelihood of success on these\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\ftwo elements.     See Guilbert, 934 F.2d at 6 (explaining that \"a\n\ncourt's conclusions as to the merits of the issues presented on\n\npreliminary injunction are to be understood as statements of\n\nprobable outcomes,\" not as final determinations). M.V. claims that\n\nBorinquen did not adequately demonstrate below that it was likely\n\nto satisfy its burden with respect to either element.           We examine\n\neach facet of this claim.\n\n       1. Eligibility for Trademark Protection. We start with M.V.'s\n\ncontention that the district court erred, as a matter of law, in\n\ndetermining that Borinquen's \"RICA\" mark was entitled to trademark\n\nprotection.     This contention proceeds from the premise that the\n\ncourt should have required Borinquen to adduce evidence that its\n\nmark had acquired secondary meaning.         We reject this premise.\n\n       It is common ground that, in order to be eligible for trademark\n\nprotection, a mark must qualify as distinctive. See Two Pesos, Inc.\n\nv. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 769 (1992).           When considering\n\nwhether a mark meets that standard, courts often employ a taxonomy\n\nthat    classifies     marks   along     a    continuum    of   increasing\n\ndistinctiveness.     That continuum contains five categories: generic\n\nmarks, descriptive marks, suggestive marks, arbitrary marks, and\n\nfanciful marks.      See, e.g., id. at 768; I.P. Lund, 163 F.3d at 39.\n\nBy definition, generic marks can never be ranked as distinctive.\n\nPark 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 194\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f(1985).   In contrast, suggestive, arbitrary, and fanciful marks are\n\nconsidered inherently distinctive.     Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768.\n\n     The category of descriptive marks is more protean in nature.\n\nDescriptiveness and distinctiveness are neither congruent concepts\n\nnor productive of mutually exclusive classifications.    Descriptive\n\nmarks are tentatively considered non-distinctive but can attain\n\ndistinctive status upon an affirmative showing of secondary meaning.\n\nId. at 769. This showing requires the trademark holder to establish\n\nthat \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of [the\n\nmark] is to identify the source of the product rather than the\n\nproduct itself.\"   Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S.\n\n844, 851 n.11 (1982).   A mark is, therefore, considered distinctive\n\n(and, thus, eligible for trademark protection) if it either is\n\ninherently distinctive or exhibits acquired distinctiveness gained\n\nthrough secondary meaning.   Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769.\n\n     Both registered and unregistered trademarks may be eligible for\n\nprotection against infringing uses.     See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 1125;\n\nsee also Keebler Co. v. Rovira Biscuit Corp., 624 F.2d 366, 372 (1st\n\nCir. 1980).   Withal, the proper mode of analysis regarding whether\n\na mark satisfies the distinctiveness criterion varies based on\n\nwhether or not the mark is registered.\n\n     When a party seeks protection for an unregistered trademark,\n\nit is incumbent on that party to demonstrate affirmatively that its\n\nmark is distinctive (either inherently or through acquired secondary\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fmeaning).    Boston Beer, 9 F.3d at 180.      The trial court must engage\n\nin a specific inquiry to determine whether the proponent has met\n\nthat burden.      See, e.g., I.P. Lund, 163 F.3d at 39-41.           Here,\n\nhowever, Borinquen's mark is registered, so this requirement does\n\nnot automatically attach.\n\n     When a party seeks protection for a registered trademark, its\n\nburdens are lighter.        Registration is \"prima facie evidence of the\n\nvalidity of the registered mark.\"          15 U.S.C. § 1115(a).   When, as\n\nin this case, the PTO registers a mark without first requiring the\n\napplicant to prove secondary meaning, the holder of the mark is\n\nentitled    \"to   a   presumption   that   its   registered   trademark   is\n\ninherently distinctive, as opposed to merely descriptive.\"          Equine\n\nTechs., Inc. v. Equitechnology, Inc., 68 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir.\n\n1995); see Quabaug Rubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe Co., 567 F.2d 154, 161\n\nn.12 (1st Cir. 1977) (explaining that \"registration is prima facie\n\nevidence that the . . . mark is distinctive per se\").2\n\n     The effect of that presumption varies depending on whether the\n\nregistered    mark    has   attained   incontestable   status.     If     the\n\n\n\n     2\n      Even when the PTO's decision to register a mark depends on\nthe applicant's proof of secondary meaning, the holder is still\nentitled to a presumption that its mark is distinctive and merits\nprotection. See 15 U.S.C. § 1115(a). In that instance, however,\nthe presumption is not that the mark is inherently distinctive,\nbut, rather, that the mark is valid because it enjoys secondary\nmeaning. See Arrow Fastener Co. v. Stanley Works, 59 F.3d 384, 393\n(2d Cir. 1995). Because Borinquen's mark was not registered on\nthis basis, we do not address the effect of a secondary meaning\npresumption.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fregistered    mark    has     become   incontestable     through   the   owner's\n\ncompliance     with     the    applicable       statutory   formalities,3     the\n\npresumption is conclusive.          15 U.S.C. § 1115(b).      If, however, the\n\nregistered mark remains contestable, the putative infringer may\n\ndefend a suit on the ground that the mark does not merit protection\n\nbecause it is not inherently distinctive (i.e., not suggestive,\n\narbitrary, or fanciful) but, rather, is merely descriptive of the\n\nproduct.     See id. § 1115(a).            It follows, then, that under the\n\nLanham Act, the effect of registration for a contestable mark is \"to\n\nshift the burden of proof from the plaintiff . . . to the defendant,\n\nwho must introduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of\n\nthe plaintiff's right to [exclusive] use\" through proof that the\n\nmark is merely descriptive. Keebler Co., 624 F.2d at 373. Inasmuch\n\nas   Borinquen's      mark    is   registered    but   contestable    (that   is,\n\nBorinquen has not satisfied the requirements of 15 U.S.C. § 1065),\n\nsee supra note 3, this is such a case.\n\n      That sets the stage for our analysis.            When, as now, a mark is\n\nregistered    but     contestable,     a    putative   infringer     must   offer\n\nsignificantly probative evidence to show that the mark is merely\n\ndescriptive.    Then — and only then — does the burden of proof shift\n\n\n      3\n      A mark becomes incontestable when its owner files an\naffidavit with the PTO attesting that the following requirements\nhave been met: (i) there has been no final decision adverse to its\nownership or enforcement rights for the preceding five-year period;\n(ii) there is no pending case or proceeding regarding the owner's\nrights in the mark; and (iii) the owner is still using the mark.\nSee 15 U.S.C. § 1065.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fback, so that the party seeking protection must take an alternative\n\nroute and assume the devoir of persuasion on the issue of whether\n\nits mark has acquired secondary meaning. See, e.g., Flextized, Inc.\n\nv. Nat'l Flextized Corp., 335 F.2d 774, 779-80 (2d Cir. 1964).\n\nSimply alleging descriptiveness is insufficient to compel the holder\n\nof a registered mark to go forward with proof of secondary meaning;\n\nthe putative infringer must prove descriptiveness by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence before the mix of issues changes and the burden of\n\npersuasion on the new issue (secondary meaning) reverts to the\n\ntrademark holder.     See Keebler Co., 624 F.2d at 373.      If the\n\nputative infringer does not cross that threshold, the presumption\n\nholds and distinctiveness is presumed.     See Pic Design Corp. v.\n\nBearings Speciality Co., 436 F.2d 804, 807 (1st Cir. 1971). In that\n\nevent, the court can proceed to consider the remaining elements of\n\nthe infringement claim without first demanding that the trademark\n\nholder offer proof of secondary meaning.   See id.\n\n     In the case at hand, these background principles get the grease\n\nfrom the goose.     Before us, M.V. insists that the district court\n\nerroneously treated Borinquen's mark as incontestable because it did\n\nnot require proof of secondary meaning. This argument conflates two\n\nissues and, in the bargain, mischaracterizes what transpired below.\n\nThe record, fairly read, supports a determination that M.V. failed\n\nto prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the \"RICA\" mark\n\nis merely descriptive.   Therefore, the district court was warranted\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fin not taking the next step and shifting the burden to Borinquen to\n\nshow that its registered but contestable mark had acquired secondary\n\nmeaning.   See Keebler Co., 624 F.2d at 373.           We explain briefly.\n\n     The issue of distinctiveness ordinarily presents a question of\n\nfact.    Equine Techs., 68 F.3d at 544.           Although M.V. raised a\n\ndescriptiveness defense, it presented minimal evidence and argument\n\nin support of that defense.       For example, while M.V. conducted a\n\nsurvey on the issue of consumer confusion, it adduced no comparable\n\nevidence in support of its contention that Borinquen's mark is\n\nmerely descriptive.4 By like token, M.V. devoted scant attention to\n\nthe question of descriptiveness in its post-hearing brief.             Given\n\nthis dearth of both evidence and argumentation, we think that the\n\ndecision   to   allow   the   distinctiveness    presumption    to   control\n\nwithstands scrutiny.\n\n     M.V.'s     counter-arguments,    though    ably    presented,   are   not\n\nsufficient, at the preliminary injunction stage, to offset the\n\n\n\n     4\n      The absence of reliable survey evidence is not, in and of\nitself, dispositive when a putative infringer attempts to establish\nthat a registered mark is not entitled to protection on\ndescriptiveness grounds.     The relevant inquiry focuses on the\nprimary significance of the mark to the product's consumers. See\nBoston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan, 867 F.2d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 1989).\nThe preferred form of proof includes direct evidence (such as\nconsumer surveys) suggesting that the average purchaser actually\nregards the mark as merely descriptive of the plaintiff's product.\nSee Keebler Co., 624 F.2d at 375. Direct evidence is not, however,\nan absolute prerequisite. See id. (noting that, in some instances,\nindirect evidence may suffice). This concept dovetails neatly with\nthe lessened proof requirements that apply at the preliminary\ninjunction stage.\n\n                                     -13-\n\ffinding that Borinquen enjoyed a likelihood of success on the\n\nmerits.    First,    M.V.    states   that   \"RICA\"   should      be    dubbed    a\n\ndescriptive mark because the word, translated literally, means\n\n\"tasty\"   or     \"rich\"     and,   therefore,    describes        a     desirable\n\ncharacteristic of a cookie or cracker. With respect to a registered\n\nmark, however, the putative infringer's burden is not simply to show\n\nthat the mark describes a feature of the trademark holder's product;\n\nrather, it must show that consumers regard the mark as merely\n\ndescriptive of that product.          See id. at 545.        Here, the record\n\ncontains no such evidence.\n\n      This shortcoming is all the more glaring because the first\n\nlanguage of the prototypical Puerto Rican consumer is Spanish and,\n\nas Borinquen notes, Spanish grammatical rules caution against\n\nattributing a purely adjectival meaning to the term \"RICA\" when\n\nviewed in the context of Borinquen's logo: \"Galletas RICA Sunland.\"\n\nA   particular   Spanish-language      grammatical    rule    —   the    rule    of\n\nconcordance — requires strict relationships of gender and number\n\nbetween adjectives and nouns.          See Gerald Erichsen, Spanish for\n\nBeginners:          Noun-Adjective              Agreement               (2006),\n\nhttp://spanish.about.com/cs/forbeginners/a/adjective_agree.htm.\n\nHence, Borinquen's mark would need to use the plural (\"RICAS\") if\n\nit were intended to serve as a grammatically correct descriptor of\n\nthe noun \"Galletas.\"      We think it follows that the average Spanish-\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fspeaking consumer would be unlikely to view the non-concordant mark\n\nas a mere descriptor for the underlying product.\n\n     M.V.'s second counter-argument is equally unconvincing.     It\n\nmaintains that Borinquen's mark must be considered descriptive\n\nbecause, in 1964, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court determined that the\n\nterm \"Rico\" (the masculine of \"Rica\") was merely descriptive of the\n\nproduct \"Café Rico\" and, thus, not entitled to protection under\n\nlocal law.    Cooperativa de Cafeteros v. Colón Colón, 91 P.R.R. 361\n\n(1964).   However, the distinctiveness inquiry is product-specific.\n\nSee Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan, 867 F.2d 22, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (explaining that when a party challenges the validity of a\n\nregistered mark, it must show that the primary significance of the\n\nmark to the consuming public is to merely to describe a particular\n\nproduct).     A term that merely describes one product may well be\n\ndistinctive as to another.\n\n     The phrase \"Café Rico,\" as to which the Puerto Rico court found\n\nthat the adjective merely described the noun, comports with the\n\nSpanish-language rule of concordance for      nouns and adjectives\n\nwhereas the phrase \"Galletas RICA,\" as to which the district court\n\nfound that the adjective did not merely describe the noun, does not.\n\nGiven this fractured grammatical usage, it seems more probable that\n\na Spanish-speaking consumer would find \"Rico\" merely descriptive of\n\n\"Café\" than that she would find \"RICA\" merely descriptive of\n\n\"Galletas.\"\n\n\n                                -15-\n\f      If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — M.V. adduced\n\nconsiderable evidence of the successful registration of other marks\n\nincluding the word \"rica.\"          Although M.V. introduced this evidence\n\nin an apparent effort to show that Borinquen's mark is weak, it\n\ntends to undercut M.V.'s contention that the term is, as a matter\n\nof law, merely descriptive of Borinquen's product.              After all, the\n\nPTO   requires    an    applicant     to   demonstrate   that    its   mark   is\n\ndistinctive before it will approve a registration.               See 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1052(e).    Courts frequently have accorded weight to these kinds\n\nof PTO determinations in evaluating whether a mark is descriptive\n\nor inherently distinctive.            See, e.g., Lone Star Steakhouse &\n\nSaloon, Inc. v. Alpha of Va., Inc., 43 F.3d 922, 934 (4th Cir.\n\n1995).    Given the PTO's expertise in the field, we are inclined to\n\ndo so here.      To that extent, then, the PTO's acceptance of these\n\nother marks for registration supports the idea that \"rica\" can be\n\nan inherently distinctive term.\n\n      For these reasons, we conclude that the evidence adduced to\n\ndate suggests that M.V. is unlikely to rebut the presumption of\n\ndistinctiveness        arising   from      Borinquen's   contestable        mark.\n\nConsequently,     the    district    court    appropriately     refrained    from\n\nrequiring Borinquen to prove secondary meaning.5\n\n\n\n      5\n      In the interest of completeness, we note that the record does\ncontain some evidence that bears upon the issue of secondary\nmeaning.    However, the view we take of this issue renders\nsuperfluous any evaluation of that evidence.\n\n                                       -16-\n\f     2.   Consumer Confusion.   M.V.'s remaining assignment of error\n\nattacks the district court's determination that its use of the\n\n\"Nestlé Ricas\" mark was likely to cause consumer confusion.      This\n\ncourt has enumerated eight factors to guide the inquiry into\n\nlikelihood of confusion:\n\n           (1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the\n           similarity of the goods; (3) the relationship\n           between the parties' channels of trade; (4) the\n           relationship between the parties' advertising;\n           (5) the classes of prospective purchasers; (6)\n           evidence   of   actual   confusion;   (7)   the\n           defendant's intent in adopting its mark; and\n           (8) the strength of the plaintiff's mark.\n\nAstra Pharm. Prods., Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 718 F.2d\n\n1201, 1205 (1st Cir. 1983); accord Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de\n\nPrecision v. Polaroid Corp., 657 F.2d 482, 487 (1st Cir. 1981).     A\n\nproper analysis takes cognizance of all eight factors but assigns\n\nno single factor dispositive weight.          Keds, 888 F.2d at 222;\n\nVolkswagenwerk, 814 F.2d at 817.    Because likelihood of confusion\n\nis a factbound inquiry, appellate review of a trial-level finding\n\non that issue is for clear error.       Keds, 888 F.2d at 222.\n\n     The court below applied the eight-factor screen and concluded\n\nthat, on the whole, the evidence preponderated in favor of a finding\n\nthat M.V.'s use of its mark in Puerto Rico was likely to result in\n\nconsumer confusion.   This conclusion was predicated on a measured\n\nview of the evidence.    On the one hand, the court noted that the\n\nparties' goods were dissimilar, that no actual confusion had been\n\nshown, and that no evidence existed that M.V. intended to mislead\n\n                                 -17-\n\fconsumers.     D. Ct. Op. at 6-9.    On the other hand, the court found\n\nthat the remaining factors all tended to favor a likelihood of\n\nconfusion.     Id. at 5-9.      The court then performed the necessary\n\nbalancing and determined that the latter points outweighed the\n\nformer.     Id. at 9-10.\n\n     M.V.     assails   this   determination,   arguing   that    the   court\n\nmisapplied     the   eight-factor   test   in   two   principal   ways:   by\n\nunderestimating the significance of Borinquen's failure to present\n\na consumer survey designed to show actual confusion and by deeming\n\n\"RICA\" a strong mark.      After careful perscrutation of the record,\n\nwe reject both arguments.\n\n     To begin, a trademark holder's burden is to show likelihood of\n\nconfusion, not actual confusion. While evidence of actual confusion\n\nis \"often deemed the best evidence of possible future confusion,\"\n\nAttrezzi, LLC v. Maytag Corp., 436 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir. 2006),\n\nproof of actual confusion is not essential to finding likelihood of\n\nconfusion.5    See Volkswagenwerk, 814 F.2d at 818; see also Pignons,\n\n657 F.2d at 490 (cautioning that \"[e]vidence of actual confusion is\n\nnot invariably necessary to prove likelihood of confusion\").\n\n\n     5\n      M.V.'s boast that the results of its own survey increased the\nimportance of establishing actual confusion rings hollow.       The\ndistrict court supportably found M.V.'s survey to be of scant\nevidentiary value. First, that survey was constructed to determine\nwhether potential customers could spot differences in the products'\npackaging, not to identify whether M.V.'s use of its mark created\na likelihood of confusion. D. Ct. Op. at 7. Second, the small\nsample size and large margin of error combined to cast considerable\ndoubt on its statistical integrity. Id.\n\n                                    -18-\n\f     Historically,           we    have     attached      substantial      weight    to    a\n\ntrademark      holder's      failure      to    prove     actual   confusion      only    in\n\ninstances in which the relevant products have coexisted on the\n\nmarket    for   a     long    period      of   time.       See,    e.g.,   Aktiebolaget\n\nElectrolux v. Armatron Int'l, Inc., 999 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(finding lack of evidence of actual confusion significant because\n\nproducts had coexisted in the same market for roughly six years).\n\nThis is not such a case: M.V.'s product was introduced to the Puerto\n\nRican market in April of 2003, and M.V.'s own evidence suggests that\n\nsales    did    not    proliferate          until   the    summer    of    2004.      This\n\ncorresponds to the time frame in which Borinquen discovered the\n\npresence of Nestlé Ricas and took action to protect its mark. Since\n\nthe preliminary injunction issued just over a year later, there was\n\nno protracted period of product coexistence. Nor is there any other\n\ncompelling reason why, in this case, survey evidence should be\n\nrequired at the preliminary injunction stage.                      We hold, therefore,\n\nthat while survey evidence would have been helpful, it was not\n\nindispensable to a finding of likelihood of confusion. See id.; see\n\nalso Volkswagenwerk, 814 F.2d at 818 (upholding permanent injunction\n\ndespite     plaintiff's           failure      to   produce    evidence      of     actual\n\nconfusion).\n\n     In much the same vein, the court did not clearly err in\n\ndetermining that \"RICA\" is a relatively strong mark.                               Various\n\nfactors are relevant in ascertaining the strength of a trademark,\n\n\n                                             -19-\n\fincluding the length of time the mark has been used, the trademark\n\nholder's renown in the industry, the potency of the mark in the\n\nproduct field (as measured by the number of similar registered\n\nmarks), and the trademark holder's efforts to promote and protect\n\nthe mark. See Boston Athletic Ass'n, 867 F.2d at 32; see also Keds,\n\n888 F.2d at 222. In assessing the strength of Borinquen's mark, the\n\ndistrict court found that the mark had been registered for more than\n\nthree decades; that Borinquen's \"RICA\" was the only cookie, cracker,\n\nor biscuit trademarked under that name in the United States; and\n\nthat Borinquen's efforts in promoting and protecting its mark were\n\nin conformance with industry standards.    D. Ct. Op. at 9.   These\n\nthree findings, all of which are supported by substantial evidence\n\nin the record, furnish ample grounding for the court's conclusion\n\nthat \"RICA\" should be considered a strong mark.\n\n     To say more on this issue would be supererogatory.   The short\n\nof it is that we discern no clear error in the findings of fact\n\nunderlying the district court's determination that Borinquen has a\n\nbetter-than-even chance of succeeding in establishing a likelihood\n\nof consumer confusion.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n     We need go no further.      Because Borinquen's trademark is\n\nregistered, it enjoys a presumption of inherent distinctiveness.\n\nSince M.V. failed adequately to rebut that presumption at the\n\npreliminary injunction stage, the district court did not err in\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fdetermining, without requiring evidence of secondary meaning, that\n\nBorinquen's mark was likely entitled to protection.               Nor did the\n\ncourt clearly err in finding that M.V.'s continued use of its\n\ncompeting   mark   probably     would    result   in   consumer    confusion.\n\nConsequently, both the court's determination that Borinquen had\n\nestablished   a    likelihood    of     success   on   the   merits   of   its\n\ninfringement claim and its related decision to award Borinquen\n\npreliminary injunctive relief are unimpugnable.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f",

Trading Corp. (M.V.) from advertising, distributing, or selling cookies or crackers in Puerto Rico under the trade name \"Ricas\" on the ground that such activities would likely infringe a registered trademark held by plaintiff-appellee Borinquen Biscuit Corp. (Borinquen). M.V. appeals. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borinquen is a manufacturer and distributor of \"galletas.\" There is no precise English equivalent of this Spanish word; \"galleta\" (or, in the plural, \"galletas\") encompasses all types of crackers, cookies, and biscuits. Since 1976, Borinquen has sold a round, yellowish, semi-sweet galleta in Puerto Rico under the federally registered trademark \"RICA.\" This galleta resembles a cookie. Borinquen acquired the recipe for the product and the rights to the mark from Sunland Biscuit Company (Sunland), which had sold the galleta in Puerto Rico under that mark since 1962. Sunland officially registered the mark on the principal register of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) in 1969. The federal registration states that \"the Spanish word `Rica' may be translated as `rich.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borinquen's \"RICA\" has always borne a logo that consists of a red circle encompassing the white-lettered phrase \"Galletas RICA Sunland.\" Borinquen registered both the mark \"RICA\" and the product's logo with the Puerto Rico Department of State in 2000. It currently sells the product in predominately red-and-white packaging, with the circular logo centered against a background consisting of rows of the galletas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While other firms have registered \"rica\" trademarks for different kinds of products (e.g., bananas, brown sugar, and tobacco), Borinquen's \"RICA\" is the only cookie, cracker, or biscuit registered under that name in the United States. Moreover, until the events at issue here, Borinquen was the only company to use the word \"rica\" in connection with the marketing or distribution of galletas in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tectonic plates shifted in April of 2003, when M.V. began selling a round, yellowish, salty galleta bearing the name \"Nestl&#233; Ricas.\" This galleta, which resembles a cracker, is manufactured by Nestl&#233; Ecuador and imported by M.V. The product logo consists of a white oval with the name \"Ricas\" centered in red letters and with a red square in the upper right-hand corner of the oval bearing the white-lettered brand name \"Nestl&#233;.\" M.V.'s packaging is mostly red and white, albeit with some yellow and blue design. The logo is centered in the upper half of the box against a background of scattered galletas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or around the summer of 2004, Borinquen learned that M.V. was marketing Nestl&#233; Ricas in earnest. Since both parties' galletas were being sold in Puerto Rican supermarkets and convenience stores, this was a matter of considerable concern. Borinquen informed M.V. that it believed M.V.'s distribution of galletas under the name \"Ricas\" infringed its registered trademark and asked M.V. to cease and desist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When M.V. refused, Borinquen filed suit for damages and injunctive relief in the federal district court. In its complaint, Borinquen alleged that M.V.'s use of the \"Ricas\" mark, coupled with similarities in trade dress, infringed its trademark and trade dress rights under federal law. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1114(1), 1125(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> M.V. denied the essential allegations of the complaint and counterclaimed for cancellation of Borinquen's \"RICA\" mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coincident with the institution of suit, Borinquen moved for a preliminary injunction. M.V. opposed that motion. The district court held an evidentiary hearing on May 31 and June 7, 2005. The president of each company testified about the advertising and sales history of his product. In addition, each side presented expert testimony anent the likelihood of confusion. The expert witnesses approached the problem from different directions. Borinquen's witness (an expert in advertising and brand recognition) polled others in his field and concluded that confusion was probable. M.V.'s witness (an expert in market research) conducted a survey of 100 consumers in metropolitan areas and concluded that consumers could recognize differences in the packaging of the two products. On that basis, she hypothesized that the marketing of Nestl&#233; Ricas created no likelihood of confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 2005, the district court issued a preliminary injunction that enjoined M.V. from advertising, distributing, or selling any cookies or crackers in Puerto Rico under the name \"Ricas.\" <i>Borinquen Biscuit Corp. v. M.V. Trading Corp.,</i> No. 04-2070, slip op. at 12 (D.P.R. Sept. 6, 2005) (D.Ct.Op.). The court concluded, inter alia, that Borinquen was likely to succeed in establishing both that its \"RICA\" mark was entitled to federal trademark protection and that M.V.'s use of the \"Ricas\" mark was likely to foment consumer confusion. This interlocutory appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, M.V. advances two principal assignments of error. First, it charges that the district court blundered in not requiring Borinquen to establish that the \"RICA\" mark had acquired secondary meaning. Second, it maintains that the district court mistakenly concluded that M.V.'s product was likely to cause consumer confusion. After delineating the legal standards applicable to grants of preliminary injunctive relief, we address each of these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Preliminary Injunction Standard.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preliminary injunction standard is familiar. Before granting this type of relief, a nisi prius court must consider (1) the likelihood of the movant's success on the merits; (2) the anticipated incidence of irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; (3) the balance of relevant equities (i.e., the hardship that will befall the non-movant if the injunction issues contrasted with the hardship that will befall the movant if the injunction does not issue); and (4) the impact, if any, of the court's action on the public interest. <i>Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996); <i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert,</i> 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1991). While all these factors must be weighed, the cynosure of this four-part test is more often than not the movant's likelihood of success on the merits. <i>See Weaver v. Henderson,</i> 984 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir.1993) (\"The <i>sine qua non</i> of [the four-factor] formulation is whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits.\"). The importance of that inquiry is magnified in trademark cases because the resolution of the other three factors will depend in large part on whether the movant is likely to succeed in establishing infringement. <i>See Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp.,</i> 888 F.2d 215, 220 (1st Cir.1989); <i>see also I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co.,</i> 163 F.3d 27, 33 (1st Cir.1998) (noting that irreparable harm can be assumed if a trademark holder demonstrates that it is likely to succeed in establishing infringement). This emphasis on likelihood of success is fully consistent with the tenet that, as a matter of public policy, trademarks should be protected against infringing uses. <i>See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Wheeler,</i> 814 F.2d 812, 820 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court's conclusions on these factors and its determinations regarding their relative weighting engender deferential appellate review. <i>See Ross-Simons,</i> 102 F.3d at 16. Thus, a decision to grant a preliminary injunction will stand unless the court \"mistook the law, clearly erred in its factual assessments, or otherwise abused its discretion in granting the interim relief.\" <i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> 260 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, M.V. does not challenge the district court's determinations regarding the last three components of the four-part preliminary injunction framework. Consequently, we need consider here only the first of the four factors: likelihood of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Likelihood of Success.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before a party can succeed in an infringement action, it must demonstrate both that its mark merits protection and that the allegedly infringing use is likely to result in consumer confusion. <i>Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co.,</i> 9 F.3d 175, 180 (1st Cir.1993). For purposes of a preliminary injunction, however, the trademark holder need only show a likelihood of success on these two elements. <i>See Guilbert,</i> 934 F.2d at 6 (explaining that \"a court's conclusions as to the merits of the issues presented on preliminary injunction are to be understood as statements of probable outcomes,\" not as final determinations). M.V. claims that Borinquen did not adequately demonstrate below that it was likely to satisfy its burden with respect to either element. We examine each facet of this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Eligibility for Trademark Protection.</i> We start with M.V.'s contention that the district court erred, as a matter of law, in determining that Borinquen's \"RICA\" mark was entitled to trademark protection. This contention proceeds from the premise that the court should have required Borinquen to adduce evidence that its mark had acquired secondary meaning. We reject this premise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common ground that, in order to be eligible for trademark protection, a mark must qualify as distinctive. <i>See Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 763, 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992). When considering whether a mark meets that standard, courts often employ a taxonomy that classifies marks along a continuum of increasing distinctiveness. That continuum contains five categories: generic marks, descriptive marks, suggestive marks, arbitrary marks, and fanciful marks. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 768; <i>I.P. Lund,</i> 163 F.3d at 39. By definition, generic marks can never be ranked as distinctive. <i>Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park &amp; Fly, Inc.,</i> 469 U.S. 189, 194, 105 S.Ct. 658, 83 L.Ed.2d 582 (1985). In contrast, suggestive, arbitrary, and fanciful marks are considered inherently distinctive. <i>Two Pesos,</i> 505 U.S. at 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The category of descriptive marks is more protean in nature. Descriptiveness and distinctiveness are neither congruent concepts nor productive of mutually exclusive classifications. Descriptive marks are tentatively considered non-distinctive but can attain distinctive status upon an affirmative showing of secondary meaning. <i>Id.</i> at 769. This showing requires the trademark holder to establish that \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of [the mark] is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.\" <i>Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc.,</i> 456 U.S. 844, 851 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982). A mark is, therefore, considered distinctive (and, thus, eligible for trademark protection) if it either is inherently distinctive or exhibits acquired distinctiveness gained through secondary meaning. <i>Two Pesos,</i> 505 U.S. at 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both registered and unregistered trademarks may be eligible for protection against infringing uses. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1114, 1125; <i>see also Keebler Co. v. Rovira Biscuit Corp.,</i> 624 F.2d 366, 372 (1st Cir.1980). Withal, the proper mode of analysis regarding whether a mark satisfies the distinctiveness criterion varies based on whether or not the mark is registered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party seeks protection for an unregistered trademark, it is incumbent on that party to demonstrate affirmatively that its mark is distinctive (either inherently or through acquired secondary meaning). <i>Boston Beer,</i> 9 F.3d at 180. The trial court must engage in a specific inquiry to determine whether the proponent has met that burden. <i>See, e.g., I.P. Lund,</i> 163 F.3d at 39-41. Here, however, Borinquen's mark is registered, so this requirement does not automatically attach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party seeks protection for a registered trademark, its burdens are lighter. Registration is \"prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1115(a). When, as in this case, the PTO registers a mark without first requiring the applicant to prove secondary meaning, the holder of the mark is entitled \"to a presumption that its registered trademark is inherently distinctive, as opposed to merely descriptive.\" <i>Equine Techs., Inc. v. Equitechnology, Inc.,</i> 68 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see Quabaug Rubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe Co.,</i> 567 F.2d 154, 161 n. 12 (1st Cir.1977) (explaining that \"registration is prima facie evidence that the . . . mark is distinctive per se\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of that presumption varies depending on whether the registered mark has attained incontestable status. If the registered mark has become incontestable through the owner's compliance with the applicable statutory formalities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the presumption is conclusive. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1115(b). If, however, the registered mark remains contestable, the putative infringer may defend a suit on the ground that the mark does not merit protection because it is not inherently distinctive (i.e., not suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful) but, rather, is merely descriptive of the product. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1115(a). It follows, then, that under the Lanham Act, the effect of registration for a contestable mark is \"to shift the burden of proof from the plaintiff. . . to the defendant, who must introduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of the plaintiff's right to [exclusive] use\" through proof that the mark is merely descriptive. <i>Keebler Co.,</i> 624 F.2d at 373. Inasmuch as Borinquen's mark is registered but contestable (that is, Borinquen has not satisfied the requirements of 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1065), <i>see supra</i> note 3, this is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That sets the stage for our analysis. When, as now, a mark is registered but contestable, a putative infringer must offer significantly probative evidence to show that the mark is merely descriptive. Then&#8212;and only then&#8212;does the burden of proof shift back, so that the party seeking protection must take an alternative route and assume the devoir of persuasion on the issue of whether its mark has acquired secondary meaning. <i>See, e.g., Flexitized, Inc. v. Nat'l Flexitized Corp.,</i> 335 F.2d 774, 779-80 (2d Cir.1964). Simply <i>alleging</i> descriptiveness is insufficient to compel the holder of a registered mark to go forward with proof of secondary meaning; the putative infringer must <i>prove</i> descriptiveness by a preponderance of the evidence before the mix of issues changes and the burden of persuasion on the new issue (secondary meaning) reverts to the trademark holder. <i>See Keebler Co.,</i> 624 F.2d at 373. If the putative infringer does not cross that threshold, the presumption holds and distinctiveness is presumed. <i>See PIC Design Corp. v. Bearings Specialty Co.,</i> 436 F.2d 804, 807 (1st Cir. 1971). In that event, the court can proceed to consider the remaining elements of the infringement claim without first demanding that the trademark holder offer proof of secondary meaning. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, these background principles get the grease from the goose. Before us, M.V. insists that the district court erroneously treated Borinquen's mark as incontestable because it did not require proof of secondary meaning. This argument conflates two issues and, in the bargain, mischaracterizes what transpired below. The record, fairly read, supports a determination that M.V. failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the \"RICA\" mark is merely descriptive. Therefore, the district court was warranted in not taking the next step and shifting the burden to Borinquen to show that its registered but contestable mark had acquired secondary meaning. <i>See Keebler Co.,</i> 624 F.2d at 373. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of distinctiveness ordinarily presents a question of fact. <i>Equine Techs.,</i> 68 F.3d at 544. Although M.V. raised a descriptiveness defense, it presented minimal evidence and argument in support of that defense. For example, while M.V. conducted a survey on the issue of consumer confusion, it adduced no comparable evidence in support of its contention that Borinquen's mark is merely descriptive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> By like token, M.V. devoted scant attention to the question of descriptiveness in its post-hearing brief. Given this dearth of both evidence and argumentation, we think that the decision to allow the distinctiveness presumption to control withstands scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M.V.'s counter-arguments, though ably presented, are not sufficient, at the preliminary injunction stage, to offset the finding that Borinquen enjoyed a likelihood of success on the merits. First, M.V. states that \"RICA\" should be dubbed a descriptive mark because the word, translated literally, means \"tasty\" or \"rich\" and, therefore, describes a desirable characteristic of a cookie or cracker. With respect to a registered mark, however, the putative infringer's burden is not simply to show that the mark describes a feature of the trademark holder's product; rather, it must show that consumers regard the mark as <i>merely</i> descriptive of that product. <i>See id.</i> at 545. Here, the record contains no such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This shortcoming is all the more glaring because the first language of the prototypical Puerto Rican consumer is Spanish and, as Borinquen notes, Spanish grammatical rules caution against attributing a purely adjectival meaning to the term \"RICA\" when viewed in the context of Borinquen's logo: \"Galletas RICA Sunland.\" A particular Spanish-language grammatical rule&#8212; the rule of concordance&#8212;requires strict relationships of gender and number between adjectives and nouns. <i>See</i> Gerald Erichsen, Spanish for Beginners: Noun-Adjective Agreement (2006), http://spanish.about.com/cs/forbeginners/a/adjective-agree.htm. Hence, Borinquen's mark would need to use the plural (\"RICAS\") if it were intended to serve as a grammatically correct descriptor of the noun \"Galletas.\" We think it follows that the average Spanish-speaking consumer would be unlikely to view the non-concordant mark as a mere descriptor for the underlying product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M.V.'s second counter-argument is equally unconvincing. It maintains that Borinquen's mark must be considered descriptive because, in 1964, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court determined that the term \"Rico\" (the masculine of \"Rica\") was merely descriptive of the product \"Caf&#233; Rico\" and, thus, not entitled to protection under local law. <i>Cooperativa de Cafeteros v. Col&#243;n Col&#243;n,</i> 91 P.R.R. 361 (1964). However, the distinctiveness inquiry is product-specific. <i>See Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan,</i> 867 F.2d 22, 27 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that when a party challenges the validity of a registered mark, it must show that the primary significance of the mark to the consuming public is to merely to describe a particular product). A term that merely describes one product may well be distinctive as to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"Caf&#233; Rico,\" as to which the Puerto Rico court found that the adjective merely described the noun, comports with the Spanish-language rule of concordance for nouns and adjectives whereas the phrase \"Galletas RICA,\" as to which the district court found that the adjective did not merely describe the noun, does not. Given this fractured grammatical usage, it seems more probable that a Spanish-speaking consumer would find \"Rico\" merely descriptive of \"Caf&#233;\" than that she would find \"RICA\" merely descriptive of \"Galletas.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed&#8212;and we doubt that it is&#8212;M.V. adduced considerable evidence of the successful registration of other marks including the word \"rica.\" Although M.V. introduced this evidence in an apparent effort to show that Borinquen's mark is weak, it tends to undercut M.V.'s contention that the term is, as a matter of law, merely descriptive of Borinquen's product. After all, the PTO requires an applicant to demonstrate that its mark is distinctive before it will approve a registration. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1052(e). Courts frequently have accorded weight to these kinds of PTO determinations in evaluating whether a mark is descriptive or inherently distinctive. <i>See, e.g., Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of Va., Inc.,</i> 43 F.3d 922, 934 (4th Cir.1995). Given the PTO's expertise in the field, we are inclined to do so here. To that extent, then, the PTO's acceptance of these other marks for registration supports the idea that \"rica\" can be an inherently distinctive term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that the evidence adduced to date suggests that M.V. is unlikely to rebut the presumption of distinctiveness arising from Borinquen's contestable mark. Consequently, the district court appropriately refrained from requiring Borinquen to prove secondary meaning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Consumer Confusion.</i> M.V.'s remaining assignment of error attacks the district court's determination that its use of the \"Nestl&#233; Ricas\" mark was likely to cause consumer confusion. This court has enumerated eight factors to guide the inquiry into likelihood of confusion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the similarity of the goods; (3) the relationship between the parties' channels of trade; (4) the relationship between the parties' advertising; (5) the classes of prospective purchasers; (6) evidence of actual confusion; (7) the defendant's intent in adopting its mark; and (8) the strength of the plaintiff's mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Astra Pharm. Prods., Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc.,</i> 718 F.2d 1201, 1205 (1st Cir.1983); <i>accord Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v. Polaroid Corp.,</i> 657 F.2d 482, 487 (1st Cir.1981). A proper analysis takes cognizance of all eight factors but assigns no single factor dispositive weight. <i>Keds,</i> 888 F.2d at 222; <i>Volkswagenwerk,</i> 814 F.2d at 817. Because likelihood of confusion is a factbound inquiry, appellate review of a trial-level finding on that issue is for clear error. <i>Keds,</i> 888 F.2d at 222.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below applied the eight-factor screen and concluded that, on the whole, the evidence preponderated in favor of a finding that M.V.'s use of its mark in Puerto Rico was likely to result in consumer confusion. This conclusion was predicated on a measured view of the evidence. On the one hand, the court noted that the parties' goods were dissimilar, that no actual confusion had been shown, and that no evidence existed that M.V. intended to mislead consumers. D. Ct. Op. at 6-9. On the other hand, the court found that the remaining factors all tended to favor a likelihood of confusion. <i>Id.</i> at 5-9. The court then performed the necessary balancing and determined that the latter points outweighed the former. <i>Id.</i> at 9-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M.V. assails this determination, arguing that the court misapplied the eight-factor test in two principal ways: by underestimating the significance of Borinquen's failure to present a consumer survey designed to show actual confusion and by deeming \"RICA\" a strong mark. After careful perscrutation of the record, we reject both arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, a trademark holder's burden is to show likelihood of confusion, not actual confusion. While evidence of actual confusion is \"often deemed the best evidence of possible future confusion,\" <i>Attrezzi, LLC v. Maytag Corp.,</i> 436 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir.2006), proof of actual confusion is not essential to finding likelihood of confusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Volkswagenwerk,</i> 814 F.2d at 818; <i>see also Pignons,</i> 657 F.2d at 490 (cautioning that \"[e]vidence of actual confusion is not invariably necessary to prove likelihood of confusion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, we have attached substantial weight to a trademark holder's failure to prove actual confusion only in instances in which the relevant products have coexisted on the market for a long period of time. <i>See, e.g., Aktiebolaget Electrolux v. Armatron Int'l, Inc.,</i> 999 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1993) (finding lack of evidence of actual confusion significant because products had coexisted in the same market for roughly six years). This is not such a case: M.V.'s product was introduced to the Puerto Rican market in April of 2003, and M.V.'s own evidence suggests that sales did not proliferate until the summer of 2004. This corresponds to the time frame in which Borinquen discovered the presence of Nestl&#233; Ricas and took action to protect its mark. Since the preliminary injunction issued just over a year later, there was no protracted period of product coexistence. Nor is there any other compelling reason why, in this case, survey evidence should be required at the preliminary injunction stage. We hold, therefore, that while survey evidence would have been helpful, it was not indispensable to a finding of likelihood of confusion. <i>See id.; see also Volkswagenwerk,</i> 814 F.2d at 818 (upholding permanent injunction despite plaintiff's failure to produce evidence of actual confusion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In much the same vein, the court did not clearly err in determining that \"RICA\" is a relatively strong mark. Various factors are relevant in ascertaining the strength of a trademark, including the length of time the mark has been used, the trademark holder's renown in the industry, the potency of the mark in the product field (as measured by the number of similar registered marks), and the trademark holder's efforts to promote and protect the mark. <i>See Boston Athletic Ass'n,</i> 867 F.2d at 32; <i>see also Keds,</i> 888 F.2d at 222. In assessing the strength of Borinquen's mark, the district court found that the mark had been registered for more than three decades; that Borinquen's \"RICA\" was the only cookie, cracker, or biscuit trademarked under that name in the United States; and that Borinquen's efforts in promoting and protecting its mark were in conformance with industry standards. D. Ct. Op. at 9. These three findings, all of which are supported by substantial evidence in the record, furnish ample grounding for the court's conclusion that \"RICA\" should be considered a strong mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this issue would be supererogatory. The short of it is that we discern no clear error in the findings of fact underlying the district court's determination that Borinquen has a better-than-even chance of succeeding in establishing a likelihood of consumer confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Because Borinquen's trademark is registered, it enjoys a presumption of inherent distinctiveness. Since M.V. failed adequately to rebut that presumption at the preliminary injunction stage, the district court did not err in determining, without requiring evidence of secondary meaning, that Borinquen's mark was likely entitled to protection. Nor did the court clearly err in finding that M.V.'s continued use of its competing mark probably would result in consumer confusion. Consequently, both the court's determination that Borinquen had established a likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement claim and its related decision to award Borinquen preliminary injunctive relief are unimpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Borinquen also brought a dilution claim under 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c).

In that instance, however, the presumption is not that the mark is inherently distinctive, but, rather, that the mark is valid because it enjoys secondary meaning. <i>See Arrow Fastener Co. v. Stanley Works,</i> 59 F.3d 384, 393 (2d Cir.1995). Because Borinquen's mark was not registered on this basis, we do not address the effect of a secondary meaning presumption.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> A mark becomes incontestable when its owner files an affidavit with the PTO attesting that the following requirements have been met: (i) there has been no final decision adverse to its ownership or enforcement rights for the preceding five-year period; (ii) there is no pending case or proceeding regarding the owner's rights in the mark; and (iii) the owner is still using the mark<i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1065.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The absence of reliable survey evidence is not, in and of itself, dispositive when a putative infringer attempts to establish that a registered mark is not entitled to protection on descriptiveness grounds. The relevant inquiry focuses on the primary significance of the mark to the product's consumers<i>See Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan,</i> 867 F.2d 22, 27 (1st Cir.1989). The preferred form of proof includes direct evidence (such as consumer surveys) suggesting that the average purchaser actually regards the mark as merely descriptive of the plaintiff's product. <i>See Keebler Co.,</i> 624 F.2d at 375. Direct evidence is not, however, an absolute prerequisite. <i>See id.</i> (noting that, in some instances, indirect evidence may suffice).

Trading Corp. (M.V.) from advertising, distributing, or selling cookies or crackers in Puerto Rico under the trade name \"Ricas\" on the ground that such activities would likely infringe a registered trademark held by plaintiff-appellee Borinquen Biscuit Corp. (Borinquen). M.V. appeals. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1). We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borinquen is a manufacturer and distributor of \"galletas.\" There is no precise English equivalent of this Spanish word; \"galleta\" (or, in the plural, \"galletas\") encompasses all types of crackers, cookies, and biscuits. Since 1976, Borinquen has sold a round, yellowish, semi-sweet galleta in Puerto Rico under the federally registered trademark \"RICA.\" This galleta resembles a cookie. Borinquen acquired the recipe for the product and the rights to the mark from Sunland Biscuit Company (Sunland), which had sold the galleta in Puerto Rico under that mark since 1962. Sunland officially registered the mark on the principal register of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) in 1969. The federal registration states that \"the Spanish word `Rica' may be translated as `rich.'\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borinquen's \"RICA\" has always borne a logo that consists of a red circle encompassing the white-lettered phrase \"Galletas RICA Sunland.\" Borinquen registered both the mark \"RICA\" and the product's logo with the Puerto Rico Department of State in 2000. It currently sells the product in predominately red-and-white packaging, with the circular logo centered against a background consisting of rows of the galletas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While other firms have registered \"rica\" trademarks for different kinds of products (e.g., bananas, brown sugar, and tobacco), Borinquen's \"RICA\" is the only cookie, cracker, or biscuit registered under that name in the United States. Moreover, until the events at issue here, Borinquen was the only company to use the word \"rica\" in connection with the marketing or distribution of galletas in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tectonic plates shifted in April of 2003, when M.V. began selling a round, yellowish, salty galleta bearing the name \"Nestl&#233; Ricas.\" This galleta, which resembles a cracker, is manufactured by Nestl&#233; Ecuador and imported by M.V. The product logo consists of a white oval with the name \"Ricas\" centered in red letters and with a red square in the upper right-hand corner of the oval bearing the white-lettered brand name \"Nestl&#233;.\" M.V.'s packaging is mostly red and white, albeit with some yellow and blue design. The logo is centered in the upper half of the box against a background of scattered galletas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or around the summer of 2004, Borinquen learned that M.V. was marketing Nestl&#233; Ricas in earnest. Since both parties' galletas were being sold in Puerto Rican supermarkets and convenience stores, this was a matter of considerable concern. Borinquen informed M.V. that it believed M.V.'s distribution of galletas under the name \"Ricas\" infringed its registered trademark and asked M.V. to cease and desist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When M.V. refused, Borinquen filed suit for damages and injunctive relief in the federal district court. In its complaint, Borinquen alleged that M.V.'s use of the \"Ricas\" mark, coupled with similarities in trade dress, infringed its trademark and trade dress rights under federal law. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1114(1), 1125(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> M.V. denied the essential allegations of the complaint and counterclaimed for cancellation of Borinquen's \"RICA\" mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coincident with the institution of suit, Borinquen moved for a preliminary injunction. M.V. opposed that motion. The district court held an evidentiary hearing on May 31 and June 7, 2005. The president of each company testified about the advertising and sales history of his product. In addition, each side presented expert testimony anent the likelihood of confusion. The expert witnesses approached the problem from different directions. Borinquen's witness (an expert in advertising and brand recognition) polled others in his field and concluded that confusion was probable. M.V.'s witness (an expert in market research) conducted a survey of 100 consumers in metropolitan areas and concluded that consumers could recognize differences in the packaging of the two products. On that basis, she hypothesized that the marketing of Nestl&#233; Ricas created no likelihood of confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 6, 2005, the district court issued a preliminary injunction that enjoined M.V. from advertising, distributing, or selling any cookies or crackers in Puerto Rico under the name \"Ricas.\" <i>Borinquen Biscuit Corp. v. M.V. Trading Corp.,</i> No. 04-2070, slip op. at 12 (D.P.R. Sept. 6, 2005) (D.Ct.Op.). The court concluded, inter alia, that Borinquen was likely to succeed in establishing both that its \"RICA\" mark was entitled to federal trademark protection and that M.V.'s use of the \"Ricas\" mark was likely to foment consumer confusion. This interlocutory appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, M.V. advances two principal assignments of error. First, it charges that the district court blundered in not requiring Borinquen to establish that the \"RICA\" mark had acquired secondary meaning. Second, it maintains that the district court mistakenly concluded that M.V.'s product was likely to cause consumer confusion. After delineating the legal standards applicable to grants of preliminary injunctive relief, we address each of these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Preliminary Injunction Standard.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preliminary injunction standard is familiar. Before granting this type of relief, a nisi prius court must consider (1) the likelihood of the movant's success on the merits; (2) the anticipated incidence of irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; (3) the balance of relevant equities (i.e., the hardship that will befall the non-movant if the injunction issues contrasted with the hardship that will befall the movant if the injunction does not issue); and (4) the impact, if any, of the court's action on the public interest. <i>Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, 15 (1st Cir. 1996); <i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v.

While all these factors must be weighed, the cynosure of this four-part test is more often than not the movant's likelihood of success on the merits. <i>See Weaver v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599015\"><a href=\"/opinion/599015/ralph-s-weaver-etc-v-charles-henderson-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1993) (\"The <i>sine qua non</i> of [the four-factor] formulation is whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits.\"). The importance of that inquiry is magnified in trademark cases because the resolution of the other three factors will depend in large part on whether the movant is likely to succeed in establishing infringement. <i>See Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531209\"><a href=\"/opinion/531209/the-keds-corp-v-renee-international-trading-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 220 (1st Cir.1989); <i>see also I.P.

This emphasis on likelihood of success is fully consistent with the tenet that, as a matter of public policy, trademarks should be protected against infringing uses. <i>See Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Wheeler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485241\"><a href=\"/opinion/485241/volkswagenwerk-aktiengesellschaft-v-kenneth-g-wheeler/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 820 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A trial court's conclusions on these factors and its determinations regarding their relative weighting engender deferential appellate review. <i>See Ross-Simons,</i> 102 F.3d at 16. Thus, a decision to grant a preliminary injunction will stand unless the court \"mistook the law, clearly erred in its factual assessments, or otherwise abused its discretion in granting the interim relief.\" <i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199554\"><a href=\"/opinion/199554/mcguire-v-reilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, M.V. does not challenge the district court's determinations regarding the last three components of the four-part preliminary injunction framework. Consequently, we need consider here only the first of the four factors: likelihood of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Likelihood of Success.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before a party can succeed in an infringement action, it must demonstrate both that its mark merits protection and that the allegedly infringing use is likely to result in consumer confusion. <i>Boston Beer Co. v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195026\"><a href=\"/opinion/195026/boston-beer-company-v-slesar-bros/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 180 (1st Cir.1993). For purposes of a preliminary injunction, however, the trademark holder need only show a likelihood of success on these two elements. <i>See Guilbert,</i> 934 F.2d at 6 (explaining that \"a court's conclusions as to the merits of the issues presented on preliminary injunction are to be understood as statements of probable outcomes,\" not as final determinations). M.V. claims that Borinquen did not adequately demonstrate below that it was likely to satisfy its burden with respect to either element. We examine each facet of this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Eligibility for Trademark Protection.</i> We start with M.V.'s contention that the district court erred, as a matter of law, in determining that Borinquen's \"RICA\" mark was entitled to trademark protection. This contention proceeds from the premise that the court should have required Borinquen to adduce evidence that its mark had acquired secondary meaning. We reject this premise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common ground that, in order to be eligible for trademark protection, a mark must qualify as distinctive. <i>See Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span>, 769, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span> (1992). When considering whether a mark meets that standard, courts often employ a taxonomy that classifies marks along a continuum of increasing distinctiveness. That continuum contains five categories: generic marks, descriptive marks, suggestive marks, arbitrary marks, and fanciful marks. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> at 768; <i>I.P. Lund,</i> 163 F.3d at 39. By definition, generic marks can never be ranked as distinctive. <i>Park 'N Fly, Inc. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span> (1985). In contrast, suggestive, arbitrary, and fanciful marks are considered inherently distinctive. <i>Two Pesos,</i> 505 U.S. at 768, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Descriptiveness and distinctiveness are neither congruent concepts nor productive of mutually exclusive classifications. Descriptive marks are tentatively considered non-distinctive but can attain distinctive status upon an affirmative showing of secondary meaning. <i>Id.</i> at 769. This showing requires the trademark holder to establish that \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of [the mark] is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.\" <i>Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110720\"><a href=\"/opinion/110720/inwood-laboratories-inc-v-ives-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 851 n. 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110720\"><a href=\"/opinion/110720/inwood-laboratories-inc-v-ives-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span> (1982). A mark is, therefore, considered distinctive (and, thus, eligible for trademark protection) if it either is inherently distinctive or exhibits acquired distinctiveness gained through secondary meaning. <i>Two Pesos,</i> 505 U.S. at 769, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Withal, the proper mode of analysis regarding whether a mark satisfies the distinctiveness criterion varies based on whether or not the mark is registered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party seeks protection for an unregistered trademark, it is incumbent on that party to demonstrate affirmatively that its mark is distinctive (either inherently or through acquired secondary meaning). <i>Boston Beer,</i> 9 F.3d at 180. The trial court must engage in a specific inquiry to determine whether the proponent has met that burden. <i>See, e.g., I.P. Lund,</i> 163 F.3d at 39-41. Here, however, Borinquen's mark is registered, so this requirement does not automatically attach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party seeks protection for a registered trademark, its burdens are lighter. Registration is \"prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1115(a). When, as in this case, the PTO registers a mark without first requiring the applicant to prove secondary meaning, the holder of the mark is entitled \"to a presumption that its registered trademark is inherently distinctive, as opposed to merely descriptive.\" <i>Equine Techs., Inc. v. Equitechnology, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196378\"><a href=\"/opinion/196378/equine-v-equitechnology/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 545 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see Quabaug Rubber Co. v.

If the registered mark has become incontestable through the owner's compliance with the applicable statutory formalities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the presumption is conclusive. 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1115(b). If, however, the registered mark remains contestable, the putative infringer may defend a suit on the ground that the mark does not merit protection because it is not inherently distinctive (i.e., not suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful) but, rather, is merely descriptive of the product. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1115(a). It follows, then, that under the Lanham Act, the effect of registration for a contestable mark is \"to shift the burden of proof from the plaintiff. . . to the defendant, who must introduce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of the plaintiff's right to [exclusive] use\" through proof that the mark is merely descriptive. <i>Keebler Co.,</i> 624 F.2d at 373. Inasmuch as Borinquen's mark is registered but contestable (that is, Borinquen has not satisfied the requirements of 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1065), <i>see supra</i> note 3, this is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That sets the stage for our analysis. When, as now, a mark is registered but contestable, a putative infringer must offer significantly probative evidence to show that the mark is merely descriptive. Then&#8212;and only then&#8212;does the burden of proof shift back, so that the party seeking protection must take an alternative route and assume the devoir of persuasion on the issue of whether its mark has acquired secondary meaning. <i>See, e.g., Flexitized, Inc. v. Nat'l Flexitized Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"265277\"><a href=\"/opinion/265277/flexitized-inc-and-flexitized-sales-corporation-v-national-flexitized/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>, 779-80 (2d Cir.1964). Simply <i>alleging</i> descriptiveness is insufficient to compel the holder of a registered mark to go forward with proof of secondary meaning; the putative infringer must <i>prove</i> descriptiveness by a preponderance of the evidence before the mix of issues changes and the burden of persuasion on the new issue (secondary meaning) reverts to the trademark holder. <i>See Keebler Co.,</i> 624 F.2d at 373. If the putative infringer does not cross that threshold, the presumption holds and distinctiveness is presumed. <i>See PIC Design Corp. v. Bearings Specialty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"294170\"><a href=\"/opinion/294170/pic-design-corp-v-bearings-specialty-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 807 (1st Cir. 1971). In that event, the court can proceed to consider the remaining elements of the infringement claim without first demanding that the trademark holder offer proof of secondary meaning. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, these background principles get the grease from the goose. Before us, M.V. insists that the district court erroneously treated Borinquen's mark as incontestable because it did not require proof of secondary meaning. This argument conflates two issues and, in the bargain, mischaracterizes what transpired below. The record, fairly read, supports a determination that M.V. failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the \"RICA\" mark is merely descriptive. Therefore, the district court was warranted in not taking the next step and shifting the burden to Borinquen to show that its registered but contestable mark had acquired secondary meaning. <i>See Keebler Co.,</i> 624 F.2d at 373. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of distinctiveness ordinarily presents a question of fact. <i>Equine Techs.,</i> 68 F.3d at 544. Although M.V. raised a descriptiveness defense, it presented minimal evidence and argument in support of that defense. For example, while M.V. conducted a survey on the issue of consumer confusion, it adduced no comparable evidence in support of its contention that Borinquen's mark is merely descriptive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> By like token, M.V. devoted scant attention to the question of descriptiveness in its post-hearing brief. Given this dearth of both evidence and argumentation, we think that the decision to allow the distinctiveness presumption to control withstands scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M.V.'s counter-arguments, though ably presented, are not sufficient, at the preliminary injunction stage, to offset the finding that Borinquen enjoyed a likelihood of success on the merits. First, M.V. states that \"RICA\" should be dubbed a descriptive mark because the word, translated literally, means \"tasty\" or \"rich\" and, therefore, describes a desirable characteristic of a cookie or cracker. With respect to a registered mark, however, the putative infringer's burden is not simply to show that the mark describes a feature of the trademark holder's product; rather, it must show that consumers regard the mark as <i>merely</i> descriptive of that product. <i>See id.</i> at 545. Here, the record contains no such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This shortcoming is all the more glaring because the first language of the prototypical Puerto Rican consumer is Spanish and, as Borinquen notes, Spanish grammatical rules caution against attributing a purely adjectival meaning to the term \"RICA\" when viewed in the context of Borinquen's logo: \"Galletas RICA Sunland.\" A particular Spanish-language grammatical rule&#8212; the rule of concordance&#8212;requires strict relationships of gender and number between adjectives and nouns. <i>See</i> Gerald Erichsen, Spanish for Beginners: Noun-Adjective Agreement (2006), http://spanish.about.com/cs/forbeginners/a/adjective-agree.htm. Hence, Borinquen's mark would need to use the plural (\"RICAS\") if it were intended to serve as a grammatically correct descriptor of the noun \"Galletas.\" We think it follows that the average Spanish-speaking consumer would be unlikely to view the non-concordant mark as a mere descriptor for the underlying product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M.V.'s second counter-argument is equally unconvincing. It maintains that Borinquen's mark must be considered descriptive because, in 1964, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court determined that the term \"Rico\" (the masculine of \"Rica\") was merely descriptive of the product \"Caf&#233; Rico\" and, thus, not entitled to protection under local law. <i>Cooperativa de Cafeteros v. Col&#243;n Col&#243;n,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></span> (1964). However, the distinctiveness inquiry is product-specific. <i>See Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518087\"><a href=\"/opinion/518087/boston-athletic-association-v-mark-sullivan-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that when a party challenges the validity of a registered mark, it must show that the primary significance of the mark to the consuming public is to merely to describe a particular product). A term that merely describes one product may well be distinctive as to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The phrase \"Caf&#233; Rico,\" as to which the Puerto Rico court found that the adjective merely described the noun, comports with the Spanish-language rule of concordance for nouns and adjectives whereas the phrase \"Galletas RICA,\" as to which the district court found that the adjective did not merely describe the noun, does not. Given this fractured grammatical usage, it seems more probable that a Spanish-speaking consumer would find \"Rico\" merely descriptive of \"Caf&#233;\" than that she would find \"RICA\" merely descriptive of \"Galletas.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed&#8212;and we doubt that it is&#8212;M.V. adduced considerable evidence of the successful registration of other marks including the word \"rica.\" Although M.V. introduced this evidence in an apparent effort to show that Borinquen's mark is weak, it tends to undercut M.V.'s contention that the term is, as a matter of law, merely descriptive of Borinquen's product. After all, the PTO requires an applicant to demonstrate that its mark is distinctive before it will approve a registration. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1052(e). Courts frequently have accorded weight to these kinds of PTO determinations in evaluating whether a mark is descriptive or inherently distinctive. <i>See, e.g., Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of Va., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685608\"><a href=\"/opinion/685608/lone-star-steakhouse-saloon-incorporated-max-shayne-incorporated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 934 (4th Cir.1995). Given the PTO's expertise in the field, we are inclined to do so here. To that extent, then, the PTO's acceptance of these other marks for registration supports the idea that \"rica\" can be an inherently distinctive term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that the evidence adduced to date suggests that M.V. is unlikely to rebut the presumption of distinctiveness arising from Borinquen's contestable mark. Consequently, the district court appropriately refrained from requiring Borinquen to prove secondary meaning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Consumer Confusion.</i> M.V.'s remaining assignment of error attacks the district court's determination that its use of the \"Nestl&#233; Ricas\" mark was likely to cause consumer confusion. This court has enumerated eight factors to guide the inquiry into likelihood of confusion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the similarity of the goods; (3) the relationship between the parties' channels of trade; (4) the relationship between the parties' advertising; (5) the classes of prospective purchasers; (6) evidence of actual confusion; (7) the defendant's intent in adopting its mark; and (8) the strength of the plaintiff's mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Astra Pharm. Prods., Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"425940\"><a href=\"/opinion/425940/astra-pharmaceutical-products-inc-v-beckman-instruments-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1201</span></a></span>, 1205 (1st Cir.1983); <i>accord Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v.

A proper analysis takes cognizance of all eight factors but assigns no single factor dispositive weight. <i>Keds,</i> 888 F.2d at 222; <i>Volkswagenwerk,</i> 814 F.2d at 817. Because likelihood of confusion is a factbound inquiry, appellate review of a trial-level finding on that issue is for clear error. <i>Keds,</i> 888 F.2d at 222.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below applied the eight-factor screen and concluded that, on the whole, the evidence preponderated in favor of a finding that M.V.'s use of its mark in Puerto Rico was likely to result in consumer confusion. This conclusion was predicated on a measured view of the evidence. On the one hand, the court noted that the parties' goods were dissimilar, that no actual confusion had been shown, and that no evidence existed that M.V. intended to mislead consumers. D. Ct. Op. at 6-9. On the other hand, the court found that the remaining factors all tended to favor a likelihood of confusion. <i>Id.</i> at 5-9. The court then performed the necessary balancing and determined that the latter points outweighed the former. <i>Id.</i> at 9-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M.V. assails this determination, arguing that the court misapplied the eight-factor test in two principal ways: by underestimating the significance of Borinquen's failure to present a consumer survey designed to show actual confusion and by deeming \"RICA\" a strong mark. After careful perscrutation of the record, we reject both arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, a trademark holder's burden is to show likelihood of confusion, not actual confusion. While evidence of actual confusion is \"often deemed the best evidence of possible future confusion,\" <i>Attrezzi, LLC v. Maytag Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2006), proof of actual confusion is not essential to finding likelihood of confusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Volkswagenwerk,</i> 814 F.2d at 818; <i>see also Pignons,</i> 657 F.2d at 490 (cautioning that \"[e]vidence of actual confusion is not invariably necessary to prove likelihood of confusion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historically, we have attached substantial weight to a trademark holder's failure to prove actual confusion only in instances in which the relevant products have coexisted on the market for a long period of time. <i>See, e.g., Aktiebolaget Electrolux v. Armatron Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611604\"><a href=\"/opinion/611604/aktiebolaget-electrolux-v-armatron-international-inc-aktiebolaget/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1993) (finding lack of evidence of actual confusion significant because products had coexisted in the same market for roughly six years). This is not such a case: M.V.'s product was introduced to the Puerto Rican market in April of 2003, and M.V.'s own evidence suggests that sales did not proliferate until the summer of 2004. This corresponds to the time frame in which Borinquen discovered the presence of Nestl&#233; Ricas and took action to protect its mark. Since the preliminary injunction issued just over a year later, there was no protracted period of product coexistence. Nor is there any other compelling reason why, in this case, survey evidence should be required at the preliminary injunction stage. We hold, therefore, that while survey evidence would have been helpful, it was not indispensable to a finding of likelihood of confusion. <i>See id.; see also Volkswagenwerk,</i> 814 F.2d at 818 (upholding permanent injunction despite plaintiff's failure to produce evidence of actual confusion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In much the same vein, the court did not clearly err in determining that \"RICA\" is a relatively strong mark. Various factors are relevant in ascertaining the strength of a trademark, including the length of time the mark has been used, the trademark holder's renown in the industry, the potency of the mark in the product field (as measured by the number of similar registered marks), and the trademark holder's efforts to promote and protect the mark. <i>See Boston Athletic Ass'n,</i> 867 F.2d at 32; <i>see also Keds,</i> 888 F.2d at 222. In assessing the strength of Borinquen's mark, the district court found that the mark had been registered for more than three decades; that Borinquen's \"RICA\" was the only cookie, cracker, or biscuit trademarked under that name in the United States; and that Borinquen's efforts in promoting and protecting its mark were in conformance with industry standards. D. Ct. Op. at 9. These three findings, all of which are supported by substantial evidence in the record, furnish ample grounding for the court's conclusion that \"RICA\" should be considered a strong mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this issue would be supererogatory. The short of it is that we discern no clear error in the findings of fact underlying the district court's determination that Borinquen has a better-than-even chance of succeeding in establishing a likelihood of consumer confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Because Borinquen's trademark is registered, it enjoys a presumption of inherent distinctiveness. Since M.V. failed adequately to rebut that presumption at the preliminary injunction stage, the district court did not err in determining, without requiring evidence of secondary meaning, that Borinquen's mark was likely entitled to protection. Nor did the court clearly err in finding that M.V.'s continued use of its competing mark probably would result in consumer confusion. Consequently, both the court's determination that Borinquen had established a likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement claim and its related decision to award Borinquen preliminary injunctive relief are unimpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Borinquen also brought a dilution claim under 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c). That claim was not pressed at the preliminary injunction stage, so we make no further mention of it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Even when the PTO's decision to register a mark depends on the applicant's proof of secondary meaning, the holder is still entitled to a presumption that its mark is distinctive and merits protection<i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1115(a). In that instance, however, the presumption is not that the mark is inherently distinctive, but, rather, that the mark is valid because it enjoys secondary meaning. <i>See Arrow Fastener Co. v. Stanley Works,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699212\"><a href=\"/opinion/699212/arrow-fastener-co-inc-v-the-stanley-works/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span>, 393 (2d Cir.1995). Because Borinquen's mark was not registered on this basis, we do not address the effect of a secondary meaning presumption.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> A mark becomes incontestable when its owner files an affidavit with the PTO attesting that the following requirements have been met: (i) there has been no final decision adverse to its ownership or enforcement rights for the preceding five-year period; (ii) there is no pending case or proceeding regarding the owner's rights in the mark; and (iii) the owner is still using the mark<i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1065.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The absence of reliable survey evidence is not, in and of itself, dispositive when a putative infringer attempts to establish that a registered mark is not entitled to protection on descriptiveness grounds. The relevant inquiry focuses on the primary significance of the mark to the product's consumers<i>See Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518087\"><a href=\"/opinion/518087/boston-athletic-association-v-mark-sullivan-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1989). The preferred form of proof includes direct evidence (such as consumer surveys) suggesting that the average purchaser actually regards the mark as merely descriptive of the plaintiff's product. <i>See Keebler Co.,</i> 624 F.2d at 375. Direct evidence is not, however, an absolute prerequisite. <i>See id.</i> (noting that, in some instances, indirect evidence may suffice). This concept dovetails neatly with the lessened proof requirements that apply at the preliminary injunction stage.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In the interest of completeness, we note that the record does contain some evidence that bears upon the issue of secondary meaning. However, the view we take of this issue renders superfluous any evaluation of that evidence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> M.V.'s boast that the results of its own survey increased the importance of establishing actual confusion rings hollow. The district court supportably found M.V.'s survey to be of scant evidentiary value. First, that survey was constructed to determine whether potential customers could spot differences in the products' packaging, not to identify whether M.V.'s use of its mark created a likelihood of confusion.
