POLANCO-LAFONTAINE,\n\n                        Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                  v.\n\n                           TABER PARTNERS I,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n         ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n      [Hon. Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. Senior District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n              Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          Maximiliano     Trujillo-Gonzalez     was   on   brief   for\nappellants.\n\n          Godwin Aldarondo-Girald and Aldarondo Girald Law Office\nwere on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            August 7, 2003\n\f               LYNCH, Circuit Judge.      Plaintiffs brought this action\n\nunder    the    Racketeer   Influenced    and   Corrupt   Organizations   Act\n\n(RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1962 (2000), against the defendant,\n\nclaiming that it improperly cashed a series of checks written to\n\nanother party. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss for failure\n\nto state a claim, which the district court granted.            We affirm on\n\nthe grounds that the alleged actions do not constitute a pattern\n\nsufficient to state a claim under RICO.\n\n                                     I.\n\nA.   Factual Background\n\n               We describe the facts as found in plaintiffs' complaint,\n\nwhich we take as true when considering a motion to dismiss for\n\nfailure to state a claim.       Abbott v. United States, 144 F.3d 1, 2\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). We also consider the checks entered into evidence\n\nby plaintiffs.      Because they were submitted to the district court\n\nby plaintiffs and are central to their claim, we take them into\n\naccount without needing to convert the proceeding into one for\n\nsummary judgment.      See Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n               Epimenio Soto-Negrón and his wife, Aida L. Polanco-\n\nLafontaine, purchased six official checks in amounts varying from\n\n$2,500 to $4,000.       The total amount was $19,100.         The complaint\n\nasserts that the checks were issued to the order of \"a U.S.\n\nGovernment agency,\" namely the U.S. Marshals Service, and were\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f\"prepared for transactions with the United States Government.\" The\n\nchecks, though, contradict this assertion and are actually made out\n\nto \"Mauricio Vazquez, U.S. Marshall Services\" (with some variations\n\non how the entity's name is spelled).          All are dated between March\n\n27 and April 3, 2000.\n\n           The checks were cashed by the defendant, Taber Partners\n\nI, which owns and controls the Radisson Ambassador Plaza Hotel and\n\nCasino, among other properties.           The checks were converted to\n\nprivate use, even though, the complaint alleges, the checks were\n\nissued to a U.S. government agency.           Of the six checks, it is only\n\nascertainable from the copies in evidence when four of them were\n\npaid; those four were paid between March 27 and March 31, 2000.             It\n\nis a reasonable inference that the other two checks were also\n\ncashed around that time.      The complaint does not specify the dates\n\nof the transactions.\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n           On October 1, 2001, the plaintiffs filed an action\n\nagainst Taber Partners I in federal district court under RICO, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1964(c).       The complaint alleged that the defendant's\n\ncashing of checks meant for the United States government violated\n\nvarious statutes, including 18 U.S.C. §§ 495 (forgery with intent\n\nto   defraud   the   United   States)   and    641   (conversion   of   public\n\nmonies), and constituted an illegal pattern of racketeering conduct\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\funder RICO.    The complaint requested restitution of the amount of\n\nthe checks, trebled under RICO, and attorneys' fees.\n\n           Plaintiffs served the summons on October 9, 2001.           Taber\n\ndid not respond, so the district court entered default judgment\n\nagainst   it   on   December   11,   2001.     Taber   filed   a   motion   in\n\nopposition to entry of default on April 30, 2002, claiming that the\n\ncomplaint was served on an employee of the Ambassador Plaza Hotel\n\nand that as a result, the partnership had not learned of the\n\ncomplaint until the previous day.          It moved to vacate the entry of\n\ndefault on May 9, and the district court granted this request on\n\nMay 13.\n\n           On August 7, 2002, Taber moved to dismiss the complaint\n\non three grounds.      First, it argued that it was never properly\n\nserved with the complaint.1      Second, Taber contended that because\n\nthe checks were made payable to a private entity, cashing the\n\nchecks was not in fact illegal, and therefore there was no RICO\n\n\n\n     1\n       The person served was the Comptroller and Treasurer of the\nhotel. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 4(h) specifies that when a partnership\nis served, a copy of the summons and complaint must be delivered\n\"to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent\nauthorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.\"\nTaber argued that the Comptroller was not authorized to receive\nservice. Plaintiffs countered that Taber is estopped from making\nthis argument because, as a foreign partnership, it had not\nregistered with the Puerto Rico State Department and notified it of\nwho is designated to receive summons, as it was required to do\nunder Puerto Rico law.\n     The district court did not explicitly rule on Taber's motion\nto dismiss for insufficiency of service, and neither party raises\nthe issue on appeal.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fviolation.2    Third, it argued that there was no illegal pattern of\n\nconduct within the meaning of RICO, because the check cashing was\n\nan isolated event, not a pattern of events over an extended period\n\nof time.\n\n             On December 11, 2002, the district court dismissed the\n\ncomplaint.     It found that because \"the predicate acts at issue\n\nextend only over one week,\" and because there was no threat of\n\nfuture criminal conduct, the complaint did not allege a RICO\n\nviolation.     Soto-Negrón v. Taber Partners I, 235 F. Supp. 2d 105,\n\n108-09 (D.P.R. 2002).         Plaintiffs appeal this dismissal.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            We review de novo a district court's dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim.               Chute v. Walker, 281 F.3d\n\n314, 318 (1st Cir. 2002).        When reviewing the grant of a motion to\n\ndismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), \"[w]e accept as true the\n\nwell-pleaded     factual      allegations    of       the    complaint,   draw    all\n\nreasonable    inferences      therefrom     in    the       plaintiff's   favor   and\n\ndetermine     whether   the    complaint,        so   read,     sets   forth   facts\n\nsufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.\"                      Martin\n\nv. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2002).                   We\n\n\n\n     2\n       Taber bases this argument on two grounds: first, that the\nchecks named an individual, Mauricio Vazquez, and that the checks\nwere therefore payable to that person, not a federal agency; and\nsecond, that the \"U.S. Marshall Services\" refers not to a federal\nagency but to \"a corporation dedicated to the sale of motor\nvehicles.\"\n\n                                      -5-\n\fneed not, however, accept as true all facts in the complaint: \"We\n\nexempt, of course, those 'facts' which have since been conclusively\n\ncontradicted by plaintiffs' concessions or otherwise . . . .\"\n\nChongris v. Bd. of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           RICO makes it unlawful, inter alia, \"for any person\n\nemployed by or associated with any enterprise . . . to conduct or\n\nparticipate,     directly    or   indirectly,    in   .   .   .   a   pattern     of\n\nracketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.\"                 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1962(c).      \"To state a claim under section 1962(c), a plaintiff\n\nmust allege each of the four elements required by the statute: (1)\n\nconduct   (2)    of   an   enterprise,   (3)    through   a   pattern       (4)   of\n\nracketeering activity.\" N. Bridge Assocs., Inc. v. Boldt, 274 F.3d\n\n38, 42 (1st Cir. 2001); see Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S.\n\n479, 496 (1985).\n\n           Like the district court, we bypass the issue of whether\n\nthere was any racketeering activity at all and focus instead on\n\nwhether that activity constituted a pattern under RICO.                While the\n\ndefinition of a \"pattern\" was meant to be flexible, mere \"sporadic\n\nactivity\" is not enough.            H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel.\n\nCo., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989) (quoting S. Rep. No. 91-617, at 158\n\n(1969)). To establish a pattern, a plaintiff must show both a\n\nrelationship among the predicate acts and continuity.                 Id.     Acts\n\nare related if they have \"the same or similar purposes, results,\n\nparticipants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\finterrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated\n\nevents.\"   Id. at 240, quoted in Efron v. Embassy Suites (P.R.)\n\nInc., 223 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2000).      Continuity requires that\n\n\"the related predicates amount to or pose a threat of continued\n\ncriminal activity.\" H.J., 492 U.S. at 239. Plaintiffs may satisfy\n\nthe continuity requirement either by evidence of \"a series of\n\nrelated predicates extending over a substantial period of time,\"\n\nid. at 242, or by evidence that the acts \"include a specific threat\n\nof repetition extending indefinitely into the future\" or \"form part\n\nof an ongoing entity's regular way of doing business,\" id.\n\n           Plaintiffs' complaint fails to meet the RICO continuity\n\nrequirement.   The six checks at issue are all dated within a week\n\nof each other.    The four dates of payment known to us are all\n\nwithin a single five-day period.   This time frame is too narrow to\n\nmeet the continuity requirement.      See Fleet Credit Corp. v. Sion,\n\n893 F.2d 441, 446 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Predicate acts extending over\n\na few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do\n\nnot satisfy the [continuity] requirement.\" (quoting H.J., 492 U.S.\n\nat 242)). That multiple instances of wrongful behavior are alleged\n\nis of no consequence.   See Sys. Mgmt., Inc. v. Loiselle, 303 F.3d\n\n100, 105 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"RICO is not aimed at a single narrow\n\ncriminal episode . . . .\"); Apparel Art Int'l, Inc. v. Jacobson,\n\n967 F.2d 720, 723 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[A] single episode does not\n\nconstitute a 'pattern,' even if that single episode involves\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fbehavior that amounts to several crimes (for example, several\n\nunlawful mailings).\").\n\n          Nor does the complaint allege a threat of repetition.\n\nPlaintiffs do not claim that the acts alleged are part of Taber's\n\n\"regular way of doing business,\" nor that this activity is in any\n\ndanger of continuing.       Without the threat of an \"open ended\"\n\npattern of racketeering activity, the complaint cannot overcome the\n\nnarrow time period alleged.    See Sys. Mgmt., 303 F.3d at 106.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.    Costs\n\nare awarded to defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

We also consider the checks entered into evidence by plaintiffs. Because they were submitted to the district court by plaintiffs and are central to their claim, we take them into account without needing to convert the proceeding into one for summary judgment. <i>See Watterson v.

Polanco-Lafontaine, purchased six official checks in amounts varying from $2,500 to $4,000. The total amount was $19,100. The complaint asserts that the checks were issued to the order of \"a U.S. Government agency,\" namely the U.S. Marshals Service, and were \"prepared for transactions with the United States Government.\" The checks, though, contradict this assertion and are actually made out to \"Mauricio Vazquez, U.S. Marshall Services\" (with some variations on how the entity's name is spelled). All are dated between March 27 and April 3, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The checks were cashed by the defendant, Taber Partners I, which owns and controls the Radisson Ambassador Plaza Hotel and Casino, among other properties. The checks were converted to private use, even though, the complaint alleges, the checks were issued to a U.S. government agency. Of the six checks, it is only ascertainable from the copies in evidence when four of them were paid; those four were paid between March 27 and March 31, 2000. It is a reasonable inference that the other two checks were also cashed around that time. The complaint does not specify the dates of the transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 1, 2001, the plaintiffs filed an action against Taber Partners I in federal district court under RICO, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1964(c). The complaint alleged that the defendant's cashing of checks meant for the United States government violated various statutes, including 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 495 (forgery with intent to defraud the United States) and 641 (conversion of public monies), and constituted an illegal pattern of racketeering conduct under RICO. The complaint requested restitution of the amount of the checks, trebled under RICO, and attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs served the summons on October 9, 2001. Taber did not respond, so the district court entered default judgment against it on December 11, 2001. Taber filed a motion in opposition to entry of default on April 30, 2002, claiming that the complaint was served on an employee of the Ambassador Plaza Hotel and that as a result, the partnership had not learned of the complaint until the previous day. It moved to vacate the entry of default on May 9, and the district court granted this request on May 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 7, 2002, Taber moved to dismiss the complaint on three grounds. First, it argued that it was never properly served with the complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Second, Taber contended that because the checks were made payable to a private entity, cashing the checks was not in fact illegal, and therefore there was no RICO violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Third, it argued that there was no illegal pattern of conduct within the meaning of RICO, because the check cashing was an isolated event, not a pattern of events over an extended period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 2002, the district court dismissed the complaint. It found that because \"the predicate acts at issue extend only over one week,\" and because there was no threat of future criminal conduct, the complaint did not allege a RICO violation. <i>Soto Negr&#243;n v.

To establish a pattern, a plaintiff must show both a relationship among the predicate acts and continuity. <i>Id.</i> Acts are related if they have \"the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.\" <i>Id.</i> at 240, <i>quoted in Efron v.
