Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                      Before\n\n                     Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n                       and Young,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Jason M. Sullivan for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Sonia I.

Defendant-appellant       Carlos\n\nGuadalupe-Quinones (\"Guadalupe-Quinones\") appeals the revocation of\n\nhis supervised release and the imposition upon him of a new\n\nsentence of imprisonment.       We affirm.        The affirmance does not\n\npreclude Guadalupe-Quinones from pursuing an ineffective assistance\n\nclaim, if any, under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, nor does it say anything\n\nabout the merits of such a claim.\n\nI.         BACKGROUND\n\n           On   April   10,   1991,    a    federal    grand    jury   indicted\n\nGuadalupe-Quinones on two drug-related counts.              Count One of the\n\nindictment charged that on March 30, 1999, Guadalupe-Quinones and\n\na co-defendant, aiding and abetting each other, knowingly and\n\nintentionally    possessed,     with        the   intent       to   distribute,\n\napproximately forty kilograms of cocaine.             Count Two charged that\n\non March 30, 1999, Guadalupe-Quinones and a co-defendant, aiding\n\nand abetting each other, knowingly and intentionally possessed\n\nforty kilograms of cocaine while aboard an aircraft (American\n\nAirlines Flight 1290, from Puerto Rico to New York).                 Guadalupe-\n\nQuinones pled not guilty to both counts.                   The United States\n\nsubsequently    dismissed     Count     Two.       Guadalupe-Quinones       was\n\nultimately convicted by a jury on Count One.\n\n           The district judge initially sentenced Guadalupe-Quinones\n\nto 151 months' imprisonment and a five year term of supervised\n\nrelease.   Guadalupe-Quinones subsequently submitted a motion to\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fvacate the sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.      The district judge\n\ngranted this motion and ordered that Guadalupe-Quinones be produced\n\nfor   re-sentencing.   First   Assistant   Federal   Public   Defender\n\nEpifanio Morales-Cruz (\"Morales-Cruz\") was assigned to represent\n\nGuadalupe-Quinones at the re-sentencing.\n\n           On July 8, 1998, the Federal Public Defender, Joseph C.\n\nLaws, Jr. (\"Laws\"), submitted a motion requesting leave to withdraw\n\nor for continuance of the sentencing hearing (which was scheduled\n\nfor July 10).   In this motion, Laws explained that Morales-Cruz\n\n(who was apparently the second-in-command in the Federal Public\n\nDefender's office, supervised only by Laws) had been the prosecutor\n\nwho handled Guadalupe-Quinones' preliminary hearing.      Evidently,\n\nGuadalupe-Quinones had called Morales-Cruz on the morning of July\n\n8 to advise him of the conflict of interest, and to request that\n\nthe Federal Public Defender withdraw from representing him.       Laws\n\nthus asked the court to permit the Federal Public Defender's office\n\nto withdraw, or in the alternative for a continuance, explaining\n\nthat:\n\n\n           Morales Cruz advises that he has no recollection of\n           participating   in   Mr.   Guadalupe    Quinones'   case;\n           nevertheless, any such participation in fact establishes\n           a conflict in    relation to this AFPD's continued\n           participation, and     possibly     conflicts out our\n           appearance by reasons of appearance of impropriety by the\n           remaining AFPDs in the office, who all work with and for\n           Mr. Morales Cruz, who supervises them.      It should be\n           noted that AFPD Edgardo Rodriguez Quilichini, who would\n           eventually be tasked to represent Mr. Guadalupe Quinones\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f          in his appeal, is directly supervised by AFPD Morales\n          Cruz.\n\n\n          The district judge, in a margin order, granted the motion\n\nand permitted the Federal Public Defender's office to withdraw. In\n\nthat same order, he appointed another counsel for Guadalupe-\n\nQuinones: Raymond Rivera.    The sentencing was rescheduled until\n\nAugust of 1998, at which point the judge sentenced Guadalupe-\n\nQuinones to a 121 month term of imprisonment and five years of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n          On March 12, 2002, the United States Probation Office\n\nsubmitted a motion requesting the revocation of Guadalupe-Quinones'\n\nsupervised release term.    In this motion, the probation officer\n\nstated that Guadalupe-Quinones had violated his standard conditions\n\nof release by committing and being charged with local crimes\n\ninvolving attempt to commit robbery and possession of a blade\n\nweapon.   Guadalupe-Quinones had pled guilty to these two charges,\n\nand had been sentenced by the San Juan Superior Court to four years\n\nfor the robbery offense and six months for the weapons offense, to\n\nbe served concurrently.\n\n           On March 27, 2002, a magistrate judge issued an order\n\nscheduling a show-cause hearing, and appointing the Federal Public\n\nDefender to represent Guadalupe-Quinones.     On April 8, 2002, a\n\npreliminary hearing was held; Guadalupe-Quinones was not present,\n\nbut an Assistant Federal Public Defender -- Juan Matos -- appeared\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fas his counsel.    On April 10, 2002, the magistrate judge issued a\n\nReport and Recommendation, concluding that there were grounds to\n\nrevoke Guadalupe-Quinones' supervised release, and recommending\n\nthat the preliminary hearing be combined with the final revocation\n\nhearing.\n\n           A final hearing was then held on May 13, 2002, before the\n\nsame district judge who had presided over Guadalupe-Quinones'\n\nsentencing in 1998. Guadalupe-Quinones was present and represented\n\nby   another   Assistant   Federal   Public       Defender,   Maria   Arsuaga.\n\nGuadalupe-Quinones was advised of his rights, and was also informed\n\nthat the probation officer had a copy of the judgment against him\n\nfor the state offenses.      Id. at 5-6.      Neither the prosecutor nor\n\nGuadalupe-Quinones' counsel -- nor Guadalupe-Quinones himself --\n\nreminded the district judge of the prior conflict with the Federal\n\nPublic   Defender's   office   nearly      four    years   earlier,   and   the\n\ndistrict judge did not inquire into it.           Guadalupe-Quinones waived\n\nthe hearing, admitted to having committed the state offenses, and\n\nwas sentenced to 60 months imprisonment to run consecutively with\n\nthe state court sentence.\n\n           Guadalupe-Quinones now appeals this disposition, arguing\n\nthat his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel\n\nwas violated by his counsel's (alleged) conflict of interest in\n\nrepresenting him.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fII.       DISCUSSION\n\n          Guadalupe-Quinones argues that, having been advised of\n\nhis conflict with the Federal Public Defender's office in July\n\n1998, the district judge should have inquired into the nature and\n\nextent of that conflict when Guadalupe-Quinones appeared before him\n\n-- represented by another member of the Federal Public Defender's\n\noffice -- during the supervised release revocation proceedings\n\nnearly four years later in May 2002.       He argues that as a result of\n\nthe judge's failure to do so, he received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.             Even assuming, for\n\nargument's sake, that the district judge was indeed on inquiry\n\nnotice -- an assumption that would require us to conclude that a\n\nbusy   trial   judge,   unprompted,      should    have    recalled   a   not-\n\nparticularly-memorable incident that had transpired nearly four\n\nyears earlier -- this argument fails.\n\n           It is true that under Sullivan v. Cuyler, 446 U.S. 335,\n\n347 (1980), and Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, 272 (1981), a trial\n\ncourt that knows or reasonably should know that a particular\n\nconflict of interest exists on the part of a criminal defendant's\n\ncounsel   --   definitely   with   respect    to    counsel's    concurrent\n\nrepresentation of competing interests, and perhaps with respect to\n\nother brands of conflicts as well -- is under the duty to inquire\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\finto the conflict.1      Under the Supreme Court's recent holding in\n\nMickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 122 S. Ct. 1237 (2002), however,\n\na trial judge's failure to make this mandated inquiry will not,\n\nwithout   more,   require   automatic    reversal.     On   the   contrary,\n\nautomatic reversal is required \"only where defense counsel is\n\nforced to represent codefendants over his timely objection, unless\n\nthe trial court has determined there is no conflict.\" Mickens, 122\n\nS.Ct. at 1242.     In other circumstances, it is \"at least necessary,\n\nto void the [disposition], for [the defendant] to establish that\n\nthe   conflict    of   interest   adversely   affected      his   counsel's\n\nperformance.\"     Id. at 1245.\n\n           Despite Guadalupe-Quinones' arguments to the contrary,\n\nhis claim that a reversal is required merely because the district\n\njudge failed to inquire into a conflict about which he knew or\n\nshould have known is foreclosed by Mickens.          Only by establishing\n\nthat the alleged conflict of interest adversely affected his\n\ncounsel's performance can Guadalupe-Quinones prevail in his attempt\n\nto set aside the result of this proceeding.          See United States v.\n\n\n\n      1\n      Sullivan and Wood both arose within the context of a conflict\nrelating to defense counsel's concurrent representation of\ncompeting interests. See Sullivan, 446 U.S. at 337; Wood, 450 U.S.\nat 266-67. In Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 122 S. Ct. 1237,\n1245-46 (2002), the Supreme Court noted that \"the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure treat concurrent representation and prior\nrepresentation differently,\" and stated that the extent to which\nthere is a duty to inquire with respect to conflicts arising from\ncircumstances other than concurrent representation is \"an open\nquestion.\"\n\n                                   -7-\n\fNewton,      F.3d      , 2003 WL 1826135, *9 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating\n\nthat in Mickens, \"the Supreme Court expressly rejected a rule of\n\nautomatic reversal in cases where a defense attorney's conflict of\n\ninterest does not adversely affect counsel's performance\").\n\n            No facts have been developed as to whether there was any\n\nadverse effect. The Supreme Court has recently affirmed the wisdom\n\nof this circuit's rule that where facts need to be developed on a\n\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the claim should be\n\nbrought by petition for post-conviction relief and the facts should\n\nbe developed by the trial judge.        See Massaro v. United States, No.\n\n01-1559, 2003 WL 1916677 (April 23, 2003).\n\n            Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.              Guadalupe-\n\nQuinones is not, however, precluded from pursuing an ineffective\n\nassistance claim under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, and we do not speak to the\n\nmerits of any such claim.        If Guadalupe-Quinones does pursue such\n\na claim, and demonstrates his indigence, we direct the district\n\ncourt to appoint counsel for him.           See 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(a)(2)(B)\n\n(stating    that     if   \"the   interests     of   justice    so     require,\n\nrepresentation may be provided [under the Criminal Justice Act] for\n\nany financially eligible person who . . . is seeking relief under\n\nsection . . . 2255 of Title 28\"); see also United States v. Mala,\n\n7   F.3d   1058,    1063-64   (1st   Cir.   1993)   (holding   that    because\n\nappellant had presented a colorable claim that was factually\n\ncomplex and legally intricate, and was severely hampered in his\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fability to investigate the undeveloped facts, the interests of\n\njustice supported the appointment of counsel if Section 2255 relief\n\nwas pursued).   As in Mala, we conclude that the interests of\n\njustice militate in favor of appointing counsel for appellant\n\nshould he pursue habeas relief, given the colorability of his\n\nclaim, its heavily fact-specific nature, and his inability to\n\ninvestigate those facts while in prison.\n\nIII.      CONCLUSION\n\n          Accordingly,   we   affirm   the   judgment   below,   without\n\nprejudice to Guadalupe-Quinones' right to raise his ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim in a proceeding brought under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255.   Should he pursue this course, the district court is\n\ninstructed to appoint counsel for him, subject to the strictures of\n\nthe Criminal Justice Act.\n\n          SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Guadalupe-Quinones was present and represented\n\nby   another   Assistant   Federal   Public       Defender,   Maria   Arsuaga.\n\nGuadalupe-Quinones was advised of his rights, and was also informed\n\nthat the probation officer had a copy of the judgment against him\n\nfor the state offenses.      Id. at 5-6.      Neither the prosecutor nor\n\nGuadalupe-Quinones' counsel -- nor Guadalupe-Quinones himself --\n\nreminded the district judge of the prior conflict with the Federal\n\nPublic   Defender's   office   nearly      four    years   earlier,   and   the\n\ndistrict judge did not inquire into it.           Guadalupe-Quinones waived\n\nthe hearing, admitted to having committed the state offenses, and\n\nwas sentenced to 60 months imprisonment to run consecutively with\n\nthe state court sentence.\n\n           Guadalupe-Quinones now appeals this disposition, arguing\n\nthat his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel\n\nwas violated by his counsel's (alleged) conflict of interest in\n\nrepresenting him.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fII.       DISCUSSION\n\n          Guadalupe-Quinones argues that, having been advised of\n\nhis conflict with the Federal Public Defender's office in July\n\n1998, the district judge should have inquired into the nature and\n\nextent of that conflict when Guadalupe-Quinones appeared before him\n\n-- represented by another member of the Federal Public Defender's\n\noffice -- during the supervised release revocation proceedings\n\nnearly four years later in May 2002.       He argues that as a result of\n\nthe judge's failure to do so, he received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel, in violation of the Sixth Amendment.             Even assuming, for\n\nargument's sake, that the district judge was indeed on inquiry\n\nnotice -- an assumption that would require us to conclude that a\n\nbusy   trial   judge,   unprompted,      should    have    recalled   a   not-\n\nparticularly-memorable incident that had transpired nearly four\n\nyears earlier -- this argument fails.\n\n           It is true that under Sullivan v.

On   the   contrary,\n\nautomatic reversal is required \"only where defense counsel is\n\nforced to represent codefendants over his timely objection, unless\n\nthe trial court has determined there is no conflict.\" Mickens, 122\n\nS.Ct. at 1242.     In other circumstances, it is \"at least necessary,\n\nto void the [disposition], for [the defendant] to establish that\n\nthe   conflict    of   interest   adversely   affected      his   counsel's\n\nperformance.\"     Id. at 1245.\n\n           Despite Guadalupe-Quinones' arguments to the contrary,\n\nhis claim that a reversal is required merely because the district\n\njudge failed to inquire into a conflict about which he knew or\n\nshould have known is foreclosed by Mickens.          Only by establishing\n\nthat the alleged conflict of interest adversely affected his\n\ncounsel's performance can Guadalupe-Quinones prevail in his attempt\n\nto set aside the result of this proceeding.
