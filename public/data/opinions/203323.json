Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                 Before\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                     Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Gelpi,* District Judge.\n\n\n                 ORDER FOR CERTIFICATION OF QUESTIONS\n            TO THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n                        Entered: June 10, 2008\n\n     For the reasons stated in our decision in this case, submitted\n\nwith this order, we certify the following three questions to the\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\fSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts:\n\n\n     1. Where an insured protected by standard CGL policy language\nincurs covered costs as a result of ongoing environmental\ncontamination occurring over more than one year and the insurer\nprovided coverage for less than the full period of years in which\ncontamination occurred, should the direct liability of the sued\ninsurer be pro rated in some manner among all insurers \"on the\nrisk,\" limiting the direct liability of the sued insurer to its\nshare but leaving the insured free to seek the balance from other\nsuch insurers?\n\n     2. If some form of pro rata liability is called for in such\ncircumstances, what allocation method or formula should be used?\n\n     3. If a single insurer in such circumstances is subject to\nliability under more than one policy and each policy has a separate\ndeductible or self-insured retention, should the insured be able to\ncollect covered losses from a single policy subject only to that\npolicy's deductible or self-insured retention, or should liability\nbe reduced by the sum of the applicable self-insured retentions,\neffectively allocating total liability across the policies of that\ninsurer in effect during the contamination period?\n\n\n     This court certifies that these questions are determinative of\n\nthe claim in this case and that it appears there is no controlling\n\nprecedent in the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court. We would\n\nalso welcome any additional guidance about relevant Massachusetts\n\nlaw that the Supreme Judicial Court may wish to offer.\n\n     The clerk of this court is to forward, under the official seal\n\nof this court, a copy of the certified questions and our decision\n\nin this case, along with the briefs and appendix filed by the\n\nparties, to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.
