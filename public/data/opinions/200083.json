Peter Mungai, a citizen and native of\n\nKenya, petitions for review of a final order of the Board of\n\nImmigration   Appeals   (\"BIA\")    denying   his   motion   to   reopen\n\nremoval proceedings. The BIA determined that the motion, which\n\nasserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, was both\n\nprocedurally and substantively deficient.\n\n          Leaving aside the procedural matters, we must concur\n\nwith the BIA's conclusion that petitioner failed to demonstrate\n\nprejudice as is required to prevail on a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.   Hernandez v. Reno, 238 F.3d 50, 55 (1st\nCir. 2001); Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); In re Lozada, 19 I & N Dec. 637, 638 (BIA 1988), aff'd,\n857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988).      Although petitioner argued in the\nmotion to reopen that he was prejudiced by his attorney's\n\nfailure (1) to call petitioner's brother as a witness to\ntestify in support of his asylum claim in the proceedings\nbefore the Immigration Judge, and (2) to file an appellate\n\nbrief on petitioner's behalf, he offered neither an affidavit\nfrom his brother nor a description of the testimony his brother\nwould have given.   Moreover, he has failed to articulate any\n\nissues or arguments that should have been presented in an\nappellate brief. We therefore accept the BIA's conclusion that\npetitioner failed to show the prejudice required to demonstrate\n\nineffective assistance of counsel and therefore failed to\nestablish any grounds for reopening the removal proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f         No other substantial issue being apparent, the final\n\norder of the BIA is affirmed.
