Rivera-Ortíz, by appointment of the court, for\nappellant.\n     Germán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, and\nNelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney (Chief,\nAppellate Division), were on brief, for appellee.\n\fMarch 28, 2007\n\f            SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.                A criminal defendant,\n\ndisappointed by his sentence, seeks appellate review despite his\n\nearlier waiver of any right to appeal.             Concluding, as we do, that\n\nthe defendant has forfeited any right to contest the waiver and\n\nthat, in all events, no miscarriage of justice will result from its\n\nenforcement, we dismiss the appeal.\n\n            The underlying case had its genesis in a four-count\n\nindictment handed up by a federal grand jury sitting in the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico.               That indictment charged twenty-four\n\nindividuals with conspiring to distribute narcotics and/or to\n\nlaunder    the     resultant     proceeds.       Among     those    charged     with\n\nconspiring    to    commit     money    laundering   was    defendant-appellant\n\nVictor    Miliano.      The    indictment      noted,    inter   alia,   that    the\n\nauthorities had discovered an illegal firearm attributable to\n\nMiliano at a stash house.\n\n            After    some     procedural    wrangling,     not     relevant   here,\n\nMiliano pleaded guilty to both the conspiracy count and to a\n\nrelated forfeiture count.          See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(h), 982.               In a\n\nnegotiated plea agreement (the Agreement), Miliano acknowledged\n\nthat, on two occasions (July 9 and 12, 2004), he had chauffeured a\n\ncar carrying drug proceeds totaling nearly one-half million dollars\n\nfor the purpose of concealing the ownership of the funds.                 Miliano\n\nreceived a stipend of $300 for the first delivery and $1,000 for\n\nthe second.      While he admitted that he knew that the funds were the\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\favails of illegal activity, he denied knowing that they were\n\nderived   from   narcotics      trafficking.       This    denial,   which     the\n\ngovernment reserved the right to contest, is of some moment; the\n\nfederal sentencing guidelines demand a six-level enhancement of a\n\ndefendant's offense level in cases in which the defendant knows or\n\nbelieves that laundered funds are the proceeds of a controlled\n\nsubstance offense.     See USSG §2S1.1(b)(1).\n\n            In addition to leaving for argument before the sentencing\n\ncourt the question of whether the disputed six-level enhancement\n\nshould    attach,   the    Agreement     recounted    a    number    of   agreed\n\nadjustments (some upward, some downward).                  It also contained\n\nclauses memorializing the government's agreement (i) not to oppose\n\na sentence at the bottom of whichever guideline range proved to be\n\napplicable   and    (ii)   to    forgo   any    monetary    recovery      on   the\n\nforfeiture count (except for the mandatory $100 special assessment\n\nrequired by 18 U.S.C. § 3013(a)).              And, finally, the Agreement\n\ncontained a clause waiving Miliano's right to appeal his sentence\n\nas long as the court sentenced him according to its terms.\n\n            At the change-of-plea hearing, Miliano had the assistance\n\nof a court-appointed interpreter.            The district judge explored the\n\nvoluntariness of Miliano's plea and conducted a thorough inquiry\n\ninto whether Miliano understood the rights he was surrendering.\n\nThis inquiry included specific reference to the waiver of appeal.\n\nThe court then confirmed that Miliano's attorney had reviewed the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fAgreement with him in Miliano's native tongue (Spanish).                In the\n\nend, the court found Miliano's plea to be knowing and voluntary,\n\naccepted the Agreement, and informed Miliano, in a literally\n\ncorrect    comment,     that   \"under    some   circumstances    you   or   the\n\ngovernment may have the right to appeal any sentence that this\n\ncourt imposes.\"\n\n            The district court convened the disposition hearing on\n\nOctober 18, 2005.        The sole disputed factual issue was whether\n\nMiliano had known that the transported funds were drug proceeds.\n\nThe presentence investigation report (PSI Report) recommended an\n\naffirmative answer to this question (and, accordingly, recommended\n\ninclusion of the six-level enhancement).\n\n            At the disposition hearing itself, the government called\n\nas a witness a federal agent, Luis Ortiz, who had overseen the\n\ninvestigation that resulted in Miliano's arrest.                To supplement\n\nthis testimony, the government introduced videotapes of both the\n\nJuly 9 and July 12 incidents. Ortiz narrated the videotapes, which\n\ndepicted Miliano and an associate, Angel Moreno-Núñez (Moreno),\n\nmeeting undercover agents in a public parking lot.                     On both\n\noccasions, Miliano functioned as the driver (using a different car\n\neach    time)   while   Moreno   conducted      the   discussions   with    the\n\nundercover agents and delivered shopping bags full of currency to\n\nthem.   Ortiz added that code-laden telephone conversations between\n\nMoreno and undercover agents prior to the first meeting were\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fconducted       in     a    manner    characteristic          of     drug-trafficking\n\ntransactions.\n\n              Ortiz    also     testified       about    a   meeting    between      the\n\nundercover      agents       and   the   money     launderers        inside   a    store\n\nimmediately prior to the beginning of the July 9 videotape.                           He\n\nnoted that Miliano was present at that meeting.\n\n              At the conclusion of his testimony, Ortiz stated that in\n\neight years of investigative work he had neither encountered nor\n\nheard about \"any other kind of business [besides trafficking in\n\nnarcotics proceeds that] delivers large amounts of quantities of\n\ncash using codes, delivering currency on the street, [in the]\n\ndenominations\" transported by Miliano.                  Drawing on this testimony,\n\nthe overall factual scenario, and Miliano's possession of a gun,1\n\nthe government argued that Miliano must have known that he was\n\nengaged in the laundering of drug money.\n\n              Miliano's lawyer attempted to blunt the force of Ortiz's\n\ntestimony      by     establishing       that    the     agent's     experience      was\n\nexclusively in narcotics and the laundering of drug proceeds.\n\nThus, the lawyer argued, Ortiz would not be aware whether or not\n\nother       criminal       enterprises     laundered         funds    using       similar\n\n\n        1\n      Miliano was not charged with possession of the gun, received\nno sentence enhancement for the gun, and never explicitly\nacknowledged possessing it. However, the gun was mentioned in the\nPSI Report as well as the indictment, and Ortiz alluded to it in\nhis testimony.    In all events, during the disposition hearing,\ndefense counsel stated that he was not challenging the information\nrelated to the gun.\n\n                                          -6-\n\ftechniques. The lawyer added that Miliano himself had not used any\n\ncodes, nor had he personally carried the funds.         Finally, the\n\nlawyer asserted that the gun was not probative of whether Miliano\n\nbelieved he was engaged in laundering drug proceeds.\n\n            The sentencing court found by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that Miliano had knowledge that the funds were drug\n\nproceeds and, accordingly, applied the six-level enhancement.     The\n\ncourt rested this finding primarily on \"the amounts [Miliano] was\n\npaid for the pick ups, the bag that was used in the pick ups, the\n\nplace where the pick ups took place, [and] the modus operandi of\n\ndrug payments in Puerto Rico.\"    This finding, when combined with\n\nthe other (agreed) sentencing adjustments, yielded a guideline\n\nsentencing range of 57-71 months.      The court sentenced Miliano to\n\nthe bottom of the range and then informed him that he had a right\n\nto appeal if the sentence imposed was \"contrary to law.\"\n\n            This timely appeal ensued.    In it, Miliano attempts to\n\nattack both the six-level enhancement and the reasonableness of his\n\nsentence.   See United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 261 (2005);\n\nUnited States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 517 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(en banc), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 928 (2007).\n\n            The threshold question is whether we should enforce\n\nMiliano's waiver of appellate rights.        Here, that question is\n\nanswered by default: Miliano did not brief it, preferring instead\n\nto ignore the waiver and its effect.       Even after the government\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\ffiled its brief, relying heavily on the waiver, Miliano eschewed\n\nthe filing of a reply brief.       This struthious approach was a poor\n\nstrategic choice.\n\n              A defendant who waives his right to appeal and thereafter\n\nattempts to avoid the effect of the waiver must confront the waiver\n\nhead-on.      Where, as here, the defendant simply ignores the waiver\n\nand seeks to argue the appeal as if no waiver ever had been\n\nexecuted, he forfeits any right to contend either that the waiver\n\nshould not be enforced or that it does not apply.          See Sandstrom v.\n\nChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that\n\narguments not made in an appellant's opening brief are deemed\n\nwaived); see also United States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 102 n.6\n\n(1st   Cir.    2006)   (applying   Sandstrom   principle    in   a   criminal\n\nappeal). Miliano's appeal is subject to dismissal for this reason\n\nalone.\n\n              To be sure, we could, in the exercise of our discretion,\n\nforgive a defendant's failure to brief the reasons why a waiver\n\nshould not be construed to bar an appeal — but that discretion\n\nshould be exercised only when doing so is necessary in order to\n\navoid a clear and gross injustice. Cf. United States v. Maldonado-\n\nGarcia, 446 F.3d 227, 230 (1st Cir. 2006) (applying the \"clear and\n\ngross injustice\" standard for appellate review when defendant\n\nwaived his motion for a judgment of acquittal in the district\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcourt).    Such cases will be hen's-teeth rare and, as we explain\n\nbelow, this case is not of that genre.\n\n           We set forth the appropriate test for evaluating the\n\nenforceability of a waiver of appellate rights in United States v.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d 14 (1st Cir. 2001).           There, we held that a waiver\n\nof the right to appeal is binding when (i) \"the written plea\n\nagreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement\n\nelucidating    the    waiver   and     delineating   its    scope\";    (ii)    the\n\ndistrict   court     \"inquire[d]     specifically    at    the   change-of-plea\n\nhearing into any waiver of appellate rights\"; and (iii) denial of\n\nthe right to appeal does not work a miscarriage of justice.               Id. at\n\n24-25.\n\n           In this instance, the first two requirements are readily\n\nsatisfied.    The Agreement, bearing Miliano's signature, contains a\n\nspecific provision that states with unmistakable clarity that\n\n\"[t]he defendant hereby agrees that if this Honorable Court accepts\n\nthis   agreement     and   sentences    him   according    to    its   terms   and\n\nconditions, [he] waives and surrenders his right to appeal the\n\njudgment and sentence in this case.\" Moreover, at the change-of-\n\nplea hearing, the district judge inquired pointedly into Miliano's\n\nunderstanding of the waiver of appeal, confirmed that defense\n\ncounsel had explained the various provisions of the Agreement\n\n(including the waiver of appeal provision) to Miliano in Spanish,\n\nand verified Miliano's understanding of the Agreement and its\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\framifications.   No more was exigible.      See, e.g., United States v.\n\nGil-Quezada, 445 F.3d 33, 36-37 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v.\n\nDe-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          This brings us to Teeter's third prong: the miscarriage\n\nof justice exception.       This exception is to \"be applied sparingly\n\nand without undue generosity.\"            Teeter, 257 F.3d at 26.       A\n\nmiscarriage of justice, at a minimum, involves an increment of\n\nerror more glaring than routine reversible error.        See id. (noting\n\nthat the miscarriage of justice requirement is \"demanding enough to\n\nprevent defendants who have agreed to waive their right to appeal\n\nfrom successfully pursuing garden-variety claims of error\"). Given\n\nMiliano's failure to brief the enforceability of the waiver, see\n\ntext supra, it suffices to say that his garden-variety claims of\n\nerror do not approach this order of magnitude.2\n\n          We need go no further. Miliano knowingly and voluntarily\n\nentered   into   a   plea    agreement,    through   which   he   received\n\n\n\n     2\n      We see no need to enumerate these claims. We note, however,\nMiliano's argument that there was insufficient evidence for the\ncourt to conclude that he knew that he was involved in laundering\ndrug proceeds.     In his view, the government's evidence was\nprobative only of his knowledge that he was illegally laundering\nmoney, not that he knew the money's origins.\n     This argument overlooks that the district court had before it\nthe PSI Report, the videotapes, and Ortiz's testimony. With these\nguideposts, the court drew its ultimate inference from the totality\nof the circumstances. Even without a waiver of appeal, we review\na sentencing court's factual findings only for clear error, United\nStates v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 507 (1st Cir. 1990), and a sentencing\ncourt's choice between competing, but rational, inferences cannot\nbe clearly erroneous, see id. at 508.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fsignificant consideration (including a minor role adjustment and a\n\nfavorable sentencing recommendation) in exchange for, inter alia,\n\na waiver of his right to appeal.         The waiver was explicit, and\n\nMiliano   understood   its   import.     To   cinch   matters,   he   failed\n\nappropriately to challenge it in his brief on appeal.            Under the\n\ncircumstances, we are fully satisfied that no clear and gross\n\ninjustice will result from the enforcement of that waiver according\n\nto its tenor.   Consequently, we dismiss Miliano's appeal.\n\n\n\n\nAppeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f",

That indictment charged twenty-four individuals with conspiring to distribute narcotics and/or to launder the resultant proceeds. Among those charged with conspiring to commit money laundering was defendant-appellant Victor Miliano. The indictment noted, inter alia, that the authorities had discovered an illegal firearm attributable to Miliano at a stash house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After some procedural wrangling, not relevant here, Miliano pleaded guilty to both the conspiracy count and to a related forfeiture count. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(h), 982. In a negotiated plea agreement (the Agreement), Miliano acknowledged that, on two occasions (July 9 and 12, 2004), he had chauffeured a car carrying drug proceeds totaling nearly one-half million dollars for the purpose of concealing the ownership of the funds. Miliano received a stipend of $300 for the first delivery and $1,000 for the second. While he admitted that he knew that the funds were the avails of illegal activity, he denied knowing that they were derived from narcotics trafficking. This denial, which the government reserved the right to contest, is of some moment; the federal sentencing guidelines demand a six-level enhancement of a defendant's offense level in cases in which the defendant knows or believes that laundered funds are the proceeds of a controlled substance offense. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2S1.1(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to leaving for argument before the sentencing court the question of whether the disputed six-level enhancement should attach, the Agreement recounted a number of agreed adjustments (some upward, some downward). It also contained clauses memorializing the government's agreement (i) not to oppose a sentence at the bottom of whichever guideline range proved to be applicable and (ii) to forgo any monetary recovery on the forfeiture count (except for the mandatory $100 special assessment required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3013(a)). And, finally, the Agreement contained a clause waiving Miliano's right to appeal his sentence as long as the court sentenced him according to its terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the change-of-plea hearing, Miliano had the assistance of a court-appointed interpreter. The district judge explored the voluntariness of Miliano's plea and conducted a thorough inquiry into whether Miliano understood the rights he was surrendering. This inquiry included specific reference to the waiver of appeal. The court then confirmed that Miliano's attorney had reviewed the Agreement with him in Miliano's native tongue (Spanish). In the end, the court found Miliano's plea to be knowing and voluntary, accepted the Agreement, and informed Miliano, in a literally correct comment, that \"under some circumstances you or the government may have the right to appeal any sentence that this court imposes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened the disposition hearing on October 18, 2005. The sole disputed factual issue was whether Miliano had known that the transported funds were drug proceeds. The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) recommended an affirmative answer to this question (and, accordingly, recommended inclusion of the six-level enhancement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing itself, the government called as a witness a federal agent, Luis Ortiz, who had overseen the investigation that resulted in Miliano's arrest. To supplement this testimony, the government introduced videotapes of both the July 9 and July 12 incidents. Ortiz narrated the videotapes, which depicted Miliano and an associate, Angel Moreno-N&#250;&#241;ez (Moreno), meeting undercover agents in a public parking lot. On both occasions, Miliano functioned as the driver (using a different car each time) while Moreno conducted the discussions with the undercover agents and delivered shopping bags full of currency to them. Ortiz added that code-laden telephone conversations between Moreno and undercover agents prior to the first meeting were conducted in a manner characteristic of drug-trafficking transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz also testified about a meeting between the undercover agents and the money launderers inside a store immediately prior to the beginning of the July 9 videotape. He noted that Miliano was present at that meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of his testimony, Ortiz stated that in eight years of investigative work he had neither encountered nor heard about \"any other kind of business [besides trafficking in narcotics proceeds that] delivers large amounts of quantities of cash using codes, delivering currency on the street, [in the] denominations\" transported by Miliano. Drawing on this testimony, the overall factual scenario, and Miliano's possession of a gun,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the government argued that Miliano must have known that he was engaged in the laundering of drug money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miliano's lawyer attempted to blunt the force of Ortiz's testimony by establishing that the agent's experience was exclusively in narcotics and the laundering of drug proceeds. Thus, the lawyer argued, Ortiz would not be aware whether or not other criminal enterprises laundered funds using similar techniques. The lawyer added that Miliano himself had not used any codes, nor had he personally carried the funds. Finally, the lawyer asserted that the gun was not probative of whether Miliano believed he was engaged in laundering drug proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Miliano had knowledge that the funds were drug proceeds and, accordingly, applied the six-level enhancement. The court rested this finding primarily on \"the amounts [Miliano] was paid for the pick ups, the bag that was used in the pick ups, the place where the pick ups took place, [and] the modus operandi of drug payments in Puerto Rico.\" This finding, when combined with the other (agreed) sentencing adjustments, yielded a guideline sentencing range of 57-71 months. The court sentenced Miliano to the bottom of the range and then informed him that he had a right to appeal if the sentence imposed was \"contrary to law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This timely appeal ensued.

Here, that question is answered by default: Miliano did not brief it, preferring instead to ignore the waiver and its effect. Even after the government filed its brief, relying heavily on the waiver, Miliano eschewed the filing of a reply brief.

Where, as here, the defendant simply ignores the waiver and seeks to argue the appeal as if no waiver ever had been executed, he forfeits any right to contend either that the waiver should not be enforced or that it does not apply. <i>See Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that arguments not made in an appellant's opening brief are deemed waived); <i>see also United States v. Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d 96, 102 n. 6 (1st Cir.2006) (applying <i>Sandstrom</i> principle in a criminal appeal).

Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14 (1st Cir.2001). There, we held that a waiver of the right to appeal is binding when (i) \"the written plea agreement signed by the defendant contains a clear statement elucidating the waiver and delineating its scope\"; (ii) the district court \"inquire[d] specifically at the change-of-plea hearing into any waiver of appellate rights\"; and (iii) denial of the right to appeal does not work a miscarriage of justice. <i>Id.</i> at 24-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the first two requirements are readily satisfied.

No more was exigible. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gil-Quezada,</i> 445 F.3d 33, 36-37 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v.

This exception is to \"be applied sparingly and without undue generosity.\" <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 26. A miscarriage of justice, at a minimum, involves an increment of error more glaring than routine reversible error. <i>See id.</i> (noting that the miscarriage of justice requirement is \"demanding enough to prevent defendants who have agreed to waive their right to appeal from successfully pursuing garden-variety claims of error\").

The waiver was explicit, and Miliano understood its import. To cinch matters, he failed appropriately to challenge it in his brief on appeal.

Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Rosa Emilia Rodr&#237;guez-V&#233;lez, United States Attorney, and Nelson P&#233;rez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney (Chief, Appellate Division), were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A criminal defendant, disappointed by his sentence, seeks appellate review despite his earlier waiver of any right to appeal. Concluding, as we do, that the defendant has forfeited any right to contest the waiver and that, in all events, no miscarriage of justice will result from its enforcement, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The underlying case had its genesis in a four-count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico. That indictment charged twenty-four individuals with conspiring to distribute narcotics and/or to launder the resultant proceeds. Among those charged with conspiring to commit money laundering was defendant-appellant Victor Miliano. The indictment noted, inter alia, that the authorities had discovered an illegal firearm attributable to Miliano at a stash house.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After some procedural wrangling, not relevant here, Miliano pleaded guilty to both the conspiracy count and to a related forfeiture count. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1956(h), 982. In a negotiated plea agreement (the Agreement), Miliano acknowledged that, on two occasions (July 9 and 12, 2004), he had chauffeured a car carrying drug proceeds totaling nearly one-half million dollars for the purpose of concealing the ownership of the funds. Miliano received a stipend of $300 for the first delivery and $1,000 for the second. While he admitted that he knew that the funds were the avails of illegal activity, he denied knowing that they were derived from narcotics trafficking. This denial, which the government reserved the right to contest, is of some moment; the federal sentencing guidelines demand a six-level enhancement of a defendant's offense level in cases in which the defendant knows or believes that laundered funds are the proceeds of a controlled substance offense. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2S1.1(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to leaving for argument before the sentencing court the question of whether the disputed six-level enhancement should attach, the Agreement recounted a number of agreed adjustments (some upward, some downward). It also contained clauses memorializing the government's agreement (i) not to oppose a sentence at the bottom of whichever guideline range proved to be applicable and (ii) to forgo any monetary recovery on the forfeiture count (except for the mandatory $100 special assessment required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3013(a)). And, finally, the Agreement contained a clause waiving Miliano's right to appeal his sentence as long as the court sentenced him according to its terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the change-of-plea hearing, Miliano had the assistance of a court-appointed interpreter. The district judge explored the voluntariness of Miliano's plea and conducted a thorough inquiry into whether Miliano understood the rights he was surrendering. This inquiry included specific reference to the waiver of appeal. The court then confirmed that Miliano's attorney had reviewed the Agreement with him in Miliano's native tongue (Spanish). In the end, the court found Miliano's plea to be knowing and voluntary, accepted the Agreement, and informed Miliano, in a literally correct comment, that \"under some circumstances you or the government may have the right to appeal any sentence that this court imposes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court convened the disposition hearing on October 18, 2005. The sole disputed factual issue was whether Miliano had known that the transported funds were drug proceeds. The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) recommended an affirmative answer to this question (and, accordingly, recommended inclusion of the six-level enhancement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing itself, the government called as a witness a federal agent, Luis Ortiz, who had overseen the investigation that resulted in Miliano's arrest. To supplement this testimony, the government introduced videotapes of both the July 9 and July 12 incidents. Ortiz narrated the videotapes, which depicted Miliano and an associate, Angel Moreno-N&#250;&#241;ez (Moreno), meeting undercover agents in a public parking lot. On both occasions, Miliano functioned as the driver (using a different car each time) while Moreno conducted the discussions with the undercover agents and delivered shopping bags full of currency to them. Ortiz added that code-laden telephone conversations between Moreno and undercover agents prior to the first meeting were conducted in a manner characteristic of drug-trafficking transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz also testified about a meeting between the undercover agents and the money launderers inside a store immediately prior to the beginning of the July 9 videotape. He noted that Miliano was present at that meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of his testimony, Ortiz stated that in eight years of investigative work he had neither encountered nor heard about \"any other kind of business [besides trafficking in narcotics proceeds that] delivers large amounts of quantities of cash using codes, delivering currency on the street, [in the] denominations\" transported by Miliano. Drawing on this testimony, the overall factual scenario, and Miliano's possession of a gun,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the government argued that Miliano must have known that he was engaged in the laundering of drug money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miliano's lawyer attempted to blunt the force of Ortiz's testimony by establishing that the agent's experience was exclusively in narcotics and the laundering of drug proceeds. Thus, the lawyer argued, Ortiz would not be aware whether or not other criminal enterprises laundered funds using similar techniques. The lawyer added that Miliano himself had not used any codes, nor had he personally carried the funds. Finally, the lawyer asserted that the gun was not probative of whether Miliano believed he was engaged in laundering drug proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Miliano had knowledge that the funds were drug proceeds and, accordingly, applied the six-level enhancement. The court rested this finding primarily on \"the amounts [Miliano] was paid for the pick ups, the bag that was used in the pick ups, the place where the pick ups took place, [and] the modus operandi of drug payments in Puerto Rico.\" This finding, when combined with the other (agreed) sentencing adjustments, yielded a guideline sentencing range of 57-71 months.
