De Ming Huang is a citizen of China who\n\noverstayed his six-month visa to the United States. He applied for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (\"CAT\"), alleging that he suffered persecution from\n\nthe Chinese government on the basis of his political beliefs.             The\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied all of his claims and the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirmed without opinion.             Huang now\n\npetitions for review.1\n\n          We do not grant a petition for review unless the evidence\n\ncompels the conclusion, contrary to the IJ's findings, that the\n\npetitioner   met   his   burden    of   proving   that   he   suffered   past\n\npersecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution based\n\non one of five enumerated grounds.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A);\n\nsee also Wang v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2007).                 We\n\nreview credibility determinations under the substantial evidence\n\nstandard; an adverse credibility finding is overturned only where\n\nthe evidence compels it.     López de Hincapie v. Gonzáles, 494 F.3d\n\n213, 218 (1st Cir. 2007).           The IJ must, however, provide \"a\n\nspecific, cogent, and supportable explanation\" for rejecting the\n\ntestimony as not credible.        Heng v. Gonzáles, 493 F.3d 46, 48 (1st\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Although Huang cites the applicable legal standards for\nwithholding of removal and protection under the CAT, he fails to\nput forth any arguments in support of those claims. We therefore\ndeem them to be waived and review only his claim for asylum. See\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fCir. 2007) (citing Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)).\n\n           Huang's   application   is    predicated   on     two   groups   of\n\nevents: (1) attacks by the Communist government police and (2)\n\nincidents while he was a member of the Chinese armed forces.             With\n\nrespect to both, the IJ concluded that Huang's testimony was not\n\ncredible   because    of   its   vagueness,    lack     of     detail,      and\n\ninconsistencies, which raise questions as to Huang's candor.\n\n           Huang testified that in 1979, when he was working in his\n\nfamily's grocery store, police officers of the Communist government\n\ncame to the store and accosted and beat his father.           Huang alleges\n\nthat when he stepped in to defend his father, he was arrested and\n\ntaken to the police station where he was beaten and imprisoned for\n\ntwenty-four hours without food or water.              A similar incident\n\nallegedly occurred one month later. Although the police ostensibly\n\ncame to the store to collect unpaid taxes, Huang alleges that the\n\nvisits were intended to persecute him and his father on account of\n\ntheir democratic political beliefs.\n\n           In making his adverse credibility determination, the IJ\n\nobserved that Huang had stated that it was his father who was\n\narrested by the police in his written application.            Huang did not\n\nlist any arrests in his application.      Yet, he testified that he had\n\nbeen arrested and beaten by the police officers on account of his\n\npolitical beliefs. In addition to highlighting this inconsistency,\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthe IJ noted that Huang's testimony made only \"vague assertions of\n\n[his] belief in democracy.\"    Huang argues that the IJ makes too\n\nmuch of minor inconsistencies; we disagree.      Indeed, the lack of\n\ndetail which plagues Huang's testimony and the inconsistencies\n\nregarding the 1979 incidents at the family grocery store are not\n\ntrivial but rather are central to his claim.    Whether it was Huang\n\nor his father who was beaten, arrested, and then taken to the\n\npolice station is critical.   Moreover, whether the arrests were in\n\nretaliation for Huang's political beliefs or simply arrests for\n\ninterference with a criminal investigation into unpaid taxes is\n\ncentral to Huang's application.\n\n           Huang also testified that he suffered mistreatment as a\n\nmember of the Chinese armed forces.     He alleges that he was forced\n\nto carry out menial kitchen and latrine duties, beaten, and sprayed\n\nwith feces.   He claims that the treatment was a result of political\n\npersecution because others in the armed forces were aware of his\n\npolitical beliefs.   Huang testified that he fled the army, without\n\npermission, after one year and has lived in hiding for nearly two\n\ndecades.\n\n           Again, the IJ found Huang's testimony to be lacking in\n\nimportant detail and not credible.      The IJ found that Huang made\n\nonly vague assertions of his belief in democracy and his resistance\n\nto communism, and the IJ expressed disbelief that Huang was so\n\nvocal about his political views while a member of the army.    The IJ\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\falso noted that Huang failed to provide any details regarding the\n\ncircumstances of his alleged beating or the incidents regarding the\n\nspraying of feces.       Moreover, despite Huang's assertions of living\n\nin constant fear, he appears to have lived rather freely during the\n\ntwenty years following his leaving the army.                 He was able to have\n\na family, work in his father's store, and leave the country with a\n\ngovernment-issued passport and visa.                When questioned about his\n\nlife during those twenty years, Huang testified inconsistently and\n\nwith a high degree of vagueness.            For example, with respect to his\n\nemployment during that time, he first stated that he was limited to\n\nagricultural work, but then admitted that he worked for his father\n\nand averred in his written application that he was a merchant.                        At\n\nhis hearing, he then denied being a merchant.                         Upon review, we\n\nconclude    that   the    IJ's   adverse     credibility         determination        is\n\nsupported by the record.\n\n            The    IJ   concluded    that    even     if   Huang       had    testified\n\ncredibly, none of his allegations rise to the level of persecution.\n\nWe agree.     As we have often stated in the course of these cases,\n\ndetermining    whether     alleged    incidents       rise       to    the    level   of\n\npersecution    requires     some    evidence     that      the    mistreatment        is\n\n\"systematic    rather     than   reflective      of    a   series        of   isolated\n\nincidents.\"    Bocova v. Gonzáles, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing In re O-Z & I-Z, 22 I. & N. Dec. 23, 26 (BIA 1998)).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            Substantial evidence supports the IJ's conclusions that\n\nthe events testified to by Huang were not sufficient to support a\n\nclaim of past persecution.       Even if he had been arrested and taken\n\ninto custody by the police at his family's grocery store, Huang\n\nfails to present evidence to support his assertion that it was in\n\nretaliation for his political opinions.           He avers that the actions\n\nwere predicated on that basis, yet provides no evidence in support\n\nof his claim.    Indeed, he admitted that the police arrived at the\n\ngrocery store on account of unpaid taxes and testified that his\n\narrests arose out of his interference with the police.             Likewise,\n\nhis allegations of mistreatment while a member of the Chinese army\n\n–- cleaning the latrine and kitchens, being beaten, and sprayed\n\nwith feces –- appear to be isolated events and not the kind of\n\nsystematic mistreatment that rises to the level of persecution.\n\nHis fears of retaliation by the Chinese army also appear to be more\n\nakin   to   prosecution    for   desertion   than    persecution    for   his\n\npolitical beliefs.\n\n            Moreover,     Huang's   claims   of   future   persecution    are\n\nseverely undercut by his ability to live openly in his community\n\nfor twenty years.    See, e.g., Velásquez v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 55,\n\n58 (1st Cir. 2003) (no well-founded fear of persecution where\n\npetitioners remained in the country for eight years after the\n\nalleged persecution), abrogated on other grounds by Bocova, 412\n\nF.3d at 265 n.2.    Furthermore, he provides no evidence that either\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fhe or his father was harassed by the Chinese government after the\n\ntwo incidents at the grocery store in 1979.        See Boukhtouchen v.\n\nGonzáles, 498 F.3d 78, 81 n.3 (1st Cir. 2007) (finding that the\n\nreasonableness of a petitioner's fear of future persecution is\n\nreduced where members of his family continue to reside there\n\nwithout incident). Huang testified that he was able to marry, have\n\na child, work at his father's grocery store, apply for a passport,\n\nand   leave   the   country   unimpeded   even   through   the   Chinese\n\nimmigration proceedings.      His ability to do all of those things\n\nprovides ample support for the IJ's conclusion that Huang lacks a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution. See, e.g., Kheireddine v.\n\nGonzáles, 427 F.3d 80, 87 (1st Cir. 2005) (petitioners' ability to\n\nobtain passports in their own names \"undercuts their claim of\n\npersecution\").\n\n          Accordingly, we deny the petition for review and affirm\n\nthe decision of the BIA.\n\n          DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

Dec. 23, 26 (BIA 1998)).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            Substantial evidence supports the IJ's conclusions that\n\nthe events testified to by Huang were not sufficient to support a\n\nclaim of past persecution.       Even if he had been arrested and taken\n\ninto custody by the police at his family's grocery store, Huang\n\nfails to present evidence to support his assertion that it was in\n\nretaliation for his political opinions.           He avers that the actions\n\nwere predicated on that basis, yet provides no evidence in support\n\nof his claim.    Indeed, he admitted that the police arrived at the\n\ngrocery store on account of unpaid taxes and testified that his\n\narrests arose out of his interference with the police.             Likewise,\n\nhis allegations of mistreatment while a member of the Chinese army\n\n–- cleaning the latrine and kitchens, being beaten, and sprayed\n\nwith feces –- appear to be isolated events and not the kind of\n\nsystematic mistreatment that rises to the level of persecution.\n\nHis fears of retaliation by the Chinese army also appear to be more\n\nakin   to   prosecution    for   desertion   than    persecution    for   his\n\npolitical beliefs.\n\n            Moreover,     Huang's   claims   of   future   persecution    are\n\nseverely undercut by his ability to live openly in his community\n\nfor twenty years.

Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783402\"><a href=\"/opinion/783402/ricardo-f-velasquez-susana-d-granados-urizar-eluvia-r-granados-urizar/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n58 (1st Cir. 2003) (no well-founded fear of persecution where\n\npetitioners remained in the country for eight years after the\n\nalleged persecution), abrogated on other grounds by Bocova, 412\n\nF.3d at 265 n.2.    Furthermore, he provides no evidence that either\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fhe or his father was harassed by the Chinese government after the\n\ntwo incidents at the grocery store in 1979.

His ability to do all of those things\n\nprovides ample support for the IJ's conclusion that Huang lacks a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.
