Noting that a court has now\n\nvacated the criminal conviction on which his removal proceedings\n\nwere premised, Fredy Hugo Pena-Muriel asks us to vacate the Bureau\n\nof Immigration Appeals' (\"BIA\") decision refusing to reopen his\n\nremoval   proceedings.           Pena-Muriel       argues   that      a    change    in\n\nimmigration    law   or,   alternatively,          principles    of       due   process\n\nrequire such a reopening, even though he left the country before he\n\npetitioned the government to reopen his deportation proceedings.\n\nWe reject his arguments and deny the petition for review.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Pena-Muriel,     a    native     and    citizen     of    Bolivia,      was\n\nadmitted to the United States in 1970, when he was less than two\n\nyears old.      After residing in the United States as a lawful\n\npermanent     resident     for    twenty-seven       years,     Pena-Muriel         was\n\nconvicted of domestic assault in February 1997 under R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n§§ 11-5-3 and 12-29-5; he received a one-year suspended sentence\n\nand probation.       As a result of his conviction, Pena-Muriel was\n\nplaced in removal proceedings.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)\n\n(providing for deportation of aliens convicted of an aggravated\n\nfelony); and id. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) (same for crimes of domestic\n\nviolence). An Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") ordered Pena-Muriel removed\n\nto Bolivia in August 1997.         Pena-Muriel neither applied for relief\n\nfrom the order nor appealed the IJ's decision.                   He subsequently\n\nleft the United States.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            In March 2002, Pena-Muriel's Rhode Island conviction was\n\nvacated on the basis of an affidavit from the victim stating that\n\nPena-Muriel       \"should     not   have    been       charged\"    without    further\n\nelaboration.       The victim simply said: \"I am not at liberty to\n\nexplain why.\"       Shortly thereafter – but roughly five years after\n\nhis departure from the United States – Pena-Muriel moved to reopen\n\nhis removal proceedings based on the vacatur of his conviction.\n\nThe IJ denied the motion to reopen, citing 8 C.F.R. § 3.23(b)(1)\n\n(now designated at 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1)), which states: \"A\n\nmotion to reopen or to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf\n\nof   a   person    who   is   the   subject       of    removal,   deportation,      or\n\nexclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the\n\nUnited States.\" (emphasis added).                The BIA summarily affirmed the\n\nIJ's decision in February 2003.\n\n            Months later, Pena-Muriel filed a petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas    corpus    in   the    District         of    Massachusetts.        Upon   the\n\ngovernment's motion, the case was transferred to the First Circuit\n\nas a petition for review pursuant to section 106(c) of the REAL ID\n\nAct of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, div. B, 119 Stat. 231.                             See\n\nAlexandre v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 452 F.3d 1204, 1206 (11th Cir. 2006)\n\n(\"Section 106 of the REAL ID Act amended 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a) so that\n\na petition for review filed with the appropriate court is now an\n\nalien's exclusive means of review of a removal order.                           While\n\nlimiting the avenues of judicial review, the REAL ID Act expanded\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fcourts of appeals' jurisdiction to consider constitutional and\n\nlegal     questions       presented     in    a     petition      for    review.\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(D).      Congress believed that '[b]y placing all review\n\nin the courts of appeals, [the REAL ID Act] would provide an\n\n'adequate and effective' alternative to habeas corpus.'\" (quoting\n\n151 Cong. Rec. H2813-01) (citation omitted)).\n\n              Pena-Muriel    now    argues   that   Congress   abrogated    the\n\nregulation precluding consideration of a motion to reopen after an\n\nalien   has    departed     the    country   when   it   passed    the   Illegal\n\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\") in\n\n1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (codified as\n\namended in scattered sections of 8 U.S.C.).               IIRIRA amended the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Act (\"INA\"), in relevant part, by\n\nremoving 8 U.S.C. § 1105a(c) (1994) (repealed 1996), which stated:\n\n\"An order of deportation . . . shall not be reviewed by any court\n\nif the alien . . . has departed from the United States after the\n\nissuance of the order.\"            Describing 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) as\n\n\"linked\" to this statutory provision, Pena-Muriel argues that the\n\ndeletion of § 1105a(c) invalidated the regulation.             Alternatively,\n\nPena-Muriel argues that allowing his deportability to be premised\n\non a vacated conviction violates his Fifth Amendment due process\n\nrights.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f                                        II.\n\nA.    The Statutory Claim\n\n             The premise of Pena-Muriel's statutory claim – that the\n\nregulation on which the BIA based its dismissal was inextricably\n\nlinked to the language of the superseded statute – is wrong.                      At\n\nthe   time   the    regulation    was     adopted,      there   was   no    statutory\n\nauthority for a motion to reopen.                See INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S.\n\n314, 322 (1992).1      Instead, the regulation arose from the Attorney\n\nGeneral's broad discretion to regulate relief from deportation\n\norders.      See Goncalves v. INS, 6 F.3d 830, 832 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(recognizing that \"Congress intended the Attorney General to have\n\nconsiderable leeway in working out the precise procedures for\n\ndetermining        contested     issues     related       to    deportation      and\n\n'discretionary relief'\").          The Attorney General's authority to\n\nprohibit consideration of motions to reopen from aliens who have\n\ndeparted the United States did not originally depend upon the\n\nstatutory language in § 1105a(c).                 Thus, the removal of that\n\nstatutory     language   by    IIRIRA     does    not    abrogate     the    Attorney\n\nGeneral's authority to continue to enforce the limitations of 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       With IIRIRA's enactment, motions to reopen were transformed\nfrom a regulatory to a statutory form of relief. See Azarte v.\nAshcroft, 394 F.3d 1278, 1283-84 (9th Cir. 2005) (discussing\nIIRIRA's codification of the reopening procedure).\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f            Pena-Muriel also argues that, by deleting the language of\n\n§ 1105a(c), Congress signaled its intent that the Attorney General\n\nshould no longer enforce 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).                     The Attorney\n\nGeneral    counters    that    the    statutory        change     signals   no   such\n\nintention.       The   parties   point     to    no    statutory      language   that\n\nexplicitly addresses the issue.            As the Supreme Court has stated,\n\nwhere a statute is silent or ambiguous on the issue at hand, we\n\nmust \"defer to a reasonable construction by the agency charged with\n\nits implementation.\"        Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003)\n\n(citing Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S.\n\n837, 843 (1984)).\n\n            In    challenging        the   reasonableness of the Attorney\n\nGeneral's interpretation of the INA amendments as they relate to\n\nthe   reopening    issue,     Pena-Muriel       cites       due   process   concerns\n\nexpressed during testimony before the House Judiciary Committee\n\npreceding IIRIRA's passage:\n\n            The administration is committed to ensuring\n            that aliens in deportation proceedings are\n            afforded appropriate due process; however, the\n            availability of multiple layers of judicial\n            review has frustrated the timely removal of\n            deportable aliens.\n\nRemoval of Criminal and Illegal Aliens: Hearing Before the Subcomm.\n\non Immigration and Claims of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th\n\nCong. 15 (1995) (statement of T. Alexander Aleinikoff, General\n\nCounsel, Immigration and Naturalization Service).                       Pena-Muriel\n\nargues    that   Congress,     motivated        by    due   process    concerns    to\n\n                                        -6-\n\freinstate judicial review despite an alien's departure, would be\n\nsimilarly motivated to permit motions to reopen administrative\n\nproceedings      by   persons       subject    to    removal,   deportation,    or\n\nexclusion proceedings after they have left the country.\n\n            Pena-Muriel misunderstands the context of the due process\n\nconcerns expressed in the congressional testimony.                       Prior to\n\nIIRIRA,    \"an   alien   seeking      review    of    a   deportation   order   was\n\nentitled to an automatic stay pending the completion of that\n\nreview.\"     Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nIIRIRA \"altered that paradigm,\" instead \"requir[ing] a review-\n\nseeker to ask the reviewing court for a stay of removal,\" id., and\n\nraising the standards that must be met in order to receive such a\n\nstay. See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm., 525 U.S. 471,\n\n475 (1999) (noting that IIRIRA \"repealed the old judicial-review\n\nscheme     set   forth   in     §    1105a     and   instituted    a    new   []and\n\nsignificantly more restrictive[] one\").               Because this change would\n\nresult in the deportation of many aliens while they were awaiting\n\njudicial review, Congress amended the INA to allow these aliens to\n\ncontinue litigating their appeals from abroad. See Tapia Garcia v.\n\nINS, 237 F.3d 1216, 1217 (10th Cir. 2001) (recognizing, in this\n\nlimited context, that \"deportation no longer forecloses judicial\n\nreview\").\n\n            Understood against this background, the testimony cited\n\nby Pena-Muriel does not advance his position.                Indeed, the concern\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fexpressed about \"multiple layers of judicial review\" reflects an\n\nintent to reinforce the finality of removal decisions.                        With the\n\namendments to the INA, Congress allowed post-departure appeals of\n\nthe BIA's original order of deportation, thereby protecting the\n\nalien's first opportunity to challenge a deportation order in\n\ncourt.     That change does not remotely support an argument that\n\nCongress    also    intended,     implicitly,        to    allow     post-departure\n\npetitions to reopen a closed administrative proceeding.\n\n            The government also points out that IIRIRA enacted strict\n\ntime limits for the filing of motions to reopen and limited aliens\n\nto a single filing.          See Azarte v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1278, 1286\n\n(9th Cir. 2005) (noting that before IIRIRA \"motions to reopen were\n\nnever time-barred\"); Sidikhouya v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 950, 951-52\n\n(8th Cir. 2005) (explaining that IIRIRA allows aliens to file a\n\n\"single    motion      to     reopen    at    the        conclusion      of    removal\n\nproceedings\").      Yet, Congress remained silent regarding the long-\n\nstanding regulatory bar imposed by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1).\n\nCiting Supreme Court precedent, the government argues that \"when\n\nCongress    revisits     a    statute    giving      rise    to     a    longstanding\n\nadministrative      interpretation        without        pertinent       change,   the\n\n'congressional      failure      to     revise      or     repeal       the   agency's\n\ninterpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is\n\nthe one intended by Congress.'\"           Commod. Futures Trading Comm'n v.\n\nSchor, 478 U.S. 833, 846 (1986) (quoting NLRB v. Bell Aerospace\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fCo., 416 U.S. 267, 275 (1974)).           The government's insistence that\n\nthe Attorney General's interpretation was the one intended by\n\nCongress    may    be    overreaching.         Nevertheless,     this   precedent\n\nsupports     the        reasonableness        of     the   Attorney     General's\n\ninterpretation     of     the   effect   of    the   statutory   change   on   the\n\nregulatory bar imposed by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(1) on motions to\n\nreopen.\n\nB.   The Due Process Claim\n\n            Pena-Muriel argues that allowing his deportation order to\n\nstand on the basis of a criminal conviction that has since been\n\nvacated violates his constitutional right to due process.                       We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            Pena-Muriel cites a variety of cases for the principle\n\nthat \"the overturning of a conviction upon which deportability was\n\npremised is an appropriate basis for reopening administrative\n\nproceedings.\"      De Faria v. INS, 13 F.3d 422, 423 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\nsee also Alim v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 1239, 1249-50 (11th Cir. 2006);\n\nCruz-Garza v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 1125, 1128-29 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nHowever, the fact that a vacatur may be an \"appropriate\" basis for\n\nreopening a deportation order does not establish a due process\n\nright to such reopening after one has departed the country.2\n\n\n\n      2\n      In addition, Pena-Muriel's situation is distinguishable from\nthese cases because each of them involved convictions that were\nvacated before the removal proceedings had terminated and while\neach petitioner remained in the country.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f              It is well-established that aliens are entitled to due\n\nprocess in deportation proceedings.             See Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S.\n\n292, 306 (1993); Choeum v. INS, 129 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nIn this context, due process requires that the alien receive notice\n\nof the charges against him, and a fair opportunity to be heard\n\nbefore an executive or administrative tribunal.                Choeum, 129 F.3d\n\nat   38.      Pena-Muriel      received   due   process   in   his   deportation\n\nproceedings.       At the time of his departure, Pena-Muriel had been\n\nconvicted of crimes triggering deportation provisions. His removal\n\nproceeding came to a lawful conclusion before his conviction was\n\nvacated.      With the benefit of appropriate notice, he received a\n\nhearing before an IJ and the opportunity for an administrative\n\nappeal to the BIA.         He waived an appeal to the BIA after he was\n\nordered removed. He made no attempt to vacate his conviction prior\n\nto his departure; and he voluntarily left the country.               He makes no\n\nclaim      that   the   IJ's   removal    order    in   1997   was   invalid    or\n\nconstitutionally infirm.\n\n              Now Pena-Muriel seeks to reopen proceedings that ended\n\nroughly ten years ago, on the basis of a vacatur that occurred five\n\nyears after he voluntarily removed himself from the country.                   Due\n\nprocess     does   not   require    continuous      opportunities     to   attack\n\nexecuted removal orders years beyond an alien's departure from the\n\ncountry.      Indeed, there is a strong public interest in bringing\n\nfinality to the deportation process.              See Baez v. INS, 41 F.3d 19,\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f24 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting \"Congress's intention to eliminate\n\nexcessive appeals and lend finality to the deportation process\").\n\n                              III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

At the time the regulation was adopted, there was no statutory authority for a motion to reopen. <i>See INS v.

Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 104th Cong. 15 (1995) (statement of T. Alexander Aleinikoff, General Counsel, Immigration and Naturalization Service). Pena-Muriel argues that Congress, motivated by due process concerns to reinstate judicial review despite an alien's departure, would be similarly motivated to permit motions to reopen administrative proceedings by persons subject to removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings after they have left the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pena-Muriel misunderstands the context of the due process concerns expressed in the congressional testimony. Prior to IIRIRA, \"an alien seeking review of a deportation order was entitled to an automatic stay pending the completion of that review.\" <i>Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> 344 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2003). IIRIRA \"altered that paradigm,\" instead \"requir[ing] a review-seeker to ask the reviewing court for a stay of removal,\" <i>id.,</i> and raising the standards that must be met in order to receive such a stay. <i>See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm.,</i> 525 U.S. 471, 475, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999) (noting that IIRIRA \"repealed the old judicial-review scheme set forth in &#167; 1105a and instituted a new []and significantly more restrictive[] one\"). Because this change would result in the deportation of many aliens while they were awaiting judicial review, Congress amended the INA to allow these aliens to continue litigating their appeals from abroad. <i>See Tapia Garcia v. INS,</i> 237 F.3d 1216, 1217 (10th Cir.2001) (recognizing, in this limited context, that \"deportation no longer forecloses judicial review\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understood against this background, the testimony cited by Pena-Muriel does not advance his position. Indeed, the concern expressed about \"multiple layers of judicial review\" reflects an intent to reinforce the finality of removal decisions. With the amendments to the INA, Congress allowed post-departure appeals of the BIA's original order of deportation, thereby protecting the alien's first opportunity to challenge a deportation order in court. That change does not remotely support an argument that Congress also intended, implicitly, to allow post-departure petitions to reopen a closed administrative proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also points out that IIRIRA enacted strict time limits for the filing of motions to reopen and limited aliens to a single filing. <i>See Azarte v. Ashcroft,</i> 394 F.3d 1278, 1286 (9th Cir. 2005) (noting that before IIRIRA \"motions to reopen were never time-barred\"); <i>Sidikhouya v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 950, 951-52 (8th Cir.2005) (explaining that IIRIRA allows aliens to file a \"single motion to reopen at the conclusion of removal proceedings\"). Yet, Congress remained silent regarding the long-standing regulatory bar imposed by 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(1). Citing Supreme Court precedent, the government argues that \"when Congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation without pertinent change, the `congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency's interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress.'\" <i>Commod. Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor,</i> 478 U.S. 833, 846, 106 S.Ct. 3245, 92 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986) (quoting <i>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co.,</i> 416 U.S. 267, 275, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974)). The government's insistence that the Attorney General's interpretation was the one intended by Congress may be overreaching. Nevertheless, this precedent supports the reasonableness of the Attorney General's interpretation of the effect of the statutory change on the regulatory bar imposed by 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(1) on motions to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pena-Muriel cites a variety of cases for the principle that \"the overturning of a conviction upon which deportability was premised is an appropriate basis for reopening administrative proceedings.\" <i>De Faria v. INS,</i> 13 F.3d 422, 423 (1st Cir.1993); <i>see also Alim v. Gonzales,</i> 446 F.3d 1239, 1249-50 (11th Cir.2006); <i>Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft,</i> 396 F.3d 1125, 1128-29 (10th Cir.2005). However, the fact that a vacatur may be an \"appropriate\" basis for reopening a deportation order does not establish a due process right to such reopening after one has departed the country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that aliens are entitled to due process in deportation proceedings. <i>See Reno v. Flores,</i> 507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993); <i>Choeum v. INS,</i> 129 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir.1997). In this context, due process requires that the alien receive notice of the charges against him, and a fair opportunity to be heard before an executive or administrative tribunal. <i>Choeum,</i> 129 F.3d at 38. Pena-Muriel received due process in his deportation proceedings. At the time of his departure, Pena-Muriel had been convicted of crimes triggering deportation provisions. His removal proceeding came to a lawful conclusion before his conviction was vacated. With the benefit of appropriate notice, he received a hearing before an IJ and the opportunity for an administrative appeal to the BIA. He waived an appeal to the BIA after he was ordered removed. He made no attempt to vacate his conviction prior to his departure; and he voluntarily left the country. He makes no claim that the IJ's removal order in 1997 was invalid or constitutionally infirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now Pena-Muriel seeks to reopen proceedings that ended roughly ten years ago, on the basis of a vacatur that occurred five years after he voluntarily removed himself from the country. Due process does not require continuous opportunities to attack executed removal orders years beyond an alien's departure from the country. Indeed, there is a strong public interest in bringing finality to the deportation process. <i>See Baez v. INS,</i> 41 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir.1994) (noting \"Congress's intention to eliminate excessive appeals and lend finality to the deportation process\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> With IIRIRA's enactment, motions to reopen were transformed from a regulatory to a statutory form of relief<i>See Azarte v.

Pena-Muriel argues that Congress, motivated by due process concerns to reinstate judicial review despite an alien's departure, would be similarly motivated to permit motions to reopen administrative proceedings by persons subject to removal, deportation, or exclusion proceedings after they have left the country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pena-Muriel misunderstands the context of the due process concerns expressed in the congressional testimony. Prior to IIRIRA, \"an alien seeking review of a deportation order was entitled to an automatic stay pending the completion of that review.\" <i>Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200622\"><a href=\"/opinion/200622/arevalo-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2003). IIRIRA \"altered that paradigm,\" instead \"requir[ing] a review-seeker to ask the reviewing court for a stay of removal,\" <i>id.,</i> and raising the standards that must be met in order to receive such a stay. <i>See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrim.

Because this change would result in the deportation of many aliens while they were awaiting judicial review, Congress amended the INA to allow these aliens to continue litigating their appeals from abroad. <i>See Tapia Garcia v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160639\"><a href=\"/opinion/160639/tapia-garcia-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span>, 1217 (10th Cir.2001) (recognizing, in this limited context, that \"deportation no longer forecloses judicial review\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understood against this background, the testimony cited by Pena-Muriel does not advance his position. Indeed, the concern expressed about \"multiple layers of judicial review\" reflects an intent to reinforce the finality of removal decisions. With the amendments to the INA, Congress allowed post-departure appeals of the BIA's original order of deportation, thereby protecting the alien's first opportunity to challenge a deportation order in court. That change does not remotely support an argument that Congress also intended, implicitly, to allow post-departure petitions to reopen a closed administrative proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also points out that IIRIRA enacted strict time limits for the filing of motions to reopen and limited aliens to a single filing. <i>See Azarte v.

Yet, Congress remained silent regarding the long-standing regulatory bar imposed by 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(1). Citing Supreme Court precedent, the government argues that \"when Congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation without pertinent change, the `congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency's interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress.'\" <i>Commod.

Nevertheless, this precedent supports the reasonableness of the Attorney General's interpretation of the effect of the statutory change on the regulatory bar imposed by 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.23(b)(1) on motions to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

However, the fact that a vacatur may be an \"appropriate\" basis for reopening a deportation order does not establish a due process right to such reopening after one has departed the country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that aliens are entitled to due process in deportation proceedings. <i>See Reno v.

In this context, due process requires that the alien receive notice of the charges against him, and a fair opportunity to be heard before an executive or administrative tribunal. <i>Choeum,</i> 129 F.3d at 38. Pena-Muriel received due process in his deportation proceedings. At the time of his departure, Pena-Muriel had been convicted of crimes triggering deportation provisions. His removal proceeding came to a lawful conclusion before his conviction was vacated. With the benefit of appropriate notice, he received a hearing before an IJ and the opportunity for an administrative appeal to the BIA. He waived an appeal to the BIA after he was ordered removed. He made no attempt to vacate his conviction prior to his departure; and he voluntarily left the country. He makes no claim that the IJ's removal order in 1997 was invalid or constitutionally infirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now Pena-Muriel seeks to reopen proceedings that ended roughly ten years ago, on the basis of a vacatur that occurred five years after he voluntarily removed himself from the country. Due process does not require continuous opportunities to attack executed removal orders years beyond an alien's departure from the country. Indeed, there is a strong public interest in bringing finality to the deportation process. <i>See Baez v.
