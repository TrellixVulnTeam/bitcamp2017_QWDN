SUMSKI, TRUSTEE, ET AL.,\n\n                                  Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n              [Hon. Paul Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                         Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                             Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Leonard G. Deming, II and Deming Law Office, on brief for\nappellant.\n\n\n\n                                 June 2, 2006\n\f          Per Curiam.     This is an interlocutory appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of (1) a motion to stay a bankruptcy court\n\norder pending appeal of that order to the district court and (2) a\n\nmotion for reconsideration of the denial of the motion to stay.\n\nAlthough the appellant has not filed a motion for a stay pending\n\nappeal in this court, his brief seeks such relief and alleges that\n\nhe will be irreparably harmed without it.     Because we find that\n\nthis appeal presents no substantial question, see 1st Cir. R.\n\n27(c), we proceed to the merits.\n\n          The underlying bankruptcy court order, which the debtor\n\nseeks to stay pending his appeal to the district court, granted a\n\ncreditor, Wachovia Bank (\"the bank\"), relief from the automatic\n\nstay to enable it to foreclose on its mortgage loan to the debtor,\n\nwhich was secured by the debtor's home.    That order was based on\n\nthe debtor's pre-petition arrearages1 and his subsequent failure to\n\ncomply with an \"adequate protection\" order requiring him to make\n\ntimely monthly payments to the bank in specified amounts.\n\n          As the debtor acknowledges, the courts below properly\n\napplied   the   traditional   four-part   standard   applicable   to\n\npreliminary injunctions in determining whether to grant a stay\n\npending appeal, Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 296 F.3d 13, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 2002), namely, \"(1) whether the applicant has made a\n\n\n     1\n      According to the bankruptcy court docket, the bank has a\nsecured claim of $257,458.43, and the pre-petition arrearage on its\nmortgage note was $45,144.34.\n\n                                -2-\n\fstrong showing of success on the merits; (2) whether the applicant\n\nwill be irreparably harmed absent injunctive relief; (3) whether\n\nissuance of the stay will injure other parties; and (4) where the\n\npublic interest lies,\" id. at 16 n.3.   We review the lower courts'\n\ndenial of such relief for abuse of discretion or error of law.\n\nSunshine Dev., Inc. v. FDIC, 33 F.3d 106, 110-11 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          The debtor's argument that the lower courts should have\n\ngiven greater weight to the balance of harms--as opposed to the\n\ndebtor's likelihood of success on appeal--is foreclosed by our\n\ndecisions emphasizing that \"'[t]he sine qua non [of the stay\n\npending appeal standard] is whether the [movants] are likely to\n\nsucceed on the merits,'\" Acevedo-Garcia, 296 F.3d at 16 (quoting\n\nWeaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1993)), and that,\n\naccordingly, \"'[w]hat matters . . . is not the raw amount of\n\nirreparable harm [a] party might conceivably suffer, but rather the\n\nrisk of such harm in light of the party's chance of success on the\n\nmerits,'\" P.R. Hosp. Supply, Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp., 426\n\nF.3d 503, 507 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting the Massachusetts\n\nstandard, which \"closely tracks the federal standard\").\n\n          The debtor's chances of success on the merits of his\n\nappeal to the district court do appear slim.   The debtor does not\n\nallege that the bankruptcy court committed any factual errors in\n\nfinding that, at the time that the bank filed its affidavit of\n\nnoncompliance with the adequate protection order, the debtor's\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fpayments were short $2,782, approximately one and a half regular\n\nmonthly payments, and that some of those payments were late.             Nor\n\ncould such a claim reasonably be made since, in making those\n\nfindings, the bankruptcy court relied on the evidence produced by\n\nthe debtor himself, rather than that originally produced by the\n\nbank, which the debtor claims was inaccurate and incomplete.\n\n           Nor does the debtor argue that his original delinquency,\n\ncoupled with his failure to comply with the adequate protection\n\norder, did not constitute \"cause\" for granting relief from the\n\nautomatic stay under 11 U.S.C. ยง 362(d).        Any such argument would\n\nbe   unavailing,   given   the   statute's   definition   of   \"cause\"    as\n\n\"including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in\n\nproperty of [a] party in interest.\"       Id. ยง 362(d)(1).\n\n           Rather, the debtor premises his likelihood of success on\n\nthe allegedly confusing nature of the adequate protection order,\n\nhis good faith, and his substantial compliance with the order.            We\n\nsee nothing confusing about the adequate protection order, which\n\nspecified precisely when and in what amounts the payments were to\n\nbe made.   And the debtor has cited no authority for the proposition\n\nthat his alleged good faith and substantial compliance with the\n\nadequate protection order are legally relevant to whether to grant\n\nrelief from the automatic stay to a creditor whose interests are\n\notherwise inadequately protected. In any event, we see no abuse of\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fdiscretion in refusing to stay an order relieving the bank from the\n\nautomatic stay under the circumstances presented here.\n\n           Furthermore, we agree with the bankruptcy court that \"the\n\nDebtor's demonstrated inability to make timely adequate protection\n\npayments over a period of time renders his contention that the\n\ninterests of [the bank] can be protected by the Debtor's ability to\n\ncontinue   making   adequate   protection   payments   unpersuasive.\"\n\nTherefore, even the balance of harms is not clearly in the debtor's\n\nfavor.\n\n           Because the debtor has not shown that the district court\n\neither abused its discretion or erred as a matter of law in denying\n\nhis motions for a stay and for reconsideration, the district\n\ncourt's orders are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
