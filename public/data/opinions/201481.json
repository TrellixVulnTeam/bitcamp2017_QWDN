Alexis Terreforte Quidgley appeals the district\n\ncourt's denial of his motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 599 to the United States\n\nSentencing Guidelines.       See U.S.S.G. Supp. App. C, amend. 599\n\n(2002) (amending U.S.S.G. § 2K2.4).              We agree with the district\n\ncourt's   determination    that    Amendment        599   does   not    apply   to\n\nappellant's sentence.       Appellant's additional arguments, which\n\nappear to be based on U.S.S.G. § 3C1.2 and the Supreme Court's\n\nrecent decision in Blakely v. Washington, __ U.S. __, 124 S.Ct.\n\n2531 (2004), were not presented to the district court and are\n\ntherefore not properly before us.             See United States v. Martinez-\n\nMartinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1219 (1st Cir. 1995).                 In any event, we\n\nnote   that    appellant   did    not    receive     a    §   3C1.2    sentencing\n\nenhancement.\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of the\n\nmotion for reduction of sentence.             However, in accordance with the\n\ngovernment's request, we remand the case for the limited purpose of\n\nallowing the government to seek dismissal of the charge brought\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 2113(e), as contemplated in the plea agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f",
