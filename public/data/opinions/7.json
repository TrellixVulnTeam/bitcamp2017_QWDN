Warren were on brief for appellant.\n     Paul V. Sullivan for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         February 17, 2010\n\f                  STAHL, Circuit Judge.            This case arises out of a car\n\naccident on December 17, 2002, in Boston, Massachusetts.                        On that\n\nday, Heidi M. Baker, the plaintiff-appellant and a resident of\n\nRhode Island, was driving a vehicle owned by her employer, Safety\n\nSource Northeast1 (\"Safety\"), as part of her job duties.                       Baker was\n\nseriously injured in the car accident, which was caused by the\n\nother       driver.        Baker   filed     a     third-party   claim    against    the\n\ntortfeasor,          but    the    other     driver's     insurance      coverage    was\n\ninsufficient to cover Baker's damages.                   Baker also filed for and\n\nreceived workers' compensation (\"WC\") benefits through the Rhode\n\nIsland workers' compensation system.                     Finally, Baker sought to\n\nrecover under the Underinsured Motorist (UIM) provision of her\n\nemployer's automobile insurance policy,2 which was provided by St.\n\nPaul Travelers Insurance Company (\"St. Paul\"), the defendant-\n\nappellee in this case.             St. Paul denied Baker's attempt to recover\n\nunder       the    UIM     provision,      citing     Massachusetts      law   for   the\n\nproposition         that    an    employee    cannot    recover    for    work-related\n\ninjuries under both workers' compensation and her employer's UIM\n\ncoverage.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Safety Source Northeast is a Massachusetts corporation with\nits principal place of business in Massachusetts. According to\nBaker, Safety is licensed to do business in Rhode Island and Baker\nwas hired by Safety in Rhode Island and exclusively worked out of\nSafety's Rhode Island office, in Warwick, Rhode Island.\n        2\n      The insurance               policy     was     executed    and     delivered    in\nMassachusetts.\n\n                                             -2-\n\f            In response to the denial, Baker filed a complaint in\n\nRhode Island state court seeking a declaratory judgment regarding\n\nher eligibility for coverage under St. Paul's UIM coverage.3                  St.\n\nPaul removed the case to Rhode Island District Court and Baker and\n\nSt. Paul both moved for summary judgment.               A magistrate judge\n\nrecommended granting St. Paul's motion and denying Baker's, on the\n\ngrounds     that    Massachusetts     law    governed     the     matter      and\n\nMassachusetts case law prohibited recovery by an injured employee\n\nunder both workers' compensation and her employer's UIM coverage.\n\nBaker filed a written objection to the report and recommendation,\n\narguing that Rhode Island law should apply, but that even under\n\nMassachusetts      law   the   bar   on   recovery    under     both    workers'\n\ncompensation and the employer's UIM coverage did not apply where\n\nthe UIM coverage was a bargained-for provision.            Nonetheless, the\n\ndistrict court adopted the magistrate's report and recommendation\n\nin full, writing additionally only to correct an error in the\n\nmagistrate's report. See Baker v. Safety Source Northeast, No. 07-\n\n314 ML, 2009 WL 211865 (D.R.I. January 28, 2009).                  This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n            For    the   following    reasons,   we     disagree       with   the\n\nconclusion reached by the district court and will remand this case\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n     3\n      Baker also brought suit in state court against her employer,\nSafety.    After removal by Safety to federal court, Baker\nvoluntarily dismissed her claim against Safety.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f          As a preliminary matter, we must determine what law\n\ngoverns the question before us.    Because this court is sitting in\n\ndiversity, we apply the choice of law rules of the forum state,\n\nhere, Rhode Island.   See Montalvo v. Gonzalez-Amparo, 587 F.3d 43,\n\n46 (1st Cir. 2009).   Under Rhode Island law, \"[W]hen the insured is\n\na Massachusetts corporation doing business in Massachusetts, and\n\nthe   contract   is   executed   and    delivered   in   Massachusetts,\n\nMassachusetts law governs the interpretation of the contract.\"\n\nHartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. A & M Assoc., Ltd., 200 F. Supp. 2d 84,\n\n87 (D.R.I. 2002) (citing Baker v. Hanover Ins. Co., 568 A.2d 1023,\n\n1025 (R.I. 1990)). Thus, in this case, Massachusetts law applies.4\n\n          The district court concluded that two decisions from the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), Berger v. H.P. Hood,\n\n\n      4\n      Baker argues that Rhode Island law should apply under the\ninterest-weighing approach adopted in Woodward v. Stewart, 243 A.2d\n917, 923 (R.I. 1968). Such a conclusion would clearly advantage\nBaker because Rhode Island law seems to permit an injured employee\nto recover under both workers' compensation and her employer's UIM\ncoverage, provided the WC payment is reduced by the amount of the\nUIM recovery (an \"offset\").       Though the parties cite to no\ndefinitive Rhode Island case so holding, there are numerous cases\nthat suggest this result. See, e.g., Poulos v. Aetna Cas. & Sur.\nCo., 379 A.2d 362, 365 (R.I. 1977) (where an injured employee's\npersonal UIM coverage includes an offset provision regarding\nworkers' compensation, such clause is enforceable only to the\nextent that it prevents a double recovery by the injured employee);\nCruz v. Wausau Ins., 866 A.2d 1238, 1239-40 (R.I. 2005) (court only\ndecided a procedural matter and raised no objection to injured\nemployee's recovery from both WC and his employer's UIM coverage);\nCharest v. Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co., 1996 WL 936921 (R.I. Super.\nApril 23, 1996) (an injured employee who recovered on his\nemployer's UIM coverage and received WC payments was required to\noffset those two amounts when he sought coverage from a third\nsource, his personal UIM coverage).\n\n                                  -4-\n\fInc., 416 Mass. 652 (1993), and Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v.\n\nFigaratto, 423 Mass. 346 (1996), squarely foreclosed Baker's claim.\n\nWe do not agree.        Berger and National Union only address whether\n\nthe       exclusivity   provision   of    the   Massachusetts   workers'\n\ncompensation statute permits an injured employee to recover under\n\nboth WC and her employer's UIM coverage.        See Berger, 416 Mass. at\n\n652 (\"At issue is whether the exclusivity provision of the Workers'\n\nCompensation Act, G.L. c. 152, ยง 23 (1992 ed.), bars an employee's\n\nclaim against the owner and the insurer of the employer's motor\n\nvehicles, for underinsurance benefits.\"); Nat'l Union, 423 Mass. at\n\n348 (explaining that the court was bound to follow its recent\n\ndecision in Berger, which held that \"the exclusivity provision of\n\nthe Workers' Compensation Act . . . barred the employee's claim\n\nagainst the employer's insurers.\").       In contrast, in Baker's case,\n\nshe has recovered workers' compensation benefits under the Rhode\n\nIsland workers' compensation statute, rather than the Massachusetts\n\nstatute. Therefore, in our view, Berger and National Union are not\n\ndispositive.5\n\n              Thus, because the SJC has not \"spoken directly to the\n\nprecise question that confronts us,\" we are tasked with predicting\n\n\"how that court likely would decide the issue.\"       Gonzalez Figueroa\n\n\n      5\n      It is also worth noting that the SJC acknowledged in Berger\nthat state courts have reached a variety of conclusions on this\nquestion depending on how they have interpreted the exclusivity\nprovisions of their own workers' compensation statutes.       See\nBerger, 416 Mass. at 655 and n.8.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fv. J.C. Penney Puerto Rico, Inc., 568 F.3d 313, 318 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).   We are persuaded that the SJC's decisions in Berger and\n\nNational Union were largely governed by the court's policy concerns\n\nregarding providing Massachusetts companies with a predictable and\n\nreliable scheme concerning the interplay of workers' compensation\n\nand underinsured motorist coverage, and holding down insurance\n\ncosts for Massachusetts companies.6   Because this case concerns a\n\nMassachusetts company doing business in Massachusetts, and carrying\n\nan auto insurance policy executed and delivered in Massachusetts,\n\nwe expect these policy concerns would lead the SJC to apply the\n\nconclusions of Berger and National Union to this case, even though\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      In Berger the court noted that the Massachusetts uninsured\nmotorist provision was intended to \"minimize the possibility of .\n. . catastrophic financial loss [to] the victims of an automobile\naccident,\" while in the case of a workplace injury, \"the employee\nis protected from the risk of catastrophic financial loss through\nworkers' compensation.\" 416 Mass. at 656 (internal citations and\nquotations omitted). In National Union, the court expanded on this\npolicy concern:\n\n     As a matter of fair and equal treatment, a person injured\n     in the course of employment while in a motor vehicle of\n     the employer need not obtain any greater insurance\n     benefits than another person sustaining a similar injury\n     in the course of employment but not in a motor vehicle of\n     the employer.    The cost of UM coverage for employers\n     would be substantially higher than otherwise if that\n     coverage in a standard policy applied to employees'\n     on-the-job motor vehicle injuries. That increase would\n     not be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the\n     cost of workers' compensation coverage.\n\n423 Mass. at 349-50.\n\n                               -6-\n\fthose     cases    concerned    collection   of    WC   payments    under   the\n\nMassachusetts worker's compensation scheme.\n\n             However, that conclusion does not end our analysis.             In\n\nNational Union, decided three years after Berger, the SJC carved\n\nout an exception to the general bar on an employee's recovery under\n\nboth WC and her employer's UIM coverage.             \"[W]e would not extend\n\nthe bar imposed by the exclusivity provision of the Workers'\n\nCompensation Act to make ineffective [UIM] coverage (or any other\n\ncoverage) that an employer explicitly purchased for the purpose of\n\nproviding [UIM] coverage (or any other coverage) to employees\n\ninjured in the course of their employment.\"             423 Mass. at 350-51.\n\nBelow, the district court granted summary judgment to St. Paul\n\nwithout addressing the carve-out language in National Union, and\n\ntherefore it did not reach the factual question of whether the\n\nunderinsurance coverage purchased by Safety was indeed a bargained-\n\nfor     provision    intended    to    provide    Safety's    employees     with\n\nadditional        protection    from   damages    caused     by    underinsured\n\nmotorists.7\n\n\n\n      7\n      St. Paul argues that the National Union carve-out only\napplies to \"non-standard\" policies, which St. Paul appears to\ndefine as policies that do not use the standard forms issued by the\nMassachusetts Insurance Commissioner. The plain language of the\nNational Union carve-out, however, suggests a broader exclusion of\nany coverage explicitly purchased in order to provide additional\nprotection to the employer's workers. This exception requires a\nfactual determination as to whether the UIM coverage was elected\nand paid for by the employer in order to protect his employees from\nthe harm of underinsured motorists.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f            Our review of the contract shows that at the time of the\n\naccident Safety carried underinsured motorist coverage in the\n\namount of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident.                   The\n\ncontract also shows that Safety paid a premium of $79.00 in order\n\nto receive this coverage during the policy year.            Further, we take\n\njudicial     notice   of    the   Massachusetts     Commercial     Automobile\n\nInsurance    Manual   for   2002,   the    year   the   policy   was   issued.8\n\nAccording to the Manual, it appears that in 2002 there was no\n\ncompulsory     underinsured       motorist    coverage     requirement     for\n\ncommercial automobile policies and insurers were only required to\n\noffer underinsured motorist coverage at limits up to $35,000 per\n\nperson/$80,000 per accident.          In addition, the Manual set the\n\n\"basic limit\" for underinsured motorist coverage at $20,000 per\n\nperson/$40,000 per accident.         The limited facts available to us\n\nsuggest that perhaps Safety purchased and paid for additional UIM\n\ncoverage above and beyond what was required by law in force at the\n\ntime.    However, without the benefit of discovery, we are unable to\n\nconclusively determine whether Safety indeed bargained for the UIM\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      The manual is available in PDF form on the public website of\nthe Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts (AIB).         See\nhttp://www.aib.org/ContentPages/DocumentView.aspx?DocId=559. The\nAIB is a non-profit association of Massachusetts insurers that is\nsubject to the \"visitation, supervision and examination\" of the\nMassachusetts Commissioner of Insurance.      See Constitution of\nAutomobile     Insurers     Bureau    of     Massachusetts,     at\nhttp://www.aib.org/ContentPages/DocumentView.aspx?DocId=447.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcoverage contained in its policy with the intention of protecting\n\nits workers from damage caused by uninsured motorists.\n\n          We therefore vacate the district court's entry of summary\n\njudgment and remand for appropriate discovery on the question of\n\nwhether the National Union carve-out applies, namely whether Safety\n\n\"explicitly purchased\" its underinsured motorist coverage \"for the\n\npurpose of providing [UIM] coverage . . . to employees injured in\n\nthe course of their employment.\"      423 Mass. at 350-51.   If the\n\ncourt concludes in the affirmative, the terms of the contract would\n\nrequire that any recovery by Baker under the underinsured motorist\n\nprovision would be reduced by \"[t]he amount paid under a workers'\n\ncompensation law.\"   In other words, an offset would be required.\n\n          Vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.   Costs are taxed in favor of Heidi M. Baker.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

On that day, Heidi M. Baker, the plaintiff-appellant and a resident of Rhode Island, was driving a vehicle owned by her employer, Safety Source Northeast<sup>[1]</sup> (\"Safety\"), as part of her job duties. Baker was seriously injured in the car accident, which was caused by the other driver. Baker filed a third-party claim against the tortfeasor, but the other driver's insurance coverage was insufficient to cover Baker's damages. Baker also filed for and received workers' compensation (\"WC\") benefits through the Rhode Island workers' compensation system. Finally, Baker sought to recover under the Underinsured Motorist (UIM) provision of her employer's automobile insurance policy,<sup>[2]</sup> which was provided by St. Paul Travelers Insurance Company (\"St. Paul\"), the defendant-appellee in this case. St. Paul denied Baker's attempt to recover under the UIM provision, citing Massachusetts law for the proposition that an employee cannot recover for work-related injuries under both workers' compensation and her employer's UIM coverage.</p>\n<p>In response to the denial, Baker filed a complaint in Rhode Island state court seeking a declaratory judgment regarding her eligibility for coverage under St. Paul's UIM coverage.<sup>[3]</sup> St. Paul removed the case to Rhode Island District Court and Baker and St. Paul both moved for summary judgment. A magistrate judge recommended granting St. Paul's motion and denying Baker's, on the grounds that Massachusetts law governed the matter and Massachusetts case law prohibited recovery by an injured employee under both workers' compensation and her employer's UIM coverage. Baker filed a written objection to the report and recommendation, arguing that Rhode Island law should apply, but that even under Massachusetts law the bar on recovery under both workers' compensation and the employer's UIM coverage did not apply where the UIM coverage was a bargained-for provision. Nonetheless, the district court adopted the magistrate's report and recommendation in full, writing additionally only to correct an error in the magistrate's report. <i>See Baker v. Safety Source Northeast,</i> No. 07-314 ML, 2009 WL 211865 (D.R.I. Jan. 28, 2009). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>For the following reasons, we disagree with the conclusion reached by the district court and will remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, we must determine what law governs the question before us. Because this court is sitting in diversity, we apply the choice of law rules of the forum state, here, Rhode Island. <i>See </i><i>Montalvo v. Gonzalez-Amparo,</i> 587 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.2009). Under Rhode Island law, \"[W]hen the insured is a Massachusetts corporation doing business in Massachusetts, and the contract is executed and delivered in Massachusetts, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*393</span> Massachusetts law governs the interpretation of the contract.\" <i>Hartford Cas.

Thus, in this case, Massachusetts law applies.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court concluded that two decisions from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), <i>Berger v. H.P. Hood, Inc.,</i> 416 Mass. 652, 624 N.E.2d 947 (1993), and <i>Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Figaratto,</i> 423 Mass. 346, 667 N.E.2d 877 (1996), squarely foreclosed Baker's claim. We do not agree. <i>Berger</i> and <i>National Union</i> only address whether the exclusivity provision of the Massachusetts workers' compensation statute permits an injured employee to recover under both WC and her employer's UIM coverage. <i>See </i><i>Berger,</i> 416 Mass. at 652, 624 N.E.2d 947 (\"At issue is whether the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, G.L. c. 152, ยง 23 (1992 ed.), bars an employee's claim against the owner and the insurer of the employer's motor vehicles, for underinsurance benefits.\"); <i>Nat'l Union,</i> 423 Mass. at 348, 667 N.E.2d 877 (explaining that the court was bound to follow its recent decision in <i>Berger,</i> which held that \"the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act . . . barred the employee's claim against the employer's insurers.\"). In contrast, in Baker's case, she has recovered workers' compensation benefits under the Rhode Island workers' compensation statute, rather than the Massachusetts statute.

We are persuaded that the SJC's decisions in <i>Berger</i> and <i>National Union</i> were largely governed by the court's policy concerns regarding providing Massachusetts companies with a predictable and reliable scheme concerning the interplay of workers' compensation and underinsured motorist coverage, and holding down insurance costs for Massachusetts companies.<sup>[6]</sup> Because this case concerns <span class=\"star-pagination\">*394</span> a Massachusetts company doing business in Massachusetts, and carrying an auto insurance policy executed and delivered in Massachusetts, we expect these policy concerns would lead the SJC to apply the conclusions of <i>Berger</i> and <i>National Union</i> to this case, even though those cases concerned collection of WC payments under the Massachusetts worker's compensation scheme.</p>\n<p>However, that conclusion does not end our analysis. In <i>National Union,</i> decided three years after <i>Berger,</i> the SJC carved out an exception to the general bar on an employee's recovery under both WC and her employer's UIM coverage. \"[W]e would not extend the bar imposed by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act to make ineffective [UIM] coverage (or any other coverage) that an employer explicitly purchased for the purpose of providing [UIM] coverage (or any other coverage) to employees injured in the course of their employment.\" 423 Mass. at 350-51, 667 N.E.2d 877. Below, the district court granted summary judgment to St. Paul without addressing the carve-out language in <i>National Union,</i> and therefore it did not reach the factual question of whether the underinsurance coverage purchased by Safety was indeed a bargained-for provision intended to provide Safety's employees with additional protection from damages caused by underinsured motorists.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Our review of the contract shows that at the time of the accident Safety carried underinsured motorist coverage in the amount of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident.

Further, we take judicial notice of the Massachusetts Commercial Automobile Insurance Manual for 2002, the year the policy was issued.<sup>[8]</sup> According to the Manual, it appears that in 2002 there was no compulsory underinsured <span class=\"star-pagination\">*395</span> motorist coverage requirement for commercial automobile policies and insurers were only required to <i>offer</i> underinsured motorist coverage at limits up to $35,000 per person/$80,000 per accident.

If the court concludes in the affirmative, the terms of the contract would require that any recovery by Baker under the underinsured motorist provision would be reduced by \"[t]he amount paid under a workers' compensation law.\" In other words, an offset would be required.</p>\n<p><i>Vacated</i> and <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs are taxed in favor of Heidi M. Baker.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Safety Source Northeast is a Massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in Massachusetts. According to Baker, Safety is licensed to do business in Rhode Island and Baker was hired by Safety in Rhode Island and exclusively worked out of Safety's Rhode Island office, in Warwick, Rhode Island.</p>\n<p>[2]  The insurance policy was executed and delivered in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>[3]  Baker also brought suit in state court against her employer, Safety. After removal by Safety to federal court, Baker voluntarily dismissed her claim against Safety.</p>\n<p>[4]  Baker argues that Rhode Island law should apply under the interest-weighing approach adopted in <i>Woodward v. Stewart,</i> 104 R.I. 290, 243 A.2d 917, 923 (1968). Such a conclusion would clearly advantage Baker because Rhode Island law seems to permit an injured employee to recover under both workers' compensation and her employer's UIM coverage, provided the WC payment is reduced by the amount of the UIM recovery (an \"offset\"). Though the parties cite to no definitive Rhode Island case so holding, there are numerous cases that suggest this result. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Poulos v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> 119 R.I. 409, 379 A.2d 362, 365 (1977) (where an injured employee's personal UIM coverage includes an offset provision regarding workers' compensation, such clause is enforceable only to the extent that it prevents a double recovery by the injured employee); <i>Cruz v. Wausau Ins.,</i> 866 A.2d 1237, 1239-40 (2005) (court only decided a procedural matter and raised no objection to injured employee's recovery from both WC and his employer's UIM coverage); <i>Charest v. Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 1996 WL 936921 (R.I.Super. April 23, 1996) (an injured employee who recovered on his employer's UIM coverage and received WC payments was required to offset those two amounts when he sought coverage from a third source, his personal UIM coverage).</p>\n<p>[5]  It is also worth noting that the SJC acknowledged in <i>Berger</i> that state courts have reached a variety of conclusions on this question depending on how they have interpreted the exclusivity provisions of their own workers' compensation statutes. <i>See </i><i>Berger,</i> 416 Mass. at 655 and n. 8, 624 N.E.2d 947.</p>\n<p>[6]  In <i>Berger</i> the court noted that the Massachusetts uninsured motorist provision was intended to \"minimize the possibility of . . . catastrophic financial loss [to] the victims of an automobile accident,\" while in the case of a workplace injury, \"the employee is protected from the risk of catastrophic financial loss through workers' compensation.\" 416 Mass. at 656, 624 N.E.2d 947 (internal citations and quotations omitted). In <i>National Union,</i> the court expanded on this policy concern:\n</p>\n<p>As a matter of fair and equal treatment, a person injured in the course of employment while in a motor vehicle of the employer need not obtain any greater insurance benefits than another person sustaining a similar injury in the course of employment but not in a motor vehicle of the employer. The cost of UM coverage for employers would be substantially higher than otherwise if that coverage in a standard policy applied to employees' on-the-job motor vehicle injuries. That increase would not be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the cost of workers' compensation coverage.</p>\n<p>423 Mass. at 349-50, 667 N.E.2d 877.</p>\n<p>[7]  St. Paul argues that the <i>National Union</i> carve-out only applies to \"non-standard\" policies, which St. Paul appears to define as policies that do not use the standard forms issued by the Massachusetts Insurance Commissioner. The plain language of the <i>National Union</i> carve-out, however, suggests a broader exclusion of any coverage explicitly purchased in order to provide additional protection to the employer's workers. This exception requires a factual determination as to whether the UIM coverage was elected and paid for by the employer in order to protect his employees from the harm of underinsured motorists.</p>\n<p>[8]  The manual is available in PDF form on the public website of the Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts (AIB). <i>See</i> http://www. aib.org/ContentPages/DocumentView.aspx?

Sullivan for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LIPEZ, STAHL and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This case arises out of a car accident on December 17, 2002, in Boston, Massachusetts. On that day, Heidi M. Baker, the plaintiff-appellant and a resident of Rhode Island, was driving a vehicle owned by her employer, Safety Source Northeast<sup>[1]</sup> (\"Safety\"), as part of her job duties. Baker was seriously injured in the car accident, which was caused by the other driver. Baker filed a third-party claim against the tortfeasor, but the other driver's insurance coverage was insufficient to cover Baker's damages. Baker also filed for and received workers' compensation (\"WC\") benefits through the Rhode Island workers' compensation system. Finally, Baker sought to recover under the Underinsured Motorist (UIM) provision of her employer's automobile insurance policy,<sup>[2]</sup> which was provided by St. Paul Travelers Insurance Company (\"St. Paul\"), the defendant-appellee in this case. St. Paul denied Baker's attempt to recover under the UIM provision, citing Massachusetts law for the proposition that an employee cannot recover for work-related injuries under both workers' compensation and her employer's UIM coverage.</p>\n<p>In response to the denial, Baker filed a complaint in Rhode Island state court seeking a declaratory judgment regarding her eligibility for coverage under St. Paul's UIM coverage.<sup>[3]</sup> St. Paul removed the case to Rhode Island District Court and Baker and St. Paul both moved for summary judgment. A magistrate judge recommended granting St. Paul's motion and denying Baker's, on the grounds that Massachusetts law governed the matter and Massachusetts case law prohibited recovery by an injured employee under both workers' compensation and her employer's UIM coverage. Baker filed a written objection to the report and recommendation, arguing that Rhode Island law should apply, but that even under Massachusetts law the bar on recovery under both workers' compensation and the employer's UIM coverage did not apply where the UIM coverage was a bargained-for provision. Nonetheless, the district court adopted the magistrate's report and recommendation in full, writing additionally only to correct an error in the magistrate's report. <i>See Baker v. Safety Source Northeast,</i> No. 07-314 ML, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">211865</span></span> (D.R.I. Jan. 28, 2009). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>For the following reasons, we disagree with the conclusion reached by the district court and will remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>As a preliminary matter, we must determine what law governs the question before us. Because this court is sitting in diversity, we apply the choice of law rules of the forum state, here, Rhode Island. <i>See </i><i>Montalvo v. Gonzalez-Amparo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204064\"><a href=\"/opinion/204064/montalvo-v-gonzalez-amparo/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2009). Under Rhode Island law, \"[W]hen the insured is a Massachusetts corporation doing business in Massachusetts, and the contract is executed and delivered in Massachusetts, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*393</span> Massachusetts law governs the interpretation of the contract.\" <i>Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v.

Thus, in this case, Massachusetts law applies.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The district court concluded that two decisions from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), <i>Berger v. H.P. Hood, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2065194\"><a href=\"/opinion/2065194/berger-v-hp-hood-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2065194\"><a href=\"/opinion/2065194/berger-v-hp-hood-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span> (1993), and <i>Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

We do not agree. <i>Berger</i> and <i>National Union</i> only address whether the exclusivity provision of the Massachusetts workers' compensation statute permits an injured employee to recover under both WC and her employer's UIM coverage. <i>See </i><i>Berger,</i> 416 Mass. at 652, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2065194\"><a href=\"/opinion/2065194/berger-v-hp-hood-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span> (\"At issue is whether the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, G.L. c. 152, ยง 23 (1992 ed.), bars an employee's claim against the owner and the insurer of the employer's motor vehicles, for underinsurance benefits.\"); <i>Nat'l Union,</i> 423 Mass. at 348, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span> (explaining that the court was bound to follow its recent decision in <i>Berger,</i> which held that \"the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act . . . barred the employee's claim against the employer's insurers.\"). In contrast, in Baker's case, she has recovered workers' compensation benefits under the Rhode Island workers' compensation statute, rather than the Massachusetts statute. Therefore, in our view, <i>Berger</i> and <i>National Union</i> are not dispositive.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, because the SJC has not \"spoken directly to the precise question that confronts us,\" we are tasked with predicting \"how that court likely would decide the issue.\" <i>Gonzalez Figueroa v. J.C. Penney Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203865\"><a href=\"/opinion/203865/gonzalez-figueroa-v-jc-penney-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span>, 318 (1st Cir.2009). We are persuaded that the SJC's decisions in <i>Berger</i> and <i>National Union</i> were largely governed by the court's policy concerns regarding providing Massachusetts companies with a predictable and reliable scheme concerning the interplay of workers' compensation and underinsured motorist coverage, and holding down insurance costs for Massachusetts companies.<sup>[6]</sup> Because this case concerns <span class=\"star-pagination\">*394</span> a Massachusetts company doing business in Massachusetts, and carrying an auto insurance policy executed and delivered in Massachusetts, we expect these policy concerns would lead the SJC to apply the conclusions of <i>Berger</i> and <i>National Union</i> to this case, even though those cases concerned collection of WC payments under the Massachusetts worker's compensation scheme.</p>\n<p>However, that conclusion does not end our analysis. In <i>National Union,</i> decided three years after <i>Berger,</i> the SJC carved out an exception to the general bar on an employee's recovery under both WC and her employer's UIM coverage. \"[W]e would not extend the bar imposed by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act to make ineffective [UIM] coverage (or any other coverage) that an employer explicitly purchased for the purpose of providing [UIM] coverage (or any other coverage) to employees injured in the course of their employment.\" 423 Mass. at 350-51, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span>. Below, the district court granted summary judgment to St. Paul without addressing the carve-out language in <i>National Union,</i> and therefore it did not reach the factual question of whether the underinsurance coverage purchased by Safety was indeed a bargained-for provision intended to provide Safety's employees with additional protection from damages caused by underinsured motorists.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Our review of the contract shows that at the time of the accident Safety carried underinsured motorist coverage in the amount of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. The contract also shows that Safety paid a premium of $79.00 in order to receive this coverage during the policy year. Further, we take judicial notice of the Massachusetts Commercial Automobile Insurance Manual for 2002, the year the policy was issued.<sup>[8]</sup> According to the Manual, it appears that in 2002 there was no compulsory underinsured <span class=\"star-pagination\">*395</span> motorist coverage requirement for commercial automobile policies and insurers were only required to <i>offer</i> underinsured motorist coverage at limits up to $35,000 per person/$80,000 per accident. In addition, the Manual set the \"basic limit\" for underinsured motorist coverage at $20,000 per person/$40,000 per accident. The limited facts available to us suggest that perhaps Safety purchased and paid for additional UIM coverage above and beyond what was required by law in force at the time. However, without the benefit of discovery, we are unable to conclusively determine whether Safety indeed bargained for the UIM coverage contained in its policy with the intention of protecting its workers from damage caused by uninsured motorists.</p>\n<p>We therefore vacate the district court's entry of summary judgment and remand for appropriate discovery on the question of whether the <i>National Union</i> carve-out applies, namely whether Safety \"explicitly purchased\" its underinsured motorist coverage \"for the purpose of providing [UIM] coverage . . . to employees injured in the course of their employment.\" 423 Mass. at 350-51, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span>. If the court concludes in the affirmative, the terms of the contract would require that any recovery by Baker under the underinsured motorist provision would be reduced by \"[t]he amount paid under a workers' compensation law.\" In other words, an offset would be required.</p>\n<p><i>Vacated</i> and <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
