Jane Jepkoech Some (“Some”) petitions for review\n\nof a Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) decision finding that\n\nSome is not eligible for asylum and denying Some withholding of\n\nremoval.   We deny the petition.\n\n                   Factual and Procedural Background\n\n     Some is a native and citizen of Kenya who last was admitted to\n\nthe United States on January 17, 2002.     She was not authorized to\n\nstay in the United States beyond July 16, 2002.     In January 2003,\n\nSome applied for asylum.       In March 2003, the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (“INS”) issued Some a Notice to Appear,\n\ncharging her with being removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) on\n\nthe ground that she had remained in the United States for longer\n\nthan the time permitted.    Some conceded removability in April 2003\n\nand requested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture.\n\n     In October 2003, an immigration judge (“IJ”) held a removal\n\nhearing. At that hearing, Some testified that, since 1995, she had\n\nbeen a member of the Eagles Group, a social group of about twenty\n\nwomen who helped each other financially.       Some and most of the\n\nother Eagles Group members lived in Nairobi.     Some testified that\n\nthe Eagles Group provided money, clothes, food, and supplies to a\n\nschool that was being built with the help of the Seventh Day\n\nAdventist Church and local chiefs.       She also testified that, in\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fJanuary 2000, she and a number of other Eagles Group members\n\nvisited a village with the area’s Masai chief to bring some girls\n\nfrom the village to the school.         The Eagles Group thought that\n\ntaking the girls to the school would prevent the girls from being\n\nsubjected to female genital mutilation and young marriages.\n\n     Some also testified that, after Masai villagers took the girls\n\nfrom the school, she and other Eagles Group members went back to\n\nthe village and brought the girls back to the school.         She claimed\n\nthat, around that time, she and almost all the other Eagles Group\n\nmembers started receiving threatening letters.            Most of those\n\nEagles Group members still live in Nairobi, and the school’s\n\nenrollment has increased.       Some does not claim that any of the\n\nEagles Group members have been hurt.\n\n     According   to   Some’s   testimony,   she   continued   to   receive\n\nletters threatening to kill her and her family, to rape her, and to\n\nperform female genital mutilation on her.         In fact, she testified\n\nthat threatening letters still were being delivered to her Nairobi\n\nhome at the time of her hearing before the IJ.        Some did not place\n\nany of these letters into the record or save them.\n\n     Some also testified that, in May 2000, members of the Masai\n\ntribe jumped over the gate of her home and cut at the grates of her\n\nhouse.   She told a friend that they killed her dog when he tried to\n\nbite them.   Some escaped through her back door.       After she called\n\nher husband, he told her to come home and she returned there\n\n                                  -3-\n\fsafely.\n\n     In addition, Some testified that, in January 2001, she and\n\nothers took gifts to the school.     When they were returning from\n\ndelivering the gifts and were twenty miles from the school, some\n\npeople from the Masai and Mungiki tribes threw stones at one of\n\ntheir cars, damaging the windshield.\n\n     The following month, Some briefly traveled to Uganda, but\n\nreturned to Kenya.   In March 2001, Some traveled to the United\n\nStates, where her children were students and returned to her home\n\nin Nairobi in August 2001. According to Some, in October 2001, she\n\nagain brought gifts to the school and people subsequently came to\n\nher home again and left threatening notes.\n\n     Some also testified that, in December 2001, she visited family\n\nin Turbo, which is about 400 kilometers from Nairobi. According to\n\nher testimony, on about December 15, members of the Mungiki and\n\nMasai tribes came with spears and daggers and threatened her and\n\ntried to break into the home where she was staying.   However, these\n\ntribe members fled in their car when they saw other people coming\n\nin response to the cries of Some and her family.       Some and her\n\nfamily remained in Turbo to celebrate Christmas.\n\n     In January 2002, Some traveled to the United States and\n\nvisited her children who were attending school there.     She had a\n\nreturn ticket and testified that her husband expected her to return\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fto Kenya, but that she did not intend to return because she\n\nbelieved her life was in danger and she would be raped and\n\ncircumcised.\n\n     After conducting the hearing and receiving evidence, the IJ\n\nissued an oral decision denying Some’s application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture.   In the course of providing her decision, the IJ noted a\n\nnumber of peculiarities and implausibilities and found that Some’s\n\ntestimony that her involvement in the school led to threats made\n\n“very little sense.”   The IJ also stated that she did\n\n     not believe the respondent’s testimony that she went to\n     her uncle’s home in Turbo and very shortly after arriving\n     there, 15 Masai warriors and Mogiki cult members showed\n     up, threatening to kill her.     This incident bears no\n     contemporaneous relationship to any activity of this\n     respondent with respect to this girl’s school.\n\n\n\n     The IJ concluded that Some’s claims that people not of her\n\ntribe threatened to kidnap, rape, genitally mutilate, and kill her\n\nwas “a phenomenal gross exaggeration” of any threat Some ever might\n\nhave received.   The IJ ultimately found that “the respondent’s\n\nclaim that she had left Kenya because of subjective fears, given\n\nthat she traveled in and out of Kenya after coming here on two\n\nprior occasions, lacks credibility.”     The IJ further concluded\n\nthat, even if Some had subjective fears, those fears were not well\n\nfounded and she therefore failed to establish eligibility for\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fasylum.\n\n     Some appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA.                 The Government\n\ndid not file a brief in opposition to the appeal.1                 In a written\n\norder issued on July 13, 2005, the BIA affirmed the IJ’s decision\n\nand dismissed the appeal.        The BIA first stated that “although the\n\nImmigration Judge did not make an explicit adverse credibility\n\nfinding . . .      it is clear that she found the respondent not\n\ncredible   given   that    she   viewed       the   respondent’s   threat    as   a\n\n‘phenomenal gross exaggeration’ and concluded that her testimony\n\n‘made little sense.’”        The BIA also noted that the IJ concluded\n\n“that the respondent’s motivation for leaving Kenya ‘lack[ed]\n\ncredibility’   given      that   she    traveled     back   to   Kenya   –   while\n\nbelieving that her life was in danger there – on two prior\n\noccasions after visiting the United States.”\n\n     The BIA then held that there was no clear error in the IJ’s\n\nadverse credibility finding.           In reaching this conclusion, the BIA\n\nreasoned that Some had “not shown how her involvement with the pro-\n\nwomen’s Eagles Group and the Seventh-Day Adventist School would\n\ncause her to become a target for violence given that no other\n\nEagles Group member has apparently been harmed and that the school\n\n\n\n     1\n      Some claims that the Attorney General’s failure to file a\nbrief with the BIA bars him from filing a responding brief before\nthis court. There is no basis in law for this argument. If the\nAttorney General were to raise new issues before this court, that\nwould be another matter, but that is not the case here.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fwas endorsed by a Masai village chief and other local residents.”\n\nThe BIA also explained that the school’s enrollment continues to\n\nexpand and that most of the school officials and Eagles Group\n\nmembers still reside in Kenya.     In addition, the BIA emphasized\n\nthat, although Some claimed that she received over ten letters\n\nthreatening her and that she continues to receive such letters, she\n\ndid not produce any of them.      The BIA then cited to the IJ’s\n\ndecision and concluded that, as a result of “these and other\n\nimplausibilities in the record,” the IJ did not clearly err in her\n\nadverse credibility ruling.\n\n     The BIA went on to assess the case based on the assumption\n\nthat Some was credible.   The BIA concluded that Some “failed to\n\npresent any reliable evidence demonstrating either past persecution\n\nor an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of any of the five enumerated grounds in the Act.”    The BIA\n\ntherefore concluded that Some had failed to meet her burden of\n\nproof for asylum and had failed to establish eligibility for\n\nwithholding of removal or for relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture.\n\n               Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n     We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a).     We must\n\nuphold the BIA’s determination that a person is not eligible for\n\nasylum if that decision is supported by reasonable, substantial,\n\nand probative evidence in the record considered as a whole.    INS v.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992); Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333\n\nF.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003).               This deferential standard requires\n\nthe petitioner to show that no reasonable factfinder could fail to\n\nfind the requisite fear of persecution.                Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 18;\n\nsee   also    8     U.S.C.   §   1252(b)(4)(B)(2000)      (“The   administrative\n\nfindings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary.”).\n\n      We     also    review      adverse    credibility    findings   under   the\n\nsubstantial evidence standard. Chen v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 110, 113\n\n(1st Cir. 2005). “If the adverse credibility decision is supported\n\nby substantial evidence – that is, if we cannot say a finding that\n\nthe alien is credible is compelled – then the decision must be\n\naffirmed.”        Id.    When an asylum applicant “produces testimony\n\nshowing a pattern of specific threats giving rise to a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution, the IJ must, if she or she chooses to reject\n\nthat testimony as lacking credibility, offer a ‘specific, cogent\n\nreason for [the IJ’s] disbelief.’”               Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).\n\n                                     Discussion\n\n      The Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien who is\n\notherwise inadmissible or deportable, but only if the alien is a\n\n“refugee.”        8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1).          A refugee is an alien “who is\n\nunable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to\n\navail himself or herself of the protection of, [her home] country\n\n                                           -8-\n\fbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.”     8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\n\nThe burden is on the alien to prove refugee status.    Fesseha, 333\n\nF.3d at 18; 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).\n\n     A rebuttable presumption arises that an alien who has been\n\npersecuted in the past has reason to fear similar persecution in\n\nthe future.    Matter of Chen, 20 I&N Dec. 16, 18 (BIA 1989).\n\nPersecution “requires more than occasional detention, and, indeed,\n\nmore than occasional instances of physical abuse.”    Nelson v. INS,\n\n232 F.3d 258, 265 (1st Cir. 2000).     Thus, even assuming that the\n\nalleged assaults and property damage occurred and were based on an\n\nenumerated ground in connection with the Kenyan government, this\n\nconduct would not be sufficient to compel a conclusion that Some\n\nsuffered past persecution.\n\n     There remain the alleged threats of rape, female genital\n\nmutilation, and death. Although death threats may be sufficient to\n\nfind past persecution, those death threats must be credible. Un v.\n\nGonzales, 415 F.3d 205, 210 (1st Cir. 2005) (remanding for a\n\ndetermination of whether threats rising to the level of persecution\n\nwere made).\n\n     Some argues that credibility should not even be an issue on\n\nappeal because the IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility\n\nfinding.   This argument has no merit.    Although it must be clear\n\n                               -9-\n\ffrom the IJ’s decision that the IJ did, in fact, find the alien not\n\nto be credible, an adverse credibility ruling “does not require the\n\nrecitation of unique or particular words.” de Leon-Barrios v. INS,\n\n116 F.3d 391, 394 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n     In the instant case, the IJ made it quite clear that she found\n\nparts of Some’s testimony not to be credible.        The IJ found, inter\n\nalia, that Some’s description of the threats was a “phenomenal\n\ngross exaggeration.”      She also found that “the respondent’s claim\n\nthat she had left Kenya because of subjective fears, given that she\n\ntraveled in and out of Kenya after coming here on two prior\n\noccasions, lacks credibility.” Thus, it is clear that the IJ found\n\nthat Some’s testimony was not credible with regard to the alleged\n\nthreats.\n\n     We    hold   that   substantial   evidence   supports   the   adverse\n\ncredibility finding.      First, if Some genuinely received credible\n\nthreats of rape, mutilation, and death, it seems unlikely that she\n\nwould return to her home, where she was receiving the threats.\n\nReturning to the country of asserted persecution may undercut an\n\nalien’s credibility concerning the alleged fear of persecution.\n\nSee Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003) (affirming\n\nan adverse credibility finding, in part because the alien twice\n\nreturned to the country of persecution after trips abroad).         After\n\nshe allegedly began receiving threats, Some twice left and returned\n\nto Kenya and even returned to her home in Nairobi where she\n\n                                  -10-\n\freceived the threats.2\n\n       Second, although Some claimed that she continued to receive\n\nthreatening letters even after applying for asylum and she must\n\nhave known that the threats were critical to her chances of success\n\nin   obtaining     asylum,   she   did   not   produce   even   one   of   the\n\nthreatening letters, relying instead on her own testimony and\n\ntestimony from her family.          Corroborating evidence of threats\n\ngenerally is not required to establish an asylum claim if the\n\napplicant’s own testimony is credible.           Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d\n\n34, 45 (1st Cir. 1998).       This is because refugees rarely are in a\n\nposition to offer direct corroboration of specific threats.                Id.\n\nIn a situation where corroborating evidence is available to the\n\nalien, however, the failure to produce that evidence may be used to\n\nsupport an adverse credibility finding. See Albathani, 318 F.3d at\n\n373.       Here, Some claimed that threatening letters still were being\n\ndelivered to her home following her application for asylum, but she\n\ndid not produce the letters themselves, choosing instead to have\n\nher daughter testify and have her husband simply send his own\n\nletter claiming that the threatening letters really did exist.\n\nAlthough the evidence presented may corroborate part of Some’s\n\n\n\n       2\n      Although Some takes issue with the IJ’s factual findings\nregarding exactly which countries Some visited and when, it is\nindisputable that, after allegedly receiving the threats, Some\ntwice left Kenya and then returned to Kenya and to her home there.\nOn one of these trips, she visited the United States, did not\nrequest asylum, and then returned to Nairobi.\n\n                                    -11-\n\ftestimony, it is not the kind of corroboration one would expect.\n\n      Taking into account both Some’s return to her home and her\n\nfailure to produce the letters, we find that substantial evidence\n\nsupports the IJ’s adverse credibility finding.              As a result, we\n\nalso find that there is substantial evidence to support the finding\n\nthat Some did not experience past persecution.\n\n      For similar reasons, we conclude that there is substantial\n\nevidence that, independent of alleged past persecution, Some did\n\nnot have a well-founded fear of persecution.3         In examining whether\n\na   person   has   a   well-founded    fear   of   future   persecution,   we\n\ndetermine whether a reasonable person in the asylum applicant’s\n\nposition would fear persecution on a statutorily protected ground.\n\nKhalil v. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2003).           Some visited\n\nthe school and the Masai village only a handful of times.                  In\n\naddition, although most of the Eagles Group members received\n\nthreats and still live in Kenya, there is no evidence that any of\n\nthem have been harmed as a result of their involvement with the\n\n\n\n      3\n      The standard for withholding of removal is higher than the\nstandard for granting asylum, so a failure to meet the asylum\nstandard of a well-founded fear of persecution necessarily means\nthat the petitioner did not meet the withholding of removal\nstandard of a clear probability of persecution. Aguilar-Solis v.\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 n.3 (1st Cir. 1999). Similarly, Some has\nnot met the Convention Against Torture’s requirement that it is\nmore likely than not that the petitioner will be tortured. See 8\nC.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2). Thus, Some’s failure to establish that she\nis eligible for asylum necessarily means that she is not entitled\nto withholding of removal.\n\n                                      -12-\n\fschool.   Thus,   there   is   insufficient   evidence   to   compel   the\n\nconclusion that a reasonable person in Some’s situation would fear\n\npersecution.\n\n     The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f",

In March 2003, the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (“INS”) issued Some a Notice to Appear,\n\ncharging her with being removable under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) on\n\nthe ground that she had remained in the United States for longer\n\nthan the time permitted.    Some conceded removability in April 2003\n\nand requested asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture.\n\n     In October 2003, an immigration judge (“IJ”) held a removal\n\nhearing. At that hearing, Some testified that, since 1995, she had\n\nbeen a member of the Eagles Group, a social group of about twenty\n\nwomen who helped each other financially.       Some and most of the\n\nother Eagles Group members lived in Nairobi.     Some testified that\n\nthe Eagles Group provided money, clothes, food, and supplies to a\n\nschool that was being built with the help of the Seventh Day\n\nAdventist Church and local chiefs.       She also testified that, in\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fJanuary 2000, she and a number of other Eagles Group members\n\nvisited a village with the area’s Masai chief to bring some girls\n\nfrom the village to the school.         The Eagles Group thought that\n\ntaking the girls to the school would prevent the girls from being\n\nsubjected to female genital mutilation and young marriages.\n\n     Some also testified that, after Masai villagers took the girls\n\nfrom the school, she and other Eagles Group members went back to\n\nthe village and brought the girls back to the school.         She claimed\n\nthat, around that time, she and almost all the other Eagles Group\n\nmembers started receiving threatening letters.            Most of those\n\nEagles Group members still live in Nairobi, and the school’s\n\nenrollment has increased.       Some does not claim that any of the\n\nEagles Group members have been hurt.\n\n     According   to   Some’s   testimony,   she   continued   to   receive\n\nletters threatening to kill her and her family, to rape her, and to\n\nperform female genital mutilation on her.         In fact, she testified\n\nthat threatening letters still were being delivered to her Nairobi\n\nhome at the time of her hearing before the IJ.        Some did not place\n\nany of these letters into the record or save them.\n\n     Some also testified that, in May 2000, members of the Masai\n\ntribe jumped over the gate of her home and cut at the grates of her\n\nhouse.   She told a friend that they killed her dog when he tried to\n\nbite them.   Some escaped through her back door.       After she called\n\nher husband, he told her to come home and she returned there\n\n                                  -3-\n\fsafely.\n\n     In addition, Some testified that, in January 2001, she and\n\nothers took gifts to the school.     When they were returning from\n\ndelivering the gifts and were twenty miles from the school, some\n\npeople from the Masai and Mungiki tribes threw stones at one of\n\ntheir cars, damaging the windshield.\n\n     The following month, Some briefly traveled to Uganda, but\n\nreturned to Kenya.   In March 2001, Some traveled to the United\n\nStates, where her children were students and returned to her home\n\nin Nairobi in August 2001. According to Some, in October 2001, she\n\nagain brought gifts to the school and people subsequently came to\n\nher home again and left threatening notes.\n\n     Some also testified that, in December 2001, she visited family\n\nin Turbo, which is about 400 kilometers from Nairobi. According to\n\nher testimony, on about December 15, members of the Mungiki and\n\nMasai tribes came with spears and daggers and threatened her and\n\ntried to break into the home where she was staying.   However, these\n\ntribe members fled in their car when they saw other people coming\n\nin response to the cries of Some and her family.       Some and her\n\nfamily remained in Turbo to celebrate Christmas.\n\n     In January 2002, Some traveled to the United States and\n\nvisited her children who were attending school there.     She had a\n\nreturn ticket and testified that her husband expected her to return\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fto Kenya, but that she did not intend to return because she\n\nbelieved her life was in danger and she would be raped and\n\ncircumcised.\n\n     After conducting the hearing and receiving evidence, the IJ\n\nissued an oral decision denying Some’s application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture.   In the course of providing her decision, the IJ noted a\n\nnumber of peculiarities and implausibilities and found that Some’s\n\ntestimony that her involvement in the school led to threats made\n\n“very little sense.”   The IJ also stated that she did\n\n     not believe the respondent’s testimony that she went to\n     her uncle’s home in Turbo and very shortly after arriving\n     there, 15 Masai warriors and Mogiki cult members showed\n     up, threatening to kill her.     This incident bears no\n     contemporaneous relationship to any activity of this\n     respondent with respect to this girl’s school.\n\n\n\n     The IJ concluded that Some’s claims that people not of her\n\ntribe threatened to kidnap, rape, genitally mutilate, and kill her\n\nwas “a phenomenal gross exaggeration” of any threat Some ever might\n\nhave received.   The IJ ultimately found that “the respondent’s\n\nclaim that she had left Kenya because of subjective fears, given\n\nthat she traveled in and out of Kenya after coming here on two\n\nprior occasions, lacks credibility.”     The IJ further concluded\n\nthat, even if Some had subjective fears, those fears were not well\n\nfounded and she therefore failed to establish eligibility for\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fasylum.\n\n     Some appealed the IJ’s decision to the BIA.                 The Government\n\ndid not file a brief in opposition to the appeal.1                 In a written\n\norder issued on July 13, 2005, the BIA affirmed the IJ’s decision\n\nand dismissed the appeal.        The BIA first stated that “although the\n\nImmigration Judge did not make an explicit adverse credibility\n\nfinding . . .      it is clear that she found the respondent not\n\ncredible   given   that    she   viewed       the   respondent’s   threat    as   a\n\n‘phenomenal gross exaggeration’ and concluded that her testimony\n\n‘made little sense.’”        The BIA also noted that the IJ concluded\n\n“that the respondent’s motivation for leaving Kenya ‘lack[ed]\n\ncredibility’   given      that   she    traveled     back   to   Kenya   –   while\n\nbelieving that her life was in danger there – on two prior\n\noccasions after visiting the United States.”\n\n     The BIA then held that there was no clear error in the IJ’s\n\nadverse credibility finding.           In reaching this conclusion, the BIA\n\nreasoned that Some had “not shown how her involvement with the pro-\n\nwomen’s Eagles Group and the Seventh-Day Adventist School would\n\ncause her to become a target for violence given that no other\n\nEagles Group member has apparently been harmed and that the school\n\n\n\n     1\n      Some claims that the Attorney General’s failure to file a\nbrief with the BIA bars him from filing a responding brief before\nthis court. There is no basis in law for this argument. If the\nAttorney General were to raise new issues before this court, that\nwould be another matter, but that is not the case here.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fwas endorsed by a Masai village chief and other local residents.”\n\nThe BIA also explained that the school’s enrollment continues to\n\nexpand and that most of the school officials and Eagles Group\n\nmembers still reside in Kenya.     In addition, the BIA emphasized\n\nthat, although Some claimed that she received over ten letters\n\nthreatening her and that she continues to receive such letters, she\n\ndid not produce any of them.      The BIA then cited to the IJ’s\n\ndecision and concluded that, as a result of “these and other\n\nimplausibilities in the record,” the IJ did not clearly err in her\n\nadverse credibility ruling.\n\n     The BIA went on to assess the case based on the assumption\n\nthat Some was credible.   The BIA concluded that Some “failed to\n\npresent any reliable evidence demonstrating either past persecution\n\nor an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of any of the five enumerated grounds in the Act.”    The BIA\n\ntherefore concluded that Some had failed to meet her burden of\n\nproof for asylum and had failed to establish eligibility for\n\nwithholding of removal or for relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture.\n\n               Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n     We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a).     We must\n\nuphold the BIA’s determination that a person is not eligible for\n\nasylum if that decision is supported by reasonable, substantial,\n\nand probative evidence in the record considered as a whole.

A refugee is an alien “who is\n\nunable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to\n\navail himself or herself of the protection of, [her home] country\n\n                                           -8-\n\fbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.”     8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\n\nThe burden is on the alien to prove refugee status.    Fesseha, 333\n\nF.3d at 18; 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).\n\n     A rebuttable presumption arises that an alien who has been\n\npersecuted in the past has reason to fear similar persecution in\n\nthe future.    Matter of Chen, 20 I&N Dec. 16, 18 (BIA 1989).\n\nPersecution “requires more than occasional detention, and, indeed,\n\nmore than occasional instances of physical abuse.”    Nelson v.

Thus, even assuming that the\n\nalleged assaults and property damage occurred and were based on an\n\nenumerated ground in connection with the Kenyan government, this\n\nconduct would not be sufficient to compel a conclusion that Some\n\nsuffered past persecution.\n\n     There remain the alleged threats of rape, female genital\n\nmutilation, and death. Although death threats may be sufficient to\n\nfind past persecution, those death threats must be credible.

This argument has no merit.    Although it must be clear\n\n                               -9-\n\ffrom the IJ’s decision that the IJ did, in fact, find the alien not\n\nto be credible, an adverse credibility ruling “does not require the\n\nrecitation of unique or particular words.” de Leon-Barrios v. INS,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741983\"><a href=\"/opinion/741983/97-cal-daily-op-serv-4551-97-daily-journal-dar-7564-edgar-octaviano/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n     In the instant case, the IJ made it quite clear that she found\n\nparts of Some’s testimony not to be credible.        The IJ found, inter\n\nalia, that Some’s description of the threats was a “phenomenal\n\ngross exaggeration.”      She also found that “the respondent’s claim\n\nthat she had left Kenya because of subjective fears, given that she\n\ntraveled in and out of Kenya after coming here on two prior\n\noccasions, lacks credibility.” Thus, it is clear that the IJ found\n\nthat Some’s testimony was not credible with regard to the alleged\n\nthreats.\n\n     We    hold   that   substantial   evidence   supports   the   adverse\n\ncredibility finding.      First, if Some genuinely received credible\n\nthreats of rape, mutilation, and death, it seems unlikely that she\n\nwould return to her home, where she was receiving the threats.\n\nReturning to the country of asserted persecution may undercut an\n\nalien’s credibility concerning the alleged fear of persecution.\n\nSee Albathani v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200413\"><a href=\"/opinion/200413/albathani-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373 (1st Cir. 2003) (affirming\n\nan adverse credibility finding, in part because the alien twice\n\nreturned to the country of persecution after trips abroad).         After\n\nshe allegedly began receiving threats, Some twice left and returned\n\nto Kenya and even returned to her home in Nairobi where she\n\n                                  -10-\n\freceived the threats.2\n\n       Second, although Some claimed that she continued to receive\n\nthreatening letters even after applying for asylum and she must\n\nhave known that the threats were critical to her chances of success\n\nin   obtaining     asylum,   she   did   not   produce   even   one   of   the\n\nthreatening letters, relying instead on her own testimony and\n\ntestimony from her family.          Corroborating evidence of threats\n\ngenerally is not required to establish an asylum claim if the\n\napplicant’s own testimony is credible.           Gailius v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198026\"><a href=\"/opinion/198026/ins-v-gailius/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (1st Cir. 1998).       This is because refugees rarely are in a\n\nposition to offer direct corroboration of specific threats.                Id.\n\nIn a situation where corroborating evidence is available to the\n\nalien, however, the failure to produce that evidence may be used to\n\nsupport an adverse credibility finding. See Albathani, 318 F.3d at\n\n373.       Here, Some claimed that threatening letters still were being\n\ndelivered to her home following her application for asylum, but she\n\ndid not produce the letters themselves, choosing instead to have\n\nher daughter testify and have her husband simply send his own\n\nletter claiming that the threatening letters really did exist.\n\nAlthough the evidence presented may corroborate part of Some’s\n\n\n\n       2\n      Although Some takes issue with the IJ’s factual findings\nregarding exactly which countries Some visited and when, it is\nindisputable that, after allegedly receiving the threats, Some\ntwice left Kenya and then returned to Kenya and to her home there.\nOn one of these trips, she visited the United States, did not\nrequest asylum, and then returned to Nairobi.\n\n                                    -11-\n\ftestimony, it is not the kind of corroboration one would expect.\n\n      Taking into account both Some’s return to her home and her\n\nfailure to produce the letters, we find that substantial evidence\n\nsupports the IJ’s adverse credibility finding.              As a result, we\n\nalso find that there is substantial evidence to support the finding\n\nthat Some did not experience past persecution.\n\n      For similar reasons, we conclude that there is substantial\n\nevidence that, independent of alleged past persecution, Some did\n\nnot have a well-founded fear of persecution.3         In examining whether\n\na   person   has   a   well-founded    fear   of   future   persecution,   we\n\ndetermine whether a reasonable person in the asylum applicant’s\n\nposition would fear persecution on a statutorily protected ground.\n\nKhalil v.

Some visited\n\nthe school and the Masai village only a handful of times.
