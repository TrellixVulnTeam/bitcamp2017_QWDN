Demissie and Demissie & Associates on brief for\npetitioner.\n     William C. Erb, Jr., Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, Civil Division, United States Department of Justice,\nPeter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and\nAnthony W. Norwood, Senior Litigation Counsel, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                           May 5, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.        On September 7, 2004, this court\n\ndenied on the merits the petition of Dani Lahoud Joumaa, a native\n\nand citizen of Lebanon, for review of a final order of removal by\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), dated September 10, 2003.\n\nSee    Joumaa   v.   Ashcroft,   111    F.    App'x   15   (1st    Cir.   2004)\n\n(unpublished decision).      Joumaa, who had entered the United States\n\non December 4, 2000 as a transit visitor without a visa, had\n\noriginally been ordered removed on February 5, 2002 after an\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) denied his claims for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.                The\n\nIJ found that Joumaa was not credible and had failed to establish\n\neligibility for the types of relief he had requested.\n\n            Joumaa is back again before this court, this time on\n\npetition for review of a July 19, 2005 denial by the BIA of his\n\nbelated motion to reopen his removal proceedings to adjust his\n\nimmigration status.        Joumaa based the motion to reopen on this\n\ncourt's decision in Succar v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2005),\n\nwhich was issued after his initial petition was denied and which\n\ninvalidated one of the regulations that the IJ had invoked in\n\nfinding him to be ineligible for adjustment of status.              See id. at\n\n36 (holding that former 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(c)(8), now 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1245.1(c)(8), which barred paroled aliens in removal proceedings\n\nfrom    applying     for   adjustment    of    status,     was    \"invalid   as\n\ninconsistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a)\").          Joumaa failed to file the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fmotion to reopen within the ninety-day period required by 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i).\n\n          The BIA accordingly denied the motion as untimely.           In\n\ndoing so, it also addressed the Succar claim and found that\n\ndecision inapplicable on two grounds.     First, it noted that the IJ\n\nhad provided an alternative reason why Joumaa could not adjust\n\nstatus: Joumaa arrived in the United States under the transit\n\nwithout a visa procedure, which provided an independent ground for\n\nhis ineligibility to adjust status.            See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(c)\n\n(deeming \"[a]ny alien who entered the United States in transit\n\nwithout a visa\" ineligible to apply for adjustment of status); 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1245.1(b)(1) (same).       Second, the BIA observed that in\n\nthis case, unlike in Succar, the petitioner filed his motion to\n\nreopen long after the BIA had already issued a final administrative\n\norder of removal and this court had already denied his appeal\n\ntherefrom.\n\n          The   parties   dispute    whether    the   normal   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion standard of review for denials of motions to reopen\n\napplies, see Roberts v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"[W]e review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen based on\n\ntimeliness grounds under a highly deferential abuse of discretion\n\nstandard.\"), or whether this case presents a pure issue of law to\n\nbe reviewed de novo.   We see no issue of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f           The petition for review fails on the basis of the first\n\nground stated by the BIA.         The motion to reopen was untimely,\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i).          That statute provides\n\nthat \"[e]xcept as provided in this subparagraph, the motion to\n\nreopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a\n\nfinal administrative order of removal.\"           Id.; see also 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.2(c)(2) (\"[A]n alien may file only one motion to reopen\n\nremoval proceedings . . . and that motion must be filed no later\n\nthan 90 days after the date on which the final administrative\n\ndecision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\").\n\nCongress has created particular exceptions to the ninety-day rule,\n\nnone of which apply here. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), (iv);\n\nsee also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2), (3); id. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iii)(A),\n\n(D); id. § 1003.23(b)(4)(iv).         Congress could have provided an\n\nexception for a claim that is based on a new decision of law issued\n\nafter the ninety-day period has expired. In other contexts it has:\n\nfor example, Congress has provided certain habeas petitioners the\n\nability   to   assert    claims   based   on   subsequent   constitutional\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court that have been made retroactive.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(C) (so providing for prisoners in state\n\ncustody); see also id. § 2255 (similarly providing for prisoners in\n\nfederal custody).       It has chosen not to make any type of exception\n\nthat would be applicable here, and there are obvious reasons for\n\nthat choice.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f           This is not to say that the BIA could not have chosen\n\nhere to reopen, but only that nothing compelled it to do so.\n\nIndeed, the BIA need not have addressed Joumaa's Succar claim at\n\nall.   Although the BIA did do so, whether it is correct or not is\n\nirrelevant.   It gave a reasoned response in denying the motion on\n\nground that it was untimely.\n\n           As a last-ditch effort, Joumaa criticizes the BIA for not\n\nequitably tolling the ninety-day limit.         We need not reach the\n\nissue of whether equitable tolling is even available to excuse a\n\nlate filing in the immigration context.        See Boakai v. Gonzales,\n\nNo. 05-1961, 2006 WL 1101616, at *4 n.2 (1st Cir. April 27, 2006);\n\nChen v. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting\n\nthat this question was left open by Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (en banc), and declining to resolve it).     Joumaa did not\n\nargue equitable tolling to the BIA and therefore failed to exhaust\n\nhis administrative remedies. We lack jurisdiction to entertain the\n\nclaim.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1) (\"A court may review a final\n\norder of removal only if . . . the alien has exhausted all\n\nadministrative     remedies   available   to     the   alien   as   of\n\nright . . . .\"); see also Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 22-23\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",

Joumaa did not argue equitable tolling to the BIA and therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We lack jurisdiction to entertain the claim. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(d)(1) (\"A court may review a final order of removal only if. . . the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right . . . .\"); <i>see also Olujoke v.
