TOM,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                 Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n                  and Barbadoro,* District Judge.\n\n\n           Jonathan F. Mitchell, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Cynthia\nA. Young, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellant.\n           Mark W. Pearlstein, with whom Benjamin A. Goldberger and\nMcDermott Will & Emery LLP, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                         October 1, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f           LYNCH,   Circuit   Judge.       The    government      appeals     as\n\nunreasonably lenient a sentence of thirty-six months' probation\n\n(including six months of community confinement) imposed on a white-\n\ncollar criminal, Michael Tom.        Tom, a securities professional,\n\nillegally made almost $800,000 in insider trading profits and then\n\nobstructed justice by lying under oath to the Securities and\n\nExchange   Commission,    encouraging     another   witness    to    lie,   and\n\ncreating a false document.\n\n           The low end of the Sentencing Guidelines range for Tom,\n\nincluding a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, was\n\nthirty-seven months' imprisonment, and the prosecution agreed to\n\nmake that recommendation as part of a plea agreement.                   After\n\naccepting Tom's guilty plea, the court declined to sentence within\n\nthe Guidelines range or to imprison Tom, and stated three reasons\n\nfor its sentence.        The court primarily rested on a disparity\n\nrationale:   that Shengnan Wang, who as a cooperating co-defendant\n\nreceived a U.S.S.G. ยง 5K1.1 departure, was the insider tipper and\n\ngained $9,761, and had been sentenced by a different judge to\n\ntwelve months' probation (and 500 hours community service).                 The\n\ncourt stated that Tom was less culpable than Wang, and that made\n\nany Guidelines sentence for Tom unjust. The court also articulated\n\na concern that Tom was subject to sanctions by the SEC, and a\n\nprison sentence would over-punish him.           Finally, while the court\n\nhad   concluded   that   family   circumstances     would   not     justify    a\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fdownward departure, the court noted that Tom's family problem -- a\n\ndaughter's illness -- factored into the mix.\n\n          We   agree   with   the    government   that   the   sentence   is\n\nunreasonable and that it did not give adequate consideration to the\n\nseriousness of the offense, the need for general deterrence for\n\nwhite-collar crimes, and the need for some imprisonment.                  We\n\nreverse and remand for resentencing.\n\n                                     I.\n\n          On February 15, 2006, Michael Tom waived indictment and\n\npleaded guilty to five counts of insider trading in violation of 15\n\nU.S.C. ยง 78j(b) and ยง 78ff(a).       The insider trading arose out of a\n\ncall on April 29, 2004 that Tom received from Shengnan Wang, an\n\nemployee of Citizens Bank.      Tom and Wang had worked together at\n\nCitizens during the end of 2003, where he had helped hire and train\n\nher, and they kept in touch when Tom left Citizens to start a hedge\n\nfund, Global Time Capital Management.        In February 2004, Wang and\n\nher husband invested $60,000 in Tom's fund.\n\n          Wang's department performed due diligence on banks which\n\nCitizens sought to acquire.         The day before Wang called Tom, her\n\nsupervisor informed her that other members of her department were\n\ntraveling to conduct due diligence at an acquisition target; while\n\nshe deliberately was not provided the destination, she learned\n\nthrough her own investigations that the due diligence was taking\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fplace in Cleveland, Ohio, and that three banks were based there:\n\nKeyCorp, National City Corporation, and Charter One.\n\n           In Wang's call to Tom the next morning, she told him that\n\nthe Citizens team was analyzing an acquisition target in Cleveland,\n\nOhio.    Ten minutes after the call, Tom sent an e-mail to his\n\nbrother recommending that he purchase securities in the three\n\nbanks.    In   the    next    two-and-a-half    hours,    Tom    made   eighteen\n\npurchases of over $25,000 of stocks and options in each of the\n\nthree likely target banks for the hedge fund, for himself, and for\n\nfamily members whose accounts he controlled. Over the next several\n\ndays, as sales volume in Charter One increased, Tom sold off his\n\nsecurities in the other two banks and acquired a larger position in\n\nCharter One.       By the end of the week, he had made 52 trades,\n\nacquiring 952 Charter One call options and 2,100 shares of Charter\n\nOne common stock.          Neither Wang nor her husband purchased any\n\nsecurities.\n\n           After     the     market   closed   on   May   4,    2004,   Citizens\n\nannounced it was acquiring Charter One.             The next day, Tom sold\n\nvirtually all of his Charter One holdings and realized a gain of\n\n$743,505.37.     Including his brother's gain of $39,089, the total\n\ngain reasonably attributable to Tom was $782,594.37.\n\n           After an article the following week on the Forbes website\n\nmentioned Tom's unusual trading activity, the SEC initiated an\n\ninvestigation.       Tom attempted to obstruct this investigation in\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fnumerous ways.     First, he told Wang's husband to sign a new\n\nbackdated   investment      contract    in   an   attempt    to   mislead   the\n\ngovernment as to any link between Wang and Tom.               This backdated\n\ndocument was provided to the SEC pursuant to a subpoena.              Second,\n\nTom convinced Wang to cover up the real purpose of her phone call,\n\ntelling her to tell the SEC that she had called not to give\n\ninformation about the merger, but to seek his guidance in using one\n\nof Citizens' financial databases.             Lastly, Tom provided false\n\ntestimony under oath to the SEC, giving information that was\n\ndirectly    contrary   to    the   available      evidence    regarding     his\n\ncommunications with Wang.\n\n            Wang and her husband were charged with insider trading\n\nseparately from Tom.     They both pleaded guilty before a different\n\ndistrict court judge.       Because Wang cooperated in the case against\n\nTom, she received a U.S.S.G. ยง 5K1.1 departure for providing\n\nsubstantial assistance to the government. The judge sentenced them\n\nboth to one year of probation.1\n\n            Tom signed a plea agreement with the government in which\n\nboth parties agreed that the proper Guidelines range was thirty-\n\nseven to forty-six months in prison, which included a two-level\n\nincrease for obstruction of justice. He waived his right to appeal\n\nthe sentence or seek any departure, except on two grounds:                  (1)\n\n\n\n     1\n          The record does not indicate the government's recommended\nsentence for Wang and her husband.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fbecause of his extraordinary family circumstances and (2) because\n\nthe loss overstated the seriousness of his offense.\n\n           The   government   took    the   position    that     thirty-seven\n\nmonths' imprisonment, the low end of the Guidelines, was warranted.\n\nTom sought a departure from the Guidelines range on both his\n\nreserved   grounds,     requesting     thirty-six      months'     probation,\n\nincluding twelve months' home detention.        Based on a report from a\n\nholistic   medical    practitioner    who   diagnosed    his     daughter    as\n\nsuffering from heavy metal poisoning, Tom argued that he was her\n\nnecessary caregiver.    He then claimed that the loss was overstated\n\nbecause at a certain point after he began trading Charter One\n\nsecurities, he relied on publicly available information.                     In\n\naddition to the grounds for departure, Tom also argued to the court\n\nthat he had already agreed with the SEC never to work in the\n\ninvestment industry again, and that he still was potentially liable\n\nto the SEC in an outstanding civil action.          Lastly, Tom mentioned\n\nthe need to avoid a sentencing disparity between him and Wang,\n\narguing that as the insider, she was the more culpable of the\n\nwrongdoers.\n\n           The   district     court    appropriately      calculated        the\n\nGuidelines range of thirty-seven to forty-six months in accord with\n\nthe plea agreement and declined to grant Tom's request for a\n\ndeparture under the Guidelines.       The government provided a report\n\nfrom a board-certified toxicologist stating that Tom's daughter\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\flikely did not suffer from metal poisoning, and that the treatment\n\nTom suggested could in fact put her at greater risk.                  The report\n\nwent    on   to   say    that   even   if    the   daughter   did   require    that\n\ntreatment, Tom's participation was unnecessary.                   The court then\n\nconcluded that Tom's presence was not \"essential\" to his daughter,\n\nand that his family circumstances did not rise to the level that\n\nwould result in a departure.           In addition, the court decided that\n\nit was impossible to disentangle Tom's insider trading from his\n\ntrading based on public information.\n\n             In rendering Tom's sentence, however, the court imposed\n\na term of thirty-six months' probation, six of which were to be\n\nserved in a community confinement center.                 The court based the\n\nsentence on three reasons.             First, it said it wanted to avoid\n\nsentencing disparity between Tom and Wang, whom the court viewed as\n\nmore culpable.          While the court recognized that it had no basis\n\nfrom the record to assess the reasons for Wang's sentence, and that\n\nWang had cooperated while Tom had not, it stated that \"it doesn't\n\nseem altogether fitting and proper that the person who is at the\n\ncenter of this criminal conduct should get a year's probation while\n\nMr. Tom faces three years of incarceration.               That disparity alone\n\nsuggests to me that a Guideline[s] sentence is not the appropriate\n\nsentence.\" Second, the court recognized that Tom was still subject\n\nto punishment by the SEC.          Third, the court recognized that while\n\nTom's   \"family     problem\"     did   not    qualify   for   a   departure,    his\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fpresence   at    home   was   \"important   to   the   development   of   his\n\ndaughter.\"      The government appealed the sentence as unreasonably\n\nlenient.\n\n                                    II.\n\n           This court is required on appeal to review sentences for\n\nreasonableness. United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 261 (2005);\n\nUnited States v. Jimรฉnez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 517 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(en banc), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 928 (2007).           The sentence at\n\nissue is substantially below the Guidelines scale of a minimum of\n\nthirty-seven months' imprisonment, and imposes no imprisonment.\n\n\"[T]he farther the judge's sentence departs from the guidelines\n\nsentence the more compelling the justification . . . the judge must\n\noffer.โ    United States v. Thurston (Thurston III), 456 F.3d 211,\n\n215 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2006)).       We look for both \"a plausible explanation and a\n\ndefensible overall result.\" Jimรฉnez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519. This\n\nis not a case of inadequate explanation of the court's reasons for\n\nthe sentence, but of whether the reasons stated do come to a\n\ndefensible overall result.2       The sentence essentially substituted\n\nfor a term of over three years' imprisonment a term of probation.\n\nFurther, the only confinement imposed was community confinement,\n\nand then only for a six-month period.\n\n\n     2\n          We do not address the hypothetical question of whether\nany deviation was unreasonable, but only of whether this sentence\nwas unreasonable.\n\n                                    -8-\n\f          The low sentence was primarily based on a comparison with\n\na co-defendant, and cannot be justified on that basis. Our circuit\n\nlaw firmly holds that the concern with disparity among defendants\n\nis primarily a national concern, and not a concern about defendants\n\nin a particular case or court.     Thurston III, 456 F.3d at 216;\n\nUnited States v. Mueffelman, 470 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Post Booker, there remains a strong interest in national\n\nuniformity among defendants who commit the same crimes and are\n\nsimilarly situated.   We have not held that consideration of co-\n\ndefendant disparity before the same judge is impermissible, but\n\nhave often rejected arguments relying on co-defendant disparity as\n\na basis to give lenient sentences well below the Guidelines range.\n\nSee Thurston III, 456 F.3d at 215 (vacating a sentence that relied\n\non co-defendant disparity); United States v. Navedo-Concepciรณn, 450\n\nF.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2006) (concluding that district court was\n\nreasonable in sentencing a defendant to a longer sentence than co-\n\ndefendants); United States v. Saez, 444 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(same), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 224 (2006); United States v.\n\nGomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 862 (1st Cir. 1990).    We have done so\n\nbecause, inter alia, a focus on co-defendant disparity has a\n\ntendency to thwart the goal of national uniformity.     See, e.g.,\n\nThurston III, 456 F.3d at 215.\n\n          The Sentencing Guidelines and decisions by the Sentencing\n\nCommission, while not exclusive, are the vehicles for \"promoting\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f[national] uniformity and fairness.\"              Jimรฉnez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at\n\n518.   This is in part because the Guidelines (a) represent the only\n\nintegration of the multiple statutory factors set forth in 18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 3553(a); (b) are a reflection of data on past sentencing\n\npractices;      and    (c)      bear   the   imprimatur      of     the   Sentencing\n\nCommission, which is the expert agency charged with developing the\n\nGuidelines.        Id.; see also Rita v. United States, 127 S.Ct. 2456,\n\n2463-65 (2007); United States v. D'Amico, ___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL\n\n2253494, at *8 (1st Cir. Aug. 7, 2007); Smith, 445 F.3d at 4.\n\n              Here, it is true, as the defendant argues, that there is\n\nno statute requiring a mandatory minimum sentence for this crime.\n\nIt would be wrong to conclude, as Tom claims, that congressional\n\nintent is not at issue in substantial deviations because the\n\nGuidelines are not a statute.           In Thurston III, we recognized that\n\nthe Commission, in revising the Guidelines, was responding to\n\ncongressional concern over the leniency of punishments for white-\n\ncollar offenses.          456 F.3d at 218.      We have also recognized that\n\nthe statute, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a), expressly refers to \"the need to\n\navoid unwarranted sentence disparities\" across the nation.                     Smith,\n\n445    F.3d   at    3-4    (quoting    18    U.S.C.   ยง   3553(a)(6))       (internal\n\nquotation mark omitted).            Further, the Supreme Court in Rita has\n\nreaffirmed     that       the   Guidelines    largely     reflect    what    Congress\n\nintended.     See Rita, 127 S. Ct. at 2463-65 (2007) (noting that \"the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fGuidelines, insofar as practicable, reflect . . . sentences that\n\nmight achieve ยง 3553(a)'s objectives\").\n\n            Thus, under circuit law, while consideration of disparity\n\namong sentences imposed by the same judge on similarly situated\n\ndefendants may play some role in the analysis, Mueffelman, 470 F.3d\n\nat   41,   even    that   disparity3    does    not   necessarily   justify   a\n\nsubstantial       deviation   from     the    Guidelines   absent   compelling\n\njustification.        We have also been clear that disparities with\n\nsentences imposed by other judges on co-defendants can play an even\n\nlesser role in the analysis for several reasons.             One is that the\n\nother judge's reasons for the sentence are not fully known.              Saez,\n\n444 F.3d at 19; see also id. (\"But with different judges sentencing\n\ntwo defendants quite differently, there is no more reason to think\n\nthat the first one was right than the second.\").             Another is that\n\nthis would lead \"to endless rummaging by lawyers through sentences\n\nin other cases\" to find specific examples, and create a model of\n\nanalysis which is \"about the weakest sort of proof of national\n\npractice that can be imagined.\"          Id.     The court here erred in the\n\nsignificance it gave to the sentence imposed on a co-defendant by\n\na different judge.\n\n\n\n      3\n          Indeed, the sentence imposed created a disparity contrary\nto and not consistent with \"the need to avoid unwarranted\ndisparities among defendants with similar records who have been\nfound guilty of similar conduct.\"     18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a)(6); see\nalso United States v. Taylor, ___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL 2349415, at *8-\n9 (1st Cir. Aug. 17, 2007).\n\n                                       -11-\n\f           Further, the two defendants were not similarly situated.\n\nThe record does not uphold the court's assessment that Tom was\n\n\"less culpable\" than Wang.       It is true that Wang was the insider\n\nwho initiated the conspiracy.       Yet the record is clear that Tom was\n\nWang's senior and her mentor.        He did not use his influence with\n\nWang to stop the scheme.      To the contrary, he exploited his mentor\n\nrelationship   and     was    actively     involved   in,     had   numerous\n\nconversations with Wang about, and tried to milk maximum illicit\n\nprofit from their scheme.       He made over fifty trades, tipped his\n\nown brother, and reaped together with his brother close to $800,000\n\nin profits.\n\n           While the court did recognize that Wang had cooperated\n\nand Tom had not, it did not give enough weight to this difference\n\nin   circumstances.     \"Although     a    district   court   may   consider\n\ndisparities among co-defendants in determining a sentence, [a\n\ndefendant's] sentence [is not] unreasonable simply because his\n\nco-defendant[] agreed to help the government in exchange for [a]\n\nreduced sentence[].\"        United States v. Vรกzquez-Rivera, 470 F.3d\n\n443, 449 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Saez, 444 F.3d at 18 (justifying\n\nsentence   disparity   by    describing    co-defendant's     cooperation);\n\nUnited States v. Mateo-Espejo, 426 F.3d 508, 514 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"[D]ifferences   between     the   appellant's   belated     and   grudging\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fcooperation   and   [co-defendant's]   prompt   and   full   cooperation\n\nsensibly account for the differing sentences.\").4\n\n          Further, Tom was the dominant figure in the activity\n\namounting to obstruction of justice.       Tom not only gave false\n\ntestimony under oath to the SEC, but he convinced Wang to perjure\n\nherself so that the stories would be consistent.       He then created\n\na false document to replace a damning original document.\n\n          As a separate ground, we also agree with the government\n\nthat this lenient sentence undermined the strong congressional\n\ninterest in deterring others from committing similar crimes.         In\n\nparticular, \"deterrence of white-collar crime [is] of central\n\nconcern to Congress.\"    Mueffelman, 470 F.3d at 40.     In Taylor, we\n\nfound a sentence without imprisonment for a white-collar defendant\n\n\n\n\n     4\n          Other circuits have also taken this view. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v.

All\n\ninvestment advisors who engage in insider trading are subjected to\n\nsuch civil punishment, so \"[t]he guideline sentencing range was\n\n\n\n     5\n          There, we noted that Congress has explained:\n          The placing on probation of [a white-collar criminal] may\n          be perfectly appropriate in cases in which, under all the\n          circumstances, only the rehabilitative needs of the\n          offender are pertinent; such a sentence may be grossly\n          inappropriate,   however,    in   cases  in   which   the\n          circumstances mandate the sentence's carrying substantial\n          deterrent or punitive impact.\nTaylor, 2007 WL 2349415, at *8 (quoting S.

In addition, it is\nnot clear that a heavier sentence will lead to increased overall\npunishment, as the SEC has agreed to hold its civil case in\nabeyance until the conclusion of the criminal matter.     Indeed,\ndefendant's counsel informed the district court that \"the SEC in\nthis matter would like to see what [the court] does, and based on\nwhat [the court] does, do what it deems appropriate anything\nadditional [sic].\"\n     7\n          The pre-sentence report stated that Tom had a net worth\nof more than a million dollars.    The court adopted the report\nwithout change.\n\n                                 -14-\n\flikely predicated on this understanding.\"          Id.; see also Koon v.\n\nUnited   States,   518   U.S.   81,    110-11   (1996).      Because   it   is\n\ncommonplace for a defendant to lose his ability to practice a\n\nprofession (in this case, Tom's ability to be an investment advisor\n\nor be associated with an advisor), that career harm is not a valid\n\nground for departure.      United States v. Hoffer, 129 F.3d 1196,\n\n1203-04 (11th Cir. 1997) (finding loss of medical license an\n\ninvalid basis for departure); cf. Koon, 518 U.S. at 110 (finding an\n\nabuse of discretion when sentencing judge based downward departure\n\non potential for defendants' \"career loss\").              By definition, the\n\nfact that Tom has lost his license does not distinguish him from\n\nothers convicted of insider trading.            See 15 U.S.C. ยง 80b-3(f)\n\n(allowing the SEC to bar those convicted of insider trading from\n\nassociation with investment advisors).\n\n           Further, his argument would lead to problematic class\n\ndistinctions:      white-collar criminals would be able to avoid\n\nimprisonment while non-professionals would be imprisoned because\n\nthe latter have neither a license to lose nor substantial sums of\n\nmoney to pay civil sanctions. Sentences for white-collar criminals\n\nshould have the following effects:           \"deterrence of white-collar\n\ncrime . . . , the minimization of discrepancies between white- and\n\nblue-collar offenses, and limits on the ability of those with money\n\nor earning potential to buy their way out of jail.\"              Mueffelman,\n\n470 F.3d at 40.      See also Thurston III, 456 F.3d at 218.                The\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\frationale here cannot, consistent with the interest in national\n\nuniformity in sentencing, reasonably be the basis for a below-\n\nGuidelines sentence.\n\n              This leaves the district court's third stated reason, the\n\n\"family problem\" rationale for departure.                 The court correctly\n\nrecognized     this    rationale    could    not,    on   its   own,   justify    a\n\ndeparture.      The other two grounds could not justify the sentence\n\ngiven.     Throwing this rationale into the mix does not make an\n\nunreasonable sentence reasonable.\n\n              We believe the government is correct that some term of\n\nimprisonment is required for the sentence to be reasonable on the\n\nfacts    of   this    case.   Such    a   result     is   consistent    with   our\n\nprecedent.      In Taylor, the court found unreasonable a sentence of\n\nprobation and time in a halfway house for a white-collar defendant\n\nwho had also obstructed justice.            2007 WL 2349415, at *1; see also\n\nThurston III, 456 F.3d at 220 (finding, when a district court judge\n\nsentenced a white-collar defendant to three months' imprisonment\n\nalthough the Guidelines recommendation was sixty months, that any\n\nsentence      below    thirty-six    months     of   imprisonment      would     be\n\nunreasonable); United States v. Martin, 455 F.3d 1227, 1240 (11th\n\nCir. 2006) (holding that a seven-day sentence of imprisonment for\n\na white-collar defendant was unreasonable).\n\n              Tom argues his sentence includes confinement: that the\n\nsentence of six months' community confinement is the equivalent of\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fa prison sentence.            We reject the argument.         Most fundamentally,\n\ncommunity confinement for whatever period is not the same as\n\nimprisonment       for     thirty-six    months.        See    United   States    v.\n\nRattoballi,       452    F.3d   127,    135,    137   (2d   Cir.    2006)   (finding\n\nunreasonable       a     sentence    that   substituted       one   year    of   home\n\nconfinement and five years' probation for a Guidelines range\n\nbetween twenty-seven and thirty-three months' imprisonment); United\n\nStates v. Elkins, 176 F.3d 1016, 1020 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"Community\n\nconfinement . . . do[es] not [itself] constitute 'imprisonment.'\").\n\n[Further, even if it were, a six-month sentence is only 16% of a\n\nthirty-six-month sentence.]\n\n            Tom points to U.S.S.G. ยง 5C1.1(e)(2), which establishes\n\na schedule under which one day of community confinement may be\n\nsubstituted for one day of imprisonment for purposes of conforming\n\nwith the Guidelines.             His very argument refutes itself:               this\n\nsubstitution holds true only for Guideline ranges that fall within\n\nZones   B   and    C     of   the   Sentencing    Table.       Tom's    uncontested\n\nGuidelines range was thirty-seven to forty-six months, which falls\n\nsolidly within Zone D, and for which the Guidelines provide no\n\nsubstitute punishment for imprisonment.                U.S.S.G. ยง 5C1.1(f); see\n\nalso United States v.

Even for sentences within Zone B or\n\nZone C, some minimum term of imprisonment must be served under the\n\nGuidelines:     for Zone B sentences, there must be at least one month\n\nof imprisonment, and for Zone C sentences at least one-half of the\n\nminimum term must be served in prison.

Young, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Mark W. Pearlstein, with whom Benjamin A. Goldberger and McDermott Will &amp; Emery LLP, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges, and BARBADORO,<sup>[*]</sup> District Judge.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The government appeals as unreasonably lenient a sentence of thirty-six months' probation (including six months of community confinement) imposed on a white-collar criminal, Michael Tom. Tom, a securities professional, illegally made almost $800,000 in insider trading profits and then obstructed justice by lying under oath to the Securities and Exchange Commission, encouraging another witness to lie, and creating a false document.</p>\n<p>The low end of the Sentencing Guidelines range for Tom, including a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, was thirty-seven months' imprisonment, and the prosecution agreed to make that recommendation as part of a plea agreement. After accepting Tom's guilty plea, the court declined to sentence within the Guidelines range or to imprison Tom, and stated three reasons for its sentence. The court primarily rested on a disparity rationale: that Shengnan Wang, who as a cooperating co-defendant received a U.S.S.G. ยง 5K1.1 departure, was the insider tipper and gained $9,761, and had been sentenced by a different judge to twelve months' probation (and 500 hours community service). The court stated that Tom was less culpable than Wang, and that made any Guidelines sentence for Tom unjust. The court also articulated a concern that Tom was subject to sanctions by the SEC, and a prison sentence would over-punish him. Finally, while the court had concluded that family circumstances would not justify a downward departure, the court noted that Tom's family problem ย a daughter's illness ย factored into the mix.</p>\n<p>We agree with the government that the sentence is unreasonable and that it did not give adequate consideration to the seriousness of the offense, the need for general deterrence for white-collar crimes, and the need for some imprisonment. We reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On February 15, 2006, Michael Tom waived indictment and pleaded guilty to five counts of insider trading in violation of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> 15 U.S.C. ยง 78j(b) and ยง 78ff(a). The insider trading arose out of a call on April 29, 2004 that Tom received from Shengnan Wang, an employee of Citizens Bank. Tom and Wang had worked together at Citizens during the end of 2003, where he had helped hire and train her, and they kept in touch when Tom left Citizens to start a hedge fund, Global Time Capital Management. In February 2004, Wang and her husband invested $60,000 in Tom's fund.</p>\n<p>Wang's department performed due diligence on banks which Citizens sought to acquire. The day before Wang called Tom, her supervisor informed her that other members of her department were traveling to conduct due diligence at an acquisition target; while she deliberately was not provided the destination, she learned through her own investigations that the due diligence was taking place in Cleveland, Ohio, and that three banks were based there: KeyCorp, National City Corporation, and Charter One.</p>\n<p>In Wang's call to Tom the next morning, she told him that the Citizens team was analyzing an acquisition target in Cleveland, Ohio. Ten minutes after the call, Tom sent an e-mail to his brother recommending that he purchase securities in the three banks. In the next two-and-a-half hours, Tom made eighteen purchases of over $25,000 of stocks and options in each of the three likely target banks for the hedge fund, for himself, and for family members whose accounts he controlled. Over the next several days, as sales volume in Charter One increased, Tom sold off his securities in the other two banks and acquired a larger position in Charter One. By the end of the week, he had made 52 trades, acquiring 952 Charter One call options and 2,100 shares of Charter One common stock. Neither Wang nor her husband purchased any securities.</p>\n<p>After the market closed on May 4, 2004, Citizens announced it was acquiring Charter One. The next day, Tom sold virtually all of his Charter One holdings and realized a gain of $743,505.37. Including his brother's gain of $39,089, the total gain reasonably attributable to Tom was $782,594.37.</p>\n<p>After an article the following week on the <i>Forbes</i> website mentioned Tom's unusual trading activity, the SEC initiated an investigation. Tom attempted to obstruct this investigation in numerous ways. First, he told Wang's husband to sign a new backdated investment contract in an attempt to mislead the government as to any link between Wang and Tom. This backdated document was provided to the SEC pursuant to a subpoena. Second, Tom convinced Wang to cover up the real purpose of her phone call, telling her to tell the SEC that she had called not to give information about the merger, but to seek his guidance in using one of Citizens' financial databases. Lastly, Tom provided false testimony under oath to the SEC, giving information that was directly contrary to the available evidence regarding his communications with Wang.</p>\n<p>Wang and her husband were charged with insider trading separately from Tom. They both pleaded guilty before a different district court judge. Because Wang cooperated in the case against Tom, she received a U.S.S.G. ยง 5K1.1 departure for providing substantial assistance to the government. The judge sentenced them both to one year of probation.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Tom signed a plea agreement with the government in which both parties agreed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> that the proper Guidelines range was thirty-seven to forty-six months in prison, which included a two-level increase for obstruction of justice. He waived his right to appeal the sentence or seek any departure, except on two grounds: (1) because of his extraordinary family circumstances and (2) because the loss overstated the seriousness of his offense.</p>\n<p>The government took the position that thirty-seven months' imprisonment, the low end of the Guidelines, was warranted. Tom sought a departure from the Guidelines range on both his reserved grounds, requesting thirty-six months' probation, including twelve months' home detention. Based on a report from a holistic medical practitioner who diagnosed his daughter as suffering from heavy metal poisoning, Tom argued that he was her necessary caregiver. He then claimed that the loss was overstated because at a certain point after he began trading Charter One securities, he relied on publicly available information. In addition to the grounds for departure, Tom also argued to the court that he had already agreed with the SEC never to work in the investment industry again, and that he still was potentially liable to the SEC in an outstanding civil action. Lastly, Tom mentioned the need to avoid a sentencing disparity between him and Wang, arguing that as the insider, she was the more culpable of the wrongdoers.</p>\n<p>The district court appropriately calculated the Guidelines range of thirty-seven to forty-six months in accord with the plea agreement and declined to grant Tom's request for a departure under the Guidelines. The government provided a report from a board-certified toxicologist stating that Tom's daughter likely did not suffer from metal poisoning, and that the treatment Tom suggested could in fact put her at greater risk. The report went on to say that even if the daughter did require that treatment, Tom's participation was unnecessary. The court then concluded that Tom's presence was not \"essential\" to his daughter, and that his family circumstances did not rise to the level that would result in a departure. In addition, the court decided that it was impossible to disentangle Tom's insider trading from his trading based on public information.</p>\n<p>In rendering Tom's sentence, however, the court imposed a term of thirty-six months' probation, six of which were to be served in a community confinement center. The court based the sentence on three reasons. First, it said it wanted to avoid sentencing disparity between Tom and Wang, whom the court viewed as more culpable. While the court recognized that it had no basis from the record to assess the reasons for Wang's sentence, and that Wang had cooperated while Tom had not, it stated that \"it doesn't seem altogether fitting and proper that the person who is at the center of this criminal conduct should get a year's probation while Mr. Tom faces three years of incarceration. That disparity alone suggests to me that a Guideline[s] sentence is not the appropriate sentence.\" Second, the court recognized that Tom was still subject to punishment by the SEC. Third, the court recognized that while Tom's \"family problem\" did not qualify for a departure, his presence at home was \"important to the development of his daughter.\" The government appealed the sentence as unreasonably lenient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>This court is required on appeal to review sentences for reasonableness. <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <i>United States v. Jimรฉnez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 517 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 928, 166 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*94</span> L.Ed.2d 715 (2007). The sentence at issue is substantially below the Guidelines scale of a minimum of thirty-seven months' imprisonment, and imposes no imprisonment. \"[T]he farther the judge's sentence departs from the guidelines sentence the more compelling the justification . . . the judge must offer.\" <i>United States v. Thurston</i> (<i>Thurston III</i>), 456 F.3d 211, 215 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 445 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2006)). We look for both \"a plausible explanation and a defensible overall result.\" <i>Jimรฉnez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519. This is not a case of inadequate explanation of the court's reasons for the sentence, but of whether the reasons stated do come to a defensible overall result.<sup>[2]</sup> The sentence essentially substituted for a term of over three years' imprisonment a term of probation. Further, the only confinement imposed was community confinement, and then only for a six-month period.</p>\n<p>The low sentence was primarily based on a comparison with a co-defendant, and cannot be justified on that basis. Our circuit law firmly holds that the concern with disparity among defendants is primarily a national concern, and not a concern about defendants in a particular case or court. <i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 216; <i>United States v. Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Post <i>Booker,</i> there remains a strong interest in national uniformity among defendants who commit the same crimes and are similarly situated. We have not held that consideration of co-defendant disparity before the same judge is impermissible, but have often rejected arguments relying on co-defendant disparity as a basis to give lenient sentences well below the Guidelines range. <i>See </i><i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 215 (vacating a sentence that relied on co-defendant disparity); <i>United States v. Navedo-Concepciรณn,</i> 450 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2006) (concluding that district court was reasonable in sentencing a defendant to a longer sentence than co-defendants); <i>United States v. Saez,</i> 444 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.2006) (same), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 224, 166 L.Ed.2d 178 (2006); <i>United States v. Gomez-Pabon,</i> 911 F.2d 847, 862 (1st Cir.1990). We have done so because, inter alia, a focus on co-defendant disparity has a tendency to thwart the goal of national uniformity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 215.</p>\n<p>The Sentencing Guidelines and decisions by the Sentencing Commission, while not exclusive, are the vehicles for \"promoting [national] uniformity and fairness.\" <i>Jimรฉnez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518. This is in part because the Guidelines (a) represent the only integration of the multiple statutory factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a); (b) are a reflection of data on past sentencing practices; and (c) bear the imprimatur of the Sentencing Commission, which is the expert agency charged with developing the Guidelines. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Rita v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <i>United States v. D'Amico,</i> 496 F.3d 95, 105-06 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Smith,</i> 445 F.3d at 4.</p>\n<p>Here, it is true, as the defendant argues, that there is no statute requiring a mandatory minimum sentence for this crime. It would be wrong to conclude, as Tom claims, that congressional intent is not at issue in substantial deviations because the Guidelines are not a statute. In <i>Thurston III,</i> we recognized that the Commission, in revising the Guidelines, was responding to congressional concern over the leniency of punishments for white-collar offenses. 456 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> F.3d at 218. We have also recognized that the statute, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a), expressly refers to \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\" across the nation. <i>Smith,</i> 445 F.3d at 3-4 (quoting 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a)(6)) (internal quotation mark omitted). Further, the Supreme Court in <i>Rita</i> has reaffirmed that the Guidelines largely reflect what Congress intended. <i>See </i><i>Rita,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2463-65 (2007) (noting that \"the Guidelines, insofar as practicable, reflect . . . sentences that might achieve ยง 3553(a)'s objectives\").</p>\n<p>Thus, under circuit law, while consideration of disparity among sentences imposed <i>by the same judge</i> on similarly situated defendants may play some role in the analysis, <i>Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d at 41, even that disparity<sup>[3]</sup> does not necessarily justify a substantial deviation from the Guidelines absent compelling justification. We have also been clear that disparities with sentences imposed by other judges on co-defendants can play an even lesser role in the analysis for several reasons. One is that the other judge's reasons for the sentence are not fully known. <i>Saez,</i> 444 F.3d at 19; <i>see also id.</i> (\"But with different judges sentencing two defendants quite differently, there is no more reason to think that the first one was right than the second.\"). Another is that this would lead \"to endless rummaging by lawyers through sentences in other cases\" to find specific examples, and create a model of analysis which is \"about the weakest sort of proof of national practice that can be imagined.\" <i>Id.</i> The court here erred in the significance it gave to the sentence imposed on a co-defendant by a different judge.</p>\n<p>Further, the two defendants were not similarly situated. The record does not uphold the court's assessment that Tom was \"less culpable\" than Wang. It is true that Wang was the insider who initiated the conspiracy. Yet the record is clear that Tom was Wang's senior and her mentor. He did not use his influence with Wang to stop the scheme. To the contrary, he exploited his mentor relationship and was actively involved in, had numerous conversations with Wang about, and tried to milk maximum illicit profit from their scheme. He made over fifty trades, tipped his own brother, and reaped together with his brother close to $800,000 in profits.</p>\n<p>While the court did recognize that Wang had cooperated and Tom had not, it did not give enough weight to this difference in circumstances. \"Although a district court may consider disparities among co-defendants in determining a sentence, [a defendant's] sentence [is not] unreasonable simply because his co-defendant[] agreed to help the government in exchange for [a] reduced sentence[].\" <i>United States v. Vรกzquez-Rivera,</i> 470 F.3d 443, 449 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also </i><i>Saez,</i> 444 F.3d at 18 (justifying sentence disparity by describing co-defendant's cooperation); <i>United States v. Mateo-Espejo,</i> 426 F.3d 508, 514 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[D]ifferences between the appellant's belated and grudging cooperation and [co-defendant's] prompt and full cooperation sensibly account for the differing sentences.\").<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*96</span> Further, Tom was the dominant figure in the activity amounting to obstruction of justice. Tom not only gave false testimony under oath to the SEC, but he convinced Wang to perjure herself so that the stories would be consistent. He then created a false document to replace a damning original document.</p>\n<p>As a separate ground, we also agree with the government that this lenient sentence undermined the strong congressional interest in deterring others from committing similar crimes. In particular, \"deterrence of white-collar crime [is] of central concern to Congress.\" <i>Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d at 40. In <i>Taylor,</i> we found a sentence without imprisonment for a white-collar defendant unreasonable in part because it did not satisfy this interest in deterrence.<sup>[5]</sup> 499 F.3d at 103-04.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the availability of SEC sanctions does not justify this sentence.<sup>[6]</sup> The fact that the SEC may order disgorgement and monetary penalties<sup>[7]</sup> is no substitute for the fact that Congress made this offense a crime, subject to imprisonment. Our case law has already rejected this argument. In <i>Jimรฉnez-Beltre,</i> we found that the presence of other sanctions was not a persuasive ground for a reduced sentence. 440 F.3d at 520. All investment advisors who engage in insider trading are subjected to such civil punishment, so \"[t]he guideline sentencing range was likely predicated on this understanding.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 110-11, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Because it is commonplace for a defendant to lose his ability to practice a profession (in this case, Tom's ability to be an investment advisor or be associated with an advisor), that career harm is not a valid ground for departure. <i>United States v. Hoffer,</i> 129 F.3d 1196, 1203-04 (11th Cir.1997) (finding loss of medical license an invalid basis for departure); <i>cf. </i><i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 110, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (finding an abuse of discretion when sentencing judge based downward departure on potential for defendants' \"career loss\"). By definition, the fact that Tom has lost his license does not distinguish him from others convicted of insider trading. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. ยง 80b-3(f) (allowing the SEC to bar those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> convicted of insider trading from association with investment advisors).</p>\n<p>Further, his argument would lead to problematic class distinctions: white-collar criminals would be able to avoid imprisonment while non-professionals would be imprisoned because the latter have neither a license to lose nor substantial sums of money to pay civil sanctions. Sentences for white-collar criminals should have the following effects: \"deterrence of white-collar crime . . ., the minimization of discrepancies between white- and blue-collar offenses, and limits on the ability of those with money or earning potential to buy their way out of jail.\" <i>Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d at 40. <i>See also </i><i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 218. The rationale here cannot, consistent with the interest in national uniformity in sentencing, reasonably be the basis for a below-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p>This leaves the district court's third stated reason, the \"family problem\" rationale for departure. The court correctly recognized this rationale could not, on its own, justify a departure. The other two grounds could not justify the sentence given. Throwing this rationale into the mix does not make an unreasonable sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p>We believe the government is correct that some term of imprisonment is required for the sentence to be reasonable on the facts of this case. Such a result is consistent with our precedent. In <i>Taylor,</i> the court found unreasonable a sentence of probation and time in a halfway house for a white-collar defendant who had also obstructed justice. 499 F.3d at 95-96; <i>see also </i><i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 220 (finding, when a district court judge sentenced a white-collar defendant to three months' imprisonment although the Guidelines recommendation was sixty months, that any sentence below thirty-six months of imprisonment would be unreasonable); <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 455 F.3d 1227, 1240 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a seven-day sentence of imprisonment for a white-collar defendant was unreasonable).</p>\n<p>Tom argues his sentence includes confinement: that the sentence of six months' community confinement is the equivalent of a prison sentence. We reject the argument. Most fundamentally, community confinement for whatever period is not the same as imprisonment for thirty-six months. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rattoballi,</i> 452 F.3d 127, 135, 137 (2d Cir.2006) (finding unreasonable a sentence that substituted one year of home confinement and five years' probation for a Guidelines range between twenty-seven and thirty-three months' imprisonment); <i>United States v. Elkins,</i> 176 F.3d 1016, 1020 (7th Cir.1999) (\"Community confinement . . . do[es] not [itself] constitute `imprisonment.'\"). [Further, even if it were, a six-month sentence is only 16% of a thirty-six-month sentence.]</p>\n<p>Tom points to U.S.S.G. ยง 5C1.1(e)(2), which establishes a schedule under which one day of community confinement may be substituted for one day of imprisonment for purposes of conforming with the Guidelines. His very argument refutes itself: this substitution holds true only for Guideline ranges that fall within Zones B and C of the Sentencing Table. Tom's uncontested Guidelines range was thirty-seven to forty-six months, which falls solidly within Zone D, and for which the Guidelines provide no substitute punishment for imprisonment. U.S.S.G. ยง 5C1.1(f); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Mercado,</i> 412 F.3d 243, 253 n. 4 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that community confinement cannot substitute for imprisonment for Zone D sentences under the Guidelines); <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 363 F.3d 25, 40 n. 25 (1st Cir.2004) (\"[B]ecause Zone D does not allow for [community confinement], the conversion ratio . . . is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> inapplicable to this case by the terms of the Guidelines themselves.\"). Even for sentences within Zone B or Zone C, some minimum term of imprisonment is recognized under the Guidelines: for Zone B sentences when imprisonment is ordered, there must be at least one month of imprisonment, and for Zone C sentences at least one-half of the minimum term must be served in prison. U.S.S.G. ยง 5C1.1(c), (d); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Cintrรณn-Fernรกndez,</i> 356 F.3d 340, 347-48 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p>Further, we have recognized that community confinement is \"considered as [one of the] `Substitute Punishments' for imprisonment, not [a] merely different form[] of imprisonment itself.\" <i>Cintrรณn-Fernรกndez,</i> 356 F.3d at 347; <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

Tom, a securities professional, illegally made almost $800,000 in insider trading profits and then obstructed justice by lying under oath to the Securities and Exchange Commission, encouraging another witness to lie, and creating a false document.</p>\n<p>The low end of the Sentencing Guidelines range for Tom, including a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, was thirty-seven months' imprisonment, and the prosecution agreed to make that recommendation as part of a plea agreement. After accepting Tom's guilty plea, the court declined to sentence within the Guidelines range or to imprison Tom, and stated three reasons for its sentence. The court primarily rested on a disparity rationale: that Shengnan Wang, who as a cooperating co-defendant received a U.S.S.G. ยง 5K1.1 departure, was the insider tipper and gained $9,761, and had been sentenced by a different judge to twelve months' probation (and 500 hours community service). The court stated that Tom was less culpable than Wang, and that made any Guidelines sentence for Tom unjust. The court also articulated a concern that Tom was subject to sanctions by the SEC, and a prison sentence would over-punish him. Finally, while the court had concluded that family circumstances would not justify a downward departure, the court noted that Tom's family problem ย a daughter's illness ย factored into the mix.</p>\n<p>We agree with the government that the sentence is unreasonable and that it did not give adequate consideration to the seriousness of the offense, the need for general deterrence for white-collar crimes, and the need for some imprisonment. We reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On February 15, 2006, Michael Tom waived indictment and pleaded guilty to five counts of insider trading in violation of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*92</span> 15 U.S.C. ยง 78j(b) and ยง 78ff(a). The insider trading arose out of a call on April 29, 2004 that Tom received from Shengnan Wang, an employee of Citizens Bank. Tom and Wang had worked together at Citizens during the end of 2003, where he had helped hire and train her, and they kept in touch when Tom left Citizens to start a hedge fund, Global Time Capital Management. In February 2004, Wang and her husband invested $60,000 in Tom's fund.</p>\n<p>Wang's department performed due diligence on banks which Citizens sought to acquire. The day before Wang called Tom, her supervisor informed her that other members of her department were traveling to conduct due diligence at an acquisition target; while she deliberately was not provided the destination, she learned through her own investigations that the due diligence was taking place in Cleveland, Ohio, and that three banks were based there: KeyCorp, National City Corporation, and Charter One.</p>\n<p>In Wang's call to Tom the next morning, she told him that the Citizens team was analyzing an acquisition target in Cleveland, Ohio. Ten minutes after the call, Tom sent an e-mail to his brother recommending that he purchase securities in the three banks. In the next two-and-a-half hours, Tom made eighteen purchases of over $25,000 of stocks and options in each of the three likely target banks for the hedge fund, for himself, and for family members whose accounts he controlled. Over the next several days, as sales volume in Charter One increased, Tom sold off his securities in the other two banks and acquired a larger position in Charter One. By the end of the week, he had made 52 trades, acquiring 952 Charter One call options and 2,100 shares of Charter One common stock. Neither Wang nor her husband purchased any securities.</p>\n<p>After the market closed on May 4, 2004, Citizens announced it was acquiring Charter One. The next day, Tom sold virtually all of his Charter One holdings and realized a gain of $743,505.37. Including his brother's gain of $39,089, the total gain reasonably attributable to Tom was $782,594.37.</p>\n<p>After an article the following week on the <i>Forbes</i> website mentioned Tom's unusual trading activity, the SEC initiated an investigation. Tom attempted to obstruct this investigation in numerous ways. First, he told Wang's husband to sign a new backdated investment contract in an attempt to mislead the government as to any link between Wang and Tom. This backdated document was provided to the SEC pursuant to a subpoena. Second, Tom convinced Wang to cover up the real purpose of her phone call, telling her to tell the SEC that she had called not to give information about the merger, but to seek his guidance in using one of Citizens' financial databases. Lastly, Tom provided false testimony under oath to the SEC, giving information that was directly contrary to the available evidence regarding his communications with Wang.</p>\n<p>Wang and her husband were charged with insider trading separately from Tom. They both pleaded guilty before a different district court judge. Because Wang cooperated in the case against Tom, she received a U.S.S.G. ยง 5K1.1 departure for providing substantial assistance to the government. The judge sentenced them both to one year of probation.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Tom signed a plea agreement with the government in which both parties agreed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*93</span> that the proper Guidelines range was thirty-seven to forty-six months in prison, which included a two-level increase for obstruction of justice. He waived his right to appeal the sentence or seek any departure, except on two grounds: (1) because of his extraordinary family circumstances and (2) because the loss overstated the seriousness of his offense.</p>\n<p>The government took the position that thirty-seven months' imprisonment, the low end of the Guidelines, was warranted. Tom sought a departure from the Guidelines range on both his reserved grounds, requesting thirty-six months' probation, including twelve months' home detention. Based on a report from a holistic medical practitioner who diagnosed his daughter as suffering from heavy metal poisoning, Tom argued that he was her necessary caregiver. He then claimed that the loss was overstated because at a certain point after he began trading Charter One securities, he relied on publicly available information. In addition to the grounds for departure, Tom also argued to the court that he had already agreed with the SEC never to work in the investment industry again, and that he still was potentially liable to the SEC in an outstanding civil action. Lastly, Tom mentioned the need to avoid a sentencing disparity between him and Wang, arguing that as the insider, she was the more culpable of the wrongdoers.</p>\n<p>The district court appropriately calculated the Guidelines range of thirty-seven to forty-six months in accord with the plea agreement and declined to grant Tom's request for a departure under the Guidelines. The government provided a report from a board-certified toxicologist stating that Tom's daughter likely did not suffer from metal poisoning, and that the treatment Tom suggested could in fact put her at greater risk. The report went on to say that even if the daughter did require that treatment, Tom's participation was unnecessary. The court then concluded that Tom's presence was not \"essential\" to his daughter, and that his family circumstances did not rise to the level that would result in a departure. In addition, the court decided that it was impossible to disentangle Tom's insider trading from his trading based on public information.</p>\n<p>In rendering Tom's sentence, however, the court imposed a term of thirty-six months' probation, six of which were to be served in a community confinement center. The court based the sentence on three reasons. First, it said it wanted to avoid sentencing disparity between Tom and Wang, whom the court viewed as more culpable. While the court recognized that it had no basis from the record to assess the reasons for Wang's sentence, and that Wang had cooperated while Tom had not, it stated that \"it doesn't seem altogether fitting and proper that the person who is at the center of this criminal conduct should get a year's probation while Mr. Tom faces three years of incarceration. That disparity alone suggests to me that a Guideline[s] sentence is not the appropriate sentence.\" Second, the court recognized that Tom was still subject to punishment by the SEC. Third, the court recognized that while Tom's \"family problem\" did not qualify for a departure, his presence at home was \"important to the development of his daughter.\" The government appealed the sentence as unreasonably lenient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>This court is required on appeal to review sentences for reasonableness. <i>United States v.

We look for both \"a plausible explanation and a defensible overall result.\" <i>Jimรฉnez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 519. This is not a case of inadequate explanation of the court's reasons for the sentence, but of whether the reasons stated do come to a defensible overall result.<sup>[2]</sup> The sentence essentially substituted for a term of over three years' imprisonment a term of probation. Further, the only confinement imposed was community confinement, and then only for a six-month period.</p>\n<p>The low sentence was primarily based on a comparison with a co-defendant, and cannot be justified on that basis. Our circuit law firmly holds that the concern with disparity among defendants is primarily a national concern, and not a concern about defendants in a particular case or court. <i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 216; <i>United States v.

We have not held that consideration of co-defendant disparity before the same judge is impermissible, but have often rejected arguments relying on co-defendant disparity as a basis to give lenient sentences well below the Guidelines range. <i>See </i><i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 215 (vacating a sentence that relied on co-defendant disparity); <i>United States v.

We have done so because, inter alia, a focus on co-defendant disparity has a tendency to thwart the goal of national uniformity. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 215.</p>\n<p>The Sentencing Guidelines and decisions by the Sentencing Commission, while not exclusive, are the vehicles for \"promoting [national] uniformity and fairness.\" <i>Jimรฉnez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518. This is in part because the Guidelines (a) represent the only integration of the multiple statutory factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a); (b) are a reflection of data on past sentencing practices; and (c) bear the imprimatur of the Sentencing Commission, which is the expert agency charged with developing the Guidelines. <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Rita v.

It would be wrong to conclude, as Tom claims, that congressional intent is not at issue in substantial deviations because the Guidelines are not a statute. In <i>Thurston III,</i> we recognized that the Commission, in revising the Guidelines, was responding to congressional concern over the leniency of punishments for white-collar offenses. 456 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> F.3d at 218. We have also recognized that the statute, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a), expressly refers to \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\" across the nation. <i>Smith,</i> 445 F.3d at 3-4 (quoting 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a)(6)) (internal quotation mark omitted). Further, the Supreme Court in <i>Rita</i> has reaffirmed that the Guidelines largely reflect what Congress intended. <i>See </i><i>Rita,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 2463-65 (2007) (noting that \"the Guidelines, insofar as practicable, reflect . . . sentences that might achieve ยง 3553(a)'s objectives\").</p>\n<p>Thus, under circuit law, while consideration of disparity among sentences imposed <i>by the same judge</i> on similarly situated defendants may play some role in the analysis, <i>Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d at 41, even that disparity<sup>[3]</sup> does not necessarily justify a substantial deviation from the Guidelines absent compelling justification. We have also been clear that disparities with sentences imposed by other judges on co-defendants can play an even lesser role in the analysis for several reasons. One is that the other judge's reasons for the sentence are not fully known. <i>Saez,</i> 444 F.3d at 19; <i>see also id.</i> (\"But with different judges sentencing two defendants quite differently, there is no more reason to think that the first one was right than the second.\"). Another is that this would lead \"to endless rummaging by lawyers through sentences in other cases\" to find specific examples, and create a model of analysis which is \"about the weakest sort of proof of national practice that can be imagined.\" <i>Id.</i> The court here erred in the significance it gave to the sentence imposed on a co-defendant by a different judge.</p>\n<p>Further, the two defendants were not similarly situated. The record does not uphold the court's assessment that Tom was \"less culpable\" than Wang. It is true that Wang was the insider who initiated the conspiracy. Yet the record is clear that Tom was Wang's senior and her mentor. He did not use his influence with Wang to stop the scheme. To the contrary, he exploited his mentor relationship and was actively involved in, had numerous conversations with Wang about, and tried to milk maximum illicit profit from their scheme. He made over fifty trades, tipped his own brother, and reaped together with his brother close to $800,000 in profits.</p>\n<p>While the court did recognize that Wang had cooperated and Tom had not, it did not give enough weight to this difference in circumstances. \"Although a district court may consider disparities among co-defendants in determining a sentence, [a defendant's] sentence [is not] unreasonable simply because his co-defendant[] agreed to help the government in exchange for [a] reduced sentence[].\" <i>United States v. Vรกzquez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202547\"><a href=\"/opinion/202547/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 449 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also </i><i>Saez,</i> 444 F.3d at 18 (justifying sentence disparity by describing co-defendant's cooperation); <i>United States v. Mateo-Espejo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201871\"><a href=\"/opinion/201871/united-states-v-mateo-espejo/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span>, 514 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[D]ifferences between the appellant's belated and grudging cooperation and [co-defendant's] prompt and full cooperation sensibly account for the differing sentences.\").<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*96</span> Further, Tom was the dominant figure in the activity amounting to obstruction of justice. Tom not only gave false testimony under oath to the SEC, but he convinced Wang to perjure herself so that the stories would be consistent. He then created a false document to replace a damning original document.</p>\n<p>As a separate ground, we also agree with the government that this lenient sentence undermined the strong congressional interest in deterring others from committing similar crimes. In particular, \"deterrence of white-collar crime [is] of central concern to Congress.\" <i>Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d at 40. In <i>Taylor,</i> we found a sentence without imprisonment for a white-collar defendant unreasonable in part because it did not satisfy this interest in deterrence.<sup>[5]</sup> 499 F.3d at 103-04.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the availability of SEC sanctions does not justify this sentence.<sup>[6]</sup> The fact that the SEC may order disgorgement and monetary penalties<sup>[7]</sup> is no substitute for the fact that Congress made this offense a crime, subject to imprisonment. Our case law has already rejected this argument. In <i>Jimรฉnez-Beltre,</i> we found that the presence of other sanctions was not a persuasive ground for a reduced sentence. 440 F.3d at 520. All investment advisors who engage in insider trading are subjected to such civil punishment, so \"[t]he guideline sentencing range was likely predicated on this understanding.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Koon v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 110-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span> (1996). Because it is commonplace for a defendant to lose his ability to practice a profession (in this case, Tom's ability to be an investment advisor or be associated with an advisor), that career harm is not a valid ground for departure. <i>United States v. Hoffer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72318\"><a href=\"/opinion/72318/united-states-v-hoffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1196</span></a></span>, 1203-04 (11th Cir.1997) (finding loss of medical license an invalid basis for departure); <i>cf. </i><i>Koon,</i> 518 U.S. at 110, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2035</span></a></span> (finding an abuse of discretion when sentencing judge based downward departure on potential for defendants' \"career loss\"). By definition, the fact that Tom has lost his license does not distinguish him from others convicted of insider trading. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. ยง 80b-3(f) (allowing the SEC to bar those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> convicted of insider trading from association with investment advisors).</p>\n<p>Further, his argument would lead to problematic class distinctions: white-collar criminals would be able to avoid imprisonment while non-professionals would be imprisoned because the latter have neither a license to lose nor substantial sums of money to pay civil sanctions. Sentences for white-collar criminals should have the following effects: \"deterrence of white-collar crime . . ., the minimization of discrepancies between white- and blue-collar offenses, and limits on the ability of those with money or earning potential to buy their way out of jail.\" <i>Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d at 40. <i>See also </i><i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 218. The rationale here cannot, consistent with the interest in national uniformity in sentencing, reasonably be the basis for a below-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p>This leaves the district court's third stated reason, the \"family problem\" rationale for departure. The court correctly recognized this rationale could not, on its own, justify a departure. The other two grounds could not justify the sentence given. Throwing this rationale into the mix does not make an unreasonable sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p>We believe the government is correct that some term of imprisonment is required for the sentence to be reasonable on the facts of this case. Such a result is consistent with our precedent. In <i>Taylor,</i> the court found unreasonable a sentence of probation and time in a halfway house for a white-collar defendant who had also obstructed justice. 499 F.3d at 95-96; <i>see also </i><i>Thurston III,</i> 456 F.3d at 220 (finding, when a district court judge sentenced a white-collar defendant to three months' imprisonment although the Guidelines recommendation was sixty months, that any sentence below thirty-six months of imprisonment would be unreasonable); <i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77406\"><a href=\"/opinion/77406/united-states-v-michael-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></a></span>, 1240 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a seven-day sentence of imprisonment for a white-collar defendant was unreasonable).</p>\n<p>Tom argues his sentence includes confinement: that the sentence of six months' community confinement is the equivalent of a prison sentence. We reject the argument. Most fundamentally, community confinement for whatever period is not the same as imprisonment for thirty-six months. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rattoballi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794721\"><a href=\"/opinion/794721/united-states-v-james-rattoballi/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 135, 137 (2d Cir.2006) (finding unreasonable a sentence that substituted one year of home confinement and five years' probation for a Guidelines range between twenty-seven and thirty-three months' imprisonment); <i>United States v.

[Further, even if it were, a six-month sentence is only 16% of a thirty-six-month sentence.]</p>\n<p>Tom points to U.S.S.G. ยง 5C1.1(e)(2), which establishes a schedule under which one day of community confinement may be substituted for one day of imprisonment for purposes of conforming with the Guidelines. His very argument refutes itself: this substitution holds true only for Guideline ranges that fall within Zones B and C of the Sentencing Table. Tom's uncontested Guidelines range was thirty-seven to forty-six months, which falls solidly within Zone D, and for which the Guidelines provide no substitute punishment for imprisonment. U.S.S.G. ยง 5C1.1(f); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

Even for sentences within Zone B or Zone C, some minimum term of imprisonment is recognized under the Guidelines: for Zone B sentences when imprisonment is ordered, there must be at least one month of imprisonment, and for Zone C sentences at least one-half of the minimum term must be served in prison.
