This is the latest chapter in a\n\nseemingly endless bankruptcy litigation. We previously adjudicated\n\nthe underlying dispute, involving rights to a substantial bank\n\naccount standing in the name of the debtor, in favor of the trustee\n\nin bankruptcy.    See Crefisa Inc. v. Washington Mut. Bank, 186 F.3d\n\n46 (1st Cir. 1999).          The appellant attempts an end run around that\n\nruling.   Because our prior adjudication precludes the appellant's\n\nclaim, we affirm the dismissal of its complaint.\n\n                                          I.\n\n                                    Background\n\n          Our     earlier         decision        limns    the   full      historical\n\nrelationship, both procedural and factual, that is needed to put\n\nthis proceeding into perspective.               See id. at 47-49.         Rather than\n\nretrace our steps, we include here only the bare minimum that is\n\nnecessary to frame the issues on appeal.                  We draw our account from\n\nthe brute facts that appear on the face of the complaint, the\n\nsupporting      documentation         referenced          therein,       and   matters\n\nsusceptible to judicial notice.\n\n           On    April       4,   2000,   Banco     Santander       de   Puerto   Rico\n\n(Santander)     filed    a    complaint      in    the    federal    district     court\n\nrequesting the court to order Washington Mutual Bank to turn over\n\nfunds deposited in a certain \"Golden Passbook\" account.                            The\n\ncomplaint alleged that, on November 26, 1986, Caguas Federal\n\nSavings Bank loaned Milton Rua, president of Colonial Mortgage\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fBankers Corp., $500,000; that Rua signed a promissory note (the\n\nNote) in that amount and simultaneously pledged the Golden Passbook\n\naccount to secure payment of the Note; and that Rua used the loan\n\nproceeds to fund the Golden Passbook account.              The complaint then\n\ncited, and incorporated by reference, earlier litigation involving\n\nthese funds, namely, Civil Action No. 87-1874, in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\n\n            In that regard, the complaint alleged that Bowery Savings\n\nBank (predecessor in interest to Washington Mutual) sued Rua,\n\nColonial, and Caguas Federal in the same month that Colonial sought\n\nthe   protection        of   the   bankruptcy     court,     alleging    various\n\ndefalcations      in    connection    with    a   mortgage     loan     servicing\n\nagreement.     The complaint proceeded to cite, and incorporated by\n\nreference, a bankruptcy case (Bankr. No. 87-03026) in which the\n\nbankruptcy court had ordered Caguas Federal to turn over the funds\n\nheld in the Golden Passbook account to the trustee in bankruptcy\n\n(Hans López-Stubbe). Caguas Federal had complied with the turnover\n\norder, delivering a check for $557,720.86 (principal plus accrued\n\ninterest) to the trustee on or about November 1, 1989.\n\n            The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was appointed as\n\nthe receiver of Caguas Federal in August of 1999.             According to the\n\ncomplaint    in   the    instant   case,    the   RTC   thereafter    \"sold   and\n\nassigned to [Santander] the assets that it acquired from Caguas .\n\n. . , which included Rua's loan with its collateral,\" and Santander\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthen sold to Crefisa \"all the assets that it acquired from RTC,\n\nincluding the loan granted to . . . Rua with its collateral.\"\n\nCrefisa proceeded to bring an action to recover the monies on\n\ndeposit in the Golden Passbook account, but lost because, in the\n\nwords of the complaint, \"[i]t was determined that the collateral\n\nwas not transferred with the loan, and that Crefisa did not have\n\nstanding to claim the monies.\"        The complaint alleges that Crefisa\n\nthereupon transferred the loan back to Santander, \"which has the\n\ncollateral, so that Santander may claim the monies.\"\n\n           The defendants, López-Stubbe and Washington Mutual, asked\n\nthe   bankruptcy    court   to    take   judicial   notice   of    the   prior\n\nproceedings involving the Golden Passbook account, see Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 201, and simultaneously moved for dismissal of the complaint\n\non res judicata grounds.         They argued that the earlier proceeding\n\nbrought by Crefisa precluded Santander's current claim.                    The\n\nbankruptcy court agreed and granted the motion. Banco Santander de\n\nP.R. v. López-Stubbe (In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp.), Ch. 7\n\nCase No. B87-03026(ESL), Adv. No. 00-0026, slip op. at 6 (Bankr.\n\nD.P.R. July   10,    2001).       Santander   appealed.      The   Bankruptcy\n\nAppellate Panel rejected the appeal.          Banco Santander de P.R. v.\n\nLópez-Stubbe (In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp.), No. 01-073, slip\n\nop. at 26-27 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. Aug. 16, 2002).                 Santander now\n\nappeals to this court.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f                                 II.\n\n                               Analysis\n\n                                  A.\n\n            Legal Principles Governing Appellate Review\n\n           The jurisprudence of Rule 12(b)(6) is applicable to\n\nmotions to dismiss in bankruptcy cases.       See Fed. R. Bankr. P.\n\n7012(b) (incorporating by reference Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)); see\n\nalso Lawrence Nat'l Bank v. Edmonds, 924 F.2d 176, 180 (10th Cir.\n\n1991); In re Metrobility Optical Sys., Inc., 279 B.R. 37, 40\n\n(Bankr. D.N.H. June 5, 2002).     Thus, we review a dismissal of an\n\naction for failure to state a claim de novo, adhering to the same\n\ncriteria that bound the lower courts. See Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck\n\n& Co., 310 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2002); Garrett v. Tandy Corp., 295\n\nF.3d 94, 97 (1st Cir. 2002).    In that process, we assume the truth\n\nof all well-pleaded facts and indulge all reasonable inferences\n\nthat fit the plaintiff's stated theory of liability.          Rogan v.\n\nMenino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999); Aulson v. Blanchard, 83\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996).     We are not bound, however, to credit\n\n\"bald   assertions,   unsupportable    conclusions,   and   opprobrious\n\nepithets\" woven into the fabric of the complaint.      Chongris v. Bd.\n\nof Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir. 1987) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    We can affirm the allowance of a motion\n\nto dismiss only if the plaintiff's factual averments hold out no\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fhope of recovery on any theory adumbrated in its complaint. Rogan,\n\n175 F.3d at 77.\n\n           These principles require us to consider not only the\n\ncomplaint but also matters fairly incorporated within it and\n\nmatters susceptible to judicial notice.     Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d\n\n14, 21 (1st Cir. 2000); Beddall v. State St. Bank & Trust Co., 137\n\nF.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1998); Lovelace v. Software Spectrum Inc.,\n\n78 F.3d 1015, 1017-18 (5th Cir. 1996).    The first part of this rule\n\nis consistent with the axiom that a writing is the best evidence of\n\nits contents.     See, e.g., Beddall, 137 F.3d at 16-17.       The second\n\npart of this rule is consistent with the hoary tenet that a court\n\n\"may look to matters of public record in deciding a Rule 12(b)(6)\n\nmotion.\" Boateng v. Interamerican Univ., 210 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n           Despite    these   familiar   principles,     the    appellant\n\nchallenges the bankruptcy court's decision to go outside the\n\nmargins of the complaint proper in weighing the res judicata\n\ndefense.   That is an affirmative defense, the appellant says, and\n\nshould be left to proof at summary judgment or at trial.            As a\n\ntheoretical matter, this challenge is baseless.        In an appropriate\n\ncase, an affirmative defense may be adjudicated on a motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to state a claim. See, e.g., Blackstone Realty\n\nLLC v. FDIC, 244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir. 2001); LaChapelle v.\n\nBerkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir. 1998); Kale v.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fCombined Ins. Co., 924 F.2d 1161, 1165 (1st Cir. 1991).           The\n\naffirmative defense of res judicata is no exception.       See, e.g.,\n\nBoateng, 210 F.3d at 60; Kale, 924 F.2d at 1165.       Even without a\n\nmotion, \"a court on notice that it has previously decided an issue\n\nmay dismiss the action sua sponte, consistent with the res judicata\n\npolicy of avoiding judicial waste.\"     Bezanson v. Bayside Enterps.,\n\nInc., 922 F.2d 895, 904 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n           The conclusion that an action can be dismissed on the\n\nbasis of an affirmative defense, such as res judicata, does not end\n\nour inquiry.    Such a dismissal only can occur in an appropriate\n\ncase.   Two conditions must be met.    The first condition is that the\n\nfacts that establish the defense must be definitively ascertainable\n\nfrom the allegations of the complaint, the documents (if any)\n\nincorporated therein, matters of public record, and other matters\n\nof which the court may take judicial notice.     The second condition\n\nis that the facts so gleaned must conclusively establish the\n\naffirmative defense.     See Blackstone Realty, 244 F.3d at 197;\n\nLaChapelle, 142 F.3d at 509.\n\n                                 B.\n\n                       Applying the Principles\n\n           Against this backdrop, we turn to the validity of the\n\naffirmative defense in this case.      The question we must answer is\n\nwhether, applying the rules enumerated above, Santander's claim is\n\nbarred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Federal   law   determines   whether   an   earlier    judgment,\n\nrendered in a federal court, bars the maintenance of a subsequent\n\nfederal court action.     Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am.\n\nBar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 37 (1st Cir. 1998).      Under federal law, \"a\n\nfinal judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or\n\ntheir privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been\n\nraised in that action.\"    Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980).\n\nThus, the elements of a res judicata defense are (1) a final\n\njudgment on the merits in an earlier proceeding, (2) sufficient\n\nidenticality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier\n\nand later suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the\n\nparties in the two actions.   Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp., 27 F.3d\n\n751, 755 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          In this instance, the face of the complaint acknowledges\n\nthe existence of an earlier adversary proceeding.       That proceeding\n\nresulted in a judgment on the merits in favor of the defendants\n\n(appellees here).    See Crefisa, 186 F.3d at 48-49.            This court\n\nultimately affirmed the bankruptcy court's disposition. Id. at 52.\n\nSince that decision constitutes a final judgment for purposes of\n\nres judicata, see Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303, 309 n.4\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (regarding judgment from appellate court as \"final\n\nfor res judicata purposes,\" notwithstanding ongoing proceedings);\n\nR.I. Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank v. Bogosian, 11 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (1st\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fCir. 1993) (similar), the first element of the res judicata defense\n\nis satisfied.\n\n          The identicality of the claims asserted in the two\n\nactions cannot seriously be questioned.    We described the cause of\n\naction proffered in Crefisa in the following terms:\n\n          On October 6, 1991, Crefisa brought an\n          adversary   proceeding    in   the   Colonial\n          bankruptcy case asserting a security interest\n          in the Golden Passbook account; the claim was\n          based on the pledge of the Golden Passbook\n          account that Rua had made to Caguas on\n          November 28, 1986, to secure his promissory\n          note. Since the funds in the Golden Passbook\n          account had been turned over to the trustee\n          pursuant to the bankruptcy court's earlier\n          order, the relief sought by Crefisa was an\n          order from the bankruptcy court requiring the\n          trustee to transfer the proceeds to Crefisa.\n\n186 F.3d at 48.     The substance of the cause of action that\n\nSantander asserts is materially identical.    The only difference is\n\nthe identity of the party seeking relief. Thus, the second element\n\nof the res judicata defense is satisfied.\n\n          We now turn to the third element of the defense.      The\n\ndefendants are the same in both cases.     The plaintiffs, however,\n\nare nominally different.   The question thus reduces to whether the\n\nplaintiffs, though not identical, are sufficiently in privity to\n\nsatisfy this element.   Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 757-58.\n\n          The historical record strongly suggests that this query\n\nshould be answered in the affirmative.    Crefisa and Santander were\n\ntreated as a single entity throughout the earlier litigation, and\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fneither of them disputed that characterization.            See Crefisa, 186\n\nF.3d at 48 (concluding from the record that Crefisa \"is apparently\n\na wholly owned subsidiary of Banco Santander\"); see also In re\n\nColonial Mtge. Bankers Corp., Civ. No. 95-1614, 1998 WL 638341, at\n\n*6-*7   (D.P.R.   Sept.   11,    1998)    (using   the   party   designations\n\n\"Santander/Crefisa,\" \"Crefisa,\" and \"Santander\" interchangeably and\n\npervasively).      We   have    heretofore    considered   such    imbricated\n\ncorporate    relationships      sufficient    to   establish     privity   for\n\npurposes of claim preclusion.            See Aunyx Corp. v. Canon U.S.A.,\n\nInc., 978 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 1992).           Thus, the third element of\n\nthe res judicata defense is satisfied.\n\n            From what we already have written, it appears as if all\n\nthree elements of the res judicata defense are extant here (and\n\ntherefore, that the bankruptcy court appropriately dismissed the\n\ncomplaint under Rule 12(b)(6)).             In an effort to convince us\n\notherwise, Santander makes five counter-arguments.               None of them\n\nneed occupy us for long.\n\n            First, Santander maintains that the Crefisa decision did\n\nnot reach the merits, but, rather, turned on an issue of standing.\n\nAlthough Santander makes this assertion in its complaint, we are\n\nnot bound by it.   After all, this characterization is not a factual\n\nallegation deserving of indulgence under Rule 12(b)(6).                    See\n\nChongris, 811 F.2d at 37.       Instead, it is a legal conclusion — and\n\none that has no basis in the law.          We explain briefly.\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f           In   Crefisa,     we    summarized    the     bankruptcy   court's\n\nrationale, noting that the court applied the substantive law of\n\nPuerto Rico in its disposition of the case.            186 F.3d at 48-49.   We\n\nthen examined the district court's reasons for reversing the\n\nbankruptcy court's holding.        Id. at 49.    Having set the stage, we\n\nproceeded to analyze Puerto Rico law and apply it to the discerned\n\nfacts.    That exercise resulted in a reversal of the district\n\ncourt's ruling and the concomitant reinstatement of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's judgment.       Id. at 52.     At each and every step of this\n\npavane,   the   relevant    judicial   rulings    were    merits-based.      A\n\nconclusory allegation that the rulings implicated standing does not\n\nchange their fundamental character any more than calling a sow's\n\near a silk purse makes a credible fashion statement.                  A party\n\ncannot    misconstrue      legal   precedent     and     then   allege    that\n\nmisconstruction as a \"fact\" in order to deflect the preclusive\n\neffect of a prior adjudication.             Cf. Kale, 924 F.2d at 1168\n\n(\"Whenever a litigant decides to enter the court system to seek\n\njustice, he must play by the rules.\").\n\n           Santander's next challenge also is built upon a porous\n\nfoundation.     It interprets our opinion in Crefisa as turning on\n\nwhich party held the rights to the collateral that had been\n\ntendered to secure the Note.        On that reading, it posits that its\n\nreacquisition of the Note alters the nature of the claim asserted\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fhere (and, therefore, renders the claims asserted in the two\n\nactions different).\n\n            This is little more than wishful thinking.                    Our earlier\n\ndecision    did    not    turn    on    the    passing    of   the     rights    to    the\n\ncollateral from party to party but on the effect of an attempted\n\nassertion of those rights as against third parties.                      Crefisa, 186\n\nF.3d at 51.       Cognizant that the Note had been endorsed by RTC to\n\nSantander and then to Crefisa, we assumed that those endorsements\n\nautomatically transferred the security interest in the collateral.\n\nId. at 51-52.       We nonetheless determined that, under the law of\n\nPuerto Rico, such transfers had no effect against a third party\n\n(such as the trustee in bankruptcy) unless and until certain\n\nformalities had been accomplished.                 Id. at 51.          \"So far as the\n\nrecord   show[ed],       this    ha[d]    never    occurred.\"          Id.     (emphasis\n\nsupplied). We made no distinction between the transfer from RTC to\n\nSantander    and    the    subsequent         transfer    from    Santander      to    its\n\ncorporate relative (Crefisa).             Consequently, the new fact alleged\n\nin Santander's complaint does not meaningfully differentiate its\n\npresent claim from the one previously adjudicated in Crefisa.\n\n            Santander      also    maintains       that    the     \"identicality       of\n\nparties\" element is not satisfied here.                        In this regard, it\n\nasseverates       that    the    bankruptcy       court's        determination        that\n\nSantander    and    Crefisa      were    in    privity     was    no    more    than    an\n\nunsubstantiated ipse dixit.              It says now — although it did not\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fallege in its complaint — that Crefisa is not a subsidiary of Banco\n\nSantander de      Puerto   Rico,    but,    rather,     a    subsidiary       of   that\n\ncompany's parent corporation, Banco Santander de España.                           This\n\nasseveration lacks force.\n\n            As   a   procedural    matter,      Santander     and       Crefisa    were\n\ntreated as peas in a pod throughout the earlier litigation.                        See,\n\ne.g., In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp., supra, 1998 WL 638341, at\n\n*6-*7    (treating    Santander     and    Crefisa      as   one    party     without\n\neliciting any objection).         Inasmuch as that position was taken the\n\nfirst time around, Santander cannot disown Crefisa at this late\n\ndate.    Beddall, 137 F.3d at 23 (\"We generally will not permit\n\nlitigants to assert contradictory positions at different stages of\n\na lawsuit in order to advance their interests.\"); Patriot Cinemas,\n\nInc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(adopting the view that \"[j]udicial estoppel should be employed\n\nwhen a litigant is playing fast and loose with the courts, and when\n\nintentional      self-contradiction        is   being    used      as    a   means   of\n\nobtaining unfair advantage in a forum provided for suitors seeking\n\njustice\") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).1\n\n\n     1\n      In an effort to turn the tables, Santander invokes the\njudicial estoppel doctrine offensively (rather than defensively).\nIn this regard, it argues that the appellees should be estopped\nfrom disputing that standing was the pivotal issue in Crefisa\nbecause, in that case, the same parties filed a \"Motion to Dismiss\nand/or for Summary Judgment based on lack of standing.\"      In re\nColonial Mtge. Bankers Corp., supra, 1998 WL 638341, at *1. This\nargument gains no ground.     As we have explained, Santander's\ncomplaint puts courts on notice of prior proceedings relevant to\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — the\n\ndistinction that Santander tries to draw makes no substantive\n\ndifference   for    purposes   of    this   appeal.     The   district      court\n\nadjudicating the earlier claims specifically observed that the Note\n\n\"was endorsed to the order of Banco Santander P.R. by RTC as\n\nCaguas' receiver and delivered to said bank as a result of the . .\n\n. Agreement between RTC and Santander/Crefisa.\"               In re Colonial\n\nMtge. Bankers      Corp.,   supra,   1998    WL    638341,   at    *6   (emphasis\n\nsupplied).   Thus, we can only conclude that Banco Santander de\n\nPuerto Rico was a party to the specific transaction at issue in our\n\nearlier Crefisa decision.\n\n          In all events, Santander and Crefisa, even on Santander's\n\ncurrent version of the corporate interrelationship, are sister\n\ncorporations under the control of a common parent.                On any view of\n\nthe record, these sister corporations share a common economic\n\ninterest in attempting to satisfy a single debt, represented by the\n\nNote, by establishing a security interest in the Golden Passbook\n\naccount and wresting the funds from the steely grip of the trustee\n\nin   bankruptcy.            Within    this        context,    the       corporate\n\ninterrelationship among the parties gave Crefisa adequate incentive\n\nto litigate this common interest. No more is exigible to establish\n\n\nthe issues therein. We have determined, apart from any arguments\nmade by the appellees, that those proceedings bar Santander's\npresent action. Thus, whether the appellees should be barred from\nasserting the res judicata defense makes no difference in this\nappeal. See Bezanson, 922 F.2d at 904.\n\n                                     -14-\n\fprivity for purposes of the res judicata defense. See Aunyx Corp.,\n\n978 F.2d     at    4,   7   (finding   party   identicality   of   technically\n\nseparate   but     related    corporations     when   they   shared   a   common\n\ninterest); see also Iannochino v. Rodolakis, 242 F.3d 36, 45-46\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (finding privity when one former law partner was\n\nthe \"de facto representative\" of the other anent a common economic\n\ninterest).        Any other result would invite endless varieties of\n\nmanipulation and reward \"tactical maneuvering designed unfairly to\n\nexploit technical nonparty status.\"            Gonzalez, 27 F.3d at 761.\n\n           Fourth, Santander charges that the bankruptcy court erred\n\nin failing to convert the appellees' motion to dismiss into a\n\nmotion for summary judgment.             Had the court done so, Santander\n\nsuggests, it could have introduced the RTC-Santander asset purchase\n\nagreement to support its claim.\n\n           This argument is flawed in at least two respects.                For\n\none thing, matters of public record are fair game in adjudicating\n\nRule 12(b)(6) motions, and a court's reference to such matters does\n\nnot convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.\n\nBoateng, 210 F.3d at 60.               For another thing, any attempt to\n\nintroduce the asset purchase agreement would have been futile.\n\nAfter a party has litigated and lost, the doctrine of res judicata\n\nprecludes any attempt on its part, the second time around, to\n\nsupplement the evidentiary record.             See McCurry, 449 U.S. at 94;\n\nMass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 39.\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f            Finally, Santander — grasping at straws — cites dictum in\n\nCrefisa outlining a theory under which that case's holding might\n\nnot apply to a bankruptcy trustee.            See Crefisa, 186 F.3d at 52.\n\nSantander takes that language as an invitation for it to relitigate\n\nthe result of the earlier case.            No such invitation was extended.\n\n            We specifically noted in the earlier case that Crefisa\n\nfailed to make the argument that we called a possible \"escape\n\nhatch.\"     Id.     Crefisa thus forfeited the right to press that\n\nargument.     See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, and Helpers\n\nUnion v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nBecause res       judicata   bars    not   only   those   theories   that   were\n\nactually litigated in the earlier action but also those theories\n\nthat could have been litigated therein, see McCurry, 449 U.S. at\n\n94; Mass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 39, the invitation to bring this\n\nargument before us in a future case clearly was not intended for\n\nany party in privity with Crefisa.            Santander is such a party.\n\n                                       III.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n            We need go no further.         Motions to dismiss are in order\n\nwhen a plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can\n\nbe granted.       This vehicle may be employed when the complaint, the\n\ndocuments incorporated by reference in it, matters of public\n\nrecord, and other matters susceptible to judicial notice coalesce\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fto show beyond doubt that an action is barred, under the doctrine\n\nof res judicata, by a prior adjudication.\n\n          This is such a case.    The complaint makes it abundantly\n\nclear that Santander, acting through its privy and corporate\n\nrelative, had a full and fair opportunity to litigate its claim.\n\nIt did so and lost.   Having had one bite of the cherry, Santander\n\nis not entitled to another.   As the lower courts properly held, its\n\naction is easy prey for the res judicata defense.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f",

The complaint alleged that, on November 26, 1986, Caguas Federal Savings Bank loaned Milton Rua, president of Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., $500,000; that Rua signed a promissory note (the Note) in that amount and simultaneously pledged the Golden Passbook account to secure payment of the Note; and that Rua used the loan proceeds to fund the Golden Passbook account. The complaint then cited, and incorporated by reference, earlier litigation involving these funds, namely, Civil Action No. 87 1874, in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that regard, the complaint alleged that Bowery Savings Bank (predecessor in interest to Washington Mutual) sued Rua, Colonial, and Caguas Federal in the same month that Colonial sought the protection of the bankruptcy court, alleging various defalcations in connection with a mortgage loan servicing agreement. The complaint proceeded to cite, and incorporated by reference, a bankruptcy case (Bankr.No. 87-03026) in which the bankruptcy court had ordered Caguas Federal to turn over the funds held in the Golden Passbook account to the trustee in bankruptcy (Hans L&#243;pez-Stubbe). Caguas Federal had complied with the turnover order, delivering a check for $557,720.86 (principal plus accrued interest) to the trustee on or about November 1, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was appointed as the receiver of Caguas Federal in August of 1999. According to the complaint in the instant case, the RTC thereafter \"sold and assigned to [Santander] the assets that it acquired from Caguas ..., which included Rua's loan with its collateral,\" and Santander then sold to Crefisa \"all the assets that it acquired from RTC, including the loan granted to ... Rua with its collateral.\" Crefisa proceeded to bring an action to recover the monies on deposit in the Golden Passbook account, but lost because, in the words of the complaint, \"[i]t was determined that the collateral was not transferred with the loan, and that Crefisa did not have standing to claim the monies.\" The complaint alleges that Crefisa thereupon transferred the loan back to Santander, \"which has the collateral, so that Santander may claim the monies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, L&#243;pez-Stubbe and Washington Mutual, asked the bankruptcy court to take judicial notice of the prior proceedings involving the Golden Passbook account, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 201, and simultaneously moved for dismissal of the complaint on res judicata grounds. They argued that the earlier proceeding brought by Crefisa precluded Santander's current claim. The bankruptcy court agreed and granted the motion. <i>Banco Santander de P.R. v. L&#243;pez-Stubbe</i> (<i>In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp.</i>), Ch. 7 Case No. B87-03026(ESL), Adv. No. 00-0026, slip op. at 6 (Bankr.D.P.R. July 10, 2001). Santander appealed.

R. Bankr.P. 7012(b) (incorporating by reference Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)); <i>see also Lawrence Nat'l Bank v. Edmonds,</i> 924 F.2d 176, 180 (10th Cir.1991); <i>In re Metrobility Optical Sys., Inc.,</i> 279 B.R. 37, 40 (Bankr.D.N.H. June 5, 2002). Thus, we review a dismissal of an action for failure to state a claim de novo, adhering to the same criteria that bound the lower courts. <i>See Arruda v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 310 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Garrett v. Tandy Corp.,</i> 295 F.3d 94, 97 (1st Cir.2002). In that process, we assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts and indulge all reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff's stated theory of liability. <i>Rogan v. Menino,</i> 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Aulson v. Blanchard,</i> 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996). We are not bound, however, to credit \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, and opprobrious epithets\" woven into the fabric of the complaint. <i>Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals,</i> 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir.1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We can affirm the allowance of a motion to dismiss only if the plaintiff's factual averments hold out no hope of recovery on any theory adumbrated in its complaint. <i>Rogan,</i> 175 F.3d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles require us to consider not only the complaint but also matters fairly incorporated within it and matters susceptible to judicial notice. <i>Cruz v. Melecio,</i> 204 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Beddall v. State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 137 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Lovelace v. Software Spectrum Inc.,</i> 78 F.3d 1015, 1017-18 (5th Cir.1996). The first part of this rule is consistent with the axiom that a writing is the best evidence of its contents. <i>See, e.g., Beddall,</i> 137 F.3d at 16-17. The second part of this rule is consistent with the hoary tenet that a court \"may look to matters of public record in deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\" <i>Boateng v. InterAmerican Univ.,</i> 210 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these familiar principles, the appellant challenges the bankruptcy court's decision to go outside the margins of the complaint proper in weighing the res judicata defense. That is an affirmative defense, the appellant says, and should be left to proof at summary judgment or at trial. As a theoretical matter, this challenge is baseless. In an appropriate case, an affirmative defense may be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <i>See, e.g., Blackstone Realty LLC v. FDIC,</i> 244 F.3d 193, 197 (1st Cir.2001); <i>LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,</i> 142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Kale v. Combined Ins. Co.,</i> 924 F.2d 1161, 1165 (1st Cir.1991). The affirmative defense of res judicata is no exception. <i>See, e.g., Boateng,</i> 210 F.3d at 60; <i>Kale,</i> 924 F.2d at 1165. Even without a motion, \"a court on notice that it has previously decided an issue may dismiss the action sua sponte, consistent with the res judicata policy of avoiding judicial waste.\" <i>Bezanson v. Bayside Enterps., Inc.,</i> 922 F.2d 895, 904 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conclusion that an action can be dismissed on the basis of an affirmative defense, such as res judicata, does not end our inquiry. Such a dismissal only can occur in an appropriate case. Two conditions must be met. The first condition is that the facts that establish the defense must be definitively ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint, the documents (if any) incorporated therein, matters of public record, and other matters of which the court may take judicial notice. The second condition is that the facts so gleaned must conclusively establish the affirmative defense. <i>See Blackstone Realty,</i> 244 F.3d at 197; <i>LaChapelle,</i> 142 F.3d at 509.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Applying the Principles</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the validity of the affirmative defense in this case. The question we must answer is whether, applying the rules enumerated above, Santander's claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal law determines whether an earlier judgment, rendered in a federal court, bars the maintenance of a subsequent federal court action. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 37 (1st Cir.1998). Under federal law, \"a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.\" <i>Allen v. McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). Thus, the elements of a res judicata defense are (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier proceeding, (2) sufficient identicality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier and later suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the parties in the two actions. <i>Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp.,</i> 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the face of the complaint acknowledges the existence of an earlier adversary proceeding. That proceeding resulted in a judgment on the merits in favor of the defendants (appellees here). <i>See Crefisa,</i> 186 F.3d at 48-49. This court ultimately affirmed the bankruptcy court's disposition. <i>Id.</i> at 52. Since that decision constitutes a final judgment for purposes of res judicata, <i>see Perez v. Volvo Car Corp.,</i> 247 F.3d 303, 309 n. 4 (1st Cir.2001) (regarding judgment from appellate court as \"final for res judicata purposes,\" notwithstanding ongoing proceedings); <i>R.I. Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank v.</i> <i>Bogosian,</i> 11 F.3d 1092, 1095-96 (1st Cir.1993) (similar), the first element of the res judicata defense is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The identicality of the claims asserted in the two actions cannot seriously be questioned. We described the cause of action proffered in <i>Crefisa</i> in the following terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 1991, Crefisa brought an adversary proceeding in the Colonial bankruptcy case asserting a security interest in the Golden Passbook account; the claim was based on the pledge of the Golden Passbook account that Rua had made to Caguas on November 28, 1986, to secure his promissory note. Since the funds in the Golden Passbook account had been turned over to the trustee pursuant to the bankruptcy court's earlier order, the relief sought by Crefisa was an order from the bankruptcy court requiring the trustee to transfer the proceeds to Crefisa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">186 F.3d at 48. The substance of the cause of action that Santander asserts is materially identical. The only difference is the identity of the party seeking relief. Thus, the second element of the res judicata defense is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the third element of the defense. The defendants are the same in both cases. The plaintiffs, however, are nominally different. The question thus reduces to whether the plaintiffs, though not identical, are sufficiently in privity to satisfy this element. <i>Gonzalez,</i> 27 F.3d at 757-58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The historical record strongly suggests that this query should be answered in the affirmative. Crefisa and Santander were treated as a single entity throughout the earlier litigation, and neither of them disputed that characterization. <i>See Crefisa,</i> 186 F.3d at 48 (concluding from the record that Crefisa \"is apparently a wholly owned subsidiary of Banco Santander\"); <i>see also In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp.,</i> Civ. No. 95-1614, 1998 WL 638341, at *6-*7 (D.P.R. Sept.11, 1998) (using the party designations \"Santander/Crefisa,\" \"Crefisa,\" and \"Santander\" interchangeably and pervasively). We have heretofore considered such imbricated corporate relationships sufficient to establish privity for purposes of claim preclusion. <i>See Aunyx Corp. v. Canon U.S.A., Inc.,</i> 978 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir.1992). Thus, the third element of the res judicata defense is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From what we already have written, it appears as if all three elements of the res judicata defense are extant here (and therefore, that the bankruptcy court appropriately dismissed the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6)). In an effort to convince us otherwise, Santander makes five counter-arguments. None of them need occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Santander maintains that the <i>Crefisa</i> decision did not reach the merits, but, rather, turned on an issue of standing. Although Santander makes this assertion in its complaint, we are not bound by it. After all, this characterization is not a factual allegation deserving of indulgence under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>See Chongris,</i> 811 F.2d at 37. Instead, it is a legal conclusion &#8212; and one that has no basis in the law. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Crefisa,</i> we summarized the bankruptcy court's rationale, noting that the court applied the substantive law of Puerto Rico in its disposition of the case. 186 F.3d at 48-49. We then examined the district court's reasons for reversing the bankruptcy court's holding. <i>Id.</i> at 49. Having set the stage, we proceeded to analyze Puerto Rico law and apply it to the discerned facts. That exercise resulted in a reversal of the district court's ruling and the concomitant reinstatement of the bankruptcy court's judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 52. At each and every step of this pavane, the relevant judicial rulings were merits-based. A conclusory allegation that the rulings implicated standing does not change their fundamental character any more than calling a sow's ear a silk purse makes a credible fashion statement. A party cannot misconstrue legal precedent and then allege that misconstruction as a \"fact\" in order to deflect the preclusive effect of a prior adjudication. <i>Cf. Kale,</i> 924 F.2d at 1168 (\"Whenever a litigant decides to enter the court system to seek justice, he must play by the rules.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santander's next challenge also is built upon a porous foundation. It interprets our opinion in <i>Crefisa</i> as turning on which party held the rights to the collateral that had been tendered to secure the Note. On that reading, it posits that its reacquisition of the Note alters the nature of the claim asserted here (and, therefore, renders the claims asserted in the two actions different).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is little more than wishful thinking. Our earlier decision did not turn on the passing of the rights to the collateral from party to party but on the effect of an attempted assertion of those rights as against third parties. <i>Crefisa,</i> 186 F.3d at 51. Cognizant that the Note had been endorsed by RTC to Santander and then to Crefisa, we assumed that those endorsements automatically transferred the security interest in the collateral. <i>Id.</i> at 51-52. We nonetheless determined that, under the law of Puerto Rico, such transfers had no effect against a third party (such as the trustee in bankruptcy) unless and until certain formalities had been accomplished. <i>Id.</i> at 51. \"So far as the record show[ed], this ha[d] <i>never</i> occurred.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). We made no distinction between the transfer from RTC to Santander and the subsequent transfer from Santander to its corporate relative (Crefisa). Consequently, the new fact alleged in Santander's complaint does not meaningfully differentiate its present claim from the one previously adjudicated in <i>Crefisa.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santander also maintains that the \"identicality of parties\" element is not satisfied here. In this regard, it asseverates that the bankruptcy court's determination that Santander and Crefisa were in privity was no more than an unsubstantiated ipse dixit. It says now &#8212; although it did not allege in its complaint &#8212; that Crefisa is not a subsidiary of Banco Santander de Puerto Rico, but, rather, a subsidiary of that company's parent corporation, Banco Santander de Espa&#241;a. This asseveration lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a procedural matter, Santander and Crefisa were treated as peas in a pod throughout the earlier litigation. <i>See, e.g., In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp., supra,</i> 1998 WL 638341, at *6-*7 (treating Santander and Crefisa as one party without eliciting any objection). Inasmuch as that position was taken the first time around, Santander cannot disown Crefisa at this late date. <i>Beddall,</i> 137 F.3d at 23 (\"We generally will not permit litigants to assert contradictory positions at different stages of a lawsuit in order to advance their interests.\"); <i>Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp.,</i> 834 F.2d 208, 212 (1st Cir.1987) (adopting the view that \"[j]udicial estoppel should be employed when a litigant is playing fast and loose with the courts, and when intentional self-contradiction is being used as a means of obtaining unfair advantage in a forum provided for suitors seeking justice\") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; the distinction that Santander tries to draw makes no substantive difference for purposes of this appeal. The district court adjudicating the earlier claims specifically observed that the Note \"was endorsed to the order of Banco <i>Santander P.R.</i> by RTC as Caguas' receiver and delivered to said bank as a result of the ... Agreement between RTC and Santander/Crefisa.\" <i>In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp., supra,</i> 1998 WL 638341, at *6 (emphasis supplied). Thus, we can only conclude that Banco Santander de Puerto Rico was a party to the specific transaction at issue in our earlier <i>Crefisa</i> decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, Santander and Crefisa, even on Santander's current version of the corporate interrelationship, are sister corporations under the control of a common parent. On any view of the record, these sister corporations share a common economic interest in attempting to satisfy a single debt, represented by the Note, by establishing a security interest in the Golden Passbook account and wresting the funds from the steely grip of the trustee in bankruptcy. Within this context, the corporate interrelationship among the parties gave Crefisa adequate incentive to litigate this common interest. No more is exigible to establish privity for purposes of the res judicata defense. <i>See Aunyx Corp.,</i> 978 F.2d at 4, 7 (finding party identicality of technically separate but related corporations when they shared a common interest); <i>see also Iannochino v. Rodolakis,</i> 242 F.3d 36, 45-46 (1st Cir.2001) (finding privity when one former law partner was the \"de facto representative\" of the other anent a common economic interest). Any other result would invite endless varieties of manipulation and reward \"tactical maneuvering designed unfairly to exploit technical nonparty status.\" <i>Gonzalez,</i> 27 F.3d at 761.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, Santander charges that the bankruptcy court erred in failing to convert the appellees' motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Had the court done so, Santander suggests, it could have introduced the RTC Santander asset purchase agreement to support its claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is flawed in at least two respects. For one thing, matters of public record are fair game in adjudicating Rule 12(b)(6) motions, and a court's reference to such matters does not convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. <i>Boateng,</i> 210 F.3d at 60. For another thing, any attempt to introduce the asset purchase agreement would have been futile. After a party has litigated and lost, the doctrine of res judicata precludes any attempt on its part, the second time around, to supplement the evidentiary record. <i>See McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. at 94; <i>Mass. Sch. of Law,</i> 142 F.3d at 39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Santander &#8212; grasping at straws &#8212; cites dictum in <i>Crefisa</i> outlining a theory under which that case's holding might not apply to a bankruptcy trustee. <i>See Crefisa,</i> 186 F.3d at 52. Santander takes that language as an invitation for it to relitigate the result of the earlier case. No such invitation was extended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We specifically noted in the earlier case that Crefisa failed to make the argument that we called a possible \"escape hatch.\" <i>Id.</i> Crefisa thus forfeited the right to press that argument. <i>See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, and Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992). Because res judicata bars not only those theories that were actually litigated in the earlier action but also those theories that could have been litigated therein, <i>see McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. at 94, 101 S.Ct. 411; <i>Mass. Sch. of Law,</i> 142 F.3d at 39, the invitation to bring this argument before us in a future case clearly was not intended for any party in privity with Crefisa. Santander is such a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Motions to dismiss are in order when a plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This vehicle may be employed when the complaint, the documents incorporated by reference in it, matters of public record, and other matters susceptible to judicial notice coalesce to show beyond doubt that an action is barred, under the doctrine of res judicata, by a prior adjudication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case. The complaint makes it abundantly clear that Santander, acting through its privy and corporate relative, had a full and fair opportunity to litigate its claim. It did so and lost. Having had one bite of the cherry, Santander is not entitled to another. As the lower courts properly held, its action is easy prey for the res judicata defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In an effort to turn the tables, Santander invokes the judicial estoppel doctrine offensively (rather than defensively). In this regard, it argues that the appellees should be estopped from disputing that standing was the pivotal issue in<i>Crefisa</i> because, in that case, the same parties filed a \"Motion to Dismiss and/or for Summary Judgment based on lack of standing.\" <i>In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp., supra,</i> 1998 WL 638341, at *1. This argument gains no ground. As we have explained, Santander's complaint puts courts on notice of prior proceedings relevant to the issues therein. We have determined, apart from any arguments made by the appellees, that those proceedings bar Santander's present action. Thus, whether the appellees should be barred from asserting the res judicata defense makes no difference in this appeal. <i>See Bezanson,</i> 922 F.2d at 904.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The complaint alleged that, on November 26, 1986, Caguas Federal Savings Bank loaned Milton Rua, president of Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., $500,000; that Rua signed a promissory note (the Note) in that amount and simultaneously pledged the Golden Passbook account to secure payment of the Note; and that Rua used the loan proceeds to fund the Golden Passbook account. The complaint then cited, and incorporated by reference, earlier litigation involving these funds, namely, Civil Action No. 87 1874, in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that regard, the complaint alleged that Bowery Savings Bank (predecessor in interest to Washington Mutual) sued Rua, Colonial, and Caguas Federal in the same month that Colonial sought the protection of the bankruptcy court, alleging various defalcations in connection with a mortgage loan servicing agreement. The complaint proceeded to cite, and incorporated by reference, a bankruptcy case (Bankr.No. 87-03026) in which the bankruptcy court had ordered Caguas Federal to turn over the funds held in the Golden Passbook account to the trustee in bankruptcy (Hans L&#243;pez-Stubbe). Caguas Federal had complied with the turnover order, delivering a check for $557,720.86 (principal plus accrued interest) to the trustee on or about November 1, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) was appointed as the receiver of Caguas Federal in August of 1999. According to the complaint in the instant case, the RTC thereafter \"sold and assigned to [Santander] the assets that it acquired from Caguas ..., which included Rua's loan with its collateral,\" and Santander then sold to Crefisa \"all the assets that it acquired from RTC, including the loan granted to ... Rua with its collateral.\" Crefisa proceeded to bring an action to recover the monies on deposit in the Golden Passbook account, but lost because, in the words of the complaint, \"[i]t was determined that the collateral was not transferred with the loan, and that Crefisa did not have standing to claim the monies.\" The complaint alleges that Crefisa thereupon transferred the loan back to Santander, \"which has the collateral, so that Santander may claim the monies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, L&#243;pez-Stubbe and Washington Mutual, asked the bankruptcy court to take judicial notice of the prior proceedings involving the Golden Passbook account, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 201, and simultaneously moved for dismissal of the complaint on res judicata grounds. They argued that the earlier proceeding brought by Crefisa precluded Santander's current claim. The bankruptcy court agreed and granted the motion. <i>Banco Santander de P.R. v.

Such a dismissal only can occur in an appropriate case. Two conditions must be met. The first condition is that the facts that establish the defense must be definitively ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint, the documents (if any) incorporated therein, matters of public record, and other matters of which the court may take judicial notice. The second condition is that the facts so gleaned must conclusively establish the affirmative defense. <i>See Blackstone Realty,</i> 244 F.3d at 197; <i>LaChapelle,</i> 142 F.3d at 509.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Applying the Principles</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the validity of the affirmative defense in this case.

Thus, the elements of a res judicata defense are (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier proceeding, (2) sufficient identicality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier and later suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the parties in the two actions. <i>Gonzalez v.

That proceeding resulted in a judgment on the merits in favor of the defendants (appellees here). <i>See Crefisa,</i> 186 F.3d at 48-49. This court ultimately affirmed the bankruptcy court's disposition. <i>Id.</i> at 52. Since that decision constitutes a final judgment for purposes of res judicata, <i>see Perez v.

We described the cause of action proffered in <i>Crefisa</i> in the following terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 1991, Crefisa brought an adversary proceeding in the Colonial bankruptcy case asserting a security interest in the Golden Passbook account; the claim was based on the pledge of the Golden Passbook account that Rua had made to Caguas on November 28, 1986, to secure his promissory note. Since the funds in the Golden Passbook account had been turned over to the trustee pursuant to the bankruptcy court's earlier order, the relief sought by Crefisa was an order from the bankruptcy court requiring the trustee to transfer the proceeds to Crefisa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">186 F.3d at 48. The substance of the cause of action that Santander asserts is materially identical. The only difference is the identity of the party seeking relief. Thus, the second element of the res judicata defense is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the third element of the defense. The defendants are the same in both cases. The plaintiffs, however, are nominally different. The question thus reduces to whether the plaintiffs, though not identical, are sufficiently in privity to satisfy this element. <i>Gonzalez,</i> 27 F.3d at 757-58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The historical record strongly suggests that this query should be answered in the affirmative. Crefisa and Santander were treated as a single entity throughout the earlier litigation, and neither of them disputed that characterization. <i>See Crefisa,</i> 186 F.3d at 48 (concluding from the record that Crefisa \"is apparently a wholly owned subsidiary of Banco Santander\"); <i>see also In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp.,</i> Civ. No. 95-1614, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">638341</span></span>, at *6-*7 (D.P.R. Sept.11, 1998) (using the party designations \"Santander/Crefisa,\" \"Crefisa,\" and \"Santander\" interchangeably and pervasively). We have heretofore considered such imbricated corporate relationships sufficient to establish privity for purposes of claim preclusion. <i>See Aunyx Corp. v. Canon U.S.A., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593290\"><a href=\"/opinion/593290/aunyx-corporation-v-canon-usa-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1992). Thus, the third element of the res judicata defense is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From what we already have written, it appears as if all three elements of the res judicata defense are extant here (and therefore, that the bankruptcy court appropriately dismissed the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6)). In an effort to convince us otherwise, Santander makes five counter-arguments. None of them need occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Santander maintains that the <i>Crefisa</i> decision did not reach the merits, but, rather, turned on an issue of standing. Although Santander makes this assertion in its complaint, we are not bound by it. After all, this characterization is not a factual allegation deserving of indulgence under Rule 12(b)(6). <i>See Chongris,</i> 811 F.2d at 37. Instead, it is a legal conclusion &#8212; and one that has no basis in the law. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Crefisa,</i> we summarized the bankruptcy court's rationale, noting that the court applied the substantive law of Puerto Rico in its disposition of the case. 186 F.3d at 48-49. We then examined the district court's reasons for reversing the bankruptcy court's holding. <i>Id.</i> at 49. Having set the stage, we proceeded to analyze Puerto Rico law and apply it to the discerned facts. That exercise resulted in a reversal of the district court's ruling and the concomitant reinstatement of the bankruptcy court's judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 52. At each and every step of this pavane, the relevant judicial rulings were merits-based. A conclusory allegation that the rulings implicated standing does not change their fundamental character any more than calling a sow's ear a silk purse makes a credible fashion statement. A party cannot misconstrue legal precedent and then allege that misconstruction as a \"fact\" in order to deflect the preclusive effect of a prior adjudication. <i>Cf. Kale,</i> 924 F.2d at 1168 (\"Whenever a litigant decides to enter the court system to seek justice, he must play by the rules.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santander's next challenge also is built upon a porous foundation. It interprets our opinion in <i>Crefisa</i> as turning on which party held the rights to the collateral that had been tendered to secure the Note. On that reading, it posits that its reacquisition of the Note alters the nature of the claim asserted here (and, therefore, renders the claims asserted in the two actions different).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is little more than wishful thinking. Our earlier decision did not turn on the passing of the rights to the collateral from party to party but on the effect of an attempted assertion of those rights as against third parties. <i>Crefisa,</i> 186 F.3d at 51. Cognizant that the Note had been endorsed by RTC to Santander and then to Crefisa, we assumed that those endorsements automatically transferred the security interest in the collateral. <i>Id.</i> at 51-52. We nonetheless determined that, under the law of Puerto Rico, such transfers had no effect against a third party (such as the trustee in bankruptcy) unless and until certain formalities had been accomplished. <i>Id.</i> at 51. \"So far as the record show[ed], this ha[d] <i>never</i> occurred.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). We made no distinction between the transfer from RTC to Santander and the subsequent transfer from Santander to its corporate relative (Crefisa). Consequently, the new fact alleged in Santander's complaint does not meaningfully differentiate its present claim from the one previously adjudicated in <i>Crefisa.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santander also maintains that the \"identicality of parties\" element is not satisfied here. In this regard, it asseverates that the bankruptcy court's determination that Santander and Crefisa were in privity was no more than an unsubstantiated ipse dixit. It says now &#8212; although it did not allege in its complaint &#8212; that Crefisa is not a subsidiary of Banco Santander de Puerto Rico, but, rather, a subsidiary of that company's parent corporation, Banco Santander de Espa&#241;a. This asseveration lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a procedural matter, Santander and Crefisa were treated as peas in a pod throughout the earlier litigation. <i>See, e.g., In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">638341</span></span>, at *6-*7 (treating Santander and Crefisa as one party without eliciting any objection). Inasmuch as that position was taken the first time around, Santander cannot disown Crefisa at this late date. <i>Beddall,</i> 137 F.3d at 23 (\"We generally will not permit litigants to assert contradictory positions at different stages of a lawsuit in order to advance their interests.\"); <i>Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498115\"><a href=\"/opinion/498115/patriot-cinemas-inc-v-general-cinema-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir.1987) (adopting the view that \"[j]udicial estoppel should be employed when a litigant is playing fast and loose with the courts, and when intentional self-contradiction is being used as a means of obtaining unfair advantage in a forum provided for suitors seeking justice\") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; the distinction that Santander tries to draw makes no substantive difference for purposes of this appeal. The district court adjudicating the earlier claims specifically observed that the Note \"was endorsed to the order of Banco <i>Santander P.R.</i> by RTC as Caguas' receiver and delivered to said bank as a result of the ... Agreement between RTC and Santander/Crefisa.\" <i>In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">638341</span></span>, at *6 (emphasis supplied). Thus, we can only conclude that Banco Santander de Puerto Rico was a party to the specific transaction at issue in our earlier <i>Crefisa</i> decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, Santander and Crefisa, even on Santander's current version of the corporate interrelationship, are sister corporations under the control of a common parent. On any view of the record, these sister corporations share a common economic interest in attempting to satisfy a single debt, represented by the Note, by establishing a security interest in the Golden Passbook account and wresting the funds from the steely grip of the trustee in bankruptcy. Within this context, the corporate interrelationship among the parties gave Crefisa adequate incentive to litigate this common interest. No more is exigible to establish privity for purposes of the res judicata defense. <i>See Aunyx Corp.,</i> 978 F.2d at 4, 7 (finding party identicality of technically separate but related corporations when they shared a common interest); <i>see also Iannochino v. Rodolakis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199309\"><a href=\"/opinion/199309/iannacchino-v-rodolakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 45-46 (1st Cir.2001) (finding privity when one former law partner was the \"de facto representative\" of the other anent a common economic interest). Any other result would invite endless varieties of manipulation and reward \"tactical maneuvering designed unfairly to exploit technical nonparty status.\" <i>Gonzalez,</i> 27 F.3d at 761.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, Santander charges that the bankruptcy court erred in failing to convert the appellees' motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Had the court done so, Santander suggests, it could have introduced the RTC Santander asset purchase agreement to support its claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is flawed in at least two respects. For one thing, matters of public record are fair game in adjudicating Rule 12(b)(6) motions, and a court's reference to such matters does not convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. <i>Boateng,</i> 210 F.3d at 60. For another thing, any attempt to introduce the asset purchase agreement would have been futile. After a party has litigated and lost, the doctrine of res judicata precludes any attempt on its part, the second time around, to supplement the evidentiary record. <i>See McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. at 94; <i>Mass. Sch. of Law,</i> 142 F.3d at 39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Santander &#8212; grasping at straws &#8212; cites dictum in <i>Crefisa</i> outlining a theory under which that case's holding might not apply to a bankruptcy trustee. <i>See Crefisa,</i> 186 F.3d at 52. Santander takes that language as an invitation for it to relitigate the result of the earlier case. No such invitation was extended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We specifically noted in the earlier case that Crefisa failed to make the argument that we called a possible \"escape hatch.\" <i>Id.</i> Crefisa thus forfeited the right to press that argument. <i>See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, and Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1992). Because res judicata bars not only those theories that were actually litigated in the earlier action but also those theories that could have been litigated therein, <i>see McCurry,</i> 449 U.S. at 94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>; <i>Mass. Sch. of Law,</i> 142 F.3d at 39, the invitation to bring this argument before us in a future case clearly was not intended for any party in privity with Crefisa. Santander is such a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Motions to dismiss are in order when a plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This vehicle may be employed when the complaint, the documents incorporated by reference in it, matters of public record, and other matters susceptible to judicial notice coalesce to show beyond doubt that an action is barred, under the doctrine of res judicata, by a prior adjudication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case. The complaint makes it abundantly clear that Santander, acting through its privy and corporate relative, had a full and fair opportunity to litigate its claim. It did so and lost. Having had one bite of the cherry, Santander is not entitled to another. As the lower courts properly held, its action is easy prey for the res judicata defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In an effort to turn the tables, Santander invokes the judicial estoppel doctrine offensively (rather than defensively). In this regard, it argues that the appellees should be estopped from disputing that standing was the pivotal issue in<i>Crefisa</i> because, in that case, the same parties filed a \"Motion to Dismiss and/or for Summary Judgment based on lack of standing.\" <i>In re Colonial Mtge. Bankers Corp., supra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">638341</span></span>, at *1. This argument gains no ground. As we have explained, Santander's complaint puts courts on notice of prior proceedings relevant to the issues therein. We have determined, apart from any arguments made by the appellees, that those proceedings bar Santander's present action. Thus, whether the appellees should be barred from asserting the res judicata defense makes no difference in this appeal. <i>See Bezanson,</i> 922 F.2d at 904.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
