Paul J. Barbadoro,          U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bert John Allen, III on brief pro se.\n     Mary T.

Appellant challenges the district court's\n\ndismissal of the complaint for lack of venue pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(3).      The venue statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1391, provides,\n\nin pertinent part:\n\n\n          A civil action wherein jurisdiction is not\n          founded solely on diversity of citizenship\n          may, except as otherwise provided by law, be\n          brought only in (1) a judicial district where\n          any defendant resides, if all defendants\n          reside in the same State, (2) a judicial\n          district in which a substantial part of the\n          events or omissions giving rise to the claim\n          occurred, or a substantial part of property\n          that is the subject of the action is situated,\n          or (3) a judicial district in which any\n          defendant may be found, if there is no\n          district in which the action may otherwise be\n          brought.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).    Subsection (1) is inapplicable in this case,\n\nsince neither of the defendants can be deemed to reside in New\n\nHampshire.1   Thus, the question is whether \"a substantial part of\n\nthe events . . . giving rise to the claim occurred\" in New\n\nHampshire.2   Here, the only events with any connection at all to\n\nNew Hampshire are the allegations that individuals who are members\n\n\n\n     1\n      Appellant seems to argue that defendants should be deemed to\nreside in New Hampshire under § 1391(c), which provides that, for\npurposes of venue, corporate defendants are deemed to reside in any\ndistrict in which they are subject to personal jurisdiction when\nthe lawsuit is commenced. However, since neither defendant has any\noffices, local unions, or bargaining unit employees in New\nHampshire, § 1391(c) is inapplicable.\n     2\n      \"We turn to the third alternative only in the event that the\nfirst two provisions fail to provide an appropriate forum.\" Uffner\nv. La Reunion Francaise, S.A., 244 F.3d 38, 42 n.4 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(discussing identical provisions of § 1391(a).)\n\fof the defendant labor organizations engaged in a conspiracy to\n\ntrade postage stamps illegally for cash in order to finance \"Muslim\n\ngangs,\"   and   that   they   accomplished   this   in   the   course   of\n\ntransporting prisoners between a Massachusetts prison and the\n\nManchester, New Hampshire airport.           This allegation fails to\n\nestablish a substantial connection with New Hampshire because most,\n\nif not all, of the other events described in the complaint concern\n\nrapes and other abuses appellant claims to have suffered during his\n\nincarceration in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.\n\n           Liberally construing appellant's pro se brief, he also\n\nappears to suggest that, if venue is not proper in New Hampshire,\n\nthen the case should be transferred to Massachusetts under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1404(a). However, appellant failed to request this relief\n\nbelow, and it is not properly sought for the first time on appeal.\n\nSee Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976).        We have reviewed\n\nappellant's remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.\n\n           Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f",
