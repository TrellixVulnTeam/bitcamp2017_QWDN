Having considered the\n\nparties' briefs and the record below, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in this case, for substantially\n\nthe reasons outlined in the district court's careful opinion.\n\n           Appellants,    both    members   of   the   Puerto   Rico   Police\n\nDepartment (PRPD), brought suit against the Superintendent and\n\nInspector General of the PRPD and against the Commonwealth, for\n\ncivil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.            Ramos-Rodriguez\n\nalleges that he was denied due process when he was not promoted to\n\nFirst   Lieutenant,    and   together     they   allege   their   right   to\n\nassociation was violated when the PRPD investigated whether they\n\nwere conducting an intimate relationship at the police station.

Ramos-Rodriguez's due\n\nprocess claim does not survive summary judgment because, viewing\n\nthe facts in the light most favorable to him, he has failed to\n\nallege a viable property interest in receiving a promotion. Stuart\n\nv. Roache, 951 F.2d 446, 455 (1st Cir. 1991).          Puerto Rico law does\n\nnot permit promotion of a police officer where he has outstanding\n\ndisciplinary complaints.         25 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3114(d) (2003).\n\nHere, it is uncontested that Ramos had at least two, and up to\n\nseven, complaints pending against him on each of the three relevant\n\npromotion dates.      In addition, Ramos-Rodriguez's allegation that\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fthe PRPD had a practice of lodging anonymous complaints to prevent\n\npromotions simply is not supported by the record.\n\n            Appellants also argue that \"both plaintiffs have been\n\ndeprived    of   a   federally   protected   right    to   privacy    by    undue\n\nsurveillance and harassment.\"         Appellants' Brief at 14.        However,\n\nappellants    expend    only   two   sentences   of   their   brief    on   this\n\nargument, one in the Statement of Issues and one in the Conclusion.\n\nWith such a paucity of argumentation, appellants have waived this\n\nissue.
