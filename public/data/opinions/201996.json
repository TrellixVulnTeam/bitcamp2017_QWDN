Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                  Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n\n                           and Restani,* Judge.\n\n\n     Victor González-Bothwell, Assistant Federal Public Defender,\nwith whom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Nancy J. Hess, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nGregory R. Miller, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                              January 5, 2006\n\n\n\n     *\n      Chief Judge of the United States Court of International\nTrade, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.    Defendant Miguel Aquino-Garcia appeals from\n\nhis conviction for possession of stolen United States mail. See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1708.\n\n           In August 2001, Aquino-Garcia and his wife entered a\n\nbranch of the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya in Los Colobos, Carolina, Puerto\n\nRico, to obtain two bank checks to be used to purchase a house.            To\n\nsecure these checks, Aquino-Garcia provided the bank with three\n\nother checks: a United States Treasury check belonging to a judge\n\nand his wife for $4,143.54, a personal check to Aquino-Garcia from\n\nhis wife for $5,952.24, which was later returned for insufficient\n\nfunds, and a cashier’s check for approximately $5,000.\n\n           Sometime later, the branch was informed by its operations\n\ncenter that the Treasury check would not be honored.              The branch\n\nmanager, Luis Rivera Manzan, called Aquino-Garcia, who told Manzan\n\nthat the check had been given to him by the owner of a jewelry\n\nstore who was away from Puerto Rico and could not be contacted.\n\nManzan   sent   the   check   to   the   bank’s   security   department   for\n\ninvestigation.\n\n           In May 2002, an investigative agent with the Puerto Rico\n\nPolice interviewed Aquino-Garcia in connection with a complaint\n\nfiled by the bank regarding the Treasury check.              The agent asked\n\nAquino-Garcia how he had acquired it.         Aquino-Garcia replied that\n\nhe had received the check as payment for the sale of bottled water.\n\nHe could not, however, name the individual to whom he had made the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fsale.    Moreover, he could not provide documentation of the sale.\n\nEventually, Aquino-Garcia was indicted, tried, and convicted.\n\n            On appeal, Aquino-Garcia contends that the government\n\npresented      insufficient   evidence     to   prove   that   he    knowingly\n\npossessed stolen mail.        He also argues that the district court\n\nabused   its     discretion   by   admitting     into   evidence     allegedly\n\nirrelevant and unduly prejudicial material.\n\n            We begin with the sufficiency claim, and review the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.                See United\n\nStates v. Jimenez, 419 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir. 2005).            To prove that\n\nAquino-Garcia knowingly possessed stolen mail, the government was\n\nrequired to establish that Aquino-Garcia had in his possession the\n\ncontents of mail stolen from a mail receptacle or mail route, and\n\nthat he knew that what he possessed had been stolen. See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1708; United States v. Indelicato, 611 F.2d 376, 384 (1st Cir.\n\n1979).   Aquino-Garcia argues that there was insufficient evidence\n\nto show that the Treasury check was stolen from a mail receptacle\n\nor mail route because the evidence equally suggested that an\n\nauthorized person took the Treasury check from the judge's mailbox\n\nand later misplaced it (or had it stolen).\n\n            There was sufficient evidence that the Treasury check was\n\nstolen from the mailbox. The government's evidence showed that the\n\nTreasury check was mailed to the correct address; that a mailbox\n\nwas located in front of the judge's home; that neither the judge\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fnor his wife received the Treasury check; and that neither the\n\njudge nor his wife endorsed it.          These facts permit a reasonable\n\ninference that the check was delivered to the mailbox and taken\n\nfrom it before someone from the judge's household had retrieved the\n\nmail.\n\n           Aquino-Garcia also challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence that he knew that the Treasury check was stolen.                 As to\n\nthis element, like the first, the government adequately proved its\n\ncase through circumstantial evidence.             The government introduced\n\nthe personal check drawn on Aquino-Garcia’s spouse’s bank account,\n\nwhich was returned for insufficient funds, as well as her bank\n\naccount records, to bolster its contention that Aquino-Garcia was\n\nknowingly involved in a fraudulent scheme to obtain the bank checks\n\nfor the purchase of a house.                 The government also presented\n\nevidence that Aquino-Garcia had access to the area from which the\n\nTreasury   check   was   stolen   at    around    the   time   it   was   taken.\n\nFinally, Aquino-Garcia’s conflicting and uncorroborated stories of\n\nhow he acquired the Treasury check suggest that he knew that the\n\ncheck was stolen and was covering for his actions.\n\n           We next turn to the admissibility of evidence claims\n\nwhich we review for abuse of discretion.                See United States v.\n\nGuerrier, 428 F.3d 76, 79 (1st Cir. 2005).              Aquino-Garcia argues\n\nthat the evidence involving his spouse’s personal check and her\n\nbank records was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. See Fed. R.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fEvid. 401, 403.          He contends that there was no basis for an\n\ninference that he was aware that his wife’s check was worthless and\n\nthat, in any event, this evidence has little bearing on the\n\nelements of the crime with which he was charged.\n\n             As an initial matter, the jury was entitled to infer that\n\nAquino-Garcia had knowledge that his spouse’s check was worthless.\n\nWhile it is possible that a husband would be unaware of the state\n\nof his wife’s finances at the time of a joint home purchase, the\n\nissue turns on a jury's judgments about the relationships within\n\nfamilies.1     See United States    v. Corchado-Peralta, 318 F.3d 255,\n\n258 (1st Cir. 2003).          As discussed above, the district court\n\ncorrectly concluded that the evidence that Aquino-Garcia knowingly\n\npassed his wife’s worthless check was relevant since it makes it\n\nmore likely that he did not obtain the Treasury check accidentally\n\nor   through    lawful    means.    Additionally,   the   district   court\n\nreasonably concluded that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial,\n\nas Aquino-Garcia’s state of mind was a central issue in the case.\n\n             Aquino-Garcia also challenges the admission of evidence\n\nsuggesting that he had access to the area from which the Treasury\n\ncheck was stolen.        Specifically, he challenges the testimony of a\n\n\n      1\n      Aquino-Garcia also contends that the bank records were\nirrelevant because the government could not show that his wife’s\nbank account was empty on the date that he obtained the bank\nchecks. But the fact that there were insufficient funds in the\naccount on the date of the purchase speaks for itself, and the bank\nrecords further suggest that the absence of sufficient funds in the\naccount on that day was no passing phenomenon.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fsecurity   guard    stationed   at   a     gate    at   the   judge's    housing\n\ndevelopment, who testified that Aquino-Garcia delivered water to\n\nthe development around August 2001. Aquino-Garcia primarily argues\n\nthat this evidence was irrelevant because it goes only to whether\n\nhe stole the Treasury check -- a crime with which he was not\n\ncharged.   He also contends that the testimony was unreliable and\n\nlikely misled the jury.\n\n           Aquino-Garcia’s view of the relevance of this evidence is\n\ntoo   narrow.      That   Aquino-Garcia      had    access    to   the   judge's\n\ndevelopment increases the likelihood that he either stole the check\n\nhimself or had an opportunity to encounter the person who stole it.\n\nThis, in turn, increases the likelihood that he knew the check was\n\nstolen. Further, any argument about the reliability of the guard’s\n\ntestimony goes to its weight, and not its relevance.                See United\n\nStates v. Noone, 913 F.2d 20, 35 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n           Finally, Aquino-Garcia argues that the testimony confused\n\nthe issues and likely misled the jury by suggesting that he was\n\ncharged with stealing the Treasury check. See Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\nOn the contrary, the record discloses that the jury was clearly\n\ninstructed that the charged crime was possession of stolen mail\n\nand, as discussed above, the evidence was relevant to whether\n\nAquino-Garcia committed the charged crime.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",
