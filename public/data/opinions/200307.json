Lewis (\"Lewis\") brought this action against the City of Boston\n\n(\"City\"), claiming that the City first discharged him and then\n\nfailed to hire him for a newly created position because of his race\n\nin violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(1) and because of his\n\npublic statements regarding inadequate funding for the City’s music\n\nprograms in violation of the First Amendment.                    The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment in the City's favor.                    We affirm.\n\n                                           I\n\n               Lewis, an African-American male, has been employed by the\n\nCity in the Boston Public Schools (\"BPS\") from 1975 through the\n\npresent, and served as city-wide Music Director from 1995 through\n\nAugust   1999.         The    City   initially     employed      Lewis    as   a    music\n\ninstructor from 1975 to August 18, 1995, at which time the City\n\nappointed him as acting Music Director; on January 15, 1998, the\n\nCity appointed him as permanent Music Director. As Music Director,\n\nLewis    was    responsible       for   implementing       and   developing        policy\n\nrelating       to     music    education,        overseeing      music     curriculum\n\ndevelopment,         supporting      ninety-two    music     teachers,     conducting\n\ninventories of musical instruments, organizing the Martin Luther\n\nKing, Jr. celebration, and serving as liaison between the BPS and\n\nvarious music organizations in the City.\n\n               The    Music    Director    was    one   of    ten   Senior     Program\n\nDirectors      in    the     Department   of     Curriculum      and     Instructional\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fPractices (\"Curriculum Department\"), all of whom reported to the\n\nDirector of the Department, Sid Smith (\"Smith\"), a white male.\n\nSmith reported directly to Timothy Knowles (\"Knowles\"), Deputy\n\nSuperintendent for Teaching and Learning.             In 1999, of these ten\n\ndirectors, four were African-American, one was Asian, and five were\n\nwhite.\n\n              During his tenure as Music Director, Lewis was a public\n\nadvocate for increased funding for music education, particularly\n\ninstrumental music instruction.1         In a November 25, 1997 article,\n\nthe   Boston     Herald   reported     that   Lewis    desired     to   expand\n\ninstrumental music instruction and that to do so he proposed hiring\n\nnew   music    instructors   to    travel   among   elementary    and   middle\n\nschools.      Sometime in 1998, Lewis reduced this proposal to writing\n\nand shared it with a City Councilor.           The proposal stressed that\n\nthe City was in noncompliance with its own Arts Policy by not\n\noffering      instrumental   music     instruction.       To     come   within\n\ncompliance, the proposal recommended that the City hire twenty new\n\nteachers at an approximate cost of $1,000,000, as part of a revived\n\nItinerant Music Program.          Lewis did not speak to his supervisors\n\nbefore sharing his written proposal with the City Councilor.\n\nAccording to Lewis, shortly thereafter, Smith told Lewis that the\n\nSuperintendent, Thomas Payzant, was very upset with Lewis for\n\n\n      1\n      By 1995, except in a few schools, the BPS had eliminated\ninstrumental music instruction. In lieu of such instruction, the\nCity offered music appreciation, singing, and rhythm.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fspeaking to the City Councilor.2           Smith also testified that he\n\nexpressed his concern that Lewis should think about whether he was\n\nviolating established protocol by talking to city council members\n\nabout budget-related matters without first consulting Payzant.\n\n            Lewis was also quoted in a February 1, 1999 Boston Globe\n\narticle.    The City's press office had directed the Boston Globe\n\nreporter to Lewis.         The article reported that instruments lay\n\ndormant in a warehouse, many of which had \"rotted in the eight\n\nyears    since   funding    for   instrumental   music   instruction   was\n\neliminated from the city's school budget.\"          The article did not\n\nreveal, and Lewis did not know, the source of this information.\n\nLewis was quoted as stating that the school system was trying to\n\ninform teachers of the existence and location of the instruments.\n\nThe article also discussed Lewis's desire to revive the Itinerant\n\nMusic Program. Lewis discussed the article with Smith and Payzant,\n\nand neither of them expressed any negative comments.            In March\n\n1999, with Payzant present, Lewis addressed a City Council hearing,\n\ndiscussing the need for greater funding for music programs.\n\n            In late spring of 1999, the City instituted a system-wide\n\nreduction in force to fund transition programs3 in literacy and\n\n\n     2\n      The district court ruled that the statement was not hearsay\nbased on an agency theory under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D).\nBecause the City does not challenge that ruling, we will consider\nthe statement.\n     3\n      Transition programs provided additional support to students\nwho were furthest behind and were not eligible for promotion.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fmathematics,    and      to    prepare        students       for     the       impending\n\nMassachusetts    Comprehensive         Assessment      System       tests      (\"MCAS\").\n\nSmith decided,    with    the       approval    of   Knowles       and    Payzant,    to\n\neliminate the Music Director position and to spread Lewis's duties\n\nto other positions.      The reorganization contemplated the creation\n\nof a new position, which consolidated the bulk of the Music\n\nDirector duties with the day-to-day school responsibilities held by\n\nthe Director of the Roland Hayes Division of Music4, who would\n\nreport directly to Knowles, rather than to Smith, as Lewis did.\n\nThe Arts Director would assume the remaining responsibilities.                        By\n\nletter dated May 14, 1999, Payzant notified Lewis that the City was\n\neliminating his position due to budget cuts.                        In addition to\n\neliminating Lewis's position, the City terminated thirty-one other\n\nrelatively high-level, supervisory employees.\n\n            The City posted the revised Roland Hayes position three\n\ntimes.   Qualified candidates were required to have a master's\n\ndegree and school-based management experience.                     The City formed a\n\nscreening    committee    that       reviewed    applications            and    selected\n\nqualified   candidates        for    interviews.         A   diverse       group,    the\n\nscreening committee       consisted      of    three     African-Americans,          one\n\nHispanic, and one white.            Although Lewis did not have a master's\n\n\n     4\n      Roland Hayes Division of Music, located at Madison High\nSchool, was the City's single magnet school for music. In January,\n1999, the Director of Roland Hayes, Robert Winfrey, retired. Greg\nGozzola, a white teacher at Roland Hayes, temporarily assumed\nWinfrey's duties.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdegree, he applied for the position, but was not selected for an\n\ninterview.          Instead,   the    City       selected     four       candidates   for\n\ninterviews,      including        three    African-Americans,            all   with   the\n\nrequisite master's degree and school-based management experience.\n\nThe   City    did    not   hire    any    of   the   candidates,          re-posted   the\n\nposition, and decided to keep Greg Gozzola, the teacher who had\n\nbeen filling in for Winfrey, as acting Director of Roland Hayes for\n\nthe   following       academic       year.        Some      of     the    district-wide\n\nresponsibilities formerly held by Lewis were assumed by the Arts\n\nDirector, Kathy Tosolini (\"Tosolini\"), a white female, and the\n\nremainder, such as the Martin Luther King, Jr. celebration, were\n\nassumed by other employees.\n\n              In 2000, the City re-posted the position, but reduced the\n\ndistrict-wide responsibilities; Tosolini and others continued to\n\ncover those functions.             Even though Lewis still did not have a\n\nmaster's degree,5 the City mailed to him a written invitation to\n\ninterview      and   called    him    to     confirm     on      the   morning   it   was\n\nscheduled. Lewis failed to appear for the interview, claiming that\n\nhe never received the invitation and that by the time he received\n\nthe call, he had a prior commitment.                        His interview was not\n\nrescheduled.         Ultimately, the City offered the position to an\n\nAfrican-American, but he declined. The position was re-posted, and\n\n\n\n\n      5\n          Lewis received his master's degree on June 10, 2001.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fremained unfilled at the time of the district court's summary\n\njudgment ruling.\n\n                                II\n\n          Lewis filed this civil suit against the City, alleging\n\nthat, by eliminating his position and failing to hire him for the\n\nRoland Hayes position, the City retaliated against him for his\n\npublic statements in violation of the First Amendment and because\n\nof his race in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 151B, § 4.    The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of the City,\n\nfinding that Lewis had adduced insufficient facts to support either\n\nclaim.\n\n                               III\n\n          We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Lewis,\n\nthe nonmoving party, and drawing all reasonable inferences in his\n\nfavor.   Feliciano De La Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort & Country\n\nClub, 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nA.        Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, § 4(1)\n\n          To prevail on his chapter 151B claim, Lewis must prove\n\nthat he \"is a member of a protected class, [he] suffered harm as a\n\nresult of [the City's] adverse employment action, and the [City]\n\nharbored discriminatory animus, which was the determinative cause\n\nof the adverse action.\"   Weber v. Community Teamwork, Inc., 434\n\nMass. 761, 775, 752 N.E.2d 700 (2001).   Because Lewis relies upon\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fcircumstantial evidence of discrimination, we employ a familiar\n\nthree-stage, burden-shifting paradigm first set out in McDonnell-\n\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Abramian v. President\n\n& Fellows of Harvard Coll., 432 Mass. 107, 116-18, 731 N.E.2d 1075\n\n(2000).   Lewis bears the initial burden of establishing a prima\n\nfacie case of discrimination; doing so creates a presumption of\n\ndiscrimination.     Id. at 116.    The burden then shifts to the City to\n\nrebut the presumption by advancing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for the employment decision.         The City’s obligation is one\n\nof production as opposed to persuasion, as the burden of persuasion\n\nremains with Lewis.       Id. at 117.   If the City meets its burden, the\n\npresumption of discrimination disappears.          The burden returns to\n\nLewis to establish that the basis of the City's decisions was\n\nunlawful discrimination, by adducing evidence that the reasons\n\ngiven by the City for its actions were mere pretexts to hide such\n\ndiscrimination.       Id. at 118.\n\n          1.        Elimination of the Music Director\n\n          We first decide whether Lewis established a prima facie\n\ncase, mindful that the purpose of doing so is to eliminate the\n\n\"most common nondiscriminatory reasons\" for an employment decision,\n\nfrom which     a   fact   finder   might   reasonably   conclude   that   the\n\nemployer made its decision because of race.         Id. at 116.    As Lewis\n\nwas terminated as part of a district-wide reduction in force, he\n\nmust show by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was a\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fmember of a protected class under chapter 151B; (2) he performed\n\nhis job satisfactorily; (3) he was terminated; and (4) the City did\n\nnot treat race neutrally in making its decision to terminate him or\n\nretained personnel outside of his protected class in the same\n\nposition.      LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 842 (1st Cir.\n\n1993); cf. Wheatley v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 418 Mass. 394, 397, 636\n\nN.E.2d 265 (1994) (\"It is our practice to apply Federal case law\n\nconstruing the Federal anti-discrimination statutes in interpreting\n\nG.L. c. 151B.\").6\n\n               It is undisputed that Lewis has established the first\n\nthree elements; the battleground then is in the fourth prong.               On\n\nappeal, for the first time, Lewis attempts to demonstrate that the\n\nCity did not treat race neutrally in deciding whom to terminate by\n\narguing that the lay-offs were statistically out of line with the\n\noverall racial makeup of the BPS workforce. See, e.g., Lipchitz v.\n\nRaytheon Co., 434 Mass. 493, 508-09, 751 N.E.2d 360 (2001) (holding\n\nthat       statistical   evidence   may   support   an   inference   that   a\n\nparticular decision was made because of discriminatory animus);\n\nSmith College v. MCAD, 376 Mass. 221, 228 n.9, 380 N.E.2d 121\n\n\n\n       6\n      The fourth prong is slightly different in the non-reduction\nin force setting. In that context, the fourth prong requires that\nthe employee establish that \"his employer sought to fill the\nplaintiff's   position   by   hiring   another  individual   with\nqualifications similar to the plaintiff's. . . .\" Abramian, 432\nMass. at 116, 731 N.E.2d 1075. In the typical reduction of force\ncase, however, the fourth prong is unworkable because the\nplaintiff’s position no longer exists.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f(1978) (\"In a proper case, gross statistical disparities alone may\n\nconstitute prima facie proof of a practice of discrimination.\").\n\nBecause Lewis failed to raise this theory below, we deem it\n\nforfeited.7   Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d\n\n252, 258 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[A]lthough the court of appeals affords\n\nde novo review to orders granting summary judgment, it will not\n\nreverse such an order on the basis of arguments [or theories] that\n\nwere not made in the trial court.\"); Utica Mutual Ins. Co. v.\n\nWeathermark Investments, Inc., 292 F.3d 77, 80-82 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nsee generally, Wright & Miller, supra note 7, § 2716, at 282.\n\n          Lewis also contends that \"only black Senior Program\n\nDirectors were laid off,\" from which a jury could infer that the\n\nCity targeted him because of race.    But Lewis was the only Senior\n\nProgram Director in the Curriculum Department to be terminated; the\n\nremaining three African-American Senior Program Directors retained\n\n\n\n     7\n      Even if we were to consider the argument, we would find the\nrecord devoid of any evidence revealing a gross statistical\ndisparity. Lewis attempts to present the demographic makeup of the\nBPS workforce through factual representations in a footnote to his\nappellate brief. It is elementary, however, that we review the\nrecord as it existed at the time the district court rendered its\nruling, Crawford v. Lamantia, 34 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1994); 10A\nCharles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal\nPractice & Procedure § 2716, at 282 (3d ed. 1998); cf. Fed. R. App.\nP. 10(a) (West 2002) (setting forth the composition of the record\nfor appeal), and we disregard factual assertions made in briefs and\nother self-serving documents that are not otherwise supported by\ncompetent evidence as required by Rule 56(e), Vivid Tech., Inc. v.\nAm. Sci. & Eng'g, Inc., 200 F.3d 795, 812 (1st Cir. 1999); Nieves\nv. Univ. of Puerto Rico, 7 F.3d 270, 276 n.9 (1st Cir. 1993);\nWright & Miller, supra, § 2723, at 389-90.\n\n                               -10-\n\ftheir positions.      We fail to see how a jury could reasonably infer\n\nthat the City targeted Lewis due to his race merely because he was\n\nthe one Senior Program Director, out of ten, who was terminated.\n\nCf. LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 844 (\"We . . . question whether a company\n\ncan be said not to treat age neutrally as a matter of law merely\n\nbecause two of the three people it discharges pursuant to a\n\nreduction in force belong to the protected class.                 A sample of\n\nthree is a small number from which to draw deductions of this\n\nsort.\").\n\n           Lewis also relies on the City's retention of the other\n\nSenior Program Directors who were not in his protected class.8\n\nLewis points to no convincing evidence that shows how the positions\n\nheld by the other directors may reasonably be considered the same\n\nas the position that Lewis held.             Lewis himself testified that\n\n\"there's no comparable position\" to his former position, unless the\n\nCity were \"to make a position [of] Director of Fine Arts, . . .\n\nbut--right now, that position doesn't exist . . . .\"             In any event,\n\nthe   record     emphasizes   the   differences,     not   the   similarities,\n\nbetween    the    positions.        Each    Senior   Program     Director   was\n\nresponsible for a specific academic discipline: English, which\n\nincluded two directors (one for elementary and one for secondary\n\n\n\n      8\n      Lewis's brief states that \"all the other Senior Program\nDirectors . . . were not in Lewis's protected class\" and that all\nwere retained. This is a misstatement of the record, as three of\nthe other directors were African-American.\n\n                                     -11-\n\feducation), math, science, history, world languages, music, art,\n\nphysical education, and health. The duties and responsibilities of\n\neach of     the      directors   were       defined      by    the    specific       academic\n\ndiscipline      to    which   they     were       assigned.          Within    an    assigned\n\ndiscipline, the director established and implemented performance\n\nstandards, curriculum guidelines, and professional development\n\nprograms, and supported teachers throughout the BPS.                               Smith also\n\ntestified,      uncontroverted         by       Lewis,   that    the    City       disregards\n\nseniority      when    instituting          a    reduction      in    force        within   the\n\nCurriculum Department because the City does not view the Senior\n\nProgram Director positions as being of similar character.\n\n               Lewis makes much of the fact that the Arts and Music\n\nDirector positions had the same personnel grade and salary and were\n\nlisted on a single job posting.                     Although true, Lewis ignores\n\nsignificant differences.             The Arts Director covered three subject\n\nareas: visual arts, theater, and dance.                       Among other things, she\n\nsupported 151 art teachers, established and implemented the Arts\n\nand Education Policy for the BPS, coordinated programs with the\n\nMuseum    of    Fine    Arts,    and    coordinated           after-school          and   other\n\nprograms not coordinated by the Music Director. On this record, no\n\nfact finder       could    reasonably           conclude      that    any     of    the   other\n\ndirectors were in the same position as Lewis.\n\n               Relying upon Flebotte v. Dow Jones & Co., 51 F. Supp.2d\n\n36, 40 (D. Mass. 1999), Lewis attempts to avoid our inevitable\n\n\n                                            -12-\n\fconclusion by asserting that the City's delegation of his duties to\n\nother individuals not in his protected class amounted to retaining\n\nindividuals in the same position.          We disagree.    The purpose of the\n\nprima facie case is to identify those circumstances where the\n\nemployer’s actions, if left unexplained, are more likely than not\n\nbased on unlawful discrimination.               In the typical reduction in\n\nforce case, the employer's actions have already been explained, as\n\nthe reduction in force is itself a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for the lay-offs.         And as recognized by the district court,\n\n\"in a reduction in force situation, a company generally reorganizes\n\nits workforce and reassigns responsibilities to reduce headcount\n\nand save money.\"      Lewis v. City of Boston, No. CIV. A. 00-11548,\n\n2002   WL   523910,   at    *5   (D.    Mass.    March   29,    2002).   Merely\n\ndemonstrating that, as a result of the reduction in force, the\n\nemployer consolidated positions or allocated duties of discharged\n\nemployees to other existing employees does not itself raise a\n\nreasonable inference that the employer harbored discriminatory\n\nanimus toward any one employee.          Accepting Lewis's argument \"would\n\nrender meaningless the fourth requirement of the prima facie case\"\n\nunder LeBlanc.      Id.    We are careful not to suggest, however, that\n\nan employer may mask unlawful discrimination by simply transferring\n\nall of an employee's duties to another employee during a reduction\n\nin force.      Rather, we are saying that the employee must come\n\nforward     with   something     more   than    evidence   of   the   inevitable\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\ftransfer of his or her responsibilities to existing employees.\n\nThis Lewis has failed to do.9\n\n                  Finally, Lewis for the first time contends that his\n\nposition was not, in fact, eliminated, reasoning that the duties of\n\nthe Roland Hayes Director were merely added to the position he\n\nformerly held.          This argument is unavailing.        The evidence in the\n\nrecord, adduced by both the City and Lewis, leaves beyond question\n\nthat the City eliminated the Music Director position from the\n\nCurriculum Department and consolidated the duties of that position\n\nwith       that    of   the   former   Roland   Hayes   Director   and   the   Arts\n\nDirector.         There simply is no genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether his position was eliminated.              We hold therefore that Lewis\n\nfailed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\n\n                  Even if we were to assume arguendo that Lewis satisfied\n\nhis prima facie burden, we would still affirm.               The City proffered\n\na number of legitimate reasons why it chose Lewis's position for\n\nelimination during its search for additional funds for transition\n\nprograms in literacy and mathematics and to prepare students for\n\nthe MCAS tests.          Smith, who made the decision, testified that the\n\nMusic Director position was the natural candidate for elimination\n\n\n\n       9\n      Of course, an employee is free to establish that the\nreduction in force is itself a sham.      Lewis, however, does not\nchallenge the legitimacy of the City's system-wide reduction in\nforce; indeed, at oral argument, he agreed that the City undertook\nthe reduction in force, in part, to focus more resources to prepare\nstudents for the impending MCAS tests.\n\n                                         -14-\n\fin his Department because music was not a priority subject area10;\n\naside from English, the Arts was the only subject area that had two\n\nSenior Program Directors; and the duties of the Music Director\n\ncould be easily transferred to the Arts Director and the Roland\n\nHayes position, which would result in one less person doing the\n\nwork. In addition, transferring district-wide duties to the Roland\n\nHayes position and creating a new Director position that was under\n\nthe supervision of the Deputy Superintendent would achieve the\n\nCity's goal of raising the status and visibility of the Roland\n\nHayes position.       The City's reasons sufficiently dispel any taint\n\nof racial discrimination.\n\n             Beyond the thin evidence Lewis relies upon to satisfy his\n\nprima     facie   case,   Lewis   presented   no   evidence   to   support   a\n\nreasonable inference that any of the reasons given by the City were\n\nfalse.     That evidence does not by itself even suggest that the\n\nreasons advanced by the City were a pretext for discrimination.\n\nThe City's decision to discharge Lewis is not actionable under\n\nchapter 151B.\n\n             2.       Failure to hire for the Roland Hayes position\n\n             Again,   Lewis   relies   on   indirect   evidence    of   racial\n\ndiscrimination.        To establish a prima facie case, Lewis must\n\nestablish that (1) he is a member of a protected class under 151B;\n\n\n\n     10\n      The MCAS tests covered           English,     mathematics,    history,\nscience, and world languages.\n\n                                     -15-\n\f(2) he applied for an open position; (3) he was not hired; and (4)\n\nthe City sought to fill the position with individuals who had\n\nqualifications similar to his.      Wynn & Wynn v. MCAD, 431 Mass. 655,\n\n666 n.22, 729 N.E.2d 1068 (2000).          The district court held that\n\nLewis failed to establish a prima facie case because he was not\n\nqualified,   as   he   lacked   a   master's   degree   and   school-based\n\nmanagement experience.     Lewis responds that there exists a genuine\n\nissue as to whether he was qualified, pointing out that the City\n\nappointed him as Music Director in 1995, which required a master's\n\ndegree, and invited him to interview for the second posting, even\n\nthough the qualifications for the position had not changed and he\n\nstill did not have a master's degree.          We will assume, without\n\ndeciding, that Lewis has satisfied his prima facie burden, and turn\n\nto the second stage of the McDonnell-Douglas paradigm.\n\n          We think it important to review each posting separately,\n\nnot only because Lewis raises distinct challenges to each of them,\n\nbut also because doing so exposes the lack of substance to his\n\nclaims.   Lewis does not challenge the first committee's decision\n\nnot to select him, conceding at oral argument that the first\n\nselection committee, which included three African-Americans, did\n\nnot discriminate against him based upon his race.         Instead, Lewis\n\ncontends that the City, because of his race, stacked that committee\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fwith two members, Winfrey and Ruth Howe11, both African-Americans,\n\nwho it knew were biased against him and would not select him.                   This\n\nis   mere   conjecture.      Although    there       is    evidence    that   Smith,\n\nKnowles, and Payzant knew that Lewis and Winfrey had conflicts in\n\nthe past over Roland Hayes,12 not one of them selected the committee\n\nmembers.      The   committee      members    were    selected    by    the   Deputy\n\nSuperintendent, Amalle Cudiero Nelson, who also chaired the first\n\ncommittee.    Not only has Lewis failed to present any evidence that\n\nNelson knew that any of the members of the committee were biased\n\nagainst him, but, more significantly, he has also failed to show\n\nthat Nelson otherwise, because of his race, stacked the committee\n\nagainst him.       Given Lewis's concession that the committee did not\n\ndiscriminate against him due to his race, we will proceed to the\n\nsecond posting.\n\n             We need not dwell at length on the second posting as we\n\nfind that Lewis has failed to adduce any evidence even suggesting\n\nthat he was not hired due to his race.                    The City adduced ample\n\nevidence    that    Lewis   took    himself    out    of     contention   for    the\n\nposition: it is uncontested that Lewis failed to appear for the\n\n\n\n      11\n      Howe was a member of the Friends of Roland Hayes, which was\nan outside advocacy group for Roland Hayes Division of Music.\n      12\n      As to Ruth Howe, there is absolutely no record support for\nthe assertion that she was somehow biased against Lewis. Lewis\ninvites us to speculate that because she was, at the time, a member\nof the Friends of Roland Hayes, she was biased against him. We\ndecline the invitation.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fscheduled interview.   Nevertheless, Lewis points out that after\n\nfailing to show for the scheduled interview, he sent a facsimile to\n\nthe City's Human Resources Director, with a copy to Knowles,\n\nrequesting that the interview be rescheduled.    While the Director\n\ndid not reschedule, there is absolutely no evidence remotely\n\nsuggesting that the City, through its Human Resources Director,\n\nfailed to reschedule his interview because of his race.      In any\n\nevent, even more telling of a lack of discriminatory animus, the\n\nCity offered the position to an African-American, a person in\n\nLewis's protected class.    Based on this record, a jury could not\n\nreasonably conclude that the City failed to hire him because of his\n\nrace.13\n\nB.        First Amendment\n\n          Lewis also claims that the City deprived him of his First\n\nAmendment rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983,14 by retaliating\n\nagainst him for his statements to the press in 1997 and 1999 and to\n\n\n\n\n     13\n      The position was re-posted and remained open at the time of\nthe district court's rulings.     In his appellate brief, Lewis's\ncounsel alleges that Lewis was not hired after the third posting\neven though he had a master's degree. These facts are not properly\nbefore us, see supra note 7, and in any event, there is no evidence\nin the record providing the details of the hiring process from\nwhich an inference of discriminatory animus may be properly drawn.\n     14\n      Lewis also based his claim on the Massachusetts Civil Rights\nAct (\"MCRA\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, § 11H-I.     Lewis does not\nappeal the district court’s ruling that the City could not be held\nliable under MCRA because the City is not a \"person\" for purposes\nof the Act.\n\n                               -18-\n\fmembers of the City Council in 1998 and 1999.15        To prevail on his\n\nclaim, as a public employee, Lewis must establish that (1) his\n\nexpression involved matters of public concern; (2) his interest in\n\ncommenting upon those matters outweighed the City’s interests in\n\nthe efficient performance of its public services; and (3) his\n\nprotected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\nCity’s adverse employment actions.         Mullin v. Town of Fairhaven,\n\n284 F.3d 31, 37-38 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Connick v. Myers, 461\n\nU.S. 138, 147-48 (1983); Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.\n\nv. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977); Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S.\n\n563 (1968)); Nethersole v. Bulger, 87 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThe first two prongs are questions of law and thus are subject to\n\nde novo review, whereas the third prong is generally for the fact\n\nfinder to decide. Nethersole, 287 F.3d at 19; O'Connor v. Steeves,\n\n994   F.2d   905,   913   (1st   Cir.   1993).   If   Lewis   succeeds   in\n\nestablishing a prima facie case, the burden of persuasion shifts to\n\n\n\n      15\n      We uphold the district court’s ruling, unchallenged by the\nCity, that Lewis could bring his First Amendment claim under\n§ 1983, even though Lewis failed to name individual defendants in\ntheir personal capacity. The trial court found that the City’s\n\"decision was made as part of the budgetary process and constituted\na deliberate policy determination with respect to the structure of\nthe music education program in the public schools,\" and thus the\nCity, through its policy makers--Payzant, Knowles, and Smith, was\nthe \"moving force behind the decision.\" Lewis v. City of Boston,\nNo. CIV. A. 00-11548, 2002 WL 523910, at *10 (D. Mass. March 29,\n2002) (citing Bd. Of County Comm’rs of Bryan County v. Brown, 520\nU.S. 397, 404 (1997); City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 389\n(1989); Monell v. New York Dep't of Soc. Services, 436 U.S. 658,\n694 (1978)).\n\n                                    -19-\n\fthe City to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Lewis's\n\nposition would have been eliminated \"even in the absence of the\n\nprotected conduct.\"       Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 287.\n\n              The City does not challenge the district court’s ruling\n\nin favor of Lewis on the first two prongs; we therefore proceed to\n\nthe third prong.      Lewis is not required to come forward with direct\n\nevidence    (the     so-called   smoking     gun)   that    his   speech   was   a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor, but rather, as in other contexts\n\nwhere motivation is an issue, he can rely upon circumstantial\n\nevidence. Having considered the briefs and thoroughly reviewed the\n\nentire record, we agree with the district court that Lewis failed\n\nto   adduce    any   evidence    suggesting    that   his    speech   played     a\n\nsubstantial or motivating role in the City's decisions.\n\n              To establish the essential nexus, Lewis stresses the\n\ntemporal proximity between his public statements to the press and\n\nto City Council members and the City's decision to eliminate his\n\nposition.      Lewis also notes that Smith told him that Payzant was\n\nvery upset after Lewis shared his proposal with a City Councilor in\n\n1998.   From these facts, Lewis believes that a jury could conclude\n\nthat his speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the\n\nCity's decision.       We disagree.\n\n              Although \"'close temporal proximity between two events\n\nmay give rise to an inference of causal connection,'\" Nethersole,\n\n287 F.3d at 20 (emphasis added) (quoting Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fCorp., 144 F.3d 151, 168 (1st Cir. 1998)), that inference is \"not\n\nnecessarily conclusive\" where, as in this case, the inference is\n\nconsiderably weakened by other facts in the record, Hodgens, 144\n\nF.3d at 170.    Here, Lewis started his public advocacy for more\n\nfunding for music programs in 1997, over a year and a half before\n\nhe was terminated, a fact that seriously undermines his temporal\n\nproximity argument.16       Moreover, after reviewing Lewis's public\n\nstatements, we doubt that a fact finder could reasonably conclude\n\nthat they were in any way critical of the City or its supervisors;\n\nLewis merely commented on the need for more funding and his desire\n\nto revive instrumental music instruction. In any event, we find no\n\nevidence that any of his supervisors, including Smith, who made the\n\ndecision   to   eliminate    Lewis's     position,   were   anything   but\n\nsupportive of his comments.      After his statements appeared in the\n\n\n     16\n      Facing this problem before the district court, Lewis argued\nthat the relevant time period on which the court should focus is\nthe spring of 1999, when the level of public interest about funding\nof music and arts programs was high. Lewis attempts a different\ncourse on appeal, alleging that the causal link between his 1997\nstatements in the Boston Herald and the decision to terminate him\nremained unbroken, as the City engaged in retaliatory actions by no\nlonger sending him communications regarding music, excluding him\nfrom the Arts Policy Committee, denying him an adequate budget, and\nfailing to adequately respond to interferences with his workspace\nby other employees. The record demonstrates that Lewis believed\nthat, aside from failing to rectify his workspace complaints, the\nCity, because of Lewis's race, engaged in the other so-called\nretaliatory actions since 1995.      As to the City's failure to\nrespond to his workspace complaints, we seriously doubt whether it\nconstitutes a sufficient adverse employment action for First\nAmendment purposes; but even if it does, we find no evidence\nlinking his 1997 statements to the City's lack of response to his\ncomplaints.\n\n                                  -21-\n\f1997   Boston   Herald,     the   City   promoted    Lewis   from   acting    to\n\npermanent Music Director, encouraged him to start a parent advocacy\n\ngroup,    and   assisted    him   in     gaining    access   to   the    musical\n\ninstruments at Roland Hayes.             Indeed, Lewis testified that he\n\ndiscussed the Boston Globe article with Payzant because, at the\n\ntime, Payzant was assisting Lewis in distributing instruments\n\nthroughout the City, the goal that Lewis was quoted as trying to\n\nachieve.    And it was the City, through its press office, that\n\ndirected the Boston Globe reporter to Lewis.\n\n            Even more significant, the inference carried by the\n\ntemporal proximity between his statements in 1999 and the decision\n\nto terminate him dissipates when consideration is given to the\n\nattendant circumstances.          The City adduced ample evidence that\n\nLewis's position was eliminated along with thirty-one others during\n\na reduction in force resulting from the impending MCAS tests.\n\nLewis presented no credible evidence demonstrating that the reasons\n\nadvanced by the City were pretexts from which a fact finder could\n\ninfer discriminatory animus.\n\n            We are also unconvinced that Smith's alleged statement\n\nthat Payzant was very upset sufficiently links Lewis's protected\n\nactivity to the decision to terminate him.              The record evidence\n\ndoes not suggest that Smith, the person who decided to eliminate\n\nthe    position,   shared    Payzant's     claimed   view    or   that   he   was\n\nconcerned with anything beyond protocol.\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\f           Even were we to assume that Lewis met his prima facie\n\nburden on such thin circumstantial evidence, he could not avoid\n\nsummary judgment because the City sufficiently established the Mt.\n\nHealthy   defense.     We   find   that   the   City   demonstrated   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same\n\ndecision regardless of Lewis's speech.          Lewis failed to present\n\nevidence, direct or circumstantial, to refute even one of the\n\nreasons given by the City.    It would be pure conjecture to conclude\n\nthat the City would have made a different decision in the absence\n\nof Lewis's comments.\n\n                                    IV\n\n           Having found that Lewis has failed to meet his burden of\n\nadducing sufficient facts to survive a motion of summary judgment\n\non both his First Amendment and Chapter 151B claims, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\f",

The City initially employed Lewis as a music instructor from 1975 to August 18, 1995, at which time the City appointed him as acting Music Director; on January 15, 1998, the City appointed him as permanent Music Director. As Music Director, Lewis was responsible for implementing and developing policy relating to music education, overseeing music curriculum development, supporting ninety-two music teachers, conducting inventories of musical instruments, organizing the Martin Luther King, Jr. celebration, and serving as liaison between the BPS and various music organizations in the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Music Director was one of ten Senior Program Directors in the Department of Curriculum and Instructional Practices (\"Curriculum Department\"), all of whom reported to the Director of the Department, Sid Smith (\"Smith\"), a white male. Smith reported directly to Timothy Knowles (\"Knowles\"), Deputy Superintendent for Teaching and Learning.

Sometime in 1998, Lewis reduced this proposal to writing and shared it with a City Councilor. The proposal stressed that the City was in non-compliance with its own Arts Policy by not offering instrumental music instruction. To come within compliance, the proposal recommended that the City hire twenty new teachers at an approximate cost of $1,000,000, as part of a revived Itinerant Music Program. Lewis did not speak to his supervisors before sharing his written proposal with the City Councilor. According to Lewis, shortly thereafter, Smith told Lewis that the Superintendent, Thomas Payzant, was very upset with Lewis for speaking to the City Councilor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Smith also testified that he expressed his concern that Lewis should think about whether he was violating established protocol by talking to city council members about budget-related matters without first consulting Payzant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis was also quoted in a February 1, 1999 <i>Boston Globe</i> article.

The article reported that instruments lay dormant in a warehouse, many of which had \"rotted in the eight years since funding for instrumental music instruction was eliminated from the city's school budget.\" The article did not reveal, and Lewis did not know, the source of this information. Lewis was quoted as stating that the school system was trying to inform teachers of the existence and location of the instruments. The article also discussed Lewis's desire to revive the Itinerant Music Program. Lewis discussed the article with Smith and Payzant, and neither of them expressed any negative comments. In March 1999, with Payzant present, Lewis addressed a City Council hearing, discussing the need for greater funding for music programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late spring of 1999, the City instituted a system-wide reduction in force to fund transition programs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> in literacy and mathematics, and to prepare students for the impending Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests (\"MCAS\"). Smith decided, with the approval of Knowles and Payzant, to eliminate the Music Director position and to spread Lewis's duties to other positions. The reorganization contemplated the creation of a new position, which consolidated the bulk of the Music Director duties with the day-to-day school responsibilities held by the Director of the Roland Hayes Division of Music<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>, who would report directly to Knowles, rather than to Smith, as Lewis did. The Arts Director would assume the remaining responsibilities. By letter dated May 14, 1999, Payzant notified Lewis that the City was eliminating his position due to budget cuts. In addition to eliminating Lewis's position, the City terminated thirty-one other relatively high-level, supervisory employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City posted the revised Roland Hayes position three times. Qualified candidates were required to have a master's degree and school-based management experience. The City formed a screening committee that reviewed applications and selected qualified candidates for interviews. A diverse group, the screening committee consisted of three African-Americans, one Hispanic, and one white. Although Lewis did not have a master's degree, he applied for the position, but was not selected for an interview. Instead, the City selected four candidates for interviews, including three African-Americans, all with the requisite master's degree and school-based management experience. The City did not hire any of the candidates, re-posted the position, and decided to keep Greg Gozzola, the teacher who had been filling in for Winfrey, as acting Director of Roland Hayes for the following academic year. Some of the district-wide responsibilities formerly held by Lewis were assumed by the Arts Director, Kathy Tosolini (\"Tosolini\"), a white female, and the remainder, such as the Martin Luther King, Jr. celebration, were assumed by other employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, the City re-posted the position, but reduced the district-wide responsibilities; Tosolini and others continued to cover those functions. Even though Lewis still did not have a master's degree,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the City mailed to him a written invitation to interview and called him to confirm on the morning it was scheduled. Lewis failed to appear for the interview, claiming that he never received the invitation and that by the time he received the call, he had a prior commitment. His interview was not rescheduled. Ultimately, the City offered the position to an African-American, but he declined. The position was re-posted, and remained unfilled at the time of the district court's summary judgment ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis filed this civil suit against the City, alleging that, by eliminating his position and failing to hire him for the Roland Hayes position, the City retaliated against him for his public statements in violation of the First Amendment and because of his race in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 151B, &#167; 4. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the City, finding that Lewis had adduced insufficient facts to support either claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Lewis, the nonmoving party, and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Feliciano De La Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort &amp; Country Club,</i> 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on his chapter 151B claim, Lewis must prove that he \"is a member of a protected class, [he] suffered harm as a result of [the City's] adverse employment action, and the [City] harbored discriminatory animus, which was the determinative cause of the adverse action.\" <i>Weber v. Community Teamwork, Inc.,</i> 434 Mass. 761, 775, 752 N.E.2d 700 (2001). Because Lewis relies upon circumstantial evidence of discrimination, we employ a familiar three-stage, burden-shifting paradigm first set out in <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <i>Abramian v. President &amp; Fellows of Harvard Coll.,</i> 432 Mass. 107, 116-18, 731 N.E.2d 1075 (2000). Lewis bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination; doing so creates a presumption of discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 116, 731 N.E.2d 1075. The burden then shifts to the City to rebut the presumption by advancing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision. The City's obligation is one of production as opposed to persuasion, as the burden of persuasion remains with Lewis. <i>Id.</i> at 117, 731 N.E.2d 1075. If the City meets its burden, the presumption of discrimination disappears. The burden returns to Lewis to establish that the basis of the City's decisions was unlawful discrimination, by adducing evidence that the reasons given by the City for its actions were mere pretexts to hide such discrimination. <i>Id.</i> at 118, 731 N.E.2d 1075.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Elimination of the Music Director</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first decide whether Lewis established a prima facie case, mindful that the purpose of doing so is to eliminate the \"most common nondiscriminatory reasons\" for an employment decision, from which a fact finder might reasonably conclude that the employer made its decision because of race. <i>Id.</i> at 116, 731 N.E.2d 1075. As Lewis was terminated as part of a district-wide reduction in force, he must show by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class under chapter 151B; (2) he performed his job satisfactorily; (3) he was terminated; and (4) the City did not treat race neutrally in making its decision to terminate him or retained personnel outside of his protected class in the same position. <i>LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 6 F.3d 836, 842 (1st Cir.1993); <i>cf. Wheatley v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,</i> 418 Mass. 394, 397, 636 N.E.2d 265 (1994) (\"It is our practice to apply Federal case law construing the Federal anti-discrimination statutes in interpreting G.L. c. 151B.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that Lewis has established the first three elements; the battleground then is in the fourth prong. On appeal, for the first time, Lewis attempts to demonstrate that the City did not treat race neutrally in deciding whom to terminate by arguing that the lay-offs were statistically out of line with the overall racial makeup of the BPS workforce. <i>See, e.g., Lipchitz v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 434 Mass. 493, 508-09, 751 N.E.2d 360 (2001) (holding that statistical evidence may support an inference that a particular decision was made because of discriminatory animus); <i>Smith College v. MCAD,</i> 376 Mass. 221, 228 n. 9, 380 N.E.2d 121 (1978) (\"In a proper case, gross statistical disparities alone may constitute prima facie proof of a practice of discrimination.\"). Because Lewis failed to raise this theory below, we deem it forfeited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Higgins v. New Balance</i> <i>Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 252, 258 (1st Cir.1999) (\"[A]lthough the court of appeals affords <i>de novo</i> review to orders granting summary judgment, it will not reverse such an order on the basis of arguments [or theories] that were not made in the trial court.\"); <i>Utica Mutual Ins. Co. v. Weathermark Investments, Inc.,</i> 292 F.3d 77, 80-82 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see generally,</i> Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra</i> note 7, &#167; 2716, at 282. Lewis also contends that \"only black Senior Program Directors were laid off,\" from which a jury could infer that the City targeted him because of race. But Lewis was the <i>only</i> Senior Program Director in the Curriculum Department to be terminated; the remaining three African-American Senior Program Directors retained their positions. We fail to see how a jury could reasonably infer that the City targeted Lewis due to his race merely because he was the one Senior Program Director, out of ten, who was terminated. <i>Cf. LeBlanc,</i> 6 F.3d at 844 (\"We ... question whether a company can be said not to treat age neutrally as a matter of law merely because two of the three people it discharges pursuant to a reduction in force belong to the protected class. A sample of three is a small number from which to draw deductions of this sort.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis also relies on the City's retention of the other Senior Program Directors who were not in his protected class.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Lewis points to no convincing evidence that shows how the positions held by the other directors may reasonably be considered the same as the position that Lewis held. Lewis himself testified that \"there's no comparable position\" to his former position, unless the City were \"to make a position [of] Director of Fine Arts,... but &#8212; right now, that position doesn't exist....\" In any event, the record emphasizes the differences, not the similarities, between the positions. Each Senior Program Director was responsible for a specific academic discipline: English, which included two directors (one for elementary and one for secondary education), math, science, history, world languages, music, art, physical education, and health. The duties and responsibilities of each of the directors were defined by the specific academic discipline to which they were assigned. Within an assigned discipline, the director established and implemented performance standards, curriculum guidelines, and professional development programs, and supported teachers throughout the BPS. Smith also testified, uncontroverted by Lewis, that the City disregards seniority when instituting a reduction in force within the Curriculum Department because the City does not view the Senior Program Director positions as being of similar character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis makes much of the fact that the Arts and Music Director positions had the same personnel grade and salary and were listed on a single job posting. Although true, Lewis ignores significant differences. The Arts Director covered three subject areas: visual arts, theater, and dance. Among other things, she supported 151 art teachers, established and implemented the Arts and Education Policy for the BPS, coordinated programs with the Museum of Fine Arts, and coordinated after-school and other programs not coordinated by the Music Director. On this record, no fact finder could reasonably conclude that any of the other directors were in the same position as Lewis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying upon <i>Flebotte v. Dow Jones &amp; Co.,</i> 51 F.Supp.2d 36, 40 (D.Mass. 1999), Lewis attempts to avoid our inevitable conclusion by asserting that the City's delegation of his duties to other individuals not in his protected class amounted to retaining individuals in the same position. We disagree. The purpose of the prima facie case is to identify those circumstances where the employer's actions, if left unexplained, are more likely than not based on unlawful discrimination. In the typical reduction in force case, the employer's actions have already been explained, as the reduction in force is itself a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the lay-offs. And as recognized by the district court, \"in a reduction in force situation, a company generally reorganizes its workforce and reassigns responsibilities to reduce headcount and save money.\" <i>Lewis v. City of Boston,</i> No. CIV. A. 00-11548, 2002 WL 523910, at *5 (D.Mass. March 29, 2002). Merely demonstrating that, as a result of the reduction in force, the employer consolidated positions or allocated duties of discharged employees to other existing employees does not itself raise a reasonable inference that the employer harbored discriminatory animus toward any one employee. Accepting Lewis's argument \"would render meaningless the fourth requirement of the prima facie case\" under <i>LeBlanc. Id.</i> We are careful <i>not</i> to suggest, however, that an employer may mask unlawful discrimination by simply transferring all of an employee's duties to another employee during a reduction in force. Rather, we are saying that the employee must come forward with something more than evidence of the inevitable transfer of his or her responsibilities to existing employees. This Lewis has failed to do.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Lewis for the first time contends that his position was not, in fact, eliminated, reasoning that the duties of the Roland Hayes Director were merely added to the position he formerly held. This argument is unavailing. The evidence in the record, adduced by both the City and Lewis, leaves beyond question that the City eliminated the Music Director position from the Curriculum Department and consolidated the duties of that position with that of the former Roland Hayes Director and the Arts Director. There simply is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether his position was eliminated. We hold therefore that Lewis failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to assume <i>arguendo</i> that Lewis satisfied his prima facie burden, we would still affirm. The City proffered a number of legitimate reasons why it chose Lewis's position for elimination during its search for additional funds for transition programs in literacy and mathematics and to prepare students for the MCAS tests. Smith, who made the decision, testified that the Music Director position was the natural candidate for elimination in his Department because music was not a priority subject area<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>; aside from English, the Arts was the only subject area that had two Senior Program Directors; and the duties of the Music Director could be easily transferred to the Arts Director and the Roland Hayes position, which would result in one less person doing the work. In addition, transferring district-wide duties to the Roland Hayes position and creating a new Director position that was under the supervision of the Deputy Superintendent would achieve the City's goal of raising the status and visibility of the Roland Hayes position. The City's reasons sufficiently dispel any taint of racial discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the thin evidence Lewis relies upon to satisfy his prima facie case, Lewis presented no evidence to support a reasonable inference that any of the reasons given by the City were false. That evidence does not by itself even suggest that the reasons advanced by the City were a pretext for discrimination. The City's decision to discharge Lewis is not actionable under chapter 151B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Failure to hire for the Roland Hayes position</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Lewis relies on indirect evidence of racial discrimination. To establish a prima facie case, Lewis must establish that (1) he is a member of a protected class under 151B; (2) he applied for an open position; (3) he was not hired; and (4) the City sought to fill the position with individuals who had qualifications similar to his. <i>Wynn &amp; Wynn v. MCAD,</i> 431 Mass. 655, 666 n. 22, 729 N.E.2d 1068 (2000). The district court held that Lewis failed to establish a prima facie case because he was not qualified, as he lacked a master's degree and school-based management experience. Lewis responds that there exists a genuine issue as to whether he was qualified, pointing out that the City appointed him as Music Director in 1995, which required a master's degree, and invited him to interview for the second posting, even though the qualifications for the position had not changed and he still did not have a master's degree. We will assume, without deciding, that Lewis has satisfied his prima facie burden, and turn to the second stage of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> paradigm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it important to review each posting separately, not only because Lewis raises distinct challenges to each of them, but also because doing so exposes the lack of substance to his claims. Lewis does not challenge the first committee's decision not to select him, conceding at oral argument that the first selection committee, which included three African-Americans, did not discriminate against him based upon his race. Instead, Lewis contends that the City, because of his race, stacked that committee with two members, Winfrey and Ruth Howe<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>, both African-Americans, who it knew were biased against him and would not select him. This is mere conjecture. Although there is evidence that Smith, Knowles, and Payzant knew that Lewis and Winfrey had conflicts in the past over Roland Hayes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> not one of them selected the committee members. The committee members were selected by the Deputy Superintendent, Amalle Cudiero Nelson, who also chaired the first committee. Not only has Lewis failed to present any evidence that Nelson knew that any of the members of the committee were biased against him, but, more significantly, he has also failed to show that Nelson otherwise, because of his race, stacked the committee against him. Given Lewis's concession that the committee did not discriminate against him due to his race, we will proceed to the second posting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell at length on the second posting as we find that Lewis has failed to adduce any evidence even suggesting that he was not hired due to his race. The City adduced ample evidence that Lewis took himself out of contention for the position: it is uncontested that Lewis failed to appear for the scheduled interview. Nevertheless, Lewis points out that after failing to show for the scheduled interview, he sent a facsimile to the City's Human Resources Director, with a copy to Knowles, requesting that the interview be rescheduled. While the Director did not reschedule, there is absolutely no evidence remotely suggesting that the City, through its Human Resources Director, failed to reschedule his interview because of his race. In any event, even more telling of a lack of discriminatory animus, the City offered the position to an African-American, a person in Lewis's protected class. Based on this record, a jury could not reasonably conclude that the City failed to hire him because of his race.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. First Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis also claims that the City deprived him of his First Amendment rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> by retaliating against him for his statements to the press in 1997 and 1999 and to members of the City Council in 1998 and 1999.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> To prevail on his claim, as a public employee, Lewis must establish that (1) his expression involved matters of public concern; (2) his interest in commenting upon those matters outweighed the City's interests in the efficient performance of its public services; and (3) his protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the City's adverse employment actions. <i>Mullin v. Town of Fairhaven,</i> 284 F.3d 31, 37-38 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 147-48, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968)); <i>Nethersole v. Bulger,</i> 287 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.2002). The first two prongs are questions of law and thus are subject to de novo review, whereas the third prong is generally for the fact finder to decide. <i>Nethersole,</i> 287 F.3d at 19; <i>O'Connor v. Steeves,</i> 994 F.2d 905, 913 (1st Cir.1993). If Lewis succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, the burden of persuasion shifts to the City to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Lewis's position would have been eliminated \"even in the absence of the protected conduct.\" <i>Mt. Healthy,</i> 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City does not challenge the district court's ruling in favor of Lewis on the first two prongs; we therefore proceed to the third prong. Lewis is not required to come forward with direct evidence (the so-called smoking gun) that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor, but rather, as in other contexts where motivation is an issue, he can rely upon circumstantial evidence. Having considered the briefs and thoroughly reviewed the entire record, we agree with the district court that Lewis failed to adduce any evidence suggesting that his speech played a substantial or motivating role in the City's decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish the essential nexus, Lewis stresses the temporal proximity between his public statements to the press and to City Council members and the City's decision to eliminate his position. Lewis also notes that Smith told him that Payzant was very upset after Lewis shared his proposal with a City Councilor in 1998. From these facts, Lewis believes that a jury could conclude that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the City's decision. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"`close temporal proximity between two events <i>may</i> give rise to an inference of causal connection,'\" <i>Nethersole,</i> 287 F.3d at 20 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp.,</i> 144 F.3d 151, 168 (1st Cir.1998)), that inference is \"not necessarily conclusive\" where, as in this case, the inference is considerably weakened by other facts in the record, <i>Hodgens,</i> 144 F.3d at 170. Here, Lewis started his public advocacy for more funding for music programs in 1997, over a year and a half before he was terminated, a fact that seriously undermines his temporal proximity argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Moreover, after reviewing Lewis's public statements, we doubt that a fact finder could reasonably conclude that they were in any way critical of the City or its supervisors; Lewis merely commented on the need for more funding and his desire to revive instrumental music instruction. In any event, we find no evidence that any of his supervisors, including Smith, who made the decision to eliminate Lewis's position, were anything but supportive of his comments. After his statements appeared in the 1997 <i>Boston Herald,</i> the City promoted Lewis from acting to permanent Music Director, encouraged him to start a parent advocacy group, and assisted him in gaining access to the musical instruments at Roland Hayes. Indeed, Lewis testified that he discussed the <i>Boston Globe</i> article with Payzant because, at the time, Payzant was assisting Lewis in distributing instruments throughout the City, the goal that Lewis was quoted as trying to achieve. And it was the City, through its press office, that directed the <i>Boston Globe</i> reporter to Lewis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more significant, the inference carried by the temporal proximity between his statements in 1999 and the decision to terminate him dissipates when consideration is given to the attendant circumstances. The City adduced ample evidence that Lewis's position was eliminated along with thirty-one others during a reduction in force resulting from the impending MCAS tests. Lewis presented no credible evidence demonstrating that the reasons advanced by the City were pretexts from which a fact finder could infer discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also unconvinced that Smith's alleged statement that Payzant was very upset sufficiently links Lewis's protected activity to the decision to terminate him. The record evidence does not suggest that Smith, the person who decided to eliminate the position, shared Payzant's claimed view or that he was concerned with anything beyond protocol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were we to assume that Lewis met his prima facie burden on such thin circumstantial evidence, he could not avoid summary judgment because the City sufficiently established the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense. We find that the City demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision regardless of Lewis's speech. Lewis failed to present evidence, direct or circumstantial, to refute even one of the reasons given by the City. It would be pure conjecture to conclude that the City would have made a different decision in the absence of Lewis's comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that Lewis has failed to meet his burden of adducing sufficient facts to survive a motion of summary judgment on both his First Amendment and Chapter 151B claims, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By 1995, except in a few schools, the BPS had eliminated instrumental music instruction.

The record demonstrates that Lewis believed that, aside from failing to rectify his workspace complaints, the City, because of Lewis's race, engaged in the other so-called retaliatory actions since 1995. As to the City's failure to respond to his workspace complaints, we seriously doubt whether it constitutes a sufficient adverse employment action for First Amendment purposes; but even if it does, we find no evidence linking his 1997 statements to the City's lack of response to his complaints.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Lewis (\"Lewis\") brought this action against the City of Boston (\"City\"), claiming that the City first discharged him and then failed to hire him for a newly created position because of his race in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1) and because of his public statements regarding inadequate funding for the City's music programs in violation of the First Amendment. The district court granted summary judgment in the City's favor. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Lewis, an African-American male, has been employed by the City in the Boston Public Schools (\"BPS\") from 1975 through the present, and served as city-wide Music Director from 1995 through August 1999. The City initially employed Lewis as a music instructor from 1975 to August 18, 1995, at which time the City appointed him as acting Music Director; on January 15, 1998, the City appointed him as permanent Music Director. As Music Director, Lewis was responsible for implementing and developing policy relating to music education, overseeing music curriculum development, supporting ninety-two music teachers, conducting inventories of musical instruments, organizing the Martin Luther King, Jr. celebration, and serving as liaison between the BPS and various music organizations in the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Music Director was one of ten Senior Program Directors in the Department of Curriculum and Instructional Practices (\"Curriculum Department\"), all of whom reported to the Director of the Department, Sid Smith (\"Smith\"), a white male. Smith reported directly to Timothy Knowles (\"Knowles\"), Deputy Superintendent for Teaching and Learning. In 1999, of these ten directors, four were African-American, one was Asian, and five were white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his tenure as Music Director, Lewis was a public advocate for increased funding for music education, particularly instrumental music instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In a November 25, 1997 article, the <i>Boston Herald</i> reported that Lewis desired to expand instrumental music instruction and that to do so he proposed hiring new music instructors to travel among elementary and middle schools. Sometime in 1998, Lewis reduced this proposal to writing and shared it with a City Councilor. The proposal stressed that the City was in non-compliance with its own Arts Policy by not offering instrumental music instruction. To come within compliance, the proposal recommended that the City hire twenty new teachers at an approximate cost of $1,000,000, as part of a revived Itinerant Music Program. Lewis did not speak to his supervisors before sharing his written proposal with the City Councilor. According to Lewis, shortly thereafter, Smith told Lewis that the Superintendent, Thomas Payzant, was very upset with Lewis for speaking to the City Councilor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Smith also testified that he expressed his concern that Lewis should think about whether he was violating established protocol by talking to city council members about budget-related matters without first consulting Payzant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis was also quoted in a February 1, 1999 <i>Boston Globe</i> article. The City's press office had directed the <i>Boston Globe</i> reporter to Lewis. The article reported that instruments lay dormant in a warehouse, many of which had \"rotted in the eight years since funding for instrumental music instruction was eliminated from the city's school budget.\" The article did not reveal, and Lewis did not know, the source of this information. Lewis was quoted as stating that the school system was trying to inform teachers of the existence and location of the instruments. The article also discussed Lewis's desire to revive the Itinerant Music Program. Lewis discussed the article with Smith and Payzant, and neither of them expressed any negative comments. In March 1999, with Payzant present, Lewis addressed a City Council hearing, discussing the need for greater funding for music programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late spring of 1999, the City instituted a system-wide reduction in force to fund transition programs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> in literacy and mathematics, and to prepare students for the impending Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests (\"MCAS\"). Smith decided, with the approval of Knowles and Payzant, to eliminate the Music Director position and to spread Lewis's duties to other positions. The reorganization contemplated the creation of a new position, which consolidated the bulk of the Music Director duties with the day-to-day school responsibilities held by the Director of the Roland Hayes Division of Music<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>, who would report directly to Knowles, rather than to Smith, as Lewis did. The Arts Director would assume the remaining responsibilities. By letter dated May 14, 1999, Payzant notified Lewis that the City was eliminating his position due to budget cuts. In addition to eliminating Lewis's position, the City terminated thirty-one other relatively high-level, supervisory employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City posted the revised Roland Hayes position three times. Qualified candidates were required to have a master's degree and school-based management experience. The City formed a screening committee that reviewed applications and selected qualified candidates for interviews. A diverse group, the screening committee consisted of three African-Americans, one Hispanic, and one white. Although Lewis did not have a master's degree, he applied for the position, but was not selected for an interview. Instead, the City selected four candidates for interviews, including three African-Americans, all with the requisite master's degree and school-based management experience. The City did not hire any of the candidates, re-posted the position, and decided to keep Greg Gozzola, the teacher who had been filling in for Winfrey, as acting Director of Roland Hayes for the following academic year. Some of the district-wide responsibilities formerly held by Lewis were assumed by the Arts Director, Kathy Tosolini (\"Tosolini\"), a white female, and the remainder, such as the Martin Luther King, Jr. celebration, were assumed by other employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, the City re-posted the position, but reduced the district-wide responsibilities; Tosolini and others continued to cover those functions. Even though Lewis still did not have a master's degree,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the City mailed to him a written invitation to interview and called him to confirm on the morning it was scheduled. Lewis failed to appear for the interview, claiming that he never received the invitation and that by the time he received the call, he had a prior commitment. His interview was not rescheduled. Ultimately, the City offered the position to an African-American, but he declined. The position was re-posted, and remained unfilled at the time of the district court's summary judgment ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis filed this civil suit against the City, alleging that, by eliminating his position and failing to hire him for the Roland Hayes position, the City retaliated against him for his public statements in violation of the First Amendment and because of his race in violation of Mass.

If the City meets its burden, the presumption of discrimination disappears.

As Lewis was terminated as part of a district-wide reduction in force, he must show by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class under chapter 151B; (2) he performed his job satisfactorily; (3) he was terminated; and (4) the City did not treat race neutrally in making its decision to terminate him or retained personnel outside of his protected class in the same position. <i>LeBlanc v.

Lewis himself testified that \"there's no comparable position\" to his former position, unless the City were \"to make a position [of] Director of Fine Arts,... but &#8212; right now, that position doesn't exist....\" In any event, the record emphasizes the differences, not the similarities, between the positions. Each Senior Program Director was responsible for a specific academic discipline: English, which included two directors (one for elementary and one for secondary education), math, science, history, world languages, music, art, physical education, and health. The duties and responsibilities of each of the directors were defined by the specific academic discipline to which they were assigned. Within an assigned discipline, the director established and implemented performance standards, curriculum guidelines, and professional development programs, and supported teachers throughout the BPS. Smith also testified, uncontroverted by Lewis, that the City disregards seniority when instituting a reduction in force within the Curriculum Department because the City does not view the Senior Program Director positions as being of similar character.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis makes much of the fact that the Arts and Music Director positions had the same personnel grade and salary and were listed on a single job posting. Although true, Lewis ignores significant differences. The Arts Director covered three subject areas: visual arts, theater, and dance. Among other things, she supported 151 art teachers, established and implemented the Arts and Education Policy for the BPS, coordinated programs with the Museum of Fine Arts, and coordinated after-school and other programs not coordinated by the Music Director. On this record, no fact finder could reasonably conclude that any of the other directors were in the same position as Lewis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying upon <i>Flebotte v. Dow Jones &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2496914\"><a href=\"/opinion/2496914/flebotte-v-dow-jones-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (D.Mass. 1999), Lewis attempts to avoid our inevitable conclusion by asserting that the City's delegation of his duties to other individuals not in his protected class amounted to retaining individuals in the same position. We disagree. The purpose of the prima facie case is to identify those circumstances where the employer's actions, if left unexplained, are more likely than not based on unlawful discrimination. In the typical reduction in force case, the employer's actions have already been explained, as the reduction in force is itself a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the lay-offs. And as recognized by the district court, \"in a reduction in force situation, a company generally reorganizes its workforce and reassigns responsibilities to reduce headcount and save money.\" <i>Lewis v. City of Boston,</i> No. CIV. A. 00-11548, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">523910</span></span>, at *5 (D.Mass. March 29, 2002). Merely demonstrating that, as a result of the reduction in force, the employer consolidated positions or allocated duties of discharged employees to other existing employees does not itself raise a reasonable inference that the employer harbored discriminatory animus toward any one employee. Accepting Lewis's argument \"would render meaningless the fourth requirement of the prima facie case\" under <i>LeBlanc. Id.</i> We are careful <i>not</i> to suggest, however, that an employer may mask unlawful discrimination by simply transferring all of an employee's duties to another employee during a reduction in force. Rather, we are saying that the employee must come forward with something more than evidence of the inevitable transfer of his or her responsibilities to existing employees. This Lewis has failed to do.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Lewis for the first time contends that his position was not, in fact, eliminated, reasoning that the duties of the Roland Hayes Director were merely added to the position he formerly held. This argument is unavailing. The evidence in the record, adduced by both the City and Lewis, leaves beyond question that the City eliminated the Music Director position from the Curriculum Department and consolidated the duties of that position with that of the former Roland Hayes Director and the Arts Director. There simply is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether his position was eliminated. We hold therefore that Lewis failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to assume <i>arguendo</i> that Lewis satisfied his prima facie burden, we would still affirm. The City proffered a number of legitimate reasons why it chose Lewis's position for elimination during its search for additional funds for transition programs in literacy and mathematics and to prepare students for the MCAS tests. Smith, who made the decision, testified that the Music Director position was the natural candidate for elimination in his Department because music was not a priority subject area<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>; aside from English, the Arts was the only subject area that had two Senior Program Directors; and the duties of the Music Director could be easily transferred to the Arts Director and the Roland Hayes position, which would result in one less person doing the work. In addition, transferring district-wide duties to the Roland Hayes position and creating a new Director position that was under the supervision of the Deputy Superintendent would achieve the City's goal of raising the status and visibility of the Roland Hayes position. The City's reasons sufficiently dispel any taint of racial discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond the thin evidence Lewis relies upon to satisfy his prima facie case, Lewis presented no evidence to support a reasonable inference that any of the reasons given by the City were false. That evidence does not by itself even suggest that the reasons advanced by the City were a pretext for discrimination. The City's decision to discharge Lewis is not actionable under chapter 151B.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Failure to hire for the Roland Hayes position</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Lewis relies on indirect evidence of racial discrimination. To establish a prima facie case, Lewis must establish that (1) he is a member of a protected class under 151B; (2) he applied for an open position; (3) he was not hired; and (4) the City sought to fill the position with individuals who had qualifications similar to his. <i>Wynn &amp; Wynn v. MCAD,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></span>, 666 n. 22, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></span> (2000). The district court held that Lewis failed to establish a prima facie case because he was not qualified, as he lacked a master's degree and school-based management experience. Lewis responds that there exists a genuine issue as to whether he was qualified, pointing out that the City appointed him as Music Director in 1995, which required a master's degree, and invited him to interview for the second posting, even though the qualifications for the position had not changed and he still did not have a master's degree. We will assume, without deciding, that Lewis has satisfied his prima facie burden, and turn to the second stage of the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> paradigm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it important to review each posting separately, not only because Lewis raises distinct challenges to each of them, but also because doing so exposes the lack of substance to his claims. Lewis does not challenge the first committee's decision not to select him, conceding at oral argument that the first selection committee, which included three African-Americans, did not discriminate against him based upon his race. Instead, Lewis contends that the City, because of his race, stacked that committee with two members, Winfrey and Ruth Howe<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>, both African-Americans, who it knew were biased against him and would not select him. This is mere conjecture. Although there is evidence that Smith, Knowles, and Payzant knew that Lewis and Winfrey had conflicts in the past over Roland Hayes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> not one of them selected the committee members. The committee members were selected by the Deputy Superintendent, Amalle Cudiero Nelson, who also chaired the first committee. Not only has Lewis failed to present any evidence that Nelson knew that any of the members of the committee were biased against him, but, more significantly, he has also failed to show that Nelson otherwise, because of his race, stacked the committee against him. Given Lewis's concession that the committee did not discriminate against him due to his race, we will proceed to the second posting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not dwell at length on the second posting as we find that Lewis has failed to adduce any evidence even suggesting that he was not hired due to his race. The City adduced ample evidence that Lewis took himself out of contention for the position: it is uncontested that Lewis failed to appear for the scheduled interview. Nevertheless, Lewis points out that after failing to show for the scheduled interview, he sent a facsimile to the City's Human Resources Director, with a copy to Knowles, requesting that the interview be rescheduled. While the Director did not reschedule, there is absolutely no evidence remotely suggesting that the City, through its Human Resources Director, failed to reschedule his interview because of his race. In any event, even more telling of a lack of discriminatory animus, the City offered the position to an African-American, a person in Lewis's protected class. Based on this record, a jury could not reasonably conclude that the City failed to hire him because of his race.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. First Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lewis also claims that the City deprived him of his First Amendment rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> by retaliating against him for his statements to the press in 1997 and 1999 and to members of the City Council in 1998 and 1999.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> To prevail on his claim, as a public employee, Lewis must establish that (1) his expression involved matters of public concern; (2) his interest in commenting upon those matters outweighed the City's interests in the efficient performance of its public services; and (3) his protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the City's adverse employment actions. <i>Mullin v.

Lewis is not required to come forward with direct evidence (the so-called smoking gun) that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor, but rather, as in other contexts where motivation is an issue, he can rely upon circumstantial evidence. Having considered the briefs and thoroughly reviewed the entire record, we agree with the district court that Lewis failed to adduce any evidence suggesting that his speech played a substantial or motivating role in the City's decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To establish the essential nexus, Lewis stresses the temporal proximity between his public statements to the press and to City Council members and the City's decision to eliminate his position. Lewis also notes that Smith told him that Payzant was very upset after Lewis shared his proposal with a City Councilor in 1998. From these facts, Lewis believes that a jury could conclude that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the City's decision. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"`close temporal proximity between two events <i>may</i> give rise to an inference of causal connection,'\" <i>Nethersole,</i> 287 F.3d at 20 (emphasis added) (quoting <i>Hodgens v.

Here, Lewis started his public advocacy for more funding for music programs in 1997, over a year and a half before he was terminated, a fact that seriously undermines his temporal proximity argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Moreover, after reviewing Lewis's public statements, we doubt that a fact finder could reasonably conclude that they were in any way critical of the City or its supervisors; Lewis merely commented on the need for more funding and his desire to revive instrumental music instruction. In any event, we find no evidence that any of his supervisors, including Smith, who made the decision to eliminate Lewis's position, were anything but supportive of his comments. After his statements appeared in the 1997 <i>Boston Herald,</i> the City promoted Lewis from acting to permanent Music Director, encouraged him to start a parent advocacy group, and assisted him in gaining access to the musical instruments at Roland Hayes. Indeed, Lewis testified that he discussed the <i>Boston Globe</i> article with Payzant because, at the time, Payzant was assisting Lewis in distributing instruments throughout the City, the goal that Lewis was quoted as trying to achieve. And it was the City, through its press office, that directed the <i>Boston Globe</i> reporter to Lewis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even more significant, the inference carried by the temporal proximity between his statements in 1999 and the decision to terminate him dissipates when consideration is given to the attendant circumstances. The City adduced ample evidence that Lewis's position was eliminated along with thirty-one others during a reduction in force resulting from the impending MCAS tests. Lewis presented no credible evidence demonstrating that the reasons advanced by the City were pretexts from which a fact finder could infer discriminatory animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also unconvinced that Smith's alleged statement that Payzant was very upset sufficiently links Lewis's protected activity to the decision to terminate him.

Healthy</i> defense. We find that the City demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision regardless of Lewis's speech. Lewis failed to present evidence, direct or circumstantial, to refute even one of the reasons given by the City.

We decline the invitation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The position was re-posted and remained open at the time of the district court's rulings. In his appellate brief, Lewis's counsel alleges that Lewis was not hired after the third posting even though he had a master's degree. These facts are not properly before us,<i>see supra</i> note 7, and in any event, there is no evidence in the record providing the details of the hiring process from which an inference of discriminatory animus may be properly drawn.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Lewis also based his claim on the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (\"MCRA\"), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167; 11H-I. Lewis does not appeal the district court's ruling that the City could not be held liable under MCRA because the City is not a \"person\" for purposes of the Act</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We uphold the district court's ruling, unchallenged by the City, that Lewis could bring his First Amendment claim under &#167; 1983, even though Lewis failed to name individual defendants in their personal capacity. The trial court found that the City's \"decision was made as part of the budgetary process and constituted a deliberate policy determination with respect to the structure of the music education program in the public schools,\" and thus the City, through its policy makers &#8212; Payzant, Knowles, and Smith, was the \"moving force behind the decision.\"<i>Lewis v.

Lewis attempts a different course on appeal, alleging that the causal link between his 1997 statements in the<i>Boston Herald</i> and the decision to terminate him remained unbroken, as the City engaged in retaliatory actions by no longer sending him communications regarding music, excluding him from the Arts Policy Committee, denying him an adequate budget, and failing to adequately respond to interferences with his workspace by other employees. The record demonstrates that Lewis believed that, aside from failing to rectify his workspace complaints, the City, because of Lewis's race, engaged in the other so-called retaliatory actions since 1995. As to the City's failure to respond to his workspace complaints, we seriously doubt whether it constitutes a sufficient adverse employment action for First Amendment purposes; but even if it does, we find no evidence linking his 1997 statements to the City's lack of response to his complaints.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
