Appellant is serving a 336-month incarcerative\n\nsentence for two armed carjackings in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2119(1)(1992).        See United States v. Quiñones-Rodriguez, 26 F.3d\n\n213, 220 (1st Cir. 1994)(affirming sentence after a limited remand\n\nfor explanation of upward departure); United States v. Quiñones-\n\nRodriguez,      855   F.

Hickey, 280\n\nF.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 212 (2002), we\n\nconclude that the order denying appellant sentencing relief was\n\npatently correct.          The plain language of Amendment 599 shows that\n\nit does not apply to appellant because appellant was not convicted\n\nof    a     weapons    offense       over     and    above       armed    carjacking.1\n\n\n       1\n        United States v.
