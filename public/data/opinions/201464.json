O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Aurelio Pinero on brief pro se.\n     Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, and Daniel I. Smulow,\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 22, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam. We affirm the judgment substantially for\n\nthe reasons set forth in the district court's decision, Pinero\n\nv. Verdini, 295 F. Supp. 2d 184 (D. Mass. 2003), adding only\n\nthe following comments.        At issue in this habeas petition is\n\nwhether, after a jury convicts on a lesser included offense but\n\ndeadlocks on a greater included offense, retrial of the latter\n\nis   permissible      under   the   Double   Jeopardy       Clause.      The\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court rejected petitioner's argument that\n\nsuch a retrial constitutes a forbidden second prosecution for\n\nthe same offense.       Commonwealth v. Pinero, 49 Mass. App. Ct.\n\n397 (2000).       On habeas review, the question is whether that\n\nruling     \"was    contrary   to,    or   involved     an    unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined\n\nby the Supreme Court of the United States.\"                   28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(d)(1).       Neither of these standards has been met here.\n\n            As the district court explained at greater length,\n\npetitioner was charged in separate indictments with (1) assault\n\nand battery and (2) assault with intent to rape.                      A jury\n\nconvicted him of the former charge but reported that it was\n\nunable to reach a unanimous verdict on the latter.                      With\n\npetitioner's concurrence, a mistrial was declared as to the\n\nlatter charge.      A second trial before a new jury was then held\n\non   the   assault-with-intent-to-rape       charge,    resulting      in   a\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fconviction.       Petitioner was thereafter sentenced to concurrent\n\nprison terms on these two counts.\n\n            The double jeopardy issue arises here only because of\n\na mistaken jury instruction.        Under Massachusetts law, assault\n\nand battery is not a lesser included offense of assault with\n\nintent to rape, since the latter crime does not require proof\n\nof   a   physical    touching.      Yet    at   both    trials   the   judge\n\ninstructed the jury that physical touching was an element of\n\nthat     crime.      As   the    Appeals   Court       concluded,   \"[t]his\n\ninstruction became the law of the case ... and had the effect\n\nof making assault and battery, for purposes of this case only,\n\na lesser included offense of the charge of assault with intent\n\nto rape.\"     49 Mass. App. Ct. at 399.         The Appeals Court ended\n\nup vacating the assault-and-battery conviction as duplicative,\n\nwhile rejecting petitioner's argument that the second trial was\n\nimproper.    See id. (relying on holding in Richardson v. United\n\nStates, 468 U.S. 317 (1984), that retrial following hung jury\n\ndoes not violate double jeopardy).\n\n            In advancing this argument, petitioner has sought\n\nsupport from a pair of Supreme Court decisions involving, not\n\njury deadlock, but jury silence.           In Green v. United States,\n\n355 U.S. 184 (1957), and again in Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S.\n\n323 (1970), the Court confronted the following situation:\n\ngreater and lesser included offenses were presented to the\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fjury; the jury convicted on the lesser but was silent as to the\n\ngreater (by leaving part of the verdict form blank); the\n\nconviction was reversed and the matter remanded for retrial;\n\nand defendant was again tried on both counts (with Green being\n\nconvicted of the greater and Price again being convicted of the\n\nlesser).      In each case, the Court ruled that, for double\n\njeopardy purposes, retrial had to be limited to the lesser\n\noffense.\n\n           As the Price Court noted, this conclusion rested on\n\n\"two premises\":\n\n           First, the Court [in Green] considered the\n           first jury's verdict of guilty on the\n           [lesser charge] to be an \"implicit\n           acquittal\"   on   the  [greater   charge].\n           Second, and more broadly, the Court\n           reasoned that petitioner's jeopardy on the\n           greater charge had ended when the first\n           jury \"was given a full opportunity to\n           return a verdict\" on that charge and\n           instead reached a verdict on the lesser\n           charge.\n\nId. at 328-29 (quoting Green, 355 U.S. at 190-91).   Petitioner\n\ndisclaims any reliance on the \"implicit acquittal\" rationale,\n\nfor an understandable reason: \"[a] jury's express statement\n\nthat it could not agree on a verdict as to the greater offense\n\nobviously precludes the inference that there was an implied\n\nacquittal.\" United States v. Bordeaux, 121 F.3d 1187, 1192 (8th\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f           Instead, petitioner relies on the second \"premise.\"\n\nIn his view, this other rationale is unconnected to any notion\n\nof implicit acquittal; rather, it is said to apply whenever a\n\njury, having had a \"full opportunity\" to return a verdict on\n\nthe greater charge, fails to do so because of jury deadlock\n\n(while convicting on the lesser).       As the district court\n\nobserved, the dearth of relevant authority makes it difficult\n\nto reject this argument outright-–i.e., to conclude that under\n\nno circumstances could the second Green/Price rationale be\n\nconstrued to encompass such a situation.   Yet we think such a\n\nconstruction highly unlikely for reasons explained in the Green\n\nopinion.\n\n           The Court there described its second premise as\n\nfollows:\n\n           But the result in this case need not rest\n           alone on the assumption, which we believe\n           legitimate, that the jury for one reason\n           or another acquitted Green of [the greater\n           offense].     For here, the jury was\n           dismissed without returning any express\n           verdict on that charge and without Green's\n           consent.     Yet it was given a full\n           opportunity to return a verdict and no\n           extraordinary circumstances appeared which\n           prevented it from doing so. Therefore it\n           seems clear, under established principles\n           of former jeopardy, that Green's jeopardy\n           for [the greater offense] came to an end\n           when the jury was discharged so that he\n           could not be retried for that offense.\n           Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684.\n\n\n\n\n                              -5-\n\fGreen, 355 U.S. at 191.       As the citation to Wade suggests, the\n\nCourt's mention of \"established principles\" seems a clear\n\nreference to an earlier part of its opinion, where it stated\n\nthat \"a defendant is placed in jeopardy once he is put to trial\n\nbefore a jury so that if the jury is discharged without his\n\nconsent he cannot be tried again.\"          Id. at 188 (citing Wade).\n\nAnd the Court there immediately took note of an exception to\n\nthat rule: \"jeopardy is not regarded as having come to an end\n\nso as to bar a second trial in those cases where <unforeseeable\n\ncircumstances ... arise during [the first] trial making its\n\ncompletion impossible, such as the failure of a jury to agree\n\non   a   verdict.'\"   Id.    (quoting    Wade,    336    U.S.   at   688-89)\n\n(emphasis added; brackets in original).\n\n            In light of this discussion, the second Green/Price\n\nrationale    is   unlikely    to   apply   to    cases   where   the   jury\n\ndeadlocks on the greater offense but convicts on the lesser.\n\nCf. Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U.S. 101, 112-13 (2003)\n\n(opinion of three Justices so suggesting); Bordeaux, 121 F.3d\n\nat 1190-93 (so holding under mostly comparable circumstances).\n\nFor these reasons, as well as the others recited by the\n\ndistrict court, the state court's decision cannot be said to\n\nhave contravened or unreasonably applied clearly established\n\nfederal law as determined by the Supreme Court.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f",
