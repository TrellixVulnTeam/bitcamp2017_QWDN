Challenges to the Arbitration Panel's Statutory Authority to\n     Issue Prospective Equitable Relief\n\n\n     In the administrative proceedings and before the district\n\ncourt, New Hampshire raised many arguments challenging the scope of\n\nthe arbitration panel's statutory authority to issue prospective\n\nequitable relief, but it has abandoned most of those arguments in\n\nthis appeal.22\n\n     The state does argue in this appeal, as part of its Eleventh\n\nAmendment analysis, that the arbitration panel lacked authority to\n\n\n     21\n          New Hampshire has not argued that the panel could do\nnothing more than declare rights of the private parties and the\nstate, and so has waived the argument.\n     22\n          None of the following five arguments, all of which the\nstate has urged at other stages in this case, are raised in the\nstate's briefs on appeal: (1) that the arbitration panel has no\nremedial power whatsoever because the R-S Act authorizes only the\nhead of the state agency to fashion remedies; (2) that, even if the\narbitration panel had remedial power, that power does not extend to\nordering the state to terminate existing contracts for vending\nbefore those contracts expire; (3) that the arbitration panel is\nnot authorized under the R-S Act, which applies only to federal\nproperty, to issue relief as to state-owned rest areas; (4) that\nthe arbitration panel cannot award any relief at all for violations\nof § 111(b) because there is no private right of action under §\n111(b); and (5) that even if the arbitration panel could issue\nrelief for violations of § 111(b), it cannot issue relief as to\nstate-owned rest areas on toll roads built without federal funding,\nsuch as the Hooksett rest areas. We do not reach any of these\nissues, which have been waived.\n\n                                  -44-\n\fissue    any   relief   at   all   because,   as   a    matter   of   statutory\n\nconstruction, R-S grievance procedures do not apply to § 111(b)\n\nclaims.     To the extent this argument is a free-standing challenge\n\nto the arbitration panel's statutory authority to award prospective\n\nrelief in this case, we reject it.            The state is estopped from\n\nmaking the argument, given its earlier position in 1998 that the\n\nBlind Vendors' § 111(b) claims had to go through R-S grievance\n\nprocedures.\n\n        But even if the state were not estopped, its argument is wrong\n\non the merits.     The R-S Act states that \"[a]ny blind licensee who\n\nis dissatisfied with any action arising from the operation or\n\nadministration of the vending facility program\" may avail himself\n\nor herself of R-S grievance procedures.                20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a)\n\n(emphasis added).       The relevant language, again, of § 111(b) is:\n\n     In permitting the placement of vending machines, the\n     State shall give priority to vending machines which are\n     operated through the State licensing agency designated\n     pursuant to section 2(a)(5) of the Act of June 20, 1936,\n     commonly known as the 'Randolph-Sheppard Act' (20 U.S.C.\n     107a(a)(5)).\n\n\nThe issue is whether the \"vending machines\" to which § 111(b)\n\nrefers are within \"the vending facility program\" described in the\n\nR-S Act, 20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a); if so, R-S grievance procedures\n\napply to § 111(b) claims.\n\n        We answer in the affirmative, based on the plain language of\n\nthe R-S Act and § 111(b).      The R-S Act does not define \"the vending\n\n\n                                     -45-\n\ffacility program.\"      Neither statute expressly states what the\n\nrelationship is between the \"vending machines\" described in §\n\n111(b) and \"the vending facility program\" created by the R-S Act.\n\nNonetheless, the text of § 111(b) is clear that the vending\n\nmachines to be given priority are those \"which are operated through\n\nthe State licensing agency designated pursuant to . . . the\n\n'Randolph-Sheppard Act' . . . .\" Vending machines operated through\n\nSLAs are, by definition, part of the R-S vending program.      They are\n\noperated by blind vendors licensed under the R-S Act, see 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 107a(b) (licensees must be blind); id. § 107a(a)(5) (licensing\n\nprovisions apply to the operation of vending facilities on state as\n\nwell as federal property), to whom the SLA is required under the R-\n\nS Act to provide vending facility equipment and initial stock,\n\nsee id. § 107b(2).23\n\n     Our   plain-text   reading   makes   sense   from   a   functional\n\nperspective.   It is not surprising, for reasons of efficiency and\n\nconsistency, that Congress would intend R-S grievance procedures to\n\napply when a blind vendor complains that the state failed to\n\n\n     23\n          SLAs sometimes operate vending machines outside the R-S\nAct. For example, in New Hampshire, the Bureau of Blind Services,\nin addition to serving as the designated SLA under the R-S Act,\nperforms other functions in the state, such as conducting general\nvocational training for the blind. See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-\nB:4. Among those functions is the operation of vending machines on\nstate property under the state's \"mini\"-R-S Act. N.H. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. § 186-B:9-15.    But, to the extent that SLAs operate those\nmachines, they do so in their general capacity as agencies of the\nstate, not in their capacity as licensing agencies designated under\nthe R-S Act.\n\n                                  -46-\n\fprovide the SLA priority, whether the vending machine be along the\n\ninterstate   system     or   elsewhere.         If   enforcement    were    not\n\nconsolidated under one system, inconsistencies and unfairness might\n\narise from splitting grievance procedures between the USDOE and the\n\nFederal Highway Administration.\n\n      The state cites, in support of a different argument, a               March\n\n13, 1984 Department of Transportation memorandum providing guidance\n\non   implementing   §   111(b)   (the   \"1984    DOT   Guidelines\").       This\n\nmemorandum states, \"The only application the [R-S Act] has to\n\nSection 111 is to establish the licensing agency in each State that\n\nis to be given priority.         With the exception of rest areas on\n\nFederal lands, none of the [R-S Act] requirements apply to vending\n\nmachines in Interstate rest areas.\"        We read this statement, which\n\ndoes not have the force of a regulation, as being concerned with\n\nthe additional substantive guarantees of the R-S Act: for example,\n\nthe provisions concerning vending income, which do not apply to\n\nvending machines operated under § 111(b).24 The 1984 DOT Guidelines\n\nnever mention the issue of R-S grievance procedures.               And the DOT\n\n\n\n      24\n          The R-S Act provides blind vendors an entitlement to a\npercentage of all income generated by competing vending machines\noperating on federal property whether or not blind vendors operate\nthe machines. 20 U.S.C. § 107d-3. See Comm. of Blind Vendors v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 28 F.3d 130, 131 (D.C. Cir. 1994). We agree\nwith the state that there is no indication that Congress intended\n§ 111(b) of the STA Act to incorporate such a provision or\notherwise to impose such an obligation. This was also the view of\nthe Comptroller General of the United States in a letter dated\nFebruary 28, 1984 to Rep. Kennelly.\n\n                                   -47-\n\fused identical language in a memorandum on October 5, 1992 that\n\nprincipally discusses the application of substantive requirements\n\nof the R-S Act to vending machines in rest areas along interstate\n\nhighways.     It is unlikely that the DOT intended to foreclose\n\napplication of R-S grievance procedures despite the plain language\n\nof the R-S Act and § 111(b).\n\nB.   The Meaning of \"Priority\" in 23 U.S.C. § 111(b)\n\n     The arbitration panel held that \"'priority' requires that\n\n[state licensing agencies] be approached and be given a right of\n\nfirst refusal before any other entity be approached to operate\n\nthese sites.\"        This interpretation of \"priority\" in § 111(b)\n\ninvolves two requirements: a timing requirement and a requirement\n\nthat the right of priority be waived in writing.        First, the panel\n\nheld that priority requires that the SLA \"receive an opportunity to\n\noperate vending machines before any private vendor is even pursued\"\n\n(emphasis original).      Second, it held that \"before [the state]\n\napproaches any other entity to operate machines at rest areas on\n\nthe Interstate Highway System,\" the SLA \"must waive its right to a\n\npriority in writing.\"\n\n     The state argues that the district court erred in upholding\n\nthe arbitration panel's interpretation of \"priority.\" Although the\n\nstate does not differentiate between the two components of priority\n\noutlined by    the   administrative   panel,   the   state   seems   to   be\n\nchallenging both.     It argues that priority under § 111(b) requires\n\n\n                                 -48-\n\fonly that the state confer on the SLA \"an advantage not granted to\n\nany other potential vendor,\" and that its policy of allowing\n\nvending machines at a rest area to be operated through the Bureau\n\nof Blind Services if and only if the Bureau matches the high bid\n\nmeets that definition.\n\n     Our review of the legal meaning of priority in § 111(b) is de\n\nnovo, subject to any applicable principles of deference. Griffiths\n\nv. INS, 243 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2001).25      Examining the two\n\n\n     25\n           The parties dispute the level of deference, if any, owed\nhere. The district court applied Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Res.\nDef. Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), which requires courts to accept,\nin certain circumstances, an agency's reasonable construction of an\nambiguous statute. Id. at 843-44.\n     The state argues that the district court erred in applying\nChevron deference.     The state says, inter alia, that Chevron\ndeference is appropriate only when Congress has delegated authority\nto the agency to implement the statute in question. See 1 Pierce,\nAdministrative Law Treatise § 3.5 (2002) (\"Chevron [deference]\napplies only when an agency adopts a construction of a statute it\nimplements\" because only then has \"Congress explicitly or\nimplicitly assigned to the agency the task of resolving all policy\ndisputes that arise under the statute.\"); cf. Chevron, 467 U.S. at\n844 (\"[C]onsiderable weight should be accorded to an executive\ndepartment's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to\nadminister\" (emphasis added)).     Here, the state says, Congress\nnever delegated authority to interpret the STA Act to the USDOE or\nits arbitration panels. Cf. 23 U.S.C. § 315 (delegating rulemaking\npower to carry out the STA Act to the Secretary of Transportation).\nThe Blind Vendors respond that the state waived this argument in\ndistrict court and that, in any event, Congress did delegate power\nto the federal arbitration panel to interpret § 111(b) because R-S\ngrievance procedures apply to violations of § 111(b).\n     The Blind Vendors also argue that even if Chevron deference\ndoes not apply, the arbitration panel is still entitled to some\ndeference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944),\nbecause of the Department of Education's expertise in administering\nblind vendor programs. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S.\n218, 234 (2001) (applying Skidmore deference based on \"'specialized\nexperience and broader investigations and information' available to\n\n                               -49-\n\fcomponents of the arbitration panel's interpretation of priority in\n\nturn, we   affirm    the   district    court   in   upholding   the   panel's\n\ninterpretation.     Although we recognize that there are potentially\n\na number of other issues that could arise about operation of the\n\npriority system, we confine ourselves to a review of the district\n\ncourt's holding, as those other issues are not before us.             We begin\n\nby looking to the plain language of the statute.            Greebel v. FTP\n\nSoftware, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 192 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     1.    The Timing Requirement\n\n     We turn first to the question whether \"priority\" under §\n\n111(b) requires that the SLA be consulted before other vendors are\n\nconsidered.\n\n     The STA Act does not expressly define the term \"priority,\" and\n\nthe DOT, to which Congress has given rulemaking power to implement\n\n§ 111(b), see 23 U.S.C. § 315, has not issued regulations or\n\ninterpretive rules defining the term.          The state and Blind Vendors\n\nboth cite the same dictionary definition of priority:\n\n     Precedence, going before.      A legal preference or\n     precedence. . . . When two persons have similar rights\n     in respect of the same subject-matter, but one is\n     entitled to exercise his right to the exclusion of the\n\n\nthe agency\").    The state responds that Skidmore deference is\ninappropriate because the arbitrators in this case were not members\nof the Department of Education. Nothing in the record indicates\nthat the arbitrators here had any special expertise in this area.\n     We need not resolve this dispute over the appropriate level of\ndeference because we affirm the district court's decision to uphold\nthe arbitration panel's interpretation, regardless whether any\ndeference applies.\n\n                                -50-\n\f       other, he is said to have priority.\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990).\n\n       The Blind Vendors argue that a priority involves \"precedence\"\n\nand thus requires that the Bureau of Blind Services be offered the\n\ncontract before others.         The state argues based on the same\n\ndefinition that a priority is simply a \"preference\" accorded to\n\nparties that otherwise have \"similar rights\" and thus requires only\n\nthat the STA Act be given some unique advantage in the bidding\n\nprocess, such as the right to the contract if it matches the high\n\nbid.   While the state's argument is plausible, we think that it is\n\ninconsistent with congressional intent.\n\n       Because the plain meaning is not entirely clear, we look to\n\nother sources.      Greebel, 194 F.3d at 192.          One source is a\n\nmemorandum of guidelines issued by the DOT on March 11, 1983,\n\nshortly after the passage of § 111(b) (the \"1983 DOT Guidelines\"),\n\nwhich states:\n\n       Documentation demonstrating a positive initiative to\n       involve the designated Randolph-Sheppard Act State agency\n       will be required before the State highway agency proposes\n       alternative organizations or corporations to operate the\n       vending machines. However, if the designated Randolph-\n       Sheppard Act agency waives its rights in writing, the\n       State highway agency is free to negotiate agreements . .\n       . with any organization or corporation.\n\n\nUnder the 1983 DOT Guidelines, the state must attempt to negotiate\n\nan   agreement   with   the   SLA   before   considering   other   vendors.\n\nAlthough the 1983 DOT Guidelines are not entitled to Chevron\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\fdeference because they are not binding regulations, they have\n\npersuasive authority.    See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S.\n\n218, 234-35 (2001) (applying Skidmore deference to interpretive\n\nrules). If Congress had disagreed with the 1983 DOT Guidelines, it\n\ncould easily have amended § 111(b) at some point in the last twenty\n\nyears to clarify its intent.\n\n     The 1983 DOT Guidelines are consistent with how Congress has\n\nviewed \"priority\" under the R-S Act.   We note at the outset that we\n\nlook to the priority provision of the R-S Act because of its\n\nsimilarity in language and purpose to § 111(b), not because we\n\nthink that it is somehow incorporated in § 111(b).       Although §\n\n111(b) incorporates R-S grievance procedures because, as we have\n\nexplained, the § 111(b) program is part of the \"vending facility\n\nprogram\" under 20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a) of the R-S Act, there is no\n\nlanguage in the STA Act or the R-S Act indicating that § 111(b)\n\nnecessarily incorporates the R-S Act's \"priority\" provision, 20\n\nU.S.C. § 107(b).   Section 111(b)'s only reference to the R-S Act is\n\nto 20 U.S.C. § 107a, which is an entirely different section from\n\nthat containing the priority provision.\n\n     Instead, our reason for looking to the R-S Act is that\n\nCongress uses the term \"priority\" in the R-S Act in a manner almost\n\nidentical to its use of the term in § 111(b).   Compare 23 U.S.C. §\n\n111(b) (\"In permitting the placement of vending machines, the state\n\nshall give priority to vending machines which are operated through\n\n\n                                -52-\n\fthe State licensing agency designated pursuant to . . . the\n\n'Randolph-Sheppard Act' . . . .\"), with 20 U.S.C. § 107(b) (\"In\n\nauthorizing    the   operation   of   vending   facilities    on   Federal\n\nproperty, priority shall be given to blind persons licensed by a\n\nState agency as provided in this chapter . . . .\").          This parallel\n\nlanguage was not accidental. Congress was clearly aware of the R-S\n\nAct in drafting § 111(b), given that § 111(b) directly references\n\nthe R-S Act.    Where Congress uses the same term in the same way in\n\ntwo statutes with closely related goals, basic canons of statutory\n\nconstruction suggest a presumption that Congress intended the term\n\nto have the same meaning in both contexts.      See Sullivan v. Stroop,\n\n496 U.S. 478, 484 (1990) (applying the \"normal rule of statutory\n\nconstruction that identical words used in different parts of the\n\nsame act are intended to have the same meaning\" to a single term\n\nused in two separate, but related, statutes (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)).\n\n     This presumption can be rebutted when there is some indication\n\nthat the term is intended to serve different purposes in each\n\nstatute, see Gen. Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, 124 S. Ct.\n\n1236, 1245 (2004), but we see no basis for that conclusion here.\n\nThe state relies on the 1984 DOT Guidelines, which state that\n\n\"[t]he only application the [R-S Act] has to Section 111 is to\n\nestablish the licensing agency in each State that is to be given\n\npriority.\"     This statement, however, indicates only that the DOT\n\n\n                                  -53-\n\fdoes not see § 111(b) as incorporating the substantive provisions\n\nof the R-S Act.   As we have said, our reliance on the use of the\n\nterm \"priority\" in the R-S Act is not based on a belief that §\n\n111(b) necessarily incorporates the priority provisions of the R-S\n\nAct.    The 1984 DOT Guidelines tell us nothing about the issue at\n\nhand: whether the priority provisions of the R-S Act and § 111(b)\n\nhave different purposes.26\n\n\n       26\n          The state also presents several other arguments that the\npriority provisions of the R-S Act and § 111(b) serve different\npurposes. First, the state argues that the R-S Act's use of the\nterm is \"specifically limited to the section describing the\nSecretary's authority to proscribe [sic] regulations regarding this\nsubsection.\" This contention is refuted by the plain language of\n§ 107(b), in which Congress expressly created the priority\nrequirement in addition to giving the Secretary rulemaking powers\nto enforce that requirement.\n     Second, the state urges us to infer from Congress's failure to\nexpressly incorporate the priority provisions of the R-S Act into\nthe STA Act that Congress intended the two priority provisions to\nhave different purposes. We see no basis for such an inference.\nCourts regularly presume words in closely related statutes to have\nthe same meaning where Congress has declined to expressly\nincorporate one statute's interpretation of the term into the\nother. See, e.g., Vectra Fitness, Inc. v. TNWK Corp., 162 F.3d\n1379, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (\"[I]t cannot be presumed that the\n[same] term has two different meanings in these closely related\nstatutes.\"); United States v. Thomas, 932 F.2d 1085, 1088 (5th Cir.\n1991) (\"[W]e normally impart the same meaning to the same phrase\nthroughout related statutes . . . .\").\n     Third, taking out of context language from Sentinel\nCommunications Co. v. Watts, 936 F.2d 1189 (11th Cir. 1991), the\nstate argues that § 111(b), unlike the R-S Act, is merely a\ndelegating statute that \"does not purport to authorize any type of\nscheme, discretionary or not, for the substantive regulation of\nvending machines at interstate rest areas\" (emphasis in original).\nInstead, the state suggests, § 111(b) leaves the task of defining\nthe precise contours of priority entirely to the states.         We\ndisagree.     Congress expressly created a federal priority\nrequirement, and there is no indication that Congress intended to\ncreate state-by-state variations.    The state misreads Sentinel.\n\n                               -54-\n\f     We turn to the use of \"priority\" in § 107(b) of the R-S Act.\n\nThe R-S Act does not define \"priority,\" and the Department of\n\nEducation,   which   is    authorized    to   promulgate       regulations      to\n\nimplement the R-S Act, see 20 U.S.C. § 107(b), has not defined the\n\nterm in its regulations.         But the legislative history of the R-S\n\nAct is clear that Congress intended \"priority\" to signify more than\n\na   mere   preference.      Before    1974,   the       R-S   Act    provided    a\n\n\"preference\"   rather     than   a   \"priority\"    to    blind      vendors:    \"In\n\nauthorizing the operation of vending stands on Federal property,\n\npreference shall be given, so far as feasible, to blind persons\n\nlicensed by a State agency as provided in this chapter . . . .\"                 20\n\nU.S.C. § 107 (1970) (repealed 1974).          This changed in 1974, when\n\nCongress determined that \"the program has not developed, and has\n\nnot been sustained, in the manner and spirit in which the Congress\n\nintended.\"     R-S Act Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-516, §\n\n201(1), 88 Stat. 1617, 1622 (1974).               Congress found that \"to\n\n[e]nsure the continued vitality and expansion of the Randolph-\n\nSheppard program,\" it had to \"establish a priority for vending\n\nfacilities operated by blind vendors on Federal property.\"                 Id. §\n\n201(3). To give effect to this amendment, \"priority\" must be\n\n\n\nSentinel held that § 111(b) does not directly impose obligations on\nthe state in the sense that the state can choose not to participate\nin the program by not placing vending machines in interstate rest\nareas. 936 F.2d at 1196. Sentinel did not say that once a state\ndoes choose to participate, § 111(b)'s requirement of priority\nsomehow imposes no obligations.\n\n                                     -55-\n\funderstood to mean something more than the state's definition of\n\nthe term as a simple preference.            \"When Congress acts to amend a\n\nstatute, we presume it intends its amendment to have real and\n\nsubstantial effect.\"       Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Communities\n\nfor a Great Or., 515 U.S. 687, 701 (1995) (quoting Stone v. INS,\n\n514 U.S. 386, 397 (1995)).\n\n       More importantly, the legislative history shows that Congress\n\nspecifically intended the \"priority\" requirement in the R-S Act to\n\ngive blind vendors a prior right to negotiate, through their SLAs,\n\nthe operation of vending facilities on federal property.                  The\n\nSenate Committee Report to the 1974 amendments explained:\n\n       The insertion of the term 'priority' underscores the\n       Committee's expectation that where a vending facility is\n       established on Federal property, it is the obligation of\n       the agency in control of such property, the Secretary of\n       [Health, Education, and Welfare], and the State licensing\n       agency to assure that one or more blind vendors have a\n       prior right to do business on such property, and\n       furthermore that, to the extent that a minority business\n       enterprise or non-blind operated vending machine competes\n       with or otherwise economically injures a blind vendor,\n       every effort must be made to eliminate such competition\n       or injury.\n\nS. Rep. No. 93-937, at 15 (1974) (emphasis in original).           Congress\n\nwas aware of these 1974 amendments to the R-S Act when it enacted\n\n§ 111(b) in 1983.     We note that we see no basis to assume that, by\n\nconferring a prior right to negotiate, Congress intended to give\n\nSLAs    the   right   to   operate   vending     machines   no   matter   how\n\nunreasonable, in light of congressional purposes, their bids may\n\nbe.\n\n                                     -56-\n\f2.     The Waiver Requirement\n\n       The next question is whether the arbitration panel was correct\n\nto interpret \"priority\" as requiring additionally that the state\n\nobtain a written waiver from the Bureau before approaching other\n\nvendors.    We answer that question in the affirmative, finding that\n\na waiver requirement is the interpretation most consistent with\n\nCongress's likely intent.               This waiver requirement operates as a\n\nbargaining chip for the SLA; it does not guarantee a bid will be\n\nsuccessful    even    if    entirely          unreasonable        given   congressional\n\nintent.     See 1983 DOT Guidelines, supra.\n\n       Congress     intended       \"priority\"          to   increase      significantly\n\nopportunities for blind vendors.                 That was certainly true in the\n\nanalogous    context       of    the     R-S    Act.        The    statutory   findings\n\naccompanying the 1974 amendments to the R-S Act, which added the\n\nterm   \"priority\"     to     the    statute,        state     an    intent    to    \"adopt\n\nlegislation    to    [the]       end\"    of    \"doubling      the    number    of    blind\n\noperators on Federal and other property under the Randolph-Sheppard\n\nprograms within the next five years.\"                  R-S Act Amendments of 1974,\n\nPub. L. No. 93-516, § 201(2), 88 Stat. 1617, 1622 (1974).\n\n       Given this intent, it is unlikely that Congress intended\n\n\"priority\" to confer upon SLAs only the right to be approached\n\nbefore states       award       contracts      to   other    vendors.        The    timing\n\nrequirement alone, absent any other protections, would leave states\n\nfree simply to approach their SLAs first, reject their offers, and\n\n\n                                          -57-\n\fthen open      contracts     for     competitive     bidding.        SLAs   would    be\n\nafforded no meaningful priority at all.\n\n       For    similar     reasons,    it    is    also    unlikely   that    Congress\n\nintended \"priority\" to be met by the state's Tie Rule or Match Rule\n\n(which       are,    in   any   event,       inconsistent      with    the        timing\n\nrequirement).        Counsel for the state conceded the ineffectiveness\n\nof the Tie Rule in oral argument, noting that \"the chances of [the\n\nBureau] submitting         exactly     the    same   or    higher    bid    [as   other\n\nvendors] might be vanishingly slim\" in a sealed bidding process.\n\nThe Match Rule is also problematic.               The state has not denied that\n\nthe Bureau of Blind Services simply lacks the resources to match\n\nhigh bids.          In both instances in which the Bureau has bid on\n\ncontracts, it has been significantly outbid by private vendors. In\n\n1997, the winning bid was from Coca-Cola Foods for $84,000; the\n\nBureau bid $7,200.         In 1999, the winning bid was from Good Morning\n\nSales, Inc., for $283,577; the Bureau bid $32,650.                         Thus, as a\n\npractical matter, the Match Rule offers the Bureau no advantage at\n\nall.     Congress created a priority requirement in § 111(b) because\n\nit recognized precisely this problem: that SLAs generally have\n\ndifficulty offering the highest bids in a competitive bidding\n\nprocess.\n\n       Nor do we think that Congress intended to limit priority under\n\n§ 111(b) in a way analogous to the provisions of the R-S Act\n\ngoverning the operation of cafeterias (rather than the placement of\n\n\n                                           -58-\n\fvending facilities).       The R-S Act provides that\n\n     [t]he Secretary [of Education], through the Commissioner,\n     shall prescribe regulations to establish a priority for\n     the operation of cafeterias on Federal property by blind\n     licensees when he determines, on an individual basis and\n     after consultation with the head of the appropriate\n     installation, that such operation can be provided at a\n     reasonable cost with food of a high quality comparable to\n     that currently provided to employees, whether by contract\n     or otherwise.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 107d-3(e).        Had Congress intended to limit § 111(b)\n\npriority similarly, it could easily have done so.              The cafeteria\n\nprovision, § 107d-3(e), was present in the R-S Act at the time\n\nCongress was drafting § 111(b).         See Pub. L. No. 93-516, § 206(e),\n\n88 Stat. 1617, 1627 (1974).         Congress could have drafted § 111(b)\n\nto mirror the language of § 107d-3(e) instead of § 107(b), but it\n\nchose not to.\n\n     We conclude that the arbitration panel's interpretation should\n\nbe upheld because it most closely adheres to Congress's likely\n\nintent in § 111(b).        Our interpretation is reinforced by the 1983\n\nDOT Guidelines, supra, which allow the state to negotiate with\n\nother parties if the SLA signs a written waiver of its priority\n\nrights.\n\n     Our    reading   is    further    bolstered   by   the   fact   that   New\n\nHampshire    itself   seems    to     understand   that   Congress    intends\n\n\"priority\" to impose a waiver requirement.                New Hampshire has\n\nenacted its own mini-R-S Act, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-B:9-15,\n\nwhich offers almost identical vending opportunities to the blind on\n\n\n                                      -59-\n\fstate property as offered on federal property under the R-S Act.\n\nCompare N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-B:9-15, with 20 U.S.C. § 107 et\n\nseq.    Although it does not use the term \"priority,\" § 186-B:13\n\nprovides that\n\n       No person in control of the maintenance, operation and\n       protection of any state property may offer or grant to\n       any other party a contract or concession to operate a\n       vending facility unless:\n\n\n            (a) He has notified blind services and has attempted\n       to make an agreement with blind services for a licensed\n       blind person to operate a vending facility; and\n\n\n            (b) He has determined in good faith that blind\n       services is not willing to establish a vending facility\n       on such property.\n\n\nThe state statute, §§ 186-B:9-15, does not apply to this case only\n\nbecause New Hampshire has exempted interstate highway sites --\n\nsites where New Hampshire needed federal permission to have any\n\nvending facilities at all -- from the statute's coverage. See N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a.            Why New Hampshire carved out an\n\nexception, for property along the interstate highway system, from\n\nits normal adherence to R-S Act standards is unclear.           But, to the\n\nextent that New Hampshire sought to mirror the R-S Act in § 186-\n\nB:9-15,   it   supports   our   view   of   what   New   Hampshire   believes\n\nCongress to mean by \"priority\" under § 107(b) of the R-S Act and\n\nthus under § 111(b) of the STA Act.\n\nC.     Preemption of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a\n\n\n                                   -60-\n\f      The    state      argues,    in   the        alternative,    that      even    if   the\n\narbitration panel was correct about Congress's likely intent as to\n\nthe meaning of priority, an administrative agency cannot find state\n\nlaw preempted unless Congress \"clearly expressed\" an intent to\n\npreempt state law.            Because no such clear expression is present in\n\n§ 111(b), the state argues that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a is\n\nnot preempted.\n\n      This argument is based on a mistaken understanding of the law\n\nof preemption.           New Hampshire's obligations under § 111(b) are\n\ndefined     by     federal      law.         New    Hampshire     may     pass      statutes\n\nimplementing          particular       procedures       for     carrying       out      those\n\nobligations, as N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a does.                          But to the\n\nextent      that      those     state    laws       directly      conflict       with     the\n\nrequirements of federal law, the Supremacy Clause requires that\n\nthey be given no effect.           See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505\n\nU.S. 504, 516 (1992) (citing U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2).                            This is\n\ntrue even in the absence of an express congressional statement of\n\nan   intent      to    preempt.        Id.    (\"In    the   absence     of    an     express\n\ncongressional command, state law is pre-empted if that law actually\n\nconflicts with federal law.\" (citing Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. State\n\nEnergy Res. Conservation & Dev. Comm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 204 (1983))).\n\nHere, § 230:30-a directly conflicts with the priority requirement\n\nof § 111(b).          Section 230:30-a requires the \"director of plant and\n\nproperty management\" to \"put out bids for the installation and\n\n\n                                             -61-\n\fmaintenance of the vending machines\" and provides that \"any bidder\n\nshall be eligible to bid for this service . . . .\"       This open\n\nbidding system conflicts with § 111(b)'s requirement that states\n\nfirst approach their SLAs and open the contract up to other bidders\n\nonly after the SLA has waived its priority in writing.        Section\n\n230:30-a is therefore preempted.\n\n                               VI.\n\n     \"While the state is constitutionally free to operate its own\n\nhighway   system,   the   federal     government   is   not     bound\n\nconstitutionally or statutorily to grant federal highway funds to\n\nstates which do not operate their systems in accordance with\n\nfederal guidelines.\" State of Nebraska, Dep't of Roads v. Tiemann,\n\n510 F.2d 446, 448 (8th Cir. 1975). Here, New Hampshire voluntarily\n\nentered into two agreements with the federal government, one under\n\nthe STA Act and one under the R-S Act.     As the panel found, the\n\nstate of New Hampshire has violated those agreements.\n\n     For the reasons stated above, we vacate enforcement of the\n\ndamages award and dismiss the damages claim; otherwise we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                               -62-\n\fAPPENDIX\n\nThe arbitration panel made the following findings of fact:\n\n     6.    Based    upon  legislative   history  and   statutory\n           interpretation, the word \"priority\" as used in the\n           Randolph-Sheppard Act, is defined as a right of first\n           refusal.\n\n     7.    Based upon memoranda issued by the U.S. Department of\n           Transportation after the passage of Section 111(b) of\n           TEA-21 [i.e., the STA Act], and based upon the meaning of\n           \"priority\" as interpreted under the Randolph-Sheppard\n           Act, N.H. Blind Vendors and state employees working with\n           the N.H. SLA in 1983 believed that the N.H. SLA was\n           entitled to, and should receive, a right of first refusal\n           to operate vending machines at rest areas on the\n           Interstate Highway System.\n\n     8.    The N.H. SLA could have taken advantage of its priority\n           under Section 111(b) of TEA-21 by either having licensed\n           blind vendors operate and maintain the machines, or by\n           subcontracting with private vendors to operate and\n           maintain the machines.\n\n     9.    The N.H. SLA was not given a right of first refusal to\n           operate machines at any of the rest area sites prior to\n           the New Hampshire Department of Administrative Services\n           putting the sites out for competitive bidding.\n\n     10.   Had the N.H. SLA been given a right of first refusal to\n           operate machines at any rest areas in New Hampshire, it\n           would have placed machines at those sites through its\n           licensed blind vendors or by hiring private vendors as\n           subcontractors.\n\n     11.   Despite the passage of RSA 230:30-a, various individuals\n           at Administrative Services negotiated with the N.H. SLA\n           in order to provide N.H. SLA with commissions from the\n           income earned at vending machines at rest areas on the\n           Interstate Highway System in exchange for a waiver of its\n           right to a priority.\n\n     17.   Despite long-standing efforts by the N.H. Blind Vendors\n           and N.H. SLA to negotiate with Administrative Services to\n           receive a priority to operate vending machines at rest\n           areas, the N.H. SLA has been unsuccessful.\n\n\n                                -63-\n\f    26.   In New Hampshire the SLA has never received any\n          commissions for any of the vending machines at any of the\n          rest areas on the Interstate Highway System.\n\n    28.   There is no evidence that the State of New Hampshire has\n          ever made a good faith determination that the N.H. SLA\n          was unwilling to operate machines at any rest area sites,\n          nor is there any evidence that the N.H. SLA waived its\n          right to such a priority in writing [except as to the\n          Springfield location].\n\n    30.   Since the enactment of RSA 230:30-a, the N.H. SLA's\n          priority to operate vending machines on the Interstate\n          Highway System has been intentionally violated by the\n          State of New Hampshire.\n\nIt also made the following rulings of law under federal law:\n\n     A.   The rest areas at Hooksett, Springfield, Salem, Seabrook,\n          Canterbury, Lebanon, Sanbornton and Sutton on Interstate\n          Highways 89, 93, and 95 in New Hampshire are subject to\n          the provisions of Section 111(b) of TEA-21, and its\n          predecessors. Section 111(b) of TEA-21 gives states the\n          authority to place vending machines at rest areas on the\n          Interstate Highway System if they chose to do so, however\n          by doing so a priority must be given to the SLA.\n\n     B.   In accordance with Section 111(b) of TEA-21, and based\n          upon litigation of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 'priority'\n          requires that SLAs be approached and be given a right of\n          first refusal before any other entity be approached to\n          operate such sites.\n\n     C.   The SLA must waive its right to a priority in writing\n          before it approaches any other entity to operate machines\n          at rest areas on the Interstate Highway System.\n\n     T.   RSA 230:30-a, which excludes the applicability of RSA\n          186-B:9-15 at rest areas on the Interstate Highways in\n          New Hampshire, is in direct conflict with Section 111(b)\n          of TEA-21, because New Hampshire's state-owned rest areas\n          on the Interstate Highways in New Hampshire are governed\n          first and foremost by TEA-21, and based upon RSA 230:30-a\n          the N.H. SLA is not given a priority to operate vending\n          machines at rest areas, nor does it receive any of the\n          commissions earned at such rest areas.\n\n                               -64-\n\f    U.   RSA 230:30-a is preempted by Section 111(b) of TEA-21.\n\n\n    W.   Under RSA 230:30-a, the N.H. SLA is expected to compete\n         with private vendors, and thus has no priority to operate\n         vending machines at rest areas on the Interstate Highway\n         System.\n\n(internal citations omitted)\n\n\n\n\n                               -65-\n\f",

Challenges to the Arbitration Panel's Statutory Authority to\n     Issue Prospective Equitable Relief\n\n\n     In the administrative proceedings and before the district\n\ncourt, New Hampshire raised many arguments challenging the scope of\n\nthe arbitration panel's statutory authority to issue prospective\n\nequitable relief, but it has abandoned most of those arguments in\n\nthis appeal.22\n\n     The state does argue in this appeal, as part of its Eleventh\n\nAmendment analysis, that the arbitration panel lacked authority to\n\n\n     21\n          New Hampshire has not argued that the panel could do\nnothing more than declare rights of the private parties and the\nstate, and so has waived the argument.\n     22\n          None of the following five arguments, all of which the\nstate has urged at other stages in this case, are raised in the\nstate's briefs on appeal: (1) that the arbitration panel has no\nremedial power whatsoever because the R-S Act authorizes only the\nhead of the state agency to fashion remedies; (2) that, even if the\narbitration panel had remedial power, that power does not extend to\nordering the state to terminate existing contracts for vending\nbefore those contracts expire; (3) that the arbitration panel is\nnot authorized under the R-S Act, which applies only to federal\nproperty, to issue relief as to state-owned rest areas; (4) that\nthe arbitration panel cannot award any relief at all for violations\nof § 111(b) because there is no private right of action under §\n111(b); and (5) that even if the arbitration panel could issue\nrelief for violations of § 111(b), it cannot issue relief as to\nstate-owned rest areas on toll roads built without federal funding,\nsuch as the Hooksett rest areas. We do not reach any of these\nissues, which have been waived.\n\n                                  -44-\n\fissue    any   relief   at   all   because,   as   a    matter   of   statutory\n\nconstruction, R-S grievance procedures do not apply to § 111(b)\n\nclaims.     To the extent this argument is a free-standing challenge\n\nto the arbitration panel's statutory authority to award prospective\n\nrelief in this case, we reject it.            The state is estopped from\n\nmaking the argument, given its earlier position in 1998 that the\n\nBlind Vendors' § 111(b) claims had to go through R-S grievance\n\nprocedures.\n\n        But even if the state were not estopped, its argument is wrong\n\non the merits.     The R-S Act states that \"[a]ny blind licensee who\n\nis dissatisfied with any action arising from the operation or\n\nadministration of the vending facility program\" may avail himself\n\nor herself of R-S grievance procedures.                20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a)\n\n(emphasis added).       The relevant language, again, of § 111(b) is:\n\n     In permitting the placement of vending machines, the\n     State shall give priority to vending machines which are\n     operated through the State licensing agency designated\n     pursuant to section 2(a)(5) of the Act of June 20, 1936,\n     commonly known as the 'Randolph-Sheppard Act' (20 U.S.C.\n     107a(a)(5)).\n\n\nThe issue is whether the \"vending machines\" to which § 111(b)\n\nrefers are within \"the vending facility program\" described in the\n\nR-S Act, 20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a); if so, R-S grievance procedures\n\napply to § 111(b) claims.\n\n        We answer in the affirmative, based on the plain language of\n\nthe R-S Act and § 111(b).      The R-S Act does not define \"the vending\n\n\n                                     -45-\n\ffacility program.\"      Neither statute expressly states what the\n\nrelationship is between the \"vending machines\" described in §\n\n111(b) and \"the vending facility program\" created by the R-S Act.\n\nNonetheless, the text of § 111(b) is clear that the vending\n\nmachines to be given priority are those \"which are operated through\n\nthe State licensing agency designated pursuant to . . . the\n\n'Randolph-Sheppard Act' . . . .\" Vending machines operated through\n\nSLAs are, by definition, part of the R-S vending program.      They are\n\noperated by blind vendors licensed under the R-S Act, see 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 107a(b) (licensees must be blind); id. § 107a(a)(5) (licensing\n\nprovisions apply to the operation of vending facilities on state as\n\nwell as federal property), to whom the SLA is required under the R-\n\nS Act to provide vending facility equipment and initial stock,\n\nsee id. § 107b(2).23\n\n     Our   plain-text   reading   makes   sense   from   a   functional\n\nperspective.   It is not surprising, for reasons of efficiency and\n\nconsistency, that Congress would intend R-S grievance procedures to\n\napply when a blind vendor complains that the state failed to\n\n\n     23\n          SLAs sometimes operate vending machines outside the R-S\nAct. For example, in New Hampshire, the Bureau of Blind Services,\nin addition to serving as the designated SLA under the R-S Act,\nperforms other functions in the state, such as conducting general\nvocational training for the blind. See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-\nB:4. Among those functions is the operation of vending machines on\nstate property under the state's \"mini\"-R-S Act. N.H. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. § 186-B:9-15.    But, to the extent that SLAs operate those\nmachines, they do so in their general capacity as agencies of the\nstate, not in their capacity as licensing agencies designated under\nthe R-S Act.\n\n                                  -46-\n\fprovide the SLA priority, whether the vending machine be along the\n\ninterstate   system     or   elsewhere.         If   enforcement    were    not\n\nconsolidated under one system, inconsistencies and unfairness might\n\narise from splitting grievance procedures between the USDOE and the\n\nFederal Highway Administration.\n\n      The state cites, in support of a different argument, a               March\n\n13, 1984 Department of Transportation memorandum providing guidance\n\non   implementing   §   111(b)   (the   \"1984    DOT   Guidelines\").       This\n\nmemorandum states, \"The only application the [R-S Act] has to\n\nSection 111 is to establish the licensing agency in each State that\n\nis to be given priority.         With the exception of rest areas on\n\nFederal lands, none of the [R-S Act] requirements apply to vending\n\nmachines in Interstate rest areas.\"        We read this statement, which\n\ndoes not have the force of a regulation, as being concerned with\n\nthe additional substantive guarantees of the R-S Act: for example,\n\nthe provisions concerning vending income, which do not apply to\n\nvending machines operated under § 111(b).24 The 1984 DOT Guidelines\n\nnever mention the issue of R-S grievance procedures.               And the DOT\n\n\n\n      24\n          The R-S Act provides blind vendors an entitlement to a\npercentage of all income generated by competing vending machines\noperating on federal property whether or not blind vendors operate\nthe machines. 20 U.S.C. § 107d-3. See Comm. of Blind Vendors v.\nDistrict of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673405\"><a href=\"/opinion/673405/committee-of-blind-vendors-of-the-district-of-columbia-v-district-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131 (D.C. Cir. 1994). We agree\nwith the state that there is no indication that Congress intended\n§ 111(b) of the STA Act to incorporate such a provision or\notherwise to impose such an obligation. This was also the view of\nthe Comptroller General of the United States in a letter dated\nFebruary 28, 1984 to Rep. Kennelly.\n\n                                   -47-\n\fused identical language in a memorandum on October 5, 1992 that\n\nprincipally discusses the application of substantive requirements\n\nof the R-S Act to vending machines in rest areas along interstate\n\nhighways.     It is unlikely that the DOT intended to foreclose\n\napplication of R-S grievance procedures despite the plain language\n\nof the R-S Act and § 111(b).\n\nB.   The Meaning of \"Priority\" in 23 U.S.C. § 111(b)\n\n     The arbitration panel held that \"'priority' requires that\n\n[state licensing agencies] be approached and be given a right of\n\nfirst refusal before any other entity be approached to operate\n\nthese sites.\"        This interpretation of \"priority\" in § 111(b)\n\ninvolves two requirements: a timing requirement and a requirement\n\nthat the right of priority be waived in writing.        First, the panel\n\nheld that priority requires that the SLA \"receive an opportunity to\n\noperate vending machines before any private vendor is even pursued\"\n\n(emphasis original).      Second, it held that \"before [the state]\n\napproaches any other entity to operate machines at rest areas on\n\nthe Interstate Highway System,\" the SLA \"must waive its right to a\n\npriority in writing.\"\n\n     The state argues that the district court erred in upholding\n\nthe arbitration panel's interpretation of \"priority.\" Although the\n\nstate does not differentiate between the two components of priority\n\noutlined by    the   administrative   panel,   the   state   seems   to   be\n\nchallenging both.     It argues that priority under § 111(b) requires\n\n\n                                 -48-\n\fonly that the state confer on the SLA \"an advantage not granted to\n\nany other potential vendor,\" and that its policy of allowing\n\nvending machines at a rest area to be operated through the Bureau\n\nof Blind Services if and only if the Bureau matches the high bid\n\nmeets that definition.\n\n     Our review of the legal meaning of priority in § 111(b) is de\n\nnovo, subject to any applicable principles of deference.

Id. at 843-44.\n     The state argues that the district court erred in applying\nChevron deference.     The state says, inter alia, that Chevron\ndeference is appropriate only when Congress has delegated authority\nto the agency to implement the statute in question. See 1 Pierce,\nAdministrative Law Treatise § 3.5 (2002) (\"Chevron [deference]\napplies only when an agency adopts a construction of a statute it\nimplements\" because only then has \"Congress explicitly or\nimplicitly assigned to the agency the task of resolving all policy\ndisputes that arise under the statute.\"); cf. Chevron, 467 U.S. at\n844 (\"[C]onsiderable weight should be accorded to an executive\ndepartment's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to\nadminister\" (emphasis added)).     Here, the state says, Congress\nnever delegated authority to interpret the STA Act to the USDOE or\nits arbitration panels. Cf. 23 U.S.C. § 315 (delegating rulemaking\npower to carry out the STA Act to the Secretary of Transportation).\nThe Blind Vendors respond that the state waived this argument in\ndistrict court and that, in any event, Congress did delegate power\nto the federal arbitration panel to interpret § 111(b) because R-S\ngrievance procedures apply to violations of § 111(b).\n     The Blind Vendors also argue that even if Chevron deference\ndoes not apply, the arbitration panel is still entitled to some\ndeference under Skidmore v.

We begin\n\nby looking to the plain language of the statute.            Greebel v. FTP\n\nSoftware, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198674\"><a href=\"/opinion/198674/greebel-v-ftp-software-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 192 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     1.    The Timing Requirement\n\n     We turn first to the question whether \"priority\" under §\n\n111(b) requires that the SLA be consulted before other vendors are\n\nconsidered.\n\n     The STA Act does not expressly define the term \"priority,\" and\n\nthe DOT, to which Congress has given rulemaking power to implement\n\n§ 111(b), see 23 U.S.C. § 315, has not issued regulations or\n\ninterpretive rules defining the term.          The state and Blind Vendors\n\nboth cite the same dictionary definition of priority:\n\n     Precedence, going before.      A legal preference or\n     precedence. . . . When two persons have similar rights\n     in respect of the same subject-matter, but one is\n     entitled to exercise his right to the exclusion of the\n\n\nthe agency\").    The state responds that Skidmore deference is\ninappropriate because the arbitrators in this case were not members\nof the Department of Education. Nothing in the record indicates\nthat the arbitrators here had any special expertise in this area.\n     We need not resolve this dispute over the appropriate level of\ndeference because we affirm the district court's decision to uphold\nthe arbitration panel's interpretation, regardless whether any\ndeference applies.\n\n                                -50-\n\f       other, he is said to have priority.\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990).\n\n       The Blind Vendors argue that a priority involves \"precedence\"\n\nand thus requires that the Bureau of Blind Services be offered the\n\ncontract before others.         The state argues based on the same\n\ndefinition that a priority is simply a \"preference\" accorded to\n\nparties that otherwise have \"similar rights\" and thus requires only\n\nthat the STA Act be given some unique advantage in the bidding\n\nprocess, such as the right to the contract if it matches the high\n\nbid.   While the state's argument is plausible, we think that it is\n\ninconsistent with congressional intent.\n\n       Because the plain meaning is not entirely clear, we look to\n\nother sources.      Greebel, 194 F.3d at 192.          One source is a\n\nmemorandum of guidelines issued by the DOT on March 11, 1983,\n\nshortly after the passage of § 111(b) (the \"1983 DOT Guidelines\"),\n\nwhich states:\n\n       Documentation demonstrating a positive initiative to\n       involve the designated Randolph-Sheppard Act State agency\n       will be required before the State highway agency proposes\n       alternative organizations or corporations to operate the\n       vending machines. However, if the designated Randolph-\n       Sheppard Act agency waives its rights in writing, the\n       State highway agency is free to negotiate agreements . .\n       . with any organization or corporation.\n\n\nUnder the 1983 DOT Guidelines, the state must attempt to negotiate\n\nan   agreement   with   the   SLA   before   considering   other   vendors.\n\nAlthough the 1983 DOT Guidelines are not entitled to Chevron\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\fdeference because they are not binding regulations, they have\n\npersuasive authority.

Mead Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 234-35 (2001) (applying Skidmore deference to interpretive\n\nrules). If Congress had disagreed with the 1983 DOT Guidelines, it\n\ncould easily have amended § 111(b) at some point in the last twenty\n\nyears to clarify its intent.\n\n     The 1983 DOT Guidelines are consistent with how Congress has\n\nviewed \"priority\" under the R-S Act.   We note at the outset that we\n\nlook to the priority provision of the R-S Act because of its\n\nsimilarity in language and purpose to § 111(b), not because we\n\nthink that it is somehow incorporated in § 111(b).       Although §\n\n111(b) incorporates R-S grievance procedures because, as we have\n\nexplained, the § 111(b) program is part of the \"vending facility\n\nprogram\" under 20 U.S.C. § 107d-1(a) of the R-S Act, there is no\n\nlanguage in the STA Act or the R-S Act indicating that § 111(b)\n\nnecessarily incorporates the R-S Act's \"priority\" provision, 20\n\nU.S.C. § 107(b).   Section 111(b)'s only reference to the R-S Act is\n\nto 20 U.S.C. § 107a, which is an entirely different section from\n\nthat containing the priority provision.\n\n     Instead, our reason for looking to the R-S Act is that\n\nCongress uses the term \"priority\" in the R-S Act in a manner almost\n\nidentical to its use of the term in § 111(b).   Compare 23 U.S.C. §\n\n111(b) (\"In permitting the placement of vending machines, the state\n\nshall give priority to vending machines which are operated through\n\n\n                                -52-\n\fthe State licensing agency designated pursuant to . . . the\n\n'Randolph-Sheppard Act' . . . .\"), with 20 U.S.C. § 107(b) (\"In\n\nauthorizing    the   operation   of   vending   facilities    on   Federal\n\nproperty, priority shall be given to blind persons licensed by a\n\nState agency as provided in this chapter . . . .\").          This parallel\n\nlanguage was not accidental. Congress was clearly aware of the R-S\n\nAct in drafting § 111(b), given that § 111(b) directly references\n\nthe R-S Act.    Where Congress uses the same term in the same way in\n\ntwo statutes with closely related goals, basic canons of statutory\n\nconstruction suggest a presumption that Congress intended the term\n\nto have the same meaning in both contexts.

Stroop,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112460\"><a href=\"/opinion/112460/sullivan-v-stroop/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1990) (applying the \"normal rule of statutory\n\nconstruction that identical words used in different parts of the\n\nsame act are intended to have the same meaning\" to a single term\n\nused in two separate, but related, statutes (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)).\n\n     This presumption can be rebutted when there is some indication\n\nthat the term is intended to serve different purposes in each\n\nstatute, see Gen.

As we have said, our reliance on the use of the\n\nterm \"priority\" in the R-S Act is not based on a belief that §\n\n111(b) necessarily incorporates the priority provisions of the R-S\n\nAct.    The 1984 DOT Guidelines tell us nothing about the issue at\n\nhand: whether the priority provisions of the R-S Act and § 111(b)\n\nhave different purposes.26\n\n\n       26\n          The state also presents several other arguments that the\npriority provisions of the R-S Act and § 111(b) serve different\npurposes. First, the state argues that the R-S Act's use of the\nterm is \"specifically limited to the section describing the\nSecretary's authority to proscribe [sic] regulations regarding this\nsubsection.\" This contention is refuted by the plain language of\n§ 107(b), in which Congress expressly created the priority\nrequirement in addition to giving the Secretary rulemaking powers\nto enforce that requirement.\n     Second, the state urges us to infer from Congress's failure to\nexpressly incorporate the priority provisions of the R-S Act into\nthe STA Act that Congress intended the two priority provisions to\nhave different purposes. We see no basis for such an inference.\nCourts regularly presume words in closely related statutes to have\nthe same meaning where Congress has declined to expressly\nincorporate one statute's interpretation of the term into the\nother.

We\ndisagree.     Congress expressly created a federal priority\nrequirement, and there is no indication that Congress intended to\ncreate state-by-state variations.    The state misreads Sentinel.\n\n                               -54-\n\f     We turn to the use of \"priority\" in § 107(b) of the R-S Act.\n\nThe R-S Act does not define \"priority,\" and the Department of\n\nEducation,   which   is    authorized    to   promulgate       regulations      to\n\nimplement the R-S Act, see 20 U.S.C. § 107(b), has not defined the\n\nterm in its regulations.         But the legislative history of the R-S\n\nAct is clear that Congress intended \"priority\" to signify more than\n\na   mere   preference.      Before    1974,   the       R-S   Act    provided    a\n\n\"preference\"   rather     than   a   \"priority\"    to    blind      vendors:    \"In\n\nauthorizing the operation of vending stands on Federal property,\n\npreference shall be given, so far as feasible, to blind persons\n\nlicensed by a State agency as provided in this chapter . . . .\"                 20\n\nU.S.C. § 107 (1970) (repealed 1974).          This changed in 1974, when\n\nCongress determined that \"the program has not developed, and has\n\nnot been sustained, in the manner and spirit in which the Congress\n\nintended.\"     R-S Act Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-516, §\n\n201(1), 88 Stat. 1617, 1622 (1974).               Congress found that \"to\n\n[e]nsure the continued vitality and expansion of the Randolph-\n\nSheppard program,\" it had to \"establish a priority for vending\n\nfacilities operated by blind vendors on Federal property.\"                 Id. §\n\n201(3).

The\n\nSenate Committee Report to the 1974 amendments explained:\n\n       The insertion of the term 'priority' underscores the\n       Committee's expectation that where a vending facility is\n       established on Federal property, it is the obligation of\n       the agency in control of such property, the Secretary of\n       [Health, Education, and Welfare], and the State licensing\n       agency to assure that one or more blind vendors have a\n       prior right to do business on such property, and\n       furthermore that, to the extent that a minority business\n       enterprise or non-blind operated vending machine competes\n       with or otherwise economically injures a blind vendor,\n       every effort must be made to eliminate such competition\n       or injury.\n\nS. Rep. No. 93-937, at 15 (1974) (emphasis in original).           Congress\n\nwas aware of these 1974 amendments to the R-S Act when it enacted\n\n§ 111(b) in 1983.     We note that we see no basis to assume that, by\n\nconferring a prior right to negotiate, Congress intended to give\n\nSLAs    the   right   to   operate   vending     machines   no   matter   how\n\nunreasonable, in light of congressional purposes, their bids may\n\nbe.\n\n                                     -56-\n\f2.     The Waiver Requirement\n\n       The next question is whether the arbitration panel was correct\n\nto interpret \"priority\" as requiring additionally that the state\n\nobtain a written waiver from the Bureau before approaching other\n\nvendors.    We answer that question in the affirmative, finding that\n\na waiver requirement is the interpretation most consistent with\n\nCongress's likely intent.               This waiver requirement operates as a\n\nbargaining chip for the SLA; it does not guarantee a bid will be\n\nsuccessful    even    if    entirely          unreasonable        given   congressional\n\nintent.     See 1983 DOT Guidelines, supra.\n\n       Congress     intended       \"priority\"          to   increase      significantly\n\nopportunities for blind vendors.                 That was certainly true in the\n\nanalogous    context       of    the     R-S    Act.        The    statutory   findings\n\naccompanying the 1974 amendments to the R-S Act, which added the\n\nterm   \"priority\"     to     the    statute,        state     an    intent    to    \"adopt\n\nlegislation    to    [the]       end\"    of    \"doubling      the    number    of    blind\n\noperators on Federal and other property under the Randolph-Sheppard\n\nprograms within the next five years.\"                  R-S Act Amendments of 1974,\n\nPub. L. No. 93-516, § 201(2), 88 Stat. 1617, 1622 (1974).\n\n       Given this intent, it is unlikely that Congress intended\n\n\"priority\" to confer upon SLAs only the right to be approached\n\nbefore states       award       contracts      to   other    vendors.        The    timing\n\nrequirement alone, absent any other protections, would leave states\n\nfree simply to approach their SLAs first, reject their offers, and\n\n\n                                          -57-\n\fthen open      contracts     for     competitive     bidding.        SLAs   would    be\n\nafforded no meaningful priority at all.\n\n       For    similar     reasons,    it    is    also    unlikely   that    Congress\n\nintended \"priority\" to be met by the state's Tie Rule or Match Rule\n\n(which       are,    in   any   event,       inconsistent      with    the        timing\n\nrequirement).        Counsel for the state conceded the ineffectiveness\n\nof the Tie Rule in oral argument, noting that \"the chances of [the\n\nBureau] submitting         exactly     the    same   or    higher    bid    [as   other\n\nvendors] might be vanishingly slim\" in a sealed bidding process.\n\nThe Match Rule is also problematic.               The state has not denied that\n\nthe Bureau of Blind Services simply lacks the resources to match\n\nhigh bids.          In both instances in which the Bureau has bid on\n\ncontracts, it has been significantly outbid by private vendors. In\n\n1997, the winning bid was from Coca-Cola Foods for $84,000; the\n\nBureau bid $7,200.         In 1999, the winning bid was from Good Morning\n\nSales, Inc., for $283,577; the Bureau bid $32,650.                         Thus, as a\n\npractical matter, the Match Rule offers the Bureau no advantage at\n\nall.     Congress created a priority requirement in § 111(b) because\n\nit recognized precisely this problem: that SLAs generally have\n\ndifficulty offering the highest bids in a competitive bidding\n\nprocess.\n\n       Nor do we think that Congress intended to limit priority under\n\n§ 111(b) in a way analogous to the provisions of the R-S Act\n\ngoverning the operation of cafeterias (rather than the placement of\n\n\n                                           -58-\n\fvending facilities).       The R-S Act provides that\n\n     [t]he Secretary [of Education], through the Commissioner,\n     shall prescribe regulations to establish a priority for\n     the operation of cafeterias on Federal property by blind\n     licensees when he determines, on an individual basis and\n     after consultation with the head of the appropriate\n     installation, that such operation can be provided at a\n     reasonable cost with food of a high quality comparable to\n     that currently provided to employees, whether by contract\n     or otherwise.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 107d-3(e).        Had Congress intended to limit § 111(b)\n\npriority similarly, it could easily have done so.              The cafeteria\n\nprovision, § 107d-3(e), was present in the R-S Act at the time\n\nCongress was drafting § 111(b).         See Pub. L. No. 93-516, § 206(e),\n\n88 Stat. 1617, 1627 (1974).         Congress could have drafted § 111(b)\n\nto mirror the language of § 107d-3(e) instead of § 107(b), but it\n\nchose not to.\n\n     We conclude that the arbitration panel's interpretation should\n\nbe upheld because it most closely adheres to Congress's likely\n\nintent in § 111(b).        Our interpretation is reinforced by the 1983\n\nDOT Guidelines, supra, which allow the state to negotiate with\n\nother parties if the SLA signs a written waiver of its priority\n\nrights.\n\n     Our    reading   is    further    bolstered   by   the   fact   that   New\n\nHampshire    itself   seems    to     understand   that   Congress    intends\n\n\"priority\" to impose a waiver requirement.                New Hampshire has\n\nenacted its own mini-R-S Act, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-B:9-15,\n\nwhich offers almost identical vending opportunities to the blind on\n\n\n                                      -59-\n\fstate property as offered on federal property under the R-S Act.\n\nCompare N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-B:9-15, with 20 U.S.C. § 107 et\n\nseq.    Although it does not use the term \"priority,\" § 186-B:13\n\nprovides that\n\n       No person in control of the maintenance, operation and\n       protection of any state property may offer or grant to\n       any other party a contract or concession to operate a\n       vending facility unless:\n\n\n            (a) He has notified blind services and has attempted\n       to make an agreement with blind services for a licensed\n       blind person to operate a vending facility; and\n\n\n            (b) He has determined in good faith that blind\n       services is not willing to establish a vending facility\n       on such property.\n\n\nThe state statute, §§ 186-B:9-15, does not apply to this case only\n\nbecause New Hampshire has exempted interstate highway sites --\n\nsites where New Hampshire needed federal permission to have any\n\nvending facilities at all -- from the statute's coverage. See N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a.            Why New Hampshire carved out an\n\nexception, for property along the interstate highway system, from\n\nits normal adherence to R-S Act standards is unclear.           But, to the\n\nextent that New Hampshire sought to mirror the R-S Act in § 186-\n\nB:9-15,   it   supports   our   view   of   what   New   Hampshire   believes\n\nCongress to mean by \"priority\" under § 107(b) of the R-S Act and\n\nthus under § 111(b) of the STA Act.\n\nC.     Preemption of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a\n\n\n                                   -60-\n\f      The    state      argues,    in   the        alternative,    that      even    if   the\n\narbitration panel was correct about Congress's likely intent as to\n\nthe meaning of priority, an administrative agency cannot find state\n\nlaw preempted unless Congress \"clearly expressed\" an intent to\n\npreempt state law.            Because no such clear expression is present in\n\n§ 111(b), the state argues that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a is\n\nnot preempted.\n\n      This argument is based on a mistaken understanding of the law\n\nof preemption.           New Hampshire's obligations under § 111(b) are\n\ndefined     by     federal      law.         New    Hampshire     may     pass      statutes\n\nimplementing          particular       procedures       for     carrying       out      those\n\nobligations, as N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 230:30-a does.                          But to the\n\nextent      that      those     state    laws       directly      conflict       with     the\n\nrequirements of federal law, the Supremacy Clause requires that\n\nthey be given no effect.

Based    upon  legislative   history  and   statutory\n           interpretation, the word \"priority\" as used in the\n           Randolph-Sheppard Act, is defined as a right of first\n           refusal.\n\n     7.    Based upon memoranda issued by the U.S. Department of\n           Transportation after the passage of Section 111(b) of\n           TEA-21 [i.e., the STA Act], and based upon the meaning of\n           \"priority\" as interpreted under the Randolph-Sheppard\n           Act, N.H. Blind Vendors and state employees working with\n           the N.H. SLA in 1983 believed that the N.H. SLA was\n           entitled to, and should receive, a right of first refusal\n           to operate vending machines at rest areas on the\n           Interstate Highway System.\n\n     8.    The N.H. SLA could have taken advantage of its priority\n           under Section 111(b) of TEA-21 by either having licensed\n           blind vendors operate and maintain the machines, or by\n           subcontracting with private vendors to operate and\n           maintain the machines.\n\n     9.    The N.H. SLA was not given a right of first refusal to\n           operate machines at any of the rest area sites prior to\n           the New Hampshire Department of Administrative Services\n           putting the sites out for competitive bidding.\n\n     10.   Had the N.H. SLA been given a right of first refusal to\n           operate machines at any rest areas in New Hampshire, it\n           would have placed machines at those sites through its\n           licensed blind vendors or by hiring private vendors as\n           subcontractors.\n\n     11.   Despite the passage of RSA 230:30-a, various individuals\n           at Administrative Services negotiated with the N.H. SLA\n           in order to provide N.H. SLA with commissions from the\n           income earned at vending machines at rest areas on the\n           Interstate Highway System in exchange for a waiver of its\n           right to a priority.\n\n     17.   Despite long-standing efforts by the N.H. Blind Vendors\n           and N.H. SLA to negotiate with Administrative Services to\n           receive a priority to operate vending machines at rest\n           areas, the N.H. SLA has been unsuccessful.\n\n\n                                -63-\n\f    26.   In New Hampshire the SLA has never received any\n          commissions for any of the vending machines at any of the\n          rest areas on the Interstate Highway System.\n\n    28.   There is no evidence that the State of New Hampshire has\n          ever made a good faith determination that the N.H. SLA\n          was unwilling to operate machines at any rest area sites,\n          nor is there any evidence that the N.H. SLA waived its\n          right to such a priority in writing [except as to the\n          Springfield location].\n\n    30.   Since the enactment of RSA 230:30-a, the N.H. SLA's\n          priority to operate vending machines on the Interstate\n          Highway System has been intentionally violated by the\n          State of New Hampshire.\n\nIt also made the following rulings of law under federal law:\n\n     A.   The rest areas at Hooksett, Springfield, Salem, Seabrook,\n          Canterbury, Lebanon, Sanbornton and Sutton on Interstate\n          Highways 89, 93, and 95 in New Hampshire are subject to\n          the provisions of Section 111(b) of TEA-21, and its\n          predecessors. Section 111(b) of TEA-21 gives states the\n          authority to place vending machines at rest areas on the\n          Interstate Highway System if they chose to do so, however\n          by doing so a priority must be given to the SLA.\n\n     B.   In accordance with Section 111(b) of TEA-21, and based\n          upon litigation of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 'priority'\n          requires that SLAs be approached and be given a right of\n          first refusal before any other entity be approached to\n          operate such sites.\n\n     C.   The SLA must waive its right to a priority in writing\n          before it approaches any other entity to operate machines\n          at rest areas on the Interstate Highway System.\n\n     T.   RSA 230:30-a, which excludes the applicability of RSA\n          186-B:9-15 at rest areas on the Interstate Highways in\n          New Hampshire, is in direct conflict with Section 111(b)\n          of TEA-21, because New Hampshire's state-owned rest areas\n          on the Interstate Highways in New Hampshire are governed\n          first and foremost by TEA-21, and based upon RSA 230:30-a\n          the N.H. SLA is not given a priority to operate vending\n          machines at rest areas, nor does it receive any of the\n          commissions earned at such rest areas.\n\n                               -64-\n\f    U.   RSA 230:30-a is preempted by Section 111(b) of TEA-21.\n\n\n    W.   Under RSA 230:30-a, the N.H. SLA is expected to compete\n         with private vendors, and thus has no priority to operate\n         vending machines at rest areas on the Interstate Highway\n         System.\n\n(internal citations omitted)\n\n\n\n\n                               -65-\n\f</pre>",
