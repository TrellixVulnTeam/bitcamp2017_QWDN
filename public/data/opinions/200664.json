Plaintiff-appellant Nancy Matías-\n\nCorrea appeals the district court's entry of summary judgment in\n\nfavor of defendants-appellees Pfizer, Inc. (\"Pfizer\"), and Medical\n\nCard System, Inc. (\"MCS\"), in a suit in which Matías alleged that\n\nthe termination of her disability benefits violated the Employee\n\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§\n\n1001-1461.     We affirm.\n\n                I.   Factual and Procedural Background\n\n             Matías worked as a machine operator for Pfizer (formerly\n\nWarner-Lambert) in a Puerto Rico facility, starting as a temporary\n\nemployee in 1986 and working on a permanent basis from September\n\n1988 until     November     1995.     While    employed   by   Pfizer,   Matías\n\nparticipated in Pfizer's Long Term Disability Benefits Plan, which\n\nprovides disability benefits for participants who are \"totally\n\ndisabled.\"    A participant is considered totally disabled under the\n\nterms of the plan if, during the first two years of disability, she\n\nis \"unable to perform the basic duties of [her] occupation, and\n\n[is]   not   involved     in   any   other    gainful   occupation.\"      After\n\nreceiving plan benefits for two years, however, a participant will\n\nonly be considered totally disabled if she is \"unable to work in an\n\noccupation or job for which [she is] qualified or may be qualified\n\nbased on [her] academic background, training or experience.\"                MCS\n\nacted as claims administrator for the plan.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f          In    April    1996,    Matías      applied   for   and   was   granted\n\ndisability benefits under the plan, based on her condition of low\n\nback pain syndrome, radiculopathy, and depression.                  At the time,\n\nher condition satisfied the plan's first definition of \"total\n\ndisability.\"\n\n          After    two    years    passed,     however,    Matías    could   only\n\ncontinue to receive benefits if her physical condition satisfied\n\nthe second definition of total disability.1             Under the terms of the\n\nplan, a participant receiving benefits \"may be required to undergo\n\na medical examination . . . and/or to submit evidence of continued\n\nTotal Disability satisfactory to [MCS] . . . to determine [her]\n\ncontinued entitlement to disability benefits or ability to resume\n\nactive employment.\" Further, such a participant would periodically\n\n\"be required to submit evidence to [MCS] of [her] continued total\n\ndisability,\" and refusal to submit such evidence would result in\n\nthe discontinuation of benefits.\n\n          On April 6, 2001, MCS requested that Matías submit copies\n\nof all medical records and progress notes of her treating doctors.\n\nMatías complied, submitting records from a variety of medical\n\nprofessionals,    including       her   rheumatologist,       neurologist,    and\n\npsychiatrist.     MCS referred Matías's file to Dr. José Ocasio, an\n\nindependent occupational medical consultant, for an independent\n\n\n\n     1\n      The plan restricted benefits based on mental disability to a\nmaximum of two years.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fmedical evaluation. On May 14, 2001, Dr. Ocasio made a preliminary\n\nfinding that Matías's records did not indicate total disability.\n\nHe noted that Matías did not appear to be following a regular\n\ntreatment    schedule   with   her    physicians,   and   recommended     a\n\nFunctional Capacity Evaluation (\"FCE\").\n\n            Matías's FCE showed that she was able to work at a\n\n“sedentary physical demand level” during an eight-hour day.             The\n\ntests suggested symptom exaggeration by Matías and \"very poor\n\neffort or voluntary submaximal effort which is not necessarily\n\nrelated to pain, impairment or disability.\" Based on these results\n\nand his prior findings, Dr. Ocasio recommended the termination of\n\nMatías's disability benefits on the ground that she was not totally\n\ndisabled.   MCS terminated Matías’s disability benefits, effective\n\nJune 15, 2001.\n\n            On August 3, 2001, Matías filed a first-level appeal of\n\nher benefits termination with MCS.         As part of this appeal, she\n\nsubmitted additional medical documents, including three undated\n\ndoctors’ assessments of her physical capabilities during an eight-\n\nhour workday.    These “Residual Functional Capacity Assessments”\n\n(“RFC Assessments”) varied in their conclusions as to the amount of\n\nactivity Matías could tolerate.       For example, one doctor estimated\n\nthat Matías could sit for less than one hour and stand for less\n\nthan one hour, while another estimated that she could sit for two\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fto four hours and stand for one to two hours.                 All found that\n\nMatías needed rest periods during the day.\n\n            MCS referred Matías’s full medical file, including the\n\nnew documents submitted on appeal, to Dr. Ocasio for evaluation,\n\nand on August 13, 2001, Dr. Ocasio once again recommended the\n\ntermination of Matías’s benefits.           He found that the additional\n\nmaterials     confirmed    that   Matías    was   not    totally     disabled,\n\nconcluding in particular that all three RFC Assessments indicated\n\nthat Matías could work for short periods of time, with rest.                  Two\n\ndays later, MCS affirmed its termination of Matías’s benefits,\n\nnotifying her that she did not meet the definition of \"totally\n\ndisabled\" under the plan.         MCS concluded that although Matías\n\nsuffered from several physical conditions that required treatment,\n\nshe was able to work.        MCS also informed Matías of her right to\n\nappeal the decision by submitting any additional evidence she\n\nwished to have considered.\n\n            Matías requested a second-level appeal, and on October\n\n12,   2001,    she   submitted    updated     progress       notes   from     her\n\npsychiatrist, Dr. José Bisbal, and the results of an MRI performed\n\non her right knee.2       She also resubmitted a number of the medical\n\ndocuments she had already provided as part of her initial review\n\nand first appeal.         Dr. Ocasio again reviewed Matías’s medical\n\n\n\n      2\n      The MRI revealed some abnormalities               in    Matías’s      knee,\nincluding tears and degeneration.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fevidence, and concluded that she was not \"totally disabled.\"                  On\n\nOctober 30, 2001, MCS issued its final denial of Matías’s appeal,\n\nand affirmed the termination of her benefits.\n\n            In November 2001, Matías filed suit against Pfizer and\n\nMCS in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto\n\nRico, claiming a violation of ERISA based on the termination of her\n\nbenefits.     Matías claimed that she suffered from debilitating\n\nconditions and that MCS’s decision to terminate her benefits was\n\narbitrary and capricious.       In September 2002, Pfizer and MCS moved\n\nfor summary judgment on the ground that the benefits determination\n\nwas supported by substantial evidence in the record.               In November\n\n2002, the district court entered judgment in favor of defendants.\n\nThe court found that (1) the standard of review was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious because the plan granted the necessary discretionary\n\nauthority   to   MCS;    and   (2)   MCS    had   not   acted   arbitrarily   or\n\ncapriciously in light of substantial record evidence supporting\n\nMCS’s termination of benefits.         This appeal followed.\n\n                               II.     Analysis\n\nA.          The ERISA Standard of Review\n\n            Matías alleges that the district court erred in reviewing\n\nMCS’s benefits determination under an “arbitrary and capricious”\n\nstandard.    Such a standard of review is appropriate where the\n\nlanguage    of   the    benefits     plan   reflects     a   “clear   grant   of\n\ndiscretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits.”\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fLeahy v. Raytheon Co., 315 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing\n\nTerry v. Bayer Corp., 145 F.3d 28, 37 (1st Cir. 1998)); see\n\nFirestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989).\n\n              The plan states that MCS “shall administer claims under\n\nthe Plan,” and\n\n              [S]hall have the power and the duty, including\n              discretionary authority, to take all actions and to make\n              all decisions necessary or proper to carry out the\n              provisions of the Plan, including, but not limited to,\n              the following:\n\n                                     *      *      *\n\n              To interpret the Plan to determine whether a claimant is\n              eligible for benefits, to decide the amount, form, and\n              timing of benefits, and to resolve ambiguities,\n              inconsistencies, omissions and any other claim-related\n              matters under the Plan which is [sic] raised by a\n              claimant or identified by the Investment Committee, its\n              interpretation and resolution to be final, conclusive and\n              binding on all parties affected thereby\n\nApp. at 69-70 (emphasis added).\n\n              Despite this language, Matías alleges that the plan did\n\nnot grant final discretionary authority to MCS because Pfizer has\n\nretained the authority to reverse MCS’s decisions concerning the\n\nplan.      As support, Matías points to language in the plan granting\n\nan   internal    committee   at   Pfizer   (the   “Investment   Committee”)\n\nauthority to administer the plan.3          The district court rejected\n\n\n      3\n          Matías refers to a provision stating:\n\n      The Investment Committee shall administer the Plan and shall\n      have the power and the duty, including discretionary\n      authority, to take all actions and to make all decisions\n      necessary or proper to carry out the Plan, including, but not\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthis    argument,   noting   the   unequivocal   authority   of   MCS   to\n\nadminister claims under the plan, a power not assigned to the\n\nInvestment Committee.\n\n             While the Investment Committee appears to hold some\n\nadministrative authority under the terms of the plan, MCS is the\n\nentity designated to administer claims under the plan, and to\n\ninterpret the plan to determine a claimant’s eligibility for\n\nbenefits.    MCS’s eligibility determinations are “final, conclusive\n\nand binding on all parties affected thereby.”         Matías offers no\n\nbasis to conclude that MCS lacked the discretionary authority to\n\nmake the necessary judgment calls concerning her eligibility for\n\n\n\n\n       limited to, the following:\n\n       (a)   To require any person to furnish such information as it\n             may request for the purpose of the proper administration\n             of the Plan as a condition to receiving any benefit under\n             the Plan;\n       (b)   To make and enforce such rules and regulations and\n             prescribe the use of such forms as it shall deem\n             necessary or desirable for the efficient administration\n             of the Plan;\n       (c)   To interpret the Plan, and to resolve ambiguities,\n             inconsistencies and omissions, its interpretation and\n             resolution to be finally conclusive and binding on all\n             parties affected thereby;\n       (d)   To decide on questions concerning the Plan and the\n             eligibility of any Employee to participate in the Plan in\n             accordance with the provisions of the Plan;\n       (e)   To compute the amount of benefits which shall be payable\n             to any person in accordance with the provisions of the\n             Plan . . . .\n\nApp. at 71.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fbenefits.     The district court properly applied the arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard of review.\n\nB.          The Benefits Determination\n\n            We review de novo the district court’s entry of summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants.             See Twomey v. Delta Airlines\n\nPension   Plan,   328    F.3d      27,   31    (1st   Cir.   2003).     Where   the\n\nunderlying decision by a plan administrator is subject to the\n\narbitrary and capricious standard of review, our review involves an\n\ninquiry into “whether the aggregate evidence, viewed in the light\n\nmost favorable to the non-moving party, could support a rational\n\ndetermination that the plan administrator acted arbitrarily in\n\ndenying the claim for benefits.”              Id. (quoting Leahy, 315 F.3d at\n\n18).   The touchstone is whether MCS's benefits determination was\n\nreasonable.    See Liston v. UNUM Corp. Officer Severance Plan, 330\n\nF.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Matías contends that MCS’s conclusion that she was not\n\ntotally     disabled    “is   at    odds      with    the   generally   recognized\n\nrequirement for sedentary jobs,” including the requirements set\n\nforth by the Social Security Administration.                     As the district\n\ncourt noted, however, Matías was required to satisfy the plan’s\n\ndefinition of total disability (i.e. that she was completely\n\nunable to work in an occupation for which she was, or might be,\n\nqualified based on her background).                    Cf. Pari-Fasano v. ITT\n\nHartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 420 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f2000) (“[A]lthough a related Social Security benefits decision\n\nmight be relevant to an insurer’s eligibility determination, it\n\nshould not be given controlling weight except perhaps in the rare\n\ncase in which the statutory criteria are identical to the criteria\n\nset forth in the insurance plan.”).\n\n         Matías also alleges that MCS relied too heavily on the\n\nresults of its own investigation, and should have given more\n\nweight to her doctors’ diagnoses, including those that “flatly\n\ncontradicted the FCE.”      But under the applicable standard of\n\nreview, the question is “not which side we believe is right, but\n\nwhether the insurer had substantial evidentiary grounds for a\n\nreasonable decision in its favor.\"     Brigham v. Sun Life of Canada,\n\n317 F.3d 72, 85 (1st Cir. 2003)(alterations omitted)(quoting Doyle\n\nv. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir. 1998));\n\nsee Lopes v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 332 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); see also Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, --- U.S.\n\n---, 123 S. Ct. 1965, 1971 (2003) (“Plan administrators . . .        may\n\nnot arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant’s reliable evidence,\n\nincluding the opinions of a treating physician.      But . . . courts\n\nhave no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord\n\nspecial weight to the opinions of a claimant’s physician.”).\n\n         MCS   considered   medical    evidence   that   supported   its\n\nconclusion that, while Matías was in need of medical treatment,\n\nshe was not totally disabled within the meaning of the plan.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fMatías’s FCE generated evidence that she was capable of sedentary\n\nphysical   work.       That   exam    also   showed   signs   of   symptom\n\nexaggeration. Matías also submitted evidence, including three RFC\n\nAssessments, from which an independent medical expert concluded\n\nthat she could work for limited periods of time, with rest.            In\n\nlight of the record evidence taken as a whole, we find that MCS’s\n\ntermination of Matías’s benefits was within its discretion.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f",

While employed by Pfizer, Mat&#237;as participated in Pfizer's Long Term Disability Benefits Plan, which provides disability benefits for participants who are \"totally disabled.\" A participant is considered totally disabled under the terms of the plan if, during the first two years of disability, she is \"unable to perform the basic duties of [her] occupation, and [is] not involved in any other gainful occupation.\" After receiving plan benefits for two years, however, a participant will only be considered totally disabled if she is \"unable to work in an occupation or job for which [she is] qualified or may be qualified based on [her] academic background, training or experience.\" MCS acted as claims administrator for the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1996, Mat&#237;as applied for and was granted disability benefits under the plan, based on her condition of low back pain syndrome, radiculopathy, and depression.

Where the underlying decision by a plan administrator is subject to the arbitrary and capricious standard of review, our review involves an inquiry into \"whether the aggregate evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, could support a rational determination that the plan administrator acted arbitrarily in denying the claim for benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Leahy,</i> 315 F.3d at 18). The touchstone is whether MCS's benefits determination was reasonable. <i>See Liston v. Unum Corp.

As the district court noted, however, Mat&#237;as was required to satisfy <i>the plan's</i> definition of total disability (<i>i.e.</i> that she was completely unable to work in an occupation for which she was, or might be, qualified based on her background). <i>Cf.

Mat&#237;as's FCE generated evidence that she was capable of sedentary physical work. That exam also showed signs of symptom exaggeration. Mat&#237;as also submitted evidence, including three RFC Assessments, from which an independent medical expert concluded that she could work for limited periods of time, with rest. In light of the record evidence taken as a whole, we find that MCS's termination of Mat&#237;as's benefits was within its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The plan restricted benefits based on mental disability to a maximum of two years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The MRI revealed some abnormalities in Mat&#237;as's knee, including tears and degeneration</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Mat&#237;as refers to a provision stating:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Investment Committee shall administer the Plan and shall have the power and the duty, including discretionary authority, to take all actions and to make all decisions necessary or proper to carry out the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(a) To require any person to furnish such information as it may request for the purpose of the proper administration of the Plan as a condition to receiving any benefit under the Plan;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(b) To make and enforce such rules and regulations and prescribe the use of such forms as it shall deem necessary or desirable for the efficient administration of the Plan;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(c) To interpret the Plan, and to resolve ambiguities, inconsistencies and omissions, its interpretation and resolution to be finally conclusive and binding on all parties affected thereby;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(d) To decide on questions concerning the Plan and the eligibility of any Employee to participate in the Plan in accordance with the provisions of the Plan;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(e) To compute the amount of benefits which shall be payable to any person in accordance with the provisions of the Plan....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">App. at 71.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
