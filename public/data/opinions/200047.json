Petitioner appeals from the district\n\ncourt's denial of his application for a writ of coram nobis\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1651.          The judgment will be affirmed.\n\n           The     district    court     correctly      determined   that\n\npetitioner was ineligible for coram nobis relief.                Because\n\npetitioner is in federal custody and contests the validity of\n\nhis sentence, 28 U.S.C. § 2255 provides the exclusive avenue\n\nfor seeking relief.      See Pennsylvania Bur. of Corr. v. United\n\nStates Marshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985); United States v.\n\nSawyer, 239 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\nBarrett, 178 F.3d 34, 55 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528\n\nU.S. 1176 (2000).\n            This   is   not   merely     a   formal   distinction.    As\npetitioner has already filed four previous § 2255 motions, all\n\nof which were rejected, he would be required to satisfy the\nrigid gatekeeping provisions applicable to successive § 2255\nmotions in order to have the merits of his claims considered.\n\nOne of those provisions requires petitioner to request leave of\nthis court to file a successive petition.             28 U.S.C. § 2255 (¶\n8); see Jamison v. United States, 244 F.3d 44, 45-46 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    We have not granted such leave, nor would we since\npetitioner's claims involve neither newly discovered evidence\nnor a new rule of constitutional law.          See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244 &\n\n2255.    Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f",
