Capeway Roofing Systems, Inc.\n\n(\"Capeway\"), a roofing contractor in Massachusetts, was fined by\n\nthe   Occupational   Safety    and   Health     Review   Commission   (\"the\n\nCommission\") for safety violations.           It now seeks review in this\n\ncourt.    29 U.S.C. § 660(a) (2000).          The story is quickly told,\n\nreserving details for the discussion of individual claims of error.\n\n           On April 24, 2000, two inspectors charged with enforcing\n\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act (\"the Act\") visited a site\n\nin Weymouth, Massachusetts, where Capeway was constructing roofing\n\non a new firehouse.    The firehouse had four roofs: one, high and\n\nsteeply pitched, over the center of the garage; two wider and\n\nsomewhat flatter roofs extending over the rest of the garage; and\n\na lower flat roof over the living quarters attached to the garage.1\n\n           The   inspectors,    Peter      Barletta   and   James   Holiday,\n\naccording to their testimony, found that employees were working or\n\nwalking on all four roofs without hardhats and without physical\n\n\"fall protection\" measures such as warning lines near roof edges.\n\nThe inspectors interviewed Capeway supervisor Dennis Mello and the\n\njob foreman, Manny Araujo, who said they were acting as safety\n\nmonitors; but (according to Barletta) Mello admitted that he used\n\nhis own criteria rather than the Occupational Safety and Health\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The highest roof had a pitch of \"6 in 12,\" a vertical rise of\n6 inches for every foot of horizontal run; the intermediate roofs'\npitch was one half-inch per foot.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fAdministration's (\"OSHA\") requirements for deciding whether to use\n\nfall protection gear for the men.\n\n            The inspection turned up various other problems--improper\n\nscaffolding, lack of training, materials stacked close to the roof\n\nedge, and rusty safety equipment.              In due course, the agency\n\ncharged Capeway with nine violations; after an evidentiary hearing,\n\nthe    administrative   law   judge    (\"the   ALJ\")   imposed   a   fine   of\n\n$117,000, which the Commission upheld on review.            In this court,\n\nCapeway contests seven of the nine violations, the penalties\n\nassessed, and the ALJ's handling of witness sequestration.\n\n            On judicial review, the Commission's orders are to be\n\nupheld unless \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\n\notherwise not in accordance with law,\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (2000).\n\nFact findings are sustained if supported by substantial evidence.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 660(a).     We begin with a central claim of procedural\n\nerror and then take up the specific citations in dispute one by\n\none.\n\n            Sequestration of witnesses.         Capeway opens by claiming\n\nthat in his sequestration rulings the ALJ violated Rule 615 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence, made applicable by 29 C.F.R. § 2200.71\n\n(2004).     In essence, Rule 615 requires that, upon a party's\n\nrequest, the presiding official exclude witnesses from the room \"so\n\nthat they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses\" (and so\n\ntailor their own testimony).      There is an exception for an officer\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\for employee designated to represent a party that is \"not a natural\n\nperson.\"    Fed. R. Evid. 615.\n\n            At   the    hearing    in   this    case,   Barletta   and    Holiday\n\ntestified to the violations, and the OSHA area director, Brenda\n\nGordon, testified about the penalties.              Barletta went first and,\n\nabout halfway through his testimony, agency counsel asked for\n\nsequestration of witnesses.         Capeway's lawyer objected but the ALJ\n\nordered sequestration, adding that \"the compliance officer can\n\nstay\"--an   apparent      reference     to     Holiday--and    that   any   other\n\nwitnesses had to leave except that \"[c]lients can stay here.\"\n\n            When Capeway's lawyer asked that other witnesses for the\n\nagency also be sequestered, agency counsel said that Gordon would\n\nbe the only witness for the agency beside the inspectors, and that\n\nshe would be testifying about the penalties.             The ALJ said that she\n\ncould also stay, and Capeway counsel objected.              Gordon and Holiday\n\nboth stayed in the hearing as did Araujo, who did not testify.                 The\n\ncompany's    only      witness    was   Barry    Metzler,     Capeway's     safety\n\nconsultant, and it appears that he was sequestered.\n\n            In a footnote in its post-hearing memorandum, Capeway\n\nsaid as to the sequestration issue only that Holiday had tailored\n\nhis testimony \"to address the weaknesses\" in Barletta's testimony.\n\nIn his decision, the ALJ replied (also in a footnote) that he\n\nrefused to strike Holiday's testimony because both Holiday and\n\nGordon could stay under Rule 615 and because Capeway failed \"to\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fidentify     even   one   instance\"    where       Holiday's   testimony     was\n\n\"suspect.\"     On review, the two-member Commission panel found any\n\nerror as to sequestration to be \"harmless.\"\n\n            In this court, Capeway devotes to this issue ten pages of\n\nits brief enriched by the usual rhetoric (\"fundamental right to a\n\nfair trial,\" \"right to due process\"). The agency denies that there\n\nwas any error       at all, says that the issue was not properly\n\npreserved,    and   finally   says    that    any   error    would   have   been\n\nharmless.    We think that there probably was an error, although not\n\none of major proportions; that the waiver issue is muddled; and\n\nthat the error was patently harmless and does not deserve the fuss\n\nbeing made about it.\n\n             Whether the agency designated Gordon or Holiday as its\n\nrepresentative (it is not clear that the agency formally designated\n\nanyone), the bare language of Rule 615 suggests that only one of\n\nthem should have stayed.       Conceivably the agency could argue that\n\nHoliday was its representative and that Gordon, although also a\n\nwitness, was testifying to an unrelated matter; there is a hint\n\nthat the ALJ may have so viewed the situation.              But we will assume\n\narguendo, in the company's favor, that Holiday should have left.\n\n             Nevertheless,    there   is     no   indication   whatever     that\n\nCapeway was improperly prejudiced.                The sequestration rule is\n\nconcerned primarily with falsification:               for example, that the\n\nsecond witness might testify to things he did not see but instead\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\flearned from the testimony of the first witness, or that he might\n\nalter his testimony to conform to that of the first, thereby\n\nstrengthening it instead of undercutting it. See Fed. R. Evid. 615\n\n& 1972 advisory committee note.\n\n              Capeway makes no effort whatever to show that this\n\noccurred.       Instead,     it     argues,      with    examples,      that    Holiday\n\n\"tailored\" his testimony by addressing points helpful to the\n\ncharges   against      Capeway      that    Barletta      had    left    out    of   his\n\ntestimony.       But    in   the    ordinary      case    this    is    not    improper\n\nprejudice: even if Holiday had been excluded, agency counsel would\n\nhave been free to ask Holiday questions thereafter to cover any\n\nmatters that Barletta had scanted or ignored.\n\n              It is often hard to prove actual prejudice where there\n\nhas been a failure to sequester; and without delving into problems\n\nof burden of proof and the like, see 29 Wright & Gold, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 6244 (1997), we would be open to a\n\nsuggestion of prejudice where there was serious reason to believe\n\nthat it had occurred.              In this instance, there is nothing to\n\nsuggest that Holiday lied and very little new that he added to the\n\nagency's case.\n\n              This brings us to the violations found by the Commission.\n\nUnder   the    Act,    the   Secretary      of   Labor    is     required      to   adopt\n\nworkplace safety standards, 29 U.S.C. § 655 (2000); those relating\n\nto \"fall protection\" at construction worksites occupy over 30 pages\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fof the Code of Federal Regulations.      29 C.F.R. pt. 1926, subpt. M\n\n(2004).   The Act provides for civil penalties of up to $70,000 per\n\noffense for \"willful\" or \"repeat\" violations; for other violations,\n\nthe cap is $7,000, and some penalty is required if the violation is\n\n\"serious.\"    29 U.S.C. § 666 (2000).\n\n           Lack of fall protection on the central pitched roof. The\n\nagency imposed a fine of $63,000 on Capeway for willfully failing\n\nto use physical safety devices for employees working on the highest\n\nof the four roofs.       The regulation invoked by the Commission\n\nrequires such safety devices (harnesses, guardrails, or nets) for\n\nwork on \"steep\" roofs six feet or more above \"lower levels\", 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1926.501(b)(11) (2004); \"steep\" is defined as a roof with\n\na pitch greater than 4 in 12, and \"lower level\" is defined as any\n\nsurface onto which an employee can fall.       29 C.F.R. § 1926.500(b)\n\n(2004).   Along at least one edge, the roof in this case (with a\n\npitch of 6 in 12) was over 20 feet above the ground.\n\n             Capeway says that its use of safety monitors in lieu of\n\nphysical safety devices was permitted by a 1999 OSHA directive,\n\nwhich apparently allows such an alternative for some \"residential\n\nconstruction.\"     Although the relevant regulation does not define\n\n\"residential    construction,\"   29   C.F.R.   §   1926.501(b)(13),   the\n\nCommission ruled that under the directive the firehouse did not\n\nqualify because (as is undisputed) the building's frame was made of\n\nsteel and concrete.     By contrast, the directive says that\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f            Residential construction is characterized by:\n\n            Materials: Wood framing (not steel or concrete);\n       wooden floor joists and roof structures.\n\n            Methods:    Traditional      wood    frame     construction\n       techniques.\n\nOSHA Instruction STD 3-0.1A (June 18, 1999).\n\n            The special treatment for \"residential construction\"\n\nappears to rest on the agency's view that a wood-based structure\n\nmay be a less sturdy platform for physical restraint systems like\n\nguardrails and harnesses.     Cf. 64 Fed. Reg. 38078, 38079, 38081-82\n\n(July 14, 1999); 58 Fed. Reg. 16515, 16516-17 (March 29, 1993).\n\nGiven this rationale, argued by the agency, and the directive's\n\nlanguage expressly connecting \"residential construction\" to wood-\n\nframed buildings, the Commission's decision is clearly sound--quite\n\napart from the deference due to the agency in reading its own\n\ndirective.\n\n            Capeway says that the workers were installing plywood,\n\ntar-paper,   and   shingles   on   the    top   roof,    which   is   a    common\n\nfinishing for residential buildings, and that another contractor\n\nhad done the building itself.         This is irrelevant.        The language\n\njust    quoted   ties   \"residential      construction\"     status        to   the\n\nunderlying structural elements of the building. Given the asserted\n\nrationale, this makes perfect sense.        Whoever built the underlying\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fstructure, Capeway was exposing its own workers to a forbidden\n\nrisk.      The agency cases Capeway cites do not salvage its position.2\n\n               As for the willfulness finding, the term is not defined\n\nbut we have equated it with awareness that the conduct violates the\n\nregulation or, alternatively, reckless disregard for the rules.\n\nSee Brock v. Morello Bros. Constr. Inc., 809 F.2d 161, 163-65 (1st\n\nCir. 1987).       In this case, Mello admitted to Barletta at the site\n\nthat he used his own judgment about whether the roof was steep\n\nenough to warrant greater precautions instead of the pitch standard\n\nin the regulations; and the company had been previously cited for\n\nviolating      the     same   regulation.     This    is   enough    \"substantial\n\nevidence\" to support the finding.\n\n               Capeway is mistaken in saying that a chance remark by\n\nthe Commission--that Capeway should have known that the residential\n\nstandard did not apply--shows that the Commission used a negligence\n\nrather than a reckless disregard standard.             It is also of no moment\n\nthat       Capeway's    safety   consultant   Barry    Metzler      said   that   he\n\nbelieved that the residential standard applied; it plainly did not.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      All three cases, Sec'y of Labor v. Latite Roofing & Sheet\nMetal Co., Inc., 19 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1287 (2000); Sec'y of Labor\nv. Commercial Wall, Inc., 18 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1380 (1998); Sec'y\nof Labor v. Mlodzinski, 18 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1954 (1999), deal with\nan older version of the directive that does not describe the\nstructural characteristics of \"residential construction\" and is\ntherefore irrelevant. See OSHA Instruction STD 3-0.1A (June 18,\n1999) (expressly cancelling prior version of directive).\n\n                                       -9-\n\fIn all events, the willfulness finding rested solidly on the\n\nadmissions made at the site and on Capeway's history of violations.\n\n          Hardhats.     The   Commission   fined   Capeway   $2,800   for\n\nallowing workers to operate without hardhats when exposed to\n\noverhead hazards.     29 C.F.R. § 1926.100(a) (2004).        The company\n\nsays that photographs taken by the inspectors show that some\n\nworkers were wearing hardhats; but they also show that other\n\nworkers were not.     Capeway says that those without hardhats may\n\nhave been working for other employers, but Barletta testified that\n\nmost of the workers on the roof, where Capeway alone was working,\n\nhad only put on their hardhats after the inspection conference\n\nbegan.\n\n          As for exposure to overhead hazards, Capeway says that\n\nthere were no overhead hazards for workers already on the roofs.\n\nPutting aside Barletta's view that the whole site was a hardhat\n\narea, anyone climbing the ladders to the roofs was exposed to\n\nfalling objects (materials were in fact stored too close to roof\n\nedges); the agency was arguably entitled to infer that those on the\n\nroof not wearing hardhats when Barletta arrived had not worn them\n\non the climb; and one man was so photographed on his ascent.\n\n          Safety monitors.    A $4,000 fine was imposed for failure\n\nto use proper safety monitoring, whereby certain workers are\n\ndesignated to see that others do not stray too close to the edge.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1926.502(h) (2004).      Other weaknesses in monitoring\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\faside, the Commission supportably found that at times Araujo was\n\nthe only monitor and was not (as required) on the same roofing\n\nsurface as the workers he was monitoring, and that even two\n\nmonitors could not adequately have watched work activities on all\n\nfour roofs.   There is nothing to this claim of error.\n\n          Flat roof fall protection.   The agency imposed a $28,000\n\nfine for a \"repeat\" violation, meaning that a prior citation had\n\nbeen issued for the same offense, because inter alia there was no\n\nphysical fall protection on the lowest roof--exposing workers to a\n\n13-foot fall to the ground.    29 C.F.R. § 1926.501(b)(10) (2004).\n\nCapeway had been cited three times in the prior three years for\n\nviolating the same regulation. Araujo admitted that on the workday\n\nbefore the inspection, some work had been done on the lower roof\n\nwithout such protection.\n\n          Capeway says in this court that Araujo's admission was\n\nmade only to Holiday and that Mello had told the inspectors that\n\nthe work on the lower roof had been completed two weeks before.\n\nThe Commission was entitled to credit Araujo's statement over\n\nMello's even if it were made only to Holiday (we have already\n\nrejected the \"gap-filling\" attack); but as it happens the admission\n\nwas also made to Barletta (which the Commission overlooked).\n\n          Materials storage.   In another \"repeat\" violation, the\n\nCommission fined Capeway $8,000 for storing materials within six\n\nfeet of the edge of the lower flat roof despite the lack of\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fguardrails.   29 C.F.R. § 1926.502(j)(7)(i).      Capeway says that no\n\nroofing work was being done on the lower roof (the regulation\n\napplied to storage \"[d]uring the performance of roofing work\") and\n\nthat the materials were not being \"stored\" but were there only\n\ntemporarily, awaiting the arrival of transportation.\n\n          Roofing work was being performed on the site, even if it\n\nwas not occurring on the lower roof level.        Certainly materials\n\nstored too close to a roof edge could be toppled in various ways\n\nand fall on workers below, whether or not roofing was being\n\nconducted on the same level.      We need not reach the agency's\n\nfurther argument that its own regulations define \"roofing work\" to\n\ninclude \"storage,\" 29 C.F.R. § 1926.500(b), or the counter-argument\n\nthat this interpolation would effectively render the \"[d]uring the\n\nperformance of roofing work\" language a nullity.\n\n          As for the alleged \"temporary\" character of the storage,\n\nthe regulation cannot reasonably apply to materials in the process\n\nof being moved over the side, but the Commission adopted no such\n\nfoolish   reading.    Rather,   there   is   no   evidence   that   such\n\ntransportation was in progress, even if Mello is credited in his\n\nclaim that the company planned to move the material sometime later\n\n\"that morning\" when the moving equipment became available.\n\n           Lack of training. In a third \"repeat\" violation, Capeway\n\nsuffered a $6,000 fine for failing to train one of its employees--\n\nDavid Hinchcliff--in fall protection.    29 C.F.R. § 1926.503(a)(1)\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f(2004).   Apart from its \"repeat\" status, the violation would not\n\nhave warranted so severe an award.           The company did present\n\nevidence of a training program, but the agency also showed that\n\nHinchcliff had not been properly trained.\n\n          Hinchcliff's   statements     to    Barletta   are   perhaps\n\ncompatible with his having received some training; but in substance\n\nhe took Mello's view that certain precautions should be taken only\n\nif the roof seemed too steep--hardly reflecting what the regulation\n\nmeans by \"adequate\" training.    On appeal, the company also claims\n\nthat Hinchcliff's out-of-court statement was hearsay, not binding\n\non the company; it may have been so, but the objection was not\n\nmade--nor the hearsay argument urged before the Commission--and is\n\nso waived.   29 U.S.C. § 660(a).     If the objection had been made,\n\nthe agency could have called Hinchcliff.\n\n          Defective equipment.     Finally, the company says that the\n\nCommission erred in upholding a citation (involving no financial\n\npenalty) for its use of defective safety equipment.        The photos\n\nshow that harness clips were extremely rusty and Holiday testified\n\nthat, when opened, one of the clips did not spring back to its\n\nlocked position.

(\"Capeway\"), a roofing contractor in Massachusetts, was fined by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (\"the Commission\") for safety violations. It now seeks review in this court. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a) (2000). The story is quickly told, reserving details for the discussion of individual claims of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 2000, two inspectors charged with enforcing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (\"the Act\") visited a site in Weymouth, Massachusetts, where Capeway was constructing roofing on a new firehouse. The firehouse had four roofs: one, high and steeply pitched, over the center of the garage; two wider and somewhat flatter roofs extending over the rest of the garage; and a lower flat roof over the living quarters attached to the garage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inspectors, Peter Barletta and James Holiday, according to their testimony, found that employees were working or walking on all four roofs without hardhats and without physical \"fall protection\" measures such as warning lines near roof edges. The inspectors interviewed Capeway supervisor Dennis Mello and the job foreman, Manny Araujo, who said they were acting as safety monitors; but (according to Barletta) Mello admitted that he used his own criteria rather than the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (\"OSHA\") requirements for deciding whether to use fall protection gear for the men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inspection turned up various other problems &#8212; improper scaffolding, lack of training, materials stacked close to the roof edge, and rusty safety equipment. In due course, the agency charged Capeway with nine violations; after an evidentiary hearing, the administrative law judge (\"the ALJ\") imposed a fine of $117,000, which the Commission upheld on review. In this court, Capeway contests seven of the nine violations, the penalties assessed, and the ALJ's handling of witness sequestration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On judicial review, the Commission's orders are to be upheld unless \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A) (2000). Fact findings are sustained if supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a). We begin with a central claim of procedural error and then take up the specific citations in dispute one by one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sequestration of witnesses.</i> Capeway opens by claiming that in his sequestration rulings the ALJ violated Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, made applicable by 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.71 (2004). In essence, Rule 615 requires that, upon a party's request, the presiding official exclude witnesses from the room \"so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses\" (and so tailor their own testimony). There is an exception for an officer or employee designated to represent a party that is \"not a natural person.\" Fed.R.Evid. 615.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing in this case, Barletta and Holiday testified to the violations, and the OSHA area director, Brenda Gordon, testified about the penalties. Barletta went first and, about halfway through his testimony, agency counsel asked for sequestration of witnesses. Capeway's lawyer objected but the ALJ ordered sequestration, adding that \"the compliance officer can stay\" &#8212; an apparent reference to Holiday &#8212; and that any other witnesses had to leave except that \"[c]lients can stay here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Capeway's lawyer asked that other witnesses for the agency also be sequestered, agency counsel said that Gordon would be the only witness for the agency beside the inspectors, and that she would be testifying about the penalties. The ALJ said that she could also stay, and Capeway counsel objected. Gordon and Holiday both stayed in the hearing as did Araujo, who did not testify. The company's only witness was Barry Metzler, Capeway's safety consultant, and it appears that he was sequestered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a footnote in its post-hearing memorandum, Capeway said as to the sequestration issue only that Holiday had tailored his testimony \"to address the weaknesses\" in Barletta's testimony. In his decision, the ALJ replied (also in a footnote) that he refused to strike Holiday's testimony because both Holiday and Gordon could stay under Rule 615 and because Capeway failed \"to identify even one instance\" where Holiday's testimony was \"suspect.\" On review, the two-member Commission panel found any error as to sequestration to be \"harmless.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, Capeway devotes to this issue ten pages of its brief enriched by the usual rhetoric (\"fundamental right to a fair trial,\" \"right to due process\"). The agency denies that there was any error at all, says that the issue was not properly preserved, and finally says that any error would have been harmless. We think that there probably was an error, although not one of major proportions; that the waiver issue is muddled; and that the error was patently harmless and does not deserve the fuss being made about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the agency designated Gordon or Holiday as its representative (it is not clear that the agency formally designated anyone), the bare language of Rule 615 suggests that only one of them should have stayed. Conceivably the agency could argue that Holiday was its representative and that Gordon, although also a witness, was testifying to an unrelated matter; there is a hint that the ALJ may have so viewed the situation. But we will assume arguendo, in the company's favor, that Holiday should have left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there is no indication whatever that Capeway was improperly prejudiced. The sequestration rule is concerned primarily with falsification: for example, that the second witness might testify to things he did not see but instead learned from the testimony of the first witness, or that he might alter his testimony to conform to that of the first, thereby strengthening it instead of undercutting it. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 615 &amp; 1972 advisory committee note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway makes no effort whatever to show that this occurred. Instead, it argues, with examples, that Holiday \"tailored\" his testimony by addressing points helpful to the charges against Capeway that Barletta had left out of his testimony. But in the ordinary case this is not improper prejudice: even if Holiday had been excluded, agency counsel would have been free to ask Holiday questions thereafter to cover any matters that Barletta had scanted or ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is often hard to prove actual prejudice where there has been a failure to sequester; and without delving into problems of burden of proof and the like, <i>see</i> 29 Wright &amp; Gold, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 6244 (1997), we would be open to a suggestion of prejudice where there was serious reason to believe that it had occurred. In this instance, there is nothing to suggest that Holiday lied and very little new that he added to the agency's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the violations found by the Commission. Under the Act, the Secretary of Labor is required to adopt workplace safety standards, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 655 (2000); those relating to \"fall protection\" at construction worksites occupy over 30 pages of the Code of Federal Regulations. 29 C.F.R. pt.1926, subpt. M (2004). The Act provides for civil penalties of up to $70,000 per offense for \"willful\" or \"repeat\" violations; for other violations, the cap is $7,000, and some penalty is required if the violation is \"serious.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lack of fall protection on the central pitched roof.</i> The agency imposed a fine of $63,000 on Capeway for willfully failing to use physical safety devices for employees working on the highest of the four roofs. The regulation invoked by the Commission requires such safety devices (harnesses, guardrails, or nets) for work on \"steep\" roofs six feet or more above \"lower levels\", 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.501(b)(11) (2004); \"steep\" is defined as a roof with a pitch greater than 4 in 12, and \"lower level\" is defined as any surface onto which an employee can fall. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.500(b) (2004). Along at least one edge, the roof in this case (with a pitch of 6 in 12) was over 20 feet above the ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway says that its use of safety monitors in lieu of physical safety devices was permitted by a 1999 OSHA directive, which apparently allows such an alternative for some \"residential construction.\" Although the relevant regulation does not define \"residential construction,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.501(b)(13), the Commission ruled that under the directive the firehouse did not qualify because (as is undisputed) the building's frame was made of steel and concrete. By contrast, the directive says that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Residential construction is characterized by:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materials: Wood framing (not steel or concrete); wooden floor joists and roof structures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Methods: Traditional wood frame construction techniques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OSHA Instruction STD 3-0.1A (June 18, 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special treatment for \"residential construction\" appears to rest on the agency's view that a wood-based structure may be a less sturdy platform for physical restraint systems like guardrails and harnesses. <i>Cf.</i> 64 Fed.Reg. 38078, 38079, 38081-82 (July 14, 1999); 58 Fed.Reg. 16515, 16516-17 (March 29, 1993). Given this rationale, argued by the agency, and the directive's language expressly connecting \"residential construction\" to wood-framed buildings, the Commission's decision is clearly sound &#8212; quite apart from the deference due to the agency in reading its own directive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway says that the workers were installing plywood, tar-paper, and shingles on the top roof, which is a common finishing for residential buildings, and that another contractor had done the building itself. This is irrelevant. The language just quoted ties \"residential construction\" status to the underlying structural elements of the building. Given the asserted rationale, this makes perfect sense. Whoever built the underlying structure, Capeway was exposing its own workers to a forbidden risk. The agency cases Capeway cites do not salvage its position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the willfulness finding, the term is not defined but we have equated it with awareness that the conduct violates the regulation or, alternatively, reckless disregard for the rules. <i>See Brock v. Morello Bros. Constr. Inc.,</i> 809 F.2d 161, 163-65 (1st Cir.1987). In this case, Mello admitted to Barletta at the site that he used his own judgment about whether the roof was steep enough to warrant greater precautions instead of the pitch standard in the regulations; and the company had been previously cited for violating the same regulation. This is enough \"substantial evidence\" to support the finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway is mistaken in saying that a chance remark by the Commission &#8212; that Capeway should have known that the residential standard did not apply &#8212; shows that the Commission used a negligence rather than a reckless disregard standard. It is also of no moment that Capeway's safety consultant Barry Metzler said that he believed that the residential standard applied; it plainly did not. In all events, the willfulness finding rested solidly on the admissions made at the site and on Capeway's history of violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Hardhats.</i> The Commission fined Capeway $2,800 for allowing workers to operate without hardhats when exposed to overhead hazards. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.100(a) (2004). The company says that photographs taken by the inspectors show that some workers were wearing hardhats; but they also show that other workers were not. Capeway says that those without hardhats may have been working for other employers, but Barletta testified that most of the workers on the roof, where Capeway alone was working, had only put on their hardhats after the inspection conference began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for exposure to overhead hazards, Capeway says that there were no overhead hazards for workers already on the roofs. Putting aside Barletta's view that the whole site was a hardhat area, anyone climbing the ladders to the roofs was exposed to falling objects (materials were in fact stored too close to roof edges); the agency was arguably entitled to infer that those on the roof not wearing hardhats when Barletta arrived had not worn them on the climb; and one man was so photographed on his ascent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Safety monitors.</i> A $4,000 fine was imposed for failure to use proper safety monitoring, whereby certain workers are designated to see that others do not stray too close to the edge. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.502(h) (2004). Other weaknesses in monitoring aside, the Commission supportably found that at times Araujo was the only monitor and was not (as required) on the same roofing surface as the workers he was monitoring, and that even two monitors could not adequately have watched work activities on all four roofs. There is nothing to this claim of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Flat roof fall protection.</i> The agency imposed a $28,000 fine for a \"repeat\" violation, meaning that a prior citation had been issued for the same offense, because <i>inter alia</i> there was no physical fall protection on the lowest roof &#8212; exposing workers to a 13-foot fall to the ground. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.501(b)(10) (2004). Capeway had been cited three times in the prior three years for violating the same regulation. Araujo admitted that on the workday before the inspection, some work had been done on the lower roof without such protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway says in this court that Araujo's admission was made only to Holiday and that Mello had told the inspectors that the work on the lower roof had been completed two weeks before. The Commission was entitled to credit Araujo's statement over Mello's even if it were made only to Holiday (we have already rejected the \"gap-filling\" attack); but as it happens the admission was also made to Barletta (which the Commission overlooked).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Materials storage.</i> In another \"repeat\" violation, the Commission fined Capeway $8,000 for storing materials within six feet of the edge of the lower flat roof despite the lack of guardrails. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.502(j)(7)(i). Capeway says that no roofing work was being done on the lower roof (the regulation applied to storage \"[d]uring the performance of roofing work\") and that the materials were not being \"stored\" but were there only temporarily, awaiting the arrival of transportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roofing work was being performed on the site, even if it was not occurring on the lower roof level. Certainly materials stored too close to a roof edge could be toppled in various ways and fall on workers below, whether or not roofing was being conducted on the same level. We need not reach the agency's further argument that its own regulations define \"roofing work\" to include \"storage,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.500(b), or the counter-argument that this interpolation would effectively render the \"[d]uring the performance of roofing work\" language a nullity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the alleged \"temporary\" character of the storage, the regulation cannot reasonably apply to materials in the process of being moved over the side, but the Commission adopted no such foolish reading. Rather, there is no evidence that such transportation was in progress, even if Mello is credited in his claim that the company planned to move the material sometime later \"that morning\" when the moving equipment became available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lack of training.</i> In a third \"repeat\" violation, Capeway suffered a $6,000 fine for failing to train one of its employees &#8212; David Hinchcliff &#8212; in fall protection. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.503(a)(1) (2004). Apart from its \"repeat\" status, the violation would not have warranted so severe an award. The company did present evidence of a training program, but the agency also showed that Hinchcliff had not been properly trained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchcliff's statements to Barletta are perhaps compatible with his having received some training; but in substance he took Mello's view that certain precautions should be taken only if the roof seemed too steep &#8212; hardly reflecting what the regulation means by \"adequate\" training. On appeal, the company also claims that Hinchcliff's out-of-court statement was hearsay, not binding on the company; it may have been so, but the objection was not made &#8212; nor the hearsay argument urged before the Commission &#8212; and is so waived. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a). If the objection had been made, the agency could have called Hinchcliff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Defective equipment.</i> Finally, the company says that the Commission erred in upholding a citation (involving no financial penalty) for its use of defective safety equipment. The photos show that harness clips were extremely rusty and Holiday testified that, when opened, one of the clips did not spring back to its locked position. Capeway says that it cannot be criticized for using the harness since the inspectors said that it was better than nothing; but the citation, amply supported, is for failing to remove defective equipment from service. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 502(d)(21) (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway's detailed and inventive 56-page opening brief is an exercise in hopeless ingenuity.

The firehouse had four roofs: one, high and steeply pitched, over the center of the garage; two wider and somewhat flatter roofs extending over the rest of the garage; and a lower flat roof over the living quarters attached to the garage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inspectors, Peter Barletta and James Holiday, according to their testimony, found that employees were working or walking on all four roofs without hardhats and without physical \"fall protection\" measures such as warning lines near roof edges. The inspectors interviewed Capeway supervisor Dennis Mello and the job foreman, Manny Araujo, who said they were acting as safety monitors; but (according to Barletta) Mello admitted that he used his own criteria rather than the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (\"OSHA\") requirements for deciding whether to use fall protection gear for the men.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inspection turned up various other problems &#8212; improper scaffolding, lack of training, materials stacked close to the roof edge, and rusty safety equipment. In due course, the agency charged Capeway with nine violations; after an evidentiary hearing, the administrative law judge (\"the ALJ\") imposed a fine of $117,000, which the Commission upheld on review. In this court, Capeway contests seven of the nine violations, the penalties assessed, and the ALJ's handling of witness sequestration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On judicial review, the Commission's orders are to be upheld unless \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A) (2000). Fact findings are sustained if supported by substantial evidence. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a). We begin with a central claim of procedural error and then take up the specific citations in dispute one by one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sequestration of witnesses.</i> Capeway opens by claiming that in his sequestration rulings the ALJ violated Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, made applicable by 29 C.F.R. &#167; 2200.71 (2004). In essence, Rule 615 requires that, upon a party's request, the presiding official exclude witnesses from the room \"so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses\" (and so tailor their own testimony). There is an exception for an officer or employee designated to represent a party that is \"not a natural person.\" Fed.R.Evid. 615.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing in this case, Barletta and Holiday testified to the violations, and the OSHA area director, Brenda Gordon, testified about the penalties. Barletta went first and, about halfway through his testimony, agency counsel asked for sequestration of witnesses. Capeway's lawyer objected but the ALJ ordered sequestration, adding that \"the compliance officer can stay\" &#8212; an apparent reference to Holiday &#8212; and that any other witnesses had to leave except that \"[c]lients can stay here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Capeway's lawyer asked that other witnesses for the agency also be sequestered, agency counsel said that Gordon would be the only witness for the agency beside the inspectors, and that she would be testifying about the penalties. The ALJ said that she could also stay, and Capeway counsel objected. Gordon and Holiday both stayed in the hearing as did Araujo, who did not testify. The company's only witness was Barry Metzler, Capeway's safety consultant, and it appears that he was sequestered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a footnote in its post-hearing memorandum, Capeway said as to the sequestration issue only that Holiday had tailored his testimony \"to address the weaknesses\" in Barletta's testimony. In his decision, the ALJ replied (also in a footnote) that he refused to strike Holiday's testimony because both Holiday and Gordon could stay under Rule 615 and because Capeway failed \"to identify even one instance\" where Holiday's testimony was \"suspect.\" On review, the two-member Commission panel found any error as to sequestration to be \"harmless.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, Capeway devotes to this issue ten pages of its brief enriched by the usual rhetoric (\"fundamental right to a fair trial,\" \"right to due process\"). The agency denies that there was any error at all, says that the issue was not properly preserved, and finally says that any error would have been harmless. We think that there probably was an error, although not one of major proportions; that the waiver issue is muddled; and that the error was patently harmless and does not deserve the fuss being made about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the agency designated Gordon or Holiday as its representative (it is not clear that the agency formally designated anyone), the bare language of Rule 615 suggests that only one of them should have stayed. Conceivably the agency could argue that Holiday was its representative and that Gordon, although also a witness, was testifying to an unrelated matter; there is a hint that the ALJ may have so viewed the situation. But we will assume arguendo, in the company's favor, that Holiday should have left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there is no indication whatever that Capeway was improperly prejudiced. The sequestration rule is concerned primarily with falsification: for example, that the second witness might testify to things he did not see but instead learned from the testimony of the first witness, or that he might alter his testimony to conform to that of the first, thereby strengthening it instead of undercutting it. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 615 &amp; 1972 advisory committee note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway makes no effort whatever to show that this occurred. Instead, it argues, with examples, that Holiday \"tailored\" his testimony by addressing points helpful to the charges against Capeway that Barletta had left out of his testimony. But in the ordinary case this is not improper prejudice: even if Holiday had been excluded, agency counsel would have been free to ask Holiday questions thereafter to cover any matters that Barletta had scanted or ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is often hard to prove actual prejudice where there has been a failure to sequester; and without delving into problems of burden of proof and the like, <i>see</i> 29 Wright &amp; Gold, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 6244 (1997), we would be open to a suggestion of prejudice where there was serious reason to believe that it had occurred. In this instance, there is nothing to suggest that Holiday lied and very little new that he added to the agency's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the violations found by the Commission. Under the Act, the Secretary of Labor is required to adopt workplace safety standards, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 655 (2000); those relating to \"fall protection\" at construction worksites occupy over 30 pages of the Code of Federal Regulations. 29 C.F.R. pt.1926, subpt. M (2004). The Act provides for civil penalties of up to $70,000 per offense for \"willful\" or \"repeat\" violations; for other violations, the cap is $7,000, and some penalty is required if the violation is \"serious.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 666 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lack of fall protection on the central pitched roof.</i> The agency imposed a fine of $63,000 on Capeway for willfully failing to use physical safety devices for employees working on the highest of the four roofs. The regulation invoked by the Commission requires such safety devices (harnesses, guardrails, or nets) for work on \"steep\" roofs six feet or more above \"lower levels\", 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.501(b)(11) (2004); \"steep\" is defined as a roof with a pitch greater than 4 in 12, and \"lower level\" is defined as any surface onto which an employee can fall. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.500(b) (2004). Along at least one edge, the roof in this case (with a pitch of 6 in 12) was over 20 feet above the ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway says that its use of safety monitors in lieu of physical safety devices was permitted by a 1999 OSHA directive, which apparently allows such an alternative for some \"residential construction.\" Although the relevant regulation does not define \"residential construction,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.501(b)(13), the Commission ruled that under the directive the firehouse did not qualify because (as is undisputed) the building's frame was made of steel and concrete. By contrast, the directive says that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Residential construction is characterized by:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Materials: Wood framing (not steel or concrete); wooden floor joists and roof structures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Methods: Traditional wood frame construction techniques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OSHA Instruction STD 3-0.1A (June 18, 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special treatment for \"residential construction\" appears to rest on the agency's view that a wood-based structure may be a less sturdy platform for physical restraint systems like guardrails and harnesses. <i>Cf.</i> 64 Fed.Reg. 38078, 38079, 38081-82 (July 14, 1999); 58 Fed.Reg. 16515, 16516-17 (March 29, 1993). Given this rationale, argued by the agency, and the directive's language expressly connecting \"residential construction\" to wood-framed buildings, the Commission's decision is clearly sound &#8212; quite apart from the deference due to the agency in reading its own directive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway says that the workers were installing plywood, tar-paper, and shingles on the top roof, which is a common finishing for residential buildings, and that another contractor had done the building itself. This is irrelevant. The language just quoted ties \"residential construction\" status to the underlying structural elements of the building. Given the asserted rationale, this makes perfect sense. Whoever built the underlying structure, Capeway was exposing its own workers to a forbidden risk. The agency cases Capeway cites do not salvage its position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the willfulness finding, the term is not defined but we have equated it with awareness that the conduct violates the regulation or, alternatively, reckless disregard for the rules. <i>See Brock v. Morello Bros. Constr. Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481641\"><a href=\"/opinion/481641/william-e-brock-secretary-of-labor-v-morello-brothers-construction-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span>, 163-65 (1st Cir.1987). In this case, Mello admitted to Barletta at the site that he used his own judgment about whether the roof was steep enough to warrant greater precautions instead of the pitch standard in the regulations; and the company had been previously cited for violating the same regulation. This is enough \"substantial evidence\" to support the finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway is mistaken in saying that a chance remark by the Commission &#8212; that Capeway should have known that the residential standard did not apply &#8212; shows that the Commission used a negligence rather than a reckless disregard standard. It is also of no moment that Capeway's safety consultant Barry Metzler said that he believed that the residential standard applied; it plainly did not. In all events, the willfulness finding rested solidly on the admissions made at the site and on Capeway's history of violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Hardhats.</i> The Commission fined Capeway $2,800 for allowing workers to operate without hardhats when exposed to overhead hazards. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.100(a) (2004). The company says that photographs taken by the inspectors show that some workers were wearing hardhats; but they also show that other workers were not. Capeway says that those without hardhats may have been working for other employers, but Barletta testified that most of the workers on the roof, where Capeway alone was working, had only put on their hardhats after the inspection conference began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for exposure to overhead hazards, Capeway says that there were no overhead hazards for workers already on the roofs. Putting aside Barletta's view that the whole site was a hardhat area, anyone climbing the ladders to the roofs was exposed to falling objects (materials were in fact stored too close to roof edges); the agency was arguably entitled to infer that those on the roof not wearing hardhats when Barletta arrived had not worn them on the climb; and one man was so photographed on his ascent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Safety monitors.</i> A $4,000 fine was imposed for failure to use proper safety monitoring, whereby certain workers are designated to see that others do not stray too close to the edge. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.502(h) (2004). Other weaknesses in monitoring aside, the Commission supportably found that at times Araujo was the only monitor and was not (as required) on the same roofing surface as the workers he was monitoring, and that even two monitors could not adequately have watched work activities on all four roofs. There is nothing to this claim of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Flat roof fall protection.</i> The agency imposed a $28,000 fine for a \"repeat\" violation, meaning that a prior citation had been issued for the same offense, because <i>inter alia</i> there was no physical fall protection on the lowest roof &#8212; exposing workers to a 13-foot fall to the ground. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.501(b)(10) (2004). Capeway had been cited three times in the prior three years for violating the same regulation. Araujo admitted that on the workday before the inspection, some work had been done on the lower roof without such protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway says in this court that Araujo's admission was made only to Holiday and that Mello had told the inspectors that the work on the lower roof had been completed two weeks before. The Commission was entitled to credit Araujo's statement over Mello's even if it were made only to Holiday (we have already rejected the \"gap-filling\" attack); but as it happens the admission was also made to Barletta (which the Commission overlooked).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Materials storage.</i> In another \"repeat\" violation, the Commission fined Capeway $8,000 for storing materials within six feet of the edge of the lower flat roof despite the lack of guardrails. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.502(j)(7)(i). Capeway says that no roofing work was being done on the lower roof (the regulation applied to storage \"[d]uring the performance of roofing work\") and that the materials were not being \"stored\" but were there only temporarily, awaiting the arrival of transportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roofing work was being performed on the site, even if it was not occurring on the lower roof level. Certainly materials stored too close to a roof edge could be toppled in various ways and fall on workers below, whether or not roofing was being conducted on the same level. We need not reach the agency's further argument that its own regulations define \"roofing work\" to include \"storage,\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.500(b), or the counter-argument that this interpolation would effectively render the \"[d]uring the performance of roofing work\" language a nullity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the alleged \"temporary\" character of the storage, the regulation cannot reasonably apply to materials in the process of being moved over the side, but the Commission adopted no such foolish reading. Rather, there is no evidence that such transportation was in progress, even if Mello is credited in his claim that the company planned to move the material sometime later \"that morning\" when the moving equipment became available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Lack of training.</i> In a third \"repeat\" violation, Capeway suffered a $6,000 fine for failing to train one of its employees &#8212; David Hinchcliff &#8212; in fall protection. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1926.503(a)(1) (2004). Apart from its \"repeat\" status, the violation would not have warranted so severe an award. The company did present evidence of a training program, but the agency also showed that Hinchcliff had not been properly trained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchcliff's statements to Barletta are perhaps compatible with his having received some training; but in substance he took Mello's view that certain precautions should be taken only if the roof seemed too steep &#8212; hardly reflecting what the regulation means by \"adequate\" training. On appeal, the company also claims that Hinchcliff's out-of-court statement was hearsay, not binding on the company; it may have been so, but the objection was not made &#8212; nor the hearsay argument urged before the Commission &#8212; and is so waived. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 660(a). If the objection had been made, the agency could have called Hinchcliff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Defective equipment.</i> Finally, the company says that the Commission erred in upholding a citation (involving no financial penalty) for its use of defective safety equipment. The photos show that harness clips were extremely rusty and Holiday testified that, when opened, one of the clips did not spring back to its locked position. Capeway says that it cannot be criticized for using the harness since the inspectors said that it was better than nothing; but the citation, amply supported, is for failing to remove defective equipment from service. 29 C.F.R. &#167; 502(d)(21) (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Capeway's detailed and inventive 56-page opening brief is an exercise in hopeless ingenuity.
