On March 3, 2003, defendant-\n\nappellant Germán González-Mercado pleaded guilty to three counts of\n\ncarjacking      and    two    counts   of     aggravated     carjacking    (i.e.,\n\ncarjacking resulting in serious bodily injury).                    See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2119(1), (2).       The district court sentenced him to a total of 600\n\nmonths in prison.       On appeal, González-Mercado seeks to challenge\n\nthe validity of his guilty pleas, the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence underpinning his conviction on one of the five counts, and\n\nhis sentence.         Concluding, as we do, that these assignments of\n\nerror are meritless, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n             On January 30, 2002, a federal grand jury sitting in the\n\nDistrict   of    Puerto      Rico   returned    an    indictment   charging     the\n\nappellant with three counts of aiding and abetting carjackings in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2119(1) and two counts of aiding and\n\nabetting aggravated carjackings in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2,\n\n2119(2).      The     indictment    alleged    that    the   appellant    and   his\n\nconfederates had appropriated five motor vehicles.                 Specifically,\n\ncount one charged that the appellant and Miguel Alamo Castro\n\n(Alamo) carjacked a Toyota Echo on December 31, 2001; count two\n\ncharged that the appellant, Alamo, and Ismael Ortega Santana\n\n(Ortega) carjacked a Nissan Xterra on January 10, 2002; count three\n\ncharged that the appellant and Alamo carjacked a Chevrolet Cavalier\n\non January 14, 2002; count four charged that the appellant and\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fAlamo carjacked a Nissan Pathfinder on the same date; and count\n\nfive charged that the appellant and Ortega carjacked a Mitsubishi\n\nMontero on January 24, 2002.      In two instances (counts one and\n\nthree), the indictment further charged that the carjackings had\n\nresulted in   serious   bodily   injury   in   violation   of   18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2119(2).\n\n          The appellant initially maintained his innocence.              He\n\nsubsequently moved both to change his pleas and to dismiss count\n\nthree insofar as it charged aggravated carjacking. In a memorandum\n\naccompanying the motion to dismiss, he argued that the incident\n\ngiving rise to the \"serious bodily injury\" allegation — the rape of\n\na woman known as G.K.L. — did not suffice to trigger liability for\n\naggravated carjacking. The appellant's thesis ran as follows. The\n\ncrime of carjacking requires, inter alia, the taking of a motor\n\nvehicle \"from the person or presence of another by force and\n\nviolence or by intimidation.\"      18 U.S.C. § 2119.        If, however,\n\n\"serious bodily injury . . . results,\" the crime becomes aggravated\n\ncarjacking, a separate and distinct offense punishable under the\n\nheightened penalty provisions contained in 18 U.S.C. § 2119(2).\n\nWhile the appellant concedes that rape qualifies as a serious\n\nbodily injury within the purview of section 2119(2), see United\n\nStates v. Vazquez-Rivera, 135 F.3d 172, 174-75 (1st Cir. 1998), he\n\nargues that the rape of G.K.L. was independent of, and thus did not\n\n\"result\" from, the taking of a motor vehicle.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f            The question of a change of plea was held in abeyance\n\npending the disposition of the motion to dismiss.                   The parties\n\nstipulated to the facts underlying count three.              We summarize them\n\nhere.\n\n            On January 14, 2002, Alamo and the appellant, aiding and\n\nabetting one another, took a Chevrolet Cavalier from Gerald Morales\n\nby means of force and intimidation (including the brandishing of\n\nwhat    appeared    to   be   firearms).      With     Morales   and     Morales's\n\npassenger, Héctor Berrios, in the vehicle and the appellant at the\n\nwheel, the carjackers drove to various ATM machines and forced\n\nMorales at gunpoint to withdraw cash from his account.                   When that\n\nsource of funds had been exhausted, Morales, in response to the\n\nappellant's    demands,       indicated    that   he   had   keys   to    G.K.L.'s\n\napartment and that the carjackers might be able to obtain more\n\nmoney there.       Intrigued by this possibility, the carjackers drove\n\nto the apartment complex.         Upon their arrival, they locked Berrios\n\n(whose hands had been tied with his own shoelaces) in the trunk of\n\nMorales's automobile.         The appellant retained the car keys.\n\n            Morales escorted the carjackers into G.K.L.'s apartment.\n\nThe men entered G.K.L.'s bedroom and awoke her, demanding money.\n\nShe replied that she had no cash and did not possess an ATM card.\n\nAt that point, Alamo and Morales receded into the living room, but\n\nthe appellant remained behind and raped G.K.L.               When the appellant\n\nemerged from the bedroom, the trio departed with G.K.L.'s cell\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fphone and several bottles of wine.            They then forced Berrios, at\n\ngunpoint, to direct them to his car (a Nissan Pathfinder).               Once\n\nthere, the appellant and Alamo perfected another carjacking (which\n\nbecame   the   subject   of   count    four    of   the   indictment).    The\n\ncarjackers did not release Morales and Berrios until they had made\n\nan unsuccessful attempt to empty Berrios's bank account.\n\n           Taking these facts into account, the district court, in\n\nan unpublished order, denied the motion to dismiss count three. In\n\nso ruling, the court rejected the appellant's contention that\n\nbecause G.K.L. was neither the owner of the carjacked vehicle nor\n\nphysically present at the time of the carjacking, the rape could\n\nnot be said to \"result\" from the carjacking offense.               The court\n\nnoted that in Vazquez-Rivera, we held that \"injuries covered [by\n\nsection 2119(2)] are not limited to those resulting from the\n\n'taking' of a vehicle, but also include those caused by the\n\ncarjacker at any point during his or her retention of the vehicle.\"\n\nId. at 178.    In the district court's view, that principle applied\n\nbecause, at the time of the rape, the appellant was still in\n\nretention of the carjacked vehicle, he kept the keys in his pocket,\n\nhe had a victim trapped in the car's trunk, and he held the car's\n\nowner under his command.      Thus, the serious bodily injury endured\n\nby G.K.L. could be said to \"result\" from the carjacking, as\n\nrequired by the statute.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f            Following the denial of his motion to dismiss, the\n\nappellant reactivated his motion for a change of plea.              After some\n\nskirmishing, not relevant here, the district court conducted a\n\nhearing   on     March   3,    2003.     The   change-of-plea     colloquy   was\n\nthorough.        Significantly,    the    appellant   admitted     during    that\n\ncolloquy that he and Alamo had placed Berrios in the trunk of\n\nMorales's vehicle; that he had retained the keys to the car during\n\nhis visit to G.K.L.'s abode; and that, while in possession of the\n\nkeys and in control of Berrios and Morales, he raped G.K.L.                 Based\n\non these admissions, the district court permitted the appellant to\n\nenter a plea of guilty to count three as well as to the other four\n\ncounts of the indictment.         The court also ordered the preparation\n\nof a presentence investigation report (PSI Report) and set the case\n\nfor sentencing.\n\n            On    June   16,    2003,   the    district   court   convened    the\n\ndisposition hearing.          The court ascertained that defense counsel\n\nhad discussed the PSI Report with the appellant and fully explained\n\nits contents to him. The appellant acknowledged that he understood\n\nwhat the report said.          For all intents and purposes, the defense\n\nraised no objections to the PSI Report.1              The court then stated\n\nthat, in the absence of any material objections to the PSI Report,\n\nit would adopt the findings contained therein.\n\n\n     1\n      The only misgiving that defense counsel voiced was an\nextremely minor correction to the report that had nothing to do\nwith any of the issues on appeal.\n\n                                        -6-\n\f              The court calculated a guideline sentencing range of 360\n\nmonths to life (total offense level — 40; criminal history category\n\n— III).   It sentenced the appellant to serve 600 months in prison,\n\nimposing consecutive 300-month terms for each of counts one and\n\nthree, and concurrent 180-month terms for each of counts two, four,\n\nand five.       Individually, each of these terms represented the\n\nstatutory maximum for the offense of conviction.            See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   2119(2)    (setting   a   twenty-five-year   maximum   for   aggravated\n\ncarjacking); id. § 2119(1) (setting a fifteen-year maximum for\n\nsimple carjacking).       The court also ordered a supervised release\n\nterm of five years, a special assessment of $500, and restitution\n\nin the amount of $5,950.        This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n              González-Mercado seeks to challenge the validity of his\n\nguilty pleas, his conviction on count three, and his sentence.           We\n\nconsider each challenge in turn.\n\n                  A.   The Validity of the Guilty Pleas.\n\n              In supplemental briefing and a letter submitted pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. App. P. 28(j), the appellant maintains that his pleas as\n\nto all five counts must be set aside because they were not entered\n\nin conformity with Fed. R. Crim. P. 11.          To elaborate, he insists\n\nthat his pleas were not tendered intelligently because they were\n\nbased upon a mistaken understanding of the operation of the federal\n\nsentencing guidelines.        Although a guilty plea waives most claims\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fof error, it does not preclude an attack on the voluntary and\n\nintelligent   character    of   the    plea    itself.        See   Tollett    v.\n\nHenderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973).\n\n           This   claim   derives     from    the   Supreme    Court's   recent\n\ndecision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).                   The\n\nBooker Court held that \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction)\n\nwhich is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum\n\nauthorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury\n\nverdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt,\" id. at 756, insofar as the sentence is\n\nimposed under a mandatory guideline regime, see id. at 756-57, 767-\n\n68. The appellant posits that his guilty pleas are invalid because\n\nthey were not informed by that holding (and, thus, were tendered on\n\nthe   erroneous   assumption    that   the    sentencing      guidelines   were\n\nmandatory).\n\n           We have heard and rejected this argument before.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Sahlin, 399 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding\n\nthat \"the possibility of a favorable change in the law occurring\n\nafter a plea is one of the normal risks that accompany a guilty\n\nplea\"); see also Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 757 (1970)\n\n(stating that \"a voluntary plea of guilty intelligently made in\n\nlight of the then applicable law does not become vulnerable because\n\nlater judicial decisions indicate that the plea rested on a faulty\n\npremise\"). Under the doctrine of stare decisis, then, the issue is\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fforeclosed.    See Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 348\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (explaining that \"the doctrine of stare decisis\n\nprecludes the relitigation of legal issues that have previously\n\nbeen   heard    and    authoritatively   determined\");   Gately   v.\n\nMassachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221, 1226 (1st Cir. 1993) (stating that\n\nstare decisis \"renders the ruling of law in a case binding in\n\nfuture cases before the same court or other courts owing obedience\n\nto the decision\").    As we explained in Sahlin, 399 F.3d at 31, the\n\nBooker decision, in and of itself, does not undermine the validity\n\nof the appellant's guilty pleas.\n\n                 B.   The Conviction on Count Three.\n\n          The appellant's next attack is more narrowly focused. He\n\nasseverates that the district court erred in imposing a 300-month\n\nsentence on count three because the sexual assault of G.K.L. did\n\nnot \"result\" from the Morales carjacking.   This asseveration rests\n\non the premise that the district court should have sentenced the\n\nappellant in accordance with section 2119(1), which defines the\n\ncrime of simple carjacking and caps sentences at fifteen years,\n\nrather than section 2119(2), which defines the crime of aggravated\n\ncarjacking (i.e., carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury)\n\nand caps sentences at twenty-five years.\n\n          This argument is beset with problems.   Most prominently,\n\nit ignores the decision in Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227\n\n(1999), in which the Supreme Court held that section 2119 does not\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fdefine a single crime with a choice of penalties dependent on\n\nsentencing      factors   but,   rather,     \"establish[es]    three    separate\n\noffenses [section 2119(1), section 2119(2), and section 2119(3)] by\n\nthe specification of distinct elements, each of which must be\n\ncharged by indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and\n\nsubmitted to a jury for its verdict,\" id. at 252.                 Just as the\n\nJones Court recognized that a defendant found guilty of an offense\n\nunder section 2119(1) could not be sentenced under section 2119(2),\n\nsee id. at 229, so too we recognize that a defendant who pleads\n\nguilty    to     a   violation   of   section    2119(2)   cannot      claim   an\n\nentitlement to be sentenced under the more forgiving penalty\n\nprovisions of section 2119(1).\n\n               This is an important distinction for the purposes of this\n\ncase.    18 U.S.C. § 2119 contains three separate sections, defining\n\nthree separate crimes (we have not mentioned section 2119(3)\n\nbecause that provision has no bearing on this case).                Inasmuch as\n\nthe three sections of 18 U.S.C. § 2119 limn separate offenses, the\n\nappropriate forum for contesting the applicability of any one\n\nsection to the facts of a particular case is the guilt phase of the\n\nproceeding — not the sentencing phase.\n\n               Here, however, the appellant bypassed that opportunity by\n\nelecting to enter an unconditional guilty plea.               That plea waived\n\nall non-jurisdictional challenges to the resulting conviction under\n\nsection 2119(2), save claims that the plea was not knowing and\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fvoluntary.    See United States v. Rodriguez-Castillo, 350 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (\"An unconditional guilty plea waives any and all\n\nindependent non-jurisdictional claims arising out of alleged errors\n\nantedating the plea.\"); United States v. Cordero, 42 F.3d 697, 698\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (observing that \"an unconditional guilty plea\n\ninsulates virtually all earlier rulings in the case from appellate\n\nreview\").\n\n             The appellant tries to parry this thrust in two different\n\nways.    First, he notes that he did raise a challenge to the\n\napplicability of section 2119(2) in his motion to dismiss count\n\nthree.   That is true as far as it goes, but it does not go very\n\nfar. The appellant failed to preserve the issue for review when he\n\nentered an unconditional guilty plea to count three. He could have\n\nattempted to avail himself of the procedure described in Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(a)(2), which allows a criminal defendant, with the\n\nconsent of the court and the government, to preserve the right to\n\nappeal an adverse determination on a specific pretrial motion by\n\nentering a conditional guilty plea, but he did not do so.       Under\n\nthese circumstances, his motion to dismiss died a natural death and\n\nhe cannot now resurrect it.\n\n             The appellant also seeks, albeit somewhat perfunctorily,\n\nto make an end run around the waiver that normally would flow from\n\nthe entry of an unconditional guilty plea.       The waiver doctrine\n\ndoes not apply to jurisdictional claims, see Cordero, 42 F.3d at\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f699,   so    the    appellant     labors      to   cast   his    challenge   to   the\n\nconviction on count three as jurisdictional in nature.                    He argues,\n\nin effect, that the stipulated facts do not establish a necessary\n\nelement of the offense, namely, that the rape resulted from the\n\ncarjacking and that, because the admitted conduct does not amount\n\nto a violation of the statute of conviction, the district court\n\nlacked jurisdiction to convict him.\n\n             The most gaping hole in this argument is that it cannot\n\nproperly     be    classified     as    jurisdictional       (and,   therefore,     as\n\nsubject to review notwithstanding the appellant's unconditional\n\nguilty plea).       In arguing to the contrary, the appellant clings to\n\nUnited States v. Rosa-Ortiz, 348 F.3d 33 (1st Cir. 2003), in which\n\nwe recognized that a \"guilty plea does not preclude [a defendant]\n\nfrom arguing on appeal that the statute of conviction does not\n\nactually proscribe the conduct charged in the indictment,\" id. at\n\n36.      We added that \"a federal court has jurisdiction to try\n\ncriminal cases only when the information or indictment alleges a\n\nviolation of a valid federal law,\" id. (quoting United States v.\n\nSaade,      652    F.2d   1126,        1134   (1st    Cir.      1981)),   and     that\n\n\"jurisdictional challenges to an indictment may be raised at any\n\ntime,\" regardless of the defendant's guilty plea, id.\n\n             The case at hand is a horse of a different hue.                      The\n\nappellant has not argued that the district court lacked authority\n\nto hear the case in the first instance because the indictment\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\ffailed to charge a cognizable federal offense.                  Nor could such an\n\nargument prevail.           Each of the five counts charged crimes within\n\nthe competence of the district court; count three charged in plain\n\nterms that a carjacking occurred, which \"result[ed] in serious\n\nbodily injury\" by reason of the appellant's sexual assault of\n\nG.K.L.     That language sufficiently alleged a violation of section\n\n2119(2).    This is dispositive of the appellant's argument because,\n\nwith few exceptions (none applicable here), \"a federal criminal\n\ncase is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the district\n\ncourt if the indictment charges . . . that the defendant committed\n\na crime described in [a federal criminal statute].\"                    United States\n\nv. González, 311 F.3d 440, 442 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n             Even if the appellant's allegation that the admitted\n\nfacts are insufficient as a matter of law to satisfy the \"results\"\n\nelement of aggravated carjacking were accurate — and we doubt that\n\nit   is2    —       that    allegation       would   not   raise      a        cognizable\n\njurisdictional defect.            In United States v. Valdez-Santana, 279\n\nF.3d 143 (1st Cir. 2002), we rebuffed an attempt to shoehorn what\n\nwas, in essence, a contention that admissible evidence could not\n\nestablish       a    violation    of   the   charged    crime   into      the    \"narrow\n\nexception\"          that   only   jurisdictional       issues   may       be    appealed\n\n\n\n     2\n      This court's precedents interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 2119(2)\nstrongly suggest that the appellant's rape of G.K.L. falls within\nthe statutory sweep. See, e.g., United States v. Lowe, 145 F.3d\n45, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1998); Vazquez-Rivera, 135 F.3d at 178.\n\n                                         -13-\n\ffollowing an unconditional guilty plea.     Id. at 145-46.    That\n\nholding followed inexorably from our statement in Cordero, 42 F.3d\n\nat 699, in which we said that \"a jurisdictional defect is one that\n\ncalls into doubt a court's power to entertain a matter, not one\n\nthat merely calls into doubt the sufficiency or quantum of proof\n\nrelating to guilt.\"     See also United States v. Cruz-Rivera, 357\n\nF.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that the characterization of\n\nthe argument that the factual underpinnings of a guilty plea do not\n\nestablish an element of the offense as a jurisdictional challenge\n\n\"confuses the constitutional limits on Congress's power with the\n\njurisdiction of the federal courts\"); González, 311 F.3d at 443\n\n(determining that the category of jurisdictional defects that are\n\nnot waived by a guilty plea does not include \"routine questions as\n\nto the reach and application of a criminal statute\" because such\n\nquestions have \"nothing whatever to do with the subject matter\n\n[jurisdiction] of the federal district court\").   These precedents\n\nare controlling here.\n\n          To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily.   We\n\nfind, without serious question, that the appellant's argument that\n\nhis admitted conduct does not satisfy the \"results\" element of\n\nsection 2119(2) is not jurisdictional in nature.     Consequently,\n\nfurther consideration of it is foreclosed by the appellant's\n\nunconditional guilty plea.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f                   C.   Alleged Sentencing Errors.\n\n          The entry of an unconditional guilty plea does not itself\n\nwaive challenges to the ensuing sentence.      Sahlin, 399 F.3d at 32.\n\nHere, the appellant advances two such challenges. We consider them\n\nseparately.\n\n          1.   Enhancement for Serious Bodily Harm.       The appellant\n\nsuggests that the district court erred when it applied a four-level\n\nenhancement to his adjusted offense level on count three. See USSG\n\n§2B3.1(b)(3) (allowing for the disputed enhancement \"[i]f any\n\nvictim sustained [serious] bodily injury\" in the course of the\n\ncarjacking).   This is too late and too little.\n\n          The suggestion is too late because the appellant neither\n\ninterposed an objection to the PSI Report (which recommended the\n\napplication of the enhancement) nor argued against the enhancement\n\nat sentencing.   At best, then, the point has been forfeited, and\n\nreview would be limited to plain error.          See United States v.\n\nRodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          In this instance, even plain error review is unavailable\n\nbecause the suggestion is not only too late but also too little.\n\nOn   appeal,   González-Mercado   has    not   offered   any   developed\n\nargumentation as to why it was error, let alone plain error, for\n\nthe sentencing court to apply section 2B3.1(b)(3).        This omission\n\nis all the more stark because the appellant admitted below that he\n\nraped G.K.L. while the carjacking was ongoing, that is, while\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fretaining control over both the carjacked vehicle and its occupants\n\n(Morales and Berrios).3       This failure must be deemed a waiver.\n\nSee, e.g., Muñiz v. Rovira, 373 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"It is\n\na bedrock appellate rule that issues raised perfunctorily, without\n\ndeveloped argumentation, will not be considered on appeal.\");\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (similar).\n\n          2.    Booker Claim.     Before us, the appellant raises for\n\nthe first time a challenge to his sentence premised upon the\n\ndistrict court's alleged error in making certain adjustments to the\n\noffense levels used to calculate his sentence under a preponderance\n\nof the evidence standard.4      These include a four-level \"grouping\"\n\nadjustment,    see   USSG   §3D1.4;    a     two-level   role-in-the-offense\n\nenhancement, see id. §3B1.1(c); the previously discussed four-level\n\n\"serious bodily injury\" enhancement, see id. §2B3.1(b)(3)(B); and\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      If and to the extent that the appellant intended to rely on\nhis argument that under 18 U.S.C. § 2119(2) the rape did not result\nfrom the carjacking, see supra Part II(B), his reliance is\nmisplaced. The applicable guideline does not track the language of\nthe statute; instead, it covers serious bodily injury to \"any\nvictim.\"    USSG §2B3.1(b)(3).    It is hard to conceive of any\ninterpretation of the phrase \"any victim\" that would exclude G.K.L.\nin the circumstances of this case. Cf. United States v. Hughes,\n211 F.3d 676, 691 (1st Cir. 2000) (concluding that the indefinite\nreference to \"victims\" in USSG §2B3.2(c)(1) contemplates all\nvictims of an extortion scheme, not merely the target of the\nextortionate demand).\n     4\n      The appellant also claims that the sentencing court made an\nimpermissible upward departure.    This claim is frivolous.   The\nguideline sentencing range was 360 months to life, and the court\nsentenced the appellant within that range.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fa   one-level    enhancement     for     amount    of      loss,   see    id.\n\n§2B3.1(b)(7)(B).5\n\n            The appellant did not object to any of these adjustments\n\nbelow.   In this court, however, he took the position that Blakely\n\nv. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), prohibited them. Subsequent\n\nto filing his brief, he submitted a letter under Fed. R. App. P.\n\n28(j), in    which   he   augmented    this   contention    with   a   general\n\nreference to Booker. He concedes that his Blakely/Booker challenge\n\n— for simplicity's sake, we henceforth refer to this as a claim of\n\nBooker error — was not preserved below and that, at most, he is\n\nentitled to plain error review.         See United States v. Olano, 507\n\nU.S. 725, 731-32 (1993); United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d\n\n68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            The plain error test is rigorous.       We have stated that:\n\n            Review for plain error entails four showings:\n            (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear\n            or obvious and which not only (3) affected the\n            defendant's substantial rights, but also (4)\n            seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n            public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nUnited States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).                 The\n\nappellant must carry the devoir of persuasion on all four facets of\n\nthe test.    See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Some of these adjustments applied to fewer than all of the\ncounts. For present purposes, however, such differentiations do\nnot matter.\n\n                                  -17-\n\f          In this case, the first two elements present no problem.\n\nThere is a Booker error, although it is not any of the alleged\n\nerrors that the appellant identifies.6     Booker teaches that the\n\nimposition of sentencing enhancements under a mandatory guidelines\n\nregime is erroneous.   See Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 750, 756-57.   Thus,\n\na Booker error has occurred when a sentencing court has treated the\n\nguidelines as mandatory rather than as advisory.     As we said in\n\nAntonakopoulos:\n\n          The Booker error is that the defendant's\n          Guidelines sentence was imposed under a\n          mandatory system.    The error is not that a\n          judge (by a preponderance of the evidence)\n          determined facts under the Guidelines which\n          increased a sentence beyond that authorized by\n          the jury verdict or an admission by the\n          defendant; the error is only that the judge\n          did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\n\n\n\n     6\n      Had the district court erred in making the factual findings\nunderlying these upward adjustments and, as a result, misapplied\nguideline enhancements in a way that increased the appellant's\nsentence, such errors would require resentencing even under our\npre-Booker precedents. United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix, ___ F.3d\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2005) [No. 02-2286, slip op. at 7].       Here,\nhowever, the appellant does not specifically contest the factual\nbasis for any of the enhancements, and it appears that the\nsentencing court had a solid factual basis for imposing them. The\ngrouping, leadership role, and serious bodily injury enhancements\nwere premised on facts that the appellant admitted during the\nchange-of-plea colloquy and reaffirmed through his acquiescence in\nthe PSI Report. The remaining enhancement was based upon a finding\nthat the amount of loss exceeded $10,000 per count.          While\nadmissions of record do not directly cover this point, the\nappellant, by his own acknowledgment, carjacked five late-model\nvehicles.   We think it likely that the value of each vehicle\nexceeded $10,000 — and the appellant has not even hinted to the\ncontrary. Consequently, in a pre-Booker world, there was no plain\nerror in ordering the upward adjustments.\n\n                                -18-\n\f399 F.3d at 75.    For purposes of this case, the Booker error must\n\nbe regarded as plain.    See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461,\n\n468 (1997) (stating that \"it is enough that the error be 'plain' at\n\nthe time of appellate consideration\").\n\n          It is at step three of the plain error pavane that the\n\nappellant's argument stumbles.    That prong requires a showing that\n\nthe error affected substantial rights.    Duarte, 246 F.3d at 60.   In\n\nregard to unpreserved Booker errors, our main third-prong concern\n\nis with the likelihood that the district court might have sentenced\n\nthe defendant more leniently in a post-Booker world in which the\n\nguidelines are only advisory.     See United States v. Heldeman, ___\n\nF.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2005) [No. 04-1915, slip op. at 7];\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75. The standard is one of \"reasonable\n\nprobability.\"     Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 78-79.\n\n          The appellant has not shown a reasonable probability —\n\nnot even a possibility — that the district court would have imposed\n\na different (more lenient) sentence had it understood that the\n\nsentencing guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory. That is\n\nfatal to his Booker claim.      See id. at 75; see also id. at 77\n\n(noting that the defendant bears the burden of persuasion with\n\nregard to the element of prejudice).        In this regard, it is\n\nespecially significant that, at oral argument — conducted after\n\nthis court had handed down its decision in Antonakopoulos — the\n\nappellant's counsel did not advance any viable theory as to how the\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fBooker error had prejudiced his client's substantial rights.    Nor\n\ndoes anything in the record suggest a basis for such an inference.\n\n           To cinch matters, we note that the guidelines, without\n\nany downward departure, would have allowed the court to impose an\n\naggregate sentence as low as 360 months for the grouped counts.\n\nThe court spurned that option and chose to sentence the appellant\n\nto nearly double that amount of prison time — a total of 600\n\nmonths.   The court explained that a sentence at the low end of the\n\nrange would ignore the horrific details of the specific offense\n\nconduct and \"depreciate the overall harm to the victims.\"      When,\n\nunder a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected\n\nto sentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the\n\nrange, that is a telling indication that the court, if acting under\n\nan advisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have imposed\n\nthe same sentence.   See United States v. Pratt, No. 04-30446, 2005\n\nWL 629824, at *6 (5th Cir. Mar. 18, 2005) (per curiam) (finding\n\nthat the district court's imposition of a sentence one year longer\n\nthan the minimum required under the guideline range contradicted\n\nthe defendant's effort to show a reasonable probability that he\n\nwould have received a lower sentence under an advisory guideline\n\nregime); United States v. Lee, 399 F.3d 864, 867 (7th Cir. 2005)\n\n(indicating confidence that defendant's substantial rights were not\n\naffected by the mandatory guideline regime because the district\n\ncourt had imposed the maximum available sentence).\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f            The sentence here is reasonable and, for the reasons\n\nstated above, we reject the appellant's request to vacate it on\n\nBooker grounds.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.    Discerning no merit in the\n\nappellant's various challenges, we affirm his convictions and\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

The district court sentenced him to a total of 600 months in prison. On appeal, Gonzalez-Mercado seeks to challenge the validity of his guilty pleas, the legal sufficiency of the evidence underpinning his conviction on one of the five counts, and his sentence. Concluding, as we do, that these assignments of error are meritless, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 2002, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned an indictment charging the appellant with three counts of aiding and abetting carjackings in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 2119(1) and two counts of aiding and abetting aggravated carjackings in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 2119(2). The indictment alleged that the appellant and his confederates had appropriated five motor vehicles. Specifically, count one charged that the appellant and Miguel Alamo Castro (Alamo) carjacked a Toyota Echo on December 31, 2001; count two charged that the appellant, Alamo, and Ismael Ortega Santana (Ortega) carjacked a Nissan Xterra on January 10, 2002; count three charged that the appellant and Alamo carjacked a Chevrolet Cavalier on January 14, 2002; count four charged that the appellant and Alamo carjacked a Nissan Pathfinder on the same date; and count five charged that the appellant and Ortega carjacked a Mitsubishi Montero on January 24, 2002. In two instances (counts one and three), the indictment further charged that the carjackings had resulted in serious bodily injury in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant initially maintained his innocence. He subsequently moved both to change his pleas and to dismiss count three insofar as it charged aggravated carjacking. In a memorandum accompanying the motion to dismiss, he argued that the incident giving rise to the \"serious bodily injury\" allegation &#8212; the rape of a woman known as G.K.L. &#8212; did not suffice to trigger liability for aggravated carjacking. The appellant's thesis ran as follows. The crime of carjacking requires, inter alia, the taking of a motor vehicle \"from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119. If, however, \"serious bodily injury ... results,\" the crime becomes aggravated carjacking, a separate and distinct offense punishable under the heightened penalty provisions contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2). While the appellant concedes that rape qualifies as a serious bodily injury within the purview of section 2119(2), <i>see United States v. Vazquez-Rivera,</i> 135 F.3d 172, 174-75 (1st Cir.1998), he argues that the rape of G.K.L. was independent of, and thus did not \"result\" from, the taking of a motor vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of a change of plea was held in abeyance pending the disposition of the motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated to the facts underlying count three. We summarize them here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 2002, Alamo and the appellant, aiding and abetting one another, took a Chevrolet Cavalier from Gerald Morales by means of force and intimidation (including the brandishing of what appeared to be firearms). With Morales and Morales's passenger, Hector Berrios, in the vehicle and the appellant at the wheel, the carjackers drove to various ATM machines and forced Morales at gunpoint to withdraw cash from his account. When that source of funds had been exhausted, Morales, in response to the appellant's demands, indicated that he had keys to G.K.L.'s apartment and that the carjackers might be able to obtain more money there. Intrigued by this possibility, the carjackers drove to the apartment complex. Upon their arrival, they locked Berrios (whose hands had been tied with his own shoelaces) in the trunk of Morales's automobile. The appellant retained the car keys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales escorted the carjackers into G.K.L.'s apartment. The men entered G.K.L.'s bedroom and awoke her, demanding money. She replied that she had no cash and did not possess an ATM card. At that point, Alamo and Morales receded into the living room, but the appellant remained behind and raped G.K.L. When the appellant emerged from the bedroom, the trio departed with G.K.L.'s cell phone and several bottles of wine. They then forced Berrios, at gunpoint, to direct them to his car (a Nissan Pathfinder). Once there, the appellant and Alamo perfected another carjacking (which became the subject of count four of the indictment). The carjackers did not release Morales and Berrios until they had made an unsuccessful attempt to empty Berrios's bank account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking these facts into account, the district court, in an unpublished order, denied the motion to dismiss count three. In so ruling, the court rejected the appellant's contention that because G.K.L. was neither the owner of the carjacked vehicle nor physically present at the time of the carjacking, the rape could not be said to \"result\" from the carjacking offense. The court noted that in <i>Vazquez-Rivera,</i> we held that \"injuries covered [by section 2119(2)] are not limited to those resulting from the `taking' of a vehicle, but also include those caused by the carjacker at any point during his or her retention of the vehicle.\" <i>Id.</i> at 178. In the district court's view, that principle applied because, at the time of the rape, the appellant was still in retention of the carjacked vehicle, he kept the keys in his pocket, he had a victim trapped in the car's trunk, and he held the car's owner under his command. Thus, the serious bodily injury endured by G.K.L. could be said to \"result\" from the carjacking, as required by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the denial of his motion to dismiss, the appellant reactivated his motion for a change of plea. After some skirmishing, not relevant here, the district court conducted a hearing on March 3, 2003. The change-of-plea colloquy was thorough. Significantly, the appellant admitted during that colloquy that he and Alamo had placed Berrios in the trunk of Morales's vehicle; that he had retained the keys to the car during his visit to G.K.L.'s abode; and that, while in possession of the keys and in control of Berrios and Morales, he raped G.K.L. Based on these admissions, the district court permitted the appellant to enter a plea of guilty to count three as well as to the other four counts of the indictment. The court also ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report (PSI Report) and set the case for sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, 2003, the district court convened the disposition hearing. The court ascertained that defense counsel had discussed the PSI Report with the appellant and fully explained its contents to him. The appellant acknowledged that he understood what the report said. For all intents and purposes, the defense raised no objections to the PSI Report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court then stated that, in the absence of any material objections to the PSI Report, it would adopt the findings contained therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court calculated a guideline sentencing range of 360 months to life (total offense level &#8212; 40; criminal history category &#8212; III). It sentenced the appellant to serve 600 months in prison, imposing consecutive 300-month terms for each of counts one and three, and concurrent 180-month terms for each of counts two, four, and five. Individually, each of these terms represented the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2) (setting a twenty-five-year maximum for aggravated carjacking); <i>id.</i> &#167; 2119(1) (setting a fifteen-year maximum for simple carjacking). The court also ordered a supervised release term of five years, a special assessment of $500, and restitution in the amount of $5,950. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

To elaborate, he insists that his pleas were not tendered intelligently because they were based upon a mistaken understanding of the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines. Although a guilty plea waives most claims of error, it does not preclude an attack on the voluntary and intelligent character of the plea itself. <i>See Tollett v. Henderson,</i> 411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claim derives from the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The <i>Booker</i> Court held that \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\" <i>id.</i> at 756, insofar as the sentence is imposed under a mandatory guideline regime, <i>see id.</i> at 756-57, 767-68. The appellant posits that his guilty pleas are invalid because they were not informed by that holding (and, thus, were tendered on the erroneous assumption that the sentencing guidelines were mandatory).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have heard and rejected this argument before. <i>See United States v. Sahlin,</i> 399 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2005) (holding that \"the possibility of a favorable change in the law occurring after a plea is one of the normal risks that accompany a guilty plea\"); <i>see also Brady v. United States,</i> 397 U.S. 742, 757, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970) (stating that \"a voluntary plea of guilty intelligently made in light of the then applicable law does not become vulnerable because later judicial decisions indicate that the plea rested on a faulty premise\"). Under the doctrine of stare decisis, then, the issue is foreclosed. <i>See Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> 386 F.3d 344, 348 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that \"the doctrine of stare decisis precludes the relitigation of legal issues that have previously been heard and authoritatively determined\"); <i>Gately v. Massachusetts,</i> 2 F.3d 1221, 1226 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that stare decisis \"renders the ruling of <i>law</i> in a case binding in future cases before the same court or other courts owing obedience to the decision\"). As we explained in <i>Sahlin,</i> 399 F.3d at 31, the <i>Booker</i> decision, in and of itself, does not undermine the validity of the appellant's guilty pleas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Conviction on Count Three.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's next attack is more narrowly focused. He asseverates that the district court erred in imposing a 300-month sentence on count three because the sexual assault of G.K.L. did not \"result\" from the Morales carjacking. This asseveration rests on the premise that the district court should have sentenced the appellant in accordance with section 2119(1), which defines the crime of simple carjacking and caps sentences at fifteen years, rather than section 2119(2), which defines the crime of aggravated carjacking (i.e., carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury) and caps sentences at twenty-five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is beset with problems. Most prominently, it ignores the decision in <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), in which the Supreme Court held that section 2119 does not define a single crime with a choice of penalties dependent on sentencing factors but, rather, \"establish[es] three separate offenses [section 2119(1), section 2119(2), and section 2119(3)] by the specification of distinct elements, each of which must be charged by indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and submitted to a jury for its verdict,\" <i>id.</i> at 252, 119 S.Ct. 1215. Just as the <i>Jones</i> Court recognized that a defendant found guilty of an offense under section 2119(1) could not be sentenced under section 2119(2), <i>see id.</i> at 229, 119 S.Ct. 1215, so too we recognize that a defendant who pleads guilty to a violation of section 2119(2) cannot claim an entitlement to be sentenced under the more forgiving penalty provisions of section 2119(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an important distinction for the purposes of this case. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 contains three separate sections, defining three separate crimes (we have not mentioned section 2119(3) because that provision has no bearing on this case). Inasmuch as the three sections of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 limn separate offenses, the appropriate forum for contesting the applicability of any one section to the facts of a particular case is the guilt phase of the proceeding &#8212; not the sentencing phase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the appellant bypassed that opportunity by electing to enter an unconditional guilty plea. That plea waived all non-jurisdictional challenges to the resulting conviction under section 2119(2), save claims that the plea was not knowing and voluntary. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez-Castillo,</i> 350 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2003) (\"An unconditional guilty plea waives any and all independent non-jurisdictional claims arising out of alleged errors antedating the plea.\"); <i>United States v. Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d 697, 698 (1st Cir.1994) (observing that \"an unconditional guilty plea insulates virtually all earlier rulings in the case from appellate review\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant tries to parry this thrust in two different ways. First, he notes that he did raise a challenge to the applicability of section 2119(2) in his motion to dismiss count three. That is true as far as it goes, but it does not go very far. The appellant failed to preserve the issue for review when he entered an unconditional guilty plea to count three. He could have attempted to avail himself of the procedure described in Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), which allows a criminal defendant, with the consent of the court and the government, to preserve the right to appeal an adverse determination on a specific pretrial motion by entering a conditional guilty plea, but he did not do so. Under these circumstances, his motion to dismiss died a natural death and he cannot now resurrect it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also seeks, albeit somewhat perfunctorily, to make an end run around the waiver that normally would flow from the entry of an unconditional guilty plea. The waiver doctrine does not apply to jurisdictional claims, <i>see Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 699, so the appellant labors to cast his challenge to the conviction on count three as jurisdictional in nature. He argues, in effect, that the stipulated facts do not establish a necessary element of the offense, namely, that the rape resulted from the carjacking and that, because the admitted conduct does not amount to a violation of the statute of conviction, the district court lacked jurisdiction to convict him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most gaping hole in this argument is that it cannot properly be classified as jurisdictional (and, therefore, as subject to review notwithstanding the appellant's unconditional guilty plea). In arguing to the contrary, the appellant clings to <i>United States v. Rosa-Ortiz,</i> 348 F.3d 33 (1st Cir.2003), in which we recognized that a \"guilty plea does not preclude [a defendant] from arguing on appeal that the statute of conviction does not actually proscribe the conduct charged in the indictment,\" <i>id.</i> at 36. We added that \"a federal court has jurisdiction to try criminal cases only when the information or indictment alleges a violation of a valid federal law,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Saade,</i> 652 F.2d 1126, 1134 (1st Cir.1981)), and that \"jurisdictional challenges to an indictment may be raised at any time,\" regardless of the defendant's guilty plea, <i>id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is a horse of a different hue. The appellant has not argued that the district court lacked authority to hear the case in the first instance because the indictment failed to charge a cognizable federal offense. Nor could such an argument prevail. Each of the five counts charged crimes within the competence of the district court; count three charged in plain terms that a carjacking occurred, which \"result[ed] in serious bodily injury\" by reason of the appellant's sexual assault of G.K.L. That language sufficiently alleged a violation of section 2119(2). This is dispositive of the appellant's argument because, with few exceptions (none applicable here), \"a federal criminal case is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court if the indictment charges ... that the defendant committed a crime described in [a federal criminal statute].\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> 311 F.3d 440, 442 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the appellant's allegation that the admitted facts are insufficient as a matter of law to satisfy the \"results\" element of aggravated carjacking were accurate &#8212; and we doubt that it is<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> &#8212; that allegation would not raise a cognizable jurisdictional defect. In <i>United States v. Valdez-Santana,</i> 279 F.3d 143 (1st Cir.2002), we rebuffed an attempt to shoehorn what was, in essence, a contention that admissible evidence could not establish a violation of the charged crime into the \"narrow exception\" that only jurisdictional issues may be appealed following an unconditional guilty plea. <i>Id.</i> at 145-46. That holding followed inexorably from our statement in <i>Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 699, in which we said that \"a jurisdictional defect is one that calls into doubt a court's power to entertain a matter, not one that merely calls into doubt the sufficiency or quantum of proof relating to guilt.\" <i>See also United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> 357 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that the characterization of the argument that the factual underpinnings of a guilty plea do not establish an element of the offense as a jurisdictional challenge \"confuses the constitutional limits on Congress's power with the jurisdiction of the federal courts\"); <i>Gonzalez,</i> 311 F.3d at 443 (determining that the category of jurisdictional defects that are not waived by a guilty plea does not include \"routine questions as to the reach and application of a criminal statute\" because such questions have \"nothing whatever to do with the subject matter [jurisdiction] of the federal district court\"). These precedents are controlling here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily. We find, without serious question, that the appellant's argument that his admitted conduct does not satisfy the \"results\" element of section 2119(2) is not jurisdictional in nature. Consequently, further consideration of it is foreclosed by the appellant's unconditional guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Alleged Sentencing Errors.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entry of an unconditional guilty plea does not itself waive challenges to the ensuing sentence. <i>Sahlin,</i> 399 F.3d at 32. Here, the appellant advances two such challenges. We consider them separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Enhancement for Serious Bodily Harm.</i> The appellant suggests that the district court erred when it applied a four-level enhancement to his adjusted offense level on count three. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2B3.1(b)(3) (allowing for the disputed enhancement \"[i]f any victim sustained [serious] bodily injury\" in the course of the carjacking). This is too late and too little.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion is too late because the appellant neither interposed an objection to the PSI Report (which recommended the application of the enhancement) nor argued against the enhancement at sentencing. At best, then, the point has been forfeited, and review would be limited to plain error. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, even plain error review is unavailable because the suggestion is not only too late but also too little. On appeal, Gonzalez-Mercado has not offered any developed argumentation as to why it was error, let alone plain error, for the sentencing court to apply section 2B3.1(b)(3). This omission is all the more stark because the appellant admitted below that he raped G.K.L. while the carjacking was ongoing, that is, while retaining control over both the carjacked vehicle and its occupants (Morales and Berrios).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This failure must be deemed a waiver. <i>See, e.g., Muniz v. Rovira,</i> 373 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2004) (\"It is a bedrock appellate rule that issues raised perfunctorily, without developed argumentation, will not be considered on appeal.\"); <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Booker Claim.</i> Before us, the appellant raises for the first time a challenge to his sentence premised upon the district court's alleged error in making certain adjustments to the offense levels used to calculate his sentence under a preponderance of the evidence standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> These include a four-level \"grouping\" adjustment, <i>see</i> USSG &#167; 3D1.4; a two-level role-in-the-offense enhancement, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 3B1.1(c); the previously discussed four-level \"serious bodily injury\" enhancement, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2B3.1(b)(3)(B); and a one-level enhancement for amount of loss, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 2B3.1(b)(7)(B).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant did not object to any of these adjustments below. In this court, however, he took the position that <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), prohibited them. Subsequent to filing his brief, he submitted a letter under Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), in which he augmented this contention with a general reference to <i>Booker.</i> He concedes that his <i>Blakely/Booker</i> challenge &#8212; for simplicity's sake, we henceforth refer to this as a claim of <i>Booker</i> error &#8212; was not preserved below and that, at most, he is entitled to plain error review. <i>See United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plain error test is rigorous. We have stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review for plain error entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). The appellant must carry the devoir of persuasion on all four facets of the test. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the first two elements present no problem. There is a <i>Booker</i> error, although it is not any of the alleged errors that the appellant identifies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Booker</i> teaches that the imposition of sentencing enhancements under a mandatory guidelines regime is erroneous. <i>See Booker,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, ___-___, 125 S.Ct. at 750, 756-57. Thus, a <i>Booker</i> error has occurred when a sentencing court has treated the guidelines as mandatory rather than as advisory. As we said in <i>Antonakopoulos:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Booker</i> error is that the defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory system. The error is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">399 F.3d at 75. For purposes of this case, the <i>Booker</i> error must be regarded as plain. <i>See Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that \"it is enough that the error be `plain' at the time of appellate consideration\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is at step three of the plain error pavane that the appellant's argument stumbles. That prong requires a showing that the error affected substantial rights. <i>Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60. In regard to unpreserved <i>Booker</i> errors, our main third-prong concern is with the likelihood that the district court might have sentenced the defendant more leniently in a post-<i>Booker</i> world in which the guidelines are only advisory. <i>See United States v. Heldeman,</i> ___ F.3d ___, ___, 2005 WL 708397 (1st Cir.2005) [No. 04-1915, slip op. at 7]; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. The standard is one of \"reasonable probability.\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 78-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has not shown a reasonable probability &#8212; not even a possibility &#8212; that the district court would have imposed a different (more lenient) sentence had it understood that the sentencing guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory. That is fatal to his <i>Booker</i> claim. <i>See id.</i> at 75; <i>see also id.</i> at 77 (noting that the defendant bears the burden of persuasion with regard to the element of prejudice). In this regard, it is especially significant that, at oral argument &#8212; conducted after this court had handed down its decision in <i>Antonakopoulos</i> &#8212; the appellant's counsel did not advance any viable theory as to how the <i>Booker</i> error had prejudiced his client's substantial rights. Nor does anything in the record suggest a basis for such an inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, we note that the guidelines, without any downward departure, would have allowed the court to impose an aggregate sentence as low as 360 months for the grouped counts. The court spurned that option and chose to sentence the appellant to nearly double that amount of prison time &#8212; a total of 600 months. The court explained that a sentence at the low end of the range would ignore the horrific details of the specific offense conduct and \"depreciate the overall harm to the victims.\" When, under a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected to sentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the range, that is a telling indication that the court, if acting under an advisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have imposed the same sentence. <i>See United States v. Pratt,</i> No. 04-30446, 2005 WL 629824, at *6 (5th Cir. Mar.18, 2005) (per curiam) (finding that the district court's imposition of a sentence one year longer than the minimum required under the guideline range contradicted the defendant's effort to show a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence under an advisory guideline regime); <i>United States v. Lee,</i> 399 F.3d 864, 867 (7th Cir.2005) (indicating confidence that defendant's substantial rights were not affected by the mandatory guideline regime because the district court had imposed the maximum available sentence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence here is reasonable and, for the reasons stated above, we reject the appellant's request to vacate it on <i>Booker</i> grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Lowe,</i> 145 F.3d 45, 52-53 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Vazquez-Rivera,</i> 135 F.3d at 178.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> If and to the extent that the appellant intended to rely on his argument that under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2) the rape did not result from the carjacking,<i>see supra</i> Part II(B), his reliance is misplaced. The applicable guideline does not track the language of the statute; instead, it covers serious bodily injury to \"any victim.\" USSG &#167; 2B3.1(b)(3). It is hard to conceive of any interpretation of the phrase \"any victim\" that would exclude G.K.L. in the circumstances of this case. <i>Cf. United States v. Hughes,</i> 211 F.3d 676, 691 (1st Cir.2000) (concluding that the indefinite reference to \"victims\" in USSG &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) contemplates all victims of an extortion scheme, not merely the target of the extortionate demand).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The appellant also claims that the sentencing court made an impermissible upward departure.

For present purposes, however, such differentiations do not matter</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Had the district court erred in making the factual findings underlying these upward adjustments and, as a result, misapplied guideline enhancements in a way that increased the appellant's sentence, such errors would require resentencing even under our pre-<i>Booker</i> precedents. <i>United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> 400 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.2005) [No. 02-2286, slip op. at 7]. Here, however, the appellant does not specifically contest the factual basis for any of the enhancements, and it appears that the sentencing court had a solid factual basis for imposing them. The grouping, leadership role, and serious bodily injury enhancements were premised on facts that the appellant admitted during the change-of-plea colloquy and reaffirmed through his acquiescence in the PSI Report. The remaining enhancement was based upon a finding that the amount of loss exceeded $10,000 per count. While admissions of record do not directly cover this point, the appellant, by his own acknowledgment, carjacked five late-model vehicles. We think it likely that the value of each vehicle exceeded $10,000 &#8212; and the appellant has not even hinted to the contrary. Consequently, in a pre-<i>Booker</i> world, there was no plain error in ordering the upward adjustments.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court sentenced him to a total of 600 months in prison. On appeal, Gonzalez-Mercado seeks to challenge the validity of his guilty pleas, the legal sufficiency of the evidence underpinning his conviction on one of the five counts, and his sentence. Concluding, as we do, that these assignments of error are meritless, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 2002, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Puerto Rico returned an indictment charging the appellant with three counts of aiding and abetting carjackings in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 2119(1) and two counts of aiding and abetting aggravated carjackings in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 2119(2). The indictment alleged that the appellant and his confederates had appropriated five motor vehicles. Specifically, count one charged that the appellant and Miguel Alamo Castro (Alamo) carjacked a Toyota Echo on December 31, 2001; count two charged that the appellant, Alamo, and Ismael Ortega Santana (Ortega) carjacked a Nissan Xterra on January 10, 2002; count three charged that the appellant and Alamo carjacked a Chevrolet Cavalier on January 14, 2002; count four charged that the appellant and Alamo carjacked a Nissan Pathfinder on the same date; and count five charged that the appellant and Ortega carjacked a Mitsubishi Montero on January 24, 2002. In two instances (counts one and three), the indictment further charged that the carjackings had resulted in serious bodily injury in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant initially maintained his innocence. He subsequently moved both to change his pleas and to dismiss count three insofar as it charged aggravated carjacking. In a memorandum accompanying the motion to dismiss, he argued that the incident giving rise to the \"serious bodily injury\" allegation &#8212; the rape of a woman known as G.K.L. &#8212; did not suffice to trigger liability for aggravated carjacking. The appellant's thesis ran as follows. The crime of carjacking requires, inter alia, the taking of a motor vehicle \"from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119. If, however, \"serious bodily injury ... results,\" the crime becomes aggravated carjacking, a separate and distinct offense punishable under the heightened penalty provisions contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2). While the appellant concedes that rape qualifies as a serious bodily injury within the purview of section 2119(2), <i>see United States v. Vazquez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197770\"><a href=\"/opinion/197770/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span>, 174-75 (1st Cir.1998), he argues that the rape of G.K.L. was independent of, and thus did not \"result\" from, the taking of a motor vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of a change of plea was held in abeyance pending the disposition of the motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated to the facts underlying count three. We summarize them here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 14, 2002, Alamo and the appellant, aiding and abetting one another, took a Chevrolet Cavalier from Gerald Morales by means of force and intimidation (including the brandishing of what appeared to be firearms). With Morales and Morales's passenger, Hector Berrios, in the vehicle and the appellant at the wheel, the carjackers drove to various ATM machines and forced Morales at gunpoint to withdraw cash from his account. When that source of funds had been exhausted, Morales, in response to the appellant's demands, indicated that he had keys to G.K.L.'s apartment and that the carjackers might be able to obtain more money there. Intrigued by this possibility, the carjackers drove to the apartment complex. Upon their arrival, they locked Berrios (whose hands had been tied with his own shoelaces) in the trunk of Morales's automobile. The appellant retained the car keys.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales escorted the carjackers into G.K.L.'s apartment. The men entered G.K.L.'s bedroom and awoke her, demanding money. She replied that she had no cash and did not possess an ATM card. At that point, Alamo and Morales receded into the living room, but the appellant remained behind and raped G.K.L. When the appellant emerged from the bedroom, the trio departed with G.K.L.'s cell phone and several bottles of wine. They then forced Berrios, at gunpoint, to direct them to his car (a Nissan Pathfinder). Once there, the appellant and Alamo perfected another carjacking (which became the subject of count four of the indictment). The carjackers did not release Morales and Berrios until they had made an unsuccessful attempt to empty Berrios's bank account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking these facts into account, the district court, in an unpublished order, denied the motion to dismiss count three. In so ruling, the court rejected the appellant's contention that because G.K.L. was neither the owner of the carjacked vehicle nor physically present at the time of the carjacking, the rape could not be said to \"result\" from the carjacking offense. The court noted that in <i>Vazquez-Rivera,</i> we held that \"injuries covered [by section 2119(2)] are not limited to those resulting from the `taking' of a vehicle, but also include those caused by the carjacker at any point during his or her retention of the vehicle.\" <i>Id.</i> at 178. In the district court's view, that principle applied because, at the time of the rape, the appellant was still in retention of the carjacked vehicle, he kept the keys in his pocket, he had a victim trapped in the car's trunk, and he held the car's owner under his command. Thus, the serious bodily injury endured by G.K.L. could be said to \"result\" from the carjacking, as required by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the denial of his motion to dismiss, the appellant reactivated his motion for a change of plea. After some skirmishing, not relevant here, the district court conducted a hearing on March 3, 2003. The change-of-plea colloquy was thorough. Significantly, the appellant admitted during that colloquy that he and Alamo had placed Berrios in the trunk of Morales's vehicle; that he had retained the keys to the car during his visit to G.K.L.'s abode; and that, while in possession of the keys and in control of Berrios and Morales, he raped G.K.L. Based on these admissions, the district court permitted the appellant to enter a plea of guilty to count three as well as to the other four counts of the indictment. The court also ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report (PSI Report) and set the case for sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, 2003, the district court convened the disposition hearing. The court ascertained that defense counsel had discussed the PSI Report with the appellant and fully explained its contents to him. The appellant acknowledged that he understood what the report said. For all intents and purposes, the defense raised no objections to the PSI Report.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The court then stated that, in the absence of any material objections to the PSI Report, it would adopt the findings contained therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court calculated a guideline sentencing range of 360 months to life (total offense level &#8212; 40; criminal history category &#8212; III). It sentenced the appellant to serve 600 months in prison, imposing consecutive 300-month terms for each of counts one and three, and concurrent 180-month terms for each of counts two, four, and five. Individually, each of these terms represented the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(2) (setting a twenty-five-year maximum for aggravated carjacking); <i>id.</i> &#167; 2119(1) (setting a fifteen-year maximum for simple carjacking). The court also ordered a supervised release term of five years, a special assessment of $500, and restitution in the amount of $5,950. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Mercado seeks to challenge the validity of his guilty pleas, his conviction on count three, and his sentence. We consider each challenge in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Validity of the Guilty Pleas.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In supplemental briefing and a letter submitted pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j), the appellant maintains that his pleas as to all five counts must be set aside because they were not entered in conformity with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. To elaborate, he insists that his pleas were not tendered intelligently because they were based upon a mistaken understanding of the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines. Although a guilty plea waives most claims of error, it does not preclude an attack on the voluntary and intelligent character of the plea itself. <i>See Tollett v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108762\"><a href=\"/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 267, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108762\"><a href=\"/opinion/108762/tollett-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). The <i>Booker</i> Court held that \"[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\" <i>id.</i> at 756, insofar as the sentence is imposed under a mandatory guideline regime, <i>see id.</i> at 756-57, 767-68. The appellant posits that his guilty pleas are invalid because they were not informed by that holding (and, thus, were tendered on the erroneous assumption that the sentencing guidelines were mandatory).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have heard and rejected this argument before. <i>See United States v. Sahlin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789352\"><a href=\"/opinion/789352/united-states-v-gary-sahlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2005) (holding that \"the possibility of a favorable change in the law occurring after a plea is one of the normal risks that accompany a guilty plea\"); <i>see also Brady v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span> (1970) (stating that \"a voluntary plea of guilty intelligently made in light of the then applicable law does not become vulnerable because later judicial decisions indicate that the plea rested on a faulty premise\"). Under the doctrine of stare decisis, then, the issue is foreclosed. <i>See Eulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201301\"><a href=\"/opinion/201301/eulitt-v-me-dept-of-edu/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 348 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that \"the doctrine of stare decisis precludes the relitigation of legal issues that have previously been heard and authoritatively determined\"); <i>Gately v. Massachusetts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628597\"><a href=\"/opinion/628597/62-fair-emplpraccas-1033-62-empl-prac-dec-p-42508-17-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span>, 1226 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that stare decisis \"renders the ruling of <i>law</i> in a case binding in future cases before the same court or other courts owing obedience to the decision\"). As we explained in <i>Sahlin,</i> 399 F.3d at 31, the <i>Booker</i> decision, in and of itself, does not undermine the validity of the appellant's guilty pleas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Conviction on Count Three.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's next attack is more narrowly focused. He asseverates that the district court erred in imposing a 300-month sentence on count three because the sexual assault of G.K.L. did not \"result\" from the Morales carjacking. This asseveration rests on the premise that the district court should have sentenced the appellant in accordance with section 2119(1), which defines the crime of simple carjacking and caps sentences at fifteen years, rather than section 2119(2), which defines the crime of aggravated carjacking (i.e., carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury) and caps sentences at twenty-five years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is beset with problems. Most prominently, it ignores the decision in <i>Jones v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span> (1999), in which the Supreme Court held that section 2119 does not define a single crime with a choice of penalties dependent on sentencing factors but, rather, \"establish[es] three separate offenses [section 2119(1), section 2119(2), and section 2119(3)] by the specification of distinct elements, each of which must be charged by indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and submitted to a jury for its verdict,\" <i>id.</i> at 252, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span>. Just as the <i>Jones</i> Court recognized that a defendant found guilty of an offense under section 2119(1) could not be sentenced under section 2119(2), <i>see id.</i> at 229, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118274\"><a href=\"/opinion/118274/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span>, so too we recognize that a defendant who pleads guilty to a violation of section 2119(2) cannot claim an entitlement to be sentenced under the more forgiving penalty provisions of section 2119(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an important distinction for the purposes of this case. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 contains three separate sections, defining three separate crimes (we have not mentioned section 2119(3) because that provision has no bearing on this case). Inasmuch as the three sections of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 limn separate offenses, the appropriate forum for contesting the applicability of any one section to the facts of a particular case is the guilt phase of the proceeding &#8212; not the sentencing phase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the appellant bypassed that opportunity by electing to enter an unconditional guilty plea. That plea waived all non-jurisdictional challenges to the resulting conviction under section 2119(2), save claims that the plea was not knowing and voluntary. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez-Castillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200730\"><a href=\"/opinion/200730/united-states-v-rodriguez-castillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2003) (\"An unconditional guilty plea waives any and all independent non-jurisdictional claims arising out of alleged errors antedating the plea.\"); <i>United States v. Cordero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195801\"><a href=\"/opinion/195801/united-states-v-cordero-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span>, 698 (1st Cir.1994) (observing that \"an unconditional guilty plea insulates virtually all earlier rulings in the case from appellate review\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant tries to parry this thrust in two different ways. First, he notes that he did raise a challenge to the applicability of section 2119(2) in his motion to dismiss count three. That is true as far as it goes, but it does not go very far. The appellant failed to preserve the issue for review when he entered an unconditional guilty plea to count three. He could have attempted to avail himself of the procedure described in Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), which allows a criminal defendant, with the consent of the court and the government, to preserve the right to appeal an adverse determination on a specific pretrial motion by entering a conditional guilty plea, but he did not do so. Under these circumstances, his motion to dismiss died a natural death and he cannot now resurrect it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also seeks, albeit somewhat perfunctorily, to make an end run around the waiver that normally would flow from the entry of an unconditional guilty plea. The waiver doctrine does not apply to jurisdictional claims, <i>see Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 699, so the appellant labors to cast his challenge to the conviction on count three as jurisdictional in nature. He argues, in effect, that the stipulated facts do not establish a necessary element of the offense, namely, that the rape resulted from the carjacking and that, because the admitted conduct does not amount to a violation of the statute of conviction, the district court lacked jurisdiction to convict him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most gaping hole in this argument is that it cannot properly be classified as jurisdictional (and, therefore, as subject to review notwithstanding the appellant's unconditional guilty plea). In arguing to the contrary, the appellant clings to <i>United States v. Rosa-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784026\"><a href=\"/opinion/784026/united-states-v-miguel-rosa-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003), in which we recognized that a \"guilty plea does not preclude [a defendant] from arguing on appeal that the statute of conviction does not actually proscribe the conduct charged in the indictment,\" <i>id.</i> at 36. We added that \"a federal court has jurisdiction to try criminal cases only when the information or indictment alleges a violation of a valid federal law,\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Saade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392030\"><a href=\"/opinion/392030/united-states-v-pedro-saade-united-states-of-america-v-carlos-zenon/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1126</span></a></span>, 1134 (1st Cir.1981)), and that \"jurisdictional challenges to an indictment may be raised at any time,\" regardless of the defendant's guilty plea, <i>id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is a horse of a different hue. The appellant has not argued that the district court lacked authority to hear the case in the first instance because the indictment failed to charge a cognizable federal offense. Nor could such an argument prevail. Each of the five counts charged crimes within the competence of the district court; count three charged in plain terms that a carjacking occurred, which \"result[ed] in serious bodily injury\" by reason of the appellant's sexual assault of G.K.L. That language sufficiently alleged a violation of section 2119(2). This is dispositive of the appellant's argument because, with few exceptions (none applicable here), \"a federal criminal case is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court if the indictment charges ... that the defendant committed a crime described in [a federal criminal statute].\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200216\"><a href=\"/opinion/200216/united-states-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 442 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the appellant's allegation that the admitted facts are insufficient as a matter of law to satisfy the \"results\" element of aggravated carjacking were accurate &#8212; and we doubt that it is<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> &#8212; that allegation would not raise a cognizable jurisdictional defect. In <i>United States v.

That holding followed inexorably from our statement in <i>Cordero,</i> 42 F.3d at 699, in which we said that \"a jurisdictional defect is one that calls into doubt a court's power to entertain a matter, not one that merely calls into doubt the sufficiency or quantum of proof relating to guilt.\" <i>See also United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200821\"><a href=\"/opinion/200821/united-states-v-cruz-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that the characterization of the argument that the factual underpinnings of a guilty plea do not establish an element of the offense as a jurisdictional challenge \"confuses the constitutional limits on Congress's power with the jurisdiction of the federal courts\"); <i>Gonzalez,</i> 311 F.3d at 443 (determining that the category of jurisdictional defects that are not waived by a guilty plea does not include \"routine questions as to the reach and application of a criminal statute\" because such questions have \"nothing whatever to do with the subject matter [jurisdiction] of the federal district court\"). These precedents are controlling here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this issue would be to paint the lily. We find, without serious question, that the appellant's argument that his admitted conduct does not satisfy the \"results\" element of section 2119(2) is not jurisdictional in nature. Consequently, further consideration of it is foreclosed by the appellant's unconditional guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Alleged Sentencing Errors.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entry of an unconditional guilty plea does not itself waive challenges to the ensuing sentence. <i>Sahlin,</i> 399 F.3d at 32. Here, the appellant advances two such challenges. We consider them separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Enhancement for Serious Bodily Harm.</i> The appellant suggests that the district court erred when it applied a four-level enhancement to his adjusted offense level on count three. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 2B3.1(b)(3) (allowing for the disputed enhancement \"[i]f any victim sustained [serious] bodily injury\" in the course of the carjacking). This is too late and too little.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion is too late because the appellant neither interposed an objection to the PSI Report (which recommended the application of the enhancement) nor argued against the enhancement at sentencing. At best, then, the point has been forfeited, and review would be limited to plain error. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200202\"><a href=\"/opinion/200202/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 437 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, even plain error review is unavailable because the suggestion is not only too late but also too little. On appeal, Gonzalez-Mercado has not offered any developed argumentation as to why it was error, let alone plain error, for the sentencing court to apply section 2B3.1(b)(3). This omission is all the more stark because the appellant admitted below that he raped G.K.L. while the carjacking was ongoing, that is, while retaining control over both the carjacked vehicle and its occupants (Morales and Berrios).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This failure must be deemed a waiver. <i>See, e.g., Muniz v.

We have stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review for plain error entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

The appellant must carry the devoir of persuasion on all four facets of the test. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the first two elements present no problem. There is a <i>Booker</i> error, although it is not any of the alleged errors that the appellant identifies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>Booker</i> teaches that the imposition of sentencing enhancements under a mandatory guidelines regime is erroneous. <i>See Booker,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, ___-___, 125 S.Ct. at 750, 756-57. Thus, a <i>Booker</i> error has occurred when a sentencing court has treated the guidelines as mandatory rather than as advisory. As we said in <i>Antonakopoulos:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Booker</i> error is that the defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory system. The error is not that a judge (by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the Guidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the jury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only that the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">399 F.3d at 75. For purposes of this case, the <i>Booker</i> error must be regarded as plain. <i>See Johnson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 468, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span> (1997) (stating that \"it is enough that the error be `plain' at the time of appellate consideration\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is at step three of the plain error pavane that the appellant's argument stumbles. That prong requires a showing that the error affected substantial rights. <i>Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60. In regard to unpreserved <i>Booker</i> errors, our main third-prong concern is with the likelihood that the district court might have sentenced the defendant more leniently in a post-<i>Booker</i> world in which the guidelines are only advisory. <i>See United States v. Heldeman,</i> ___ F.3d ___, ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">708397</span></span> (1st Cir.2005) [No. 04-1915, slip op. at 7]; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. The standard is one of \"reasonable probability.\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 78-79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has not shown a reasonable probability &#8212; not even a possibility &#8212; that the district court would have imposed a different (more lenient) sentence had it understood that the sentencing guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory. That is fatal to his <i>Booker</i> claim. <i>See id.</i> at 75; <i>see also id.</i> at 77 (noting that the defendant bears the burden of persuasion with regard to the element of prejudice). In this regard, it is especially significant that, at oral argument &#8212; conducted after this court had handed down its decision in <i>Antonakopoulos</i> &#8212; the appellant's counsel did not advance any viable theory as to how the <i>Booker</i> error had prejudiced his client's substantial rights. Nor does anything in the record suggest a basis for such an inference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, we note that the guidelines, without any downward departure, would have allowed the court to impose an aggregate sentence as low as 360 months for the grouped counts. The court spurned that option and chose to sentence the appellant to nearly double that amount of prison time &#8212; a total of 600 months. The court explained that a sentence at the low end of the range would ignore the horrific details of the specific offense conduct and \"depreciate the overall harm to the victims.\" When, under a mandatory guidelines regime, a sentencing court has elected to sentence the defendant substantially above the bottom of the range, that is a telling indication that the court, if acting under an advisory guidelines regime, would in all likelihood have imposed the same sentence. <i>See United States v. Pratt,</i> No. 04-30446, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">629824</span></span>, at *6 (5th Cir. Mar.18, 2005) (per curiam) (finding that the district court's imposition of a sentence one year longer than the minimum required under the guideline range contradicted the defendant's effort to show a reasonable probability that he would have received a lower sentence under an advisory guideline regime); <i>United States v. Lee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789405\"><a href=\"/opinion/789405/united-states-v-marcus-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 867 (7th Cir.2005) (indicating confidence that defendant's substantial rights were not affected by the mandatory guideline regime because the district court had imposed the maximum available sentence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence here is reasonable and, for the reasons stated above, we reject the appellant's request to vacate it on <i>Booker</i> grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

The applicable guideline does not track the language of the statute; instead, it covers serious bodily injury to \"any victim.\" USSG &#167; 2B3.1(b)(3). It is hard to conceive of any interpretation of the phrase \"any victim\" that would exclude G.K.L. in the circumstances of this case. <i>Cf. United States v. Hughes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198913\"><a href=\"/opinion/198913/united-states-v-hughes/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 691 (1st Cir.2000) (concluding that the indefinite reference to \"victims\" in USSG &#167; 2B3.2(c)(1) contemplates all victims of an extortion scheme, not merely the target of the extortionate demand).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The appellant also claims that the sentencing court made an impermissible upward departure. This claim is frivolous. The guideline sentencing range was 360 months to life, and the court sentenced the appellant within that range</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Some of these adjustments applied to fewer than all of the counts. For present purposes, however, such differentiations do not matter</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Had the district court erred in making the factual findings underlying these upward adjustments and, as a result, misapplied guideline enhancements in a way that increased the appellant's sentence, such errors would require resentencing even under our pre-<i>Booker</i> precedents. <i>United States v. Serrano-Beauvaix,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201470\"><a href=\"/opinion/201470/united-states-v-serrano-beauvaix/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2005) [No. 02-2286, slip op. at 7]. Here, however, the appellant does not specifically contest the factual basis for any of the enhancements, and it appears that the sentencing court had a solid factual basis for imposing them. The grouping, leadership role, and serious bodily injury enhancements were premised on facts that the appellant admitted during the change-of-plea colloquy and reaffirmed through his acquiescence in the PSI Report. The remaining enhancement was based upon a finding that the amount of loss exceeded $10,000 per count. While admissions of record do not directly cover this point, the appellant, by his own acknowledgment, carjacked five late-model vehicles. We think it likely that the value of each vehicle exceeded $10,000 &#8212; and the appellant has not even hinted to the contrary. Consequently, in a pre-<i>Booker</i> world, there was no plain error in ordering the upward adjustments.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
