Itamar Lubetzky appeals from a jury\n\nverdict holding him personally liable for the federal withholding\n\ntaxes of MediaForum, Inc. for the six quarters of July 1, 1996\n\nthrough December 31, 1997.         Lubetzky's central challenge is to the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence, but his appeal also invites attention\n\nto the murky standards for imposing liability.              We begin with a\n\nbrief summary of the statute, the background events and the legal\n\nproceedings that followed.\n\n               Employers are required to deduct from employee wages--and\n\nturn    over    to   the   Internal    Revenue   Service--social    security,\n\nMedicare and federal income taxes.            Although the primary liability\n\nfor failing to do so is the employer's, a penalty for such a\n\nfailure equal to the unpaid tax can be collected from \"[a]ny\n\nperson\" who was \"required\" but \"willfully\" failed to pay over the\n\nwithheld taxes. I.R.C. § 6672 (2000); Slodov v. United States, 436\n\nU.S. 238, 250 (1978).        Such persons are described in the case law\n\nas \"responsible persons\" and a body of decisions has refined the\n\nconcept, albeit imperfectly.            See Mertens, Law of Federal Income\n\nTaxation §§ 55:107-:113 (1997 & 2004 Supp.).\n\n               In this case the evidence--taken most favorably to the\n\nverdict, see PH Group Ltd. v. Birch, 985 F.2d 649, 653 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)--showed the following.           In the fall of 1995, MediaForum, an\n\nAmerican subsidiary of the British company UCM, Ltd., was engaged\n\nin     producing     interactive      software   and   multimedia   products.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fMediaForum's president was Peter Ponton, but UCM president Alan\n\nSaunders also took an active role in managing MediaForum.                       In\n\nSeptember   1995,    MediaForum     hired    Lubetzky       as    an   independent\n\nconsultant to design a financial management system for the company.\n\n            In January 1996, Lubetzky's consultancy was extended and\n\nhe began to prepare financial reports, including lists of \"aging\"\n\ndebts and    receivables.      Ponton      (or   in   his    absence     Saunders)\n\nreviewed these lists weekly and told Lubetzky which bills to pay;\n\nLubetzky would then print up the checks and give them to Ponton or\n\nSaunders to sign.\n\n            In June 1996, Lubetzky joined MediaForum as an employee.\n\nHe was appointed treasurer, thereby making him (under the by-laws)\n\nchief financial officer as well. Apparently he held himself out as\n\nan \"executive vice president\" when dealing with customers (and the\n\nIRS).   At trial he described himself as a glorified bookkeeper,\n\nsaying that he was unaware of his treasurer designation.                      From\n\nother evidence the jury could have disbelieved this disclaimer.\n\n            Even    before   June   1996     Lubetzky       had    check-signing\n\nauthority, along with Saunders, Ponton and two other employees.\n\nOver the 14-month period from January 1996 through February 1997,\n\nLubetzky signed over $200,000 in payroll checks as well as checks\n\nto suppliers, subcontractors and others.              Although formally two\n\nsignatures were required, the government at trial offered checks\n\ndating back to July 4, 1996, showing Lubetzky as the sole signer.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fFrom June 1996 onward, Lubetzky also began to prepare and sign\n\nMediaForum's federal employment tax returns.\n\n             Lubetzky's filings after he assumed office began with the\n\ncompany's March 1996 return which, he discovered, had not been\n\npreviously filed.         When he informed Saunders and Ponton of this\n\nfact--and the fact that the company’s taxes had not been paid--\n\nSaunders said that the taxes would be paid when money was available\n\nbut that suppliers had to be paid now so the company could remain\n\nin business. Lubetzky again reminded his seniors of the problem in\n\nDecember 1996. Lubetzky filed three of MediaForum’s 1996 quarterly\n\nreturns, but paid none of the taxes.\n\n           In early 1997 UCM sold MediaForum's main assets, and by\n\nFebruary 1997 Saunders had removed Ponton and the company’s vice\n\npresident.        Lubetzky told Saunders that someone needed to take\n\ncharge of the remaining operations--the company continued to do\n\nsome   work--and     in   April    1997    Lubetzky   was    appointed   company\n\npresident, saying that he proposed only to be a \"caretaker\" and\n\nwanted no corporate authority.            Nevertheless, he continued to have\n\ncheck-writing authority and regularly filed employment tax returns-\n\n-but without making payment (except for April and May 1997).\n\n             In    September      1997,     MediaForum      ceased   operations.\n\nLubetzky asserted at trial that he then thought his role had come\n\nto an end; but, at the behest of the IRS, in January 1998 he filed\n\nreturns for the company for July-December 1997.               In the last three\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fmonths of 1997 the company received customer payments amounting to\n\nover $190,000, and it continued to hold some assets in a bank\n\naccount through the close of the year.\n\n            In   September   1999,    the    IRS   assessed     a    penalty    of\n\n$78,239.45    against   Lubetzky     for    willful   failure       to   pay   over\n\nMediaForum's federal withholding taxes for 1997 and part of 1996.\n\nLubetzky paid the small amount due for the final quarter of 1997\n\nand brought suit in the federal district court in Massachusetts,\n\nseeking a refund and an abatement of the balance claimed by the\n\nIRS.   The IRS counterclaimed for the balance and a three-day trial\n\nwas held.\n\n             The jury found for the government both on the refund\n\nclaim and the counterclaim, concluding in a special verdict that\n\nLubetzky had become a responsible person on July 4, 1996, and that\n\nhe had willfully failed to pay taxes due during all six quarters at\n\nissue (the last two in 1996 and all four in 1997).                  The district\n\ncourt entered judgment for the government--with interest the amount\n\ndue was now over $90,000--and denied Lubetzky's motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial.                    This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n             With one exception (discussed below), all of Lubetzky's\n\nclaims on appeal rest on the same contention: that the evidence was\n\ninsufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find him liable.                      On\n\nthis central claim, our review is independent of the district judge\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fbut deferential to the jury unless the law was misstated or\n\ndemonstrably misunderstood.   See Heinrich v. Sweet, 308 F.3d 48,\n\n59-60 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 914 (2003); cf.\n\nVinick v. United States (“Vinick II”), 205 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    Inferences are drawn, and credibility issues generally\n\nresolved, in favor of the verdict.    United States v. Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1223\n\n(1994).\n\n           The statute, quoted in pertinent part above, imposes the\n\npenalty on a party who \"willfully\" fails to pay over the taxes due\n\nwhen required to do so.     Although in some contexts willfulness\n\nrequires a wicked intent or consciousness of wrongdoing, see Screws\n\nv. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 101-03 (1945), here it is enough if\n\na defendant knows that the taxes are due from the company and yet\n\ndisburses funds for other purposes or knowingly fails to pay the\n\nrequired sum to the government.   See Stuart v. United States, 337\n\nF.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing cases); Caterino v. United\n\nStates, 794 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1986) (same), cert. denied, 480\n\nU.S. 905 (1987).\n\n           At trial Lubetzky admitted that in the course of his\n\nwarnings to others that the taxes were due, he was warned in turn\n\nby the company's legal adviser that he might himself be held liable\n\nfor non-payment and said, \"Well, that's horrible.\"        When this\n\noccurred is not entirely clear but, in any event, on this appeal\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fLubetzky      does    not     contest     the    jury's     finding     that    he      acted\n\nwillfully.\n\n              As to the \"responsible person\" issue, the statute--which\n\ndoes not use this term--speaks of persons \"required\" to collect,\n\naccount and pay over (\"and\" is to be read as \"or,\" Slodov, 436 U.S.\n\nat    250).     There       are    also   a    few    general     principles      of     some\n\nrelevance: there can be more than one person so required, Stuart,\n\n337 F.3d at 36; the statute has generally been read broadly to\n\nprotect the government's interest in getting its money, see Vinick\n\nv. Commissioner (\"Vinick I\"), 110 F.3d 168, 172 (1st Cir. 1997),\n\nand, in       the    present      procedural        context,     the   burden     was   upon\n\nLubetzky to prove at trial that he was not a responsible person,\n\nStuart, 337 F.3d at 36.\n\n              Nevertheless, there is a surprising gap at the center of\n\nthe   statute:       it     nowhere   says      who    is   so   required    or    whether\n\n\"required\" refers to some statutory concept, common law doctrine,\n\ncompany by-laws or actual practice, or some mixture of all these.\n\nIn response, the case law has spawned a laundry list of criteria\n\nthat is well developed but moored only to some vague concept of\n\npower or control.           See, e.g., Vinick II, 205 F.3d at 7-8.\n\n              The     IRS    definition        is     equally     bland,    saying       that\n\n\"[r]esponsibility is a matter of status, duty, and authority.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Manual § 1.2.1.5.14(3) (2004). More helpfully, it\n\nsays that \"[i]n general, non-owner employees of the business\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fentity, who act solely under the dominion and control of others,\n\nand who are not in a position to make independent decisions on\n\nbehalf of the business entity\" will not be liable.   Id.   This might\n\nat first blush seem helpful to Lubetzky, but its application to\n\ncorporate officers is left obscure.\n\n          So, we are back to the case law criteria to provide a\n\nframework. These indicia are said to include whether the defendant\n\nis a member of the board or an officer, has a stake in the company,\n\nis active in management and personnel decisions, makes decisions as\n\nto payment of bills, controls bank accounts, and has check-signing\n\nauthority.   Vinick II, 205 F.3d at 7-8.   Vinick II also said of\n\nthis list that corporate title is not decisive, id. at 8, and that\n\nthe last three criteria are particularly important.   Id. at 9.   So\n\nfar we are dealing with \"the law.\"\n\n          When it comes to applying the law to the case at hand,\n\nthe factfinder gets much greater deference. As to raw facts (e.g.,\n\nwhat happened, who said what, past company practice), the standard\n\nof review at a jury trial is whether a rational jury could make\n\nsuch a finding.   See Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 386 F.3d\n\n21, 25 (1st Cir. 2004).   Further, the weighing of the factors and\n\ntheir application to the facts is treated in legal jargon as a\n\nmixed question--law application is a more accurate label--and\n\nreviewed with varying degrees of deference.    See Vinick II, 250\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fF.3d at 6; In re Extradition of Howard, 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n          Turning now to the facts of this case, we think the jury\n\ncould have found from the evidence that Lubetzky from the start of\n\nthe critical six quarters was more than a bookkeeper; that he held\n\nthe formal position of treasurer and chief financial officer; that\n\nin practice he had special responsibility for preparing lists of\n\ndebts to be paid and for filing the withholding tax returns; that\n\nhe had authority to sign checks; and that he was, according to a\n\nnumber of the relevant criteria, a \"responsible\" person--with one\n\nmajor qualification.\n\n          The qualification is that during the period before he\n\nbecame president in April 1997, Lubetzky reasonably understood that\n\nhe was expected by Saunders and Ponton to pay only the bills that\n\none of them approved, and that Saunders wanted the tax payments\n\ndelayed. Lubetzky so testified, adding that he would have regarded\n\nhimself as \"stealing\" if he had paid out checks over management's\n\nobjection.    He was supported by another witness.            No directly\n\ncontradictory evidence is noted by the government.            There is no\n\nobvious basis   on   which   the   jury   could   have   disbelieved   this\n\ntestimony.\n\n          It would be easy, and perhaps conventional, to resolve\n\nthis case by saying that the jury took everything into account and\n\nthen reasonably, although not inevitably, \"found\" Lubetzky was a\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fresponsible party.          Reserving some flexibility for the jury in\n\nweighing circumstances, as well as finding raw facts, makes sense\n\nin cases like this one--as it does in accident cases where the jury\n\ndecides whether the known facts add up to negligence.                       Often, the\n\njury's legal calculus is buried because one cannot know just what\n\nfacts it found.\n\n             Nevertheless, here Lubetzky is entitled to claim that\n\nregardless    of     the    jury's   view,    a    court    ought     not    hold   him\n\nresponsible where, as he has established, he could not have paid\n\nout substantial sums for the taxes without ignoring the directions\n\nof the company's highest officials and quite possibly losing his\n\njob.   The     IRS    regulation     quoted       above    concedes    that    a    mere\n\nbookkeeper who only wrote checks would not be liable in such a case\n\neven though he knew that taxes were unpaid.\n\n             So, unless we avert our eyes, the jury verdict in this\n\ncase depends on the legal proposition that someone in Lubetzky's\n\nposition had to confront top management and quite possibly resign\n\nfrom his position if he wanted to avoid the risk of liability for\n\nthe period before he became president (liability afterwards is even\n\nharder to avoid).          This is a harsh dilemma with which to confront\n\nsomeone, and we have found little case law that deals with the\n\nissue in such stark terms.           Perhaps this is not surprising, given\n\nthe unusual starkness of the choice in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f           However, what case law exists at the circuit level is\n\nmostly favorable to the government.      Thus, in Brounstein v. United\n\nStates, 979 F.2d 952 (3d Cir. 1992), a former salesman who was the\n\n(perhaps   nominal)   president   and    (clearly   actual)    assistant\n\ntreasurer and check-writer was held liable even though the Third\n\nCircuit assumed arguendo that Brounstein's effective superior might\n\nhave told him not to pay--and might have fired Brounstein had he\n\ndone otherwise.   \"Instructions from a superior not to pay taxes do\n\nnot,\" said the court, \"take a person otherwise responsible under\n\n[the statute] out of that category.\"      Id. at 955.\n\n           Similar in effect is Roth v. United States, 779 F.2d 1567\n\n(11th Cir. 1986), where the Eleventh Circuit said:\n\n           In our view, no instruction by the president\n           or the majority owner of [the corporation]\n           could effectively bar an otherwise responsible\n           officer from paying these funds in accordance\n           with the law.\n\nId. at 1572; accord Howard v. United States, 711 F.2d 729, 734 (5th\n\nCir. 1983) (\"The fact that Jennings might well have fired Howard\n\nhad he disobeyed Jennings' instructions and paid the taxes does not\n\nmake Howard any less responsible for their payment.\").\n\n           Our own decision in Vinick II is perhaps the best case in\n\nLubetzky's favor, but it is easily distinguishable.           Vinick was\n\nformally the treasurer of a small company in which he was an\n\ninvestor; but--unlike Lubetzky--he was neither paid by the company\n\nnor engaged in day-to-day business affairs, had no office at the\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fcompany, and did not sign checks in the relevant time frame.\n\nThroughout the period in question, Vinick was a CPA with his own\n\nprivate practice elsewhere.         205 F.3d at 4.\n\n             We   have   not    separately    addressed   the   period    after\n\nLubetzky became president because, if anything, his responsibility\n\nwas   then    enhanced--although       perhaps   not   greatly,    given    his\n\ncompany's dominance by its U.K. parent and by Saunders.                Nor, in\n\nlight of our disposition, is it necessary to consider whether\n\nLubetzky's authority in this later period independently obliged him\n\nto make payments for the earlier three quarters if the cash had\n\nbeen on hand.      Compare Slodov, 436 U.S. at 259-260.\n\n             We also need not address in detail Lubetzky's challenge\n\nto the jury's finding that he became a responsible person on July\n\n4, 1996.     Lubetzky became an officer shortly before July 1996, and\n\nat trial the earliest check on which Lubetzky was the sole signer\n\nwas dated July 4, 1996; the jury was entitled to find that this was\n\nthe first day that Lubetzky had the requisite degree of control\n\nover MediaForum's financial affairs to render him a responsible\n\nperson.\n\n             Obviously,    on   this   record,   the   party    most   directly\n\nresponsible in this case for the failure to pay was Saunders, who\n\ngave the fatal instruction to Lubetzky. This is certainly true for\n\nthe first three quarters, and most likely for a significant portion\n\nof the $90,000 plus interest now due.            There is some possibility\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fthat Saunders--and perhaps Ponton--may be liable to Lubetzky, see\n\nI.R.C. § 6672(d), but that issue is not before us.\n\n          Lubetzky has also sought review of the district court's\n\ndenial of his alternative motion for a new trial.     The district\n\njudge can order a new trial where the verdict is against the weight\n\nof the evidence--Lubetzky's main claim here.

Lubetzky's central challenge is to the sufficiency of the evidence, but his appeal also invites attention to the murky standards for imposing liability. We begin with a brief summary of the statute, the background events and the legal proceedings that followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employers are required to deduct from employee wages &#8212; and turn over to the Internal Revenue Service &#8212; social security, Medicare and federal income taxes. Although the primary liability for failing to do so is the employer's, a penalty for such a failure equal to the unpaid tax can be collected from \"[a]ny person\" who was \"required\" but \"willfully\" failed to pay over the withheld taxes. I.R.C. &#167; 6672 (2000); <i>Slodov v. United States,</i> 436 U.S. 238, 250, 98 S.Ct. 1778, 56 L.Ed.2d 251 (1978). Such persons are described in the case law as \"responsible persons\" and a body of decisions has refined the concept, albeit imperfectly. <i>See</i> Mertens, <i>Law of Federal Income Taxation</i> &#167;&#167; 55:107-:113 (1997 &amp; 2004 Supp.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case the evidence &#8212; taken most favorably to the verdict, <i>see PH Group Ltd. v. Birch,</i> 985 F.2d 649, 653 (1st Cir.1993) &#8212; showed the following. In the fall of 1995, MediaForum, an American subsidiary of the British company UCM, Ltd., was engaged in producing interactive software and multimedia products. MediaForum's president was Peter Ponton, but UCM president Alan Saunders also took an active role in managing MediaForum. In September 1995, MediaForum hired Lubetzky as an independent consultant to design a financial management system for the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1996, Lubetzky's consultancy was extended and he began to prepare financial reports, including lists of \"aging\" debts and receivables. Ponton (or in his absence Saunders) reviewed these lists weekly and told Lubetzky which bills to pay; Lubetzky would then print up the checks and give them to Ponton or Saunders to sign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1996, Lubetzky joined MediaForum as an employee. He was appointed treasurer, thereby making him (under the by-laws) chief financial officer as well. Apparently he held himself out as an \"executive vice president\" when dealing with customers (and the IRS). At trial he described himself as a glorified bookkeeper, saying that he was unaware of his treasurer designation. From other evidence the jury could have disbelieved this disclaimer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even before June 1996 Lubetzky had check-signing authority, along with Saunders, Ponton and two other employees. Over the 14-month period from January 1996 through February 1997, Lubetzky signed over $200,000 in payroll checks as well as checks to suppliers, subcontractors and others. Although formally two signatures were required, the government at trial offered checks dating back to July 4, 1996, showing Lubetzky as the sole signer. From June 1996 onward, Lubetzky also began to prepare and sign MediaForum's federal employment tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lubetzky's filings after he assumed office began with the company's March 1996 return which, he discovered, had not been previously filed. When he informed Saunders and Ponton of this fact &#8212; and the fact that the company's taxes had not been paid &#8212; Saunders said that the taxes would be paid when money was available but that suppliers had to be paid now so the company could remain in business. Lubetzky again reminded his seniors of the problem in December 1996. Lubetzky filed three of MediaForum's 1996 quarterly returns, but paid none of the taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1997 UCM sold MediaForum's main assets, and by February 1997 Saunders had removed Ponton and the company's vice president. Lubetzky told Saunders that someone needed to take charge of the remaining operations &#8212; the company continued to do some work &#8212; and in April 1997 Lubetzky was appointed company president, saying that he proposed only to be a \"caretaker\" and wanted no corporate authority. Nevertheless, he continued to have check-writing authority and regularly filed employment tax returns &#8212; but without making payment (except for April and May 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, MediaForum ceased operations. Lubetzky asserted at trial that he then thought his role had come to an end; but, at the behest of the IRS, in January 1998 he filed returns for the company for July-December 1997. In the last three months of 1997 the company received customer payments amounting to over $190,000, and it continued to hold some assets in a bank account through the close of the year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1999, the IRS assessed a penalty of $78,239.45 against Lubetzky for willful failure to pay over MediaForum's federal withholding taxes for 1997 and part of 1996. Lubetzky paid the small amount due for the final quarter of 1997 and brought suit in the federal district court in Massachusetts, seeking a refund and an abatement of the balance claimed by the IRS. The IRS counterclaimed for the balance and a three-day trial was held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found for the government both on the refund claim and the counterclaim, concluding in a special verdict that Lubetzky had become a responsible person on July 4, 1996, and that he had willfully failed to pay taxes due during all six quarters at issue (the last two in 1996 and all four in 1997). The district court entered judgment for the government &#8212; with interest the amount due was now over $90,000 &#8212; and denied Lubetzky's motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With one exception (discussed below), all of Lubetzky's claims on appeal rest on the same contention: that the evidence was insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find him liable. On this central claim, our review is independent of the district judge but deferential to the jury unless the law was misstated or demonstrably misunderstood. <i>See Heinrich v. Sweet,</i> 308 F.3d 48, 59-60 (1st Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 539 U.S. 914, 123 S.Ct. 2273, 156 L.Ed.2d 129 (2003); <i>cf. Vinick v. United States</i> (\"Vinick II \"), 205 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.2000). Inferences are drawn, and credibility issues generally resolved, in favor of the verdict. <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir.1993), <i>cert. denied,</i> 512 U.S. 1223, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute, quoted in pertinent part above, imposes the penalty on a party who \"willfully\" fails to pay over the taxes due when required to do so. Although in some contexts willfulness requires a wicked intent or consciousness of wrongdoing, <i>see Screws v. United States,</i> 325 U.S. 91, 101-03, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945), here it is enough if a defendant knows that the taxes are due from the company and yet disburses funds for other purposes or knowingly fails to pay the required sum to the government. <i>See Stuart v. United States,</i> 337 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir.2003) (citing cases); <i>Caterino v. United States,</i> 794 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1986) (same), <i>cert. denied,</i> 480 U.S. 905, 107 S.Ct. 1347, 94 L.Ed.2d 518 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Lubetzky admitted that in the course of his warnings to others that the taxes were due, he was warned in turn by the company's legal adviser that he might himself be held liable for non-payment and said, \"Well, that's horrible.\" When this occurred is not entirely clear but, in any event, on this appeal Lubetzky does not contest the jury's finding that he acted willfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the \"responsible person\" issue, the statute &#8212; which does not use this term &#8212; speaks of persons \"required\" to collect, account and pay over (\"and\" is to be read as \"or,\" <i>Slodov,</i> 436 U.S. at 250, 98 S.Ct. 1778). There are also a few general principles of some relevance: there can be more than one person so required, <i>Stuart,</i> 337 F.3d at 36; the statute has generally been read broadly to protect the government's interest in getting its money, <i>see Vinick v. Commissioner</i> (\"Vinick I \"), 110 F.3d 168, 172 (1st Cir.1997), and, in the present procedural context, the burden was upon Lubetzky to prove at trial that he was not a responsible person, <i>Stuart,</i> 337 F.3d at 36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there is a surprising gap at the center of the statute: it nowhere says <i>who</i> is so required or whether \"required\" refers to some statutory concept, common law doctrine, company by-laws or actual practice, or some mixture of all these. In response, the case law has spawned a laundry list of criteria that is well developed but moored only to some vague concept of power or control. <i>See, e.g., Vinick II,</i> 205 F.3d at 7-8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS definition is equally bland, saying that \"[r]esponsibility is a matter of status, duty, and authority.\" Internal Revenue Manual &#167; 1.2.1.5.14(3) (2004). More helpfully, it says that \"[i]n general, non-owner employees of the business entity, who act solely under the dominion and control of others, and who are not in a position to make independent decisions on behalf of the business entity\" will not be liable. <i>Id.</i> This might at first blush seem helpful to Lubetzky, but its application to corporate officers is left obscure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, we are back to the case law criteria to provide a framework. These indicia are said to include whether the defendant is a member of the board or an officer, has a stake in the company, is active in management and personnel decisions, makes decisions as to payment of bills, controls bank accounts, and has check-signing authority. <i>Vinick II,</i> 205 F.3d at 7-8. <i>Vinick II</i> also said of this list that corporate title is not decisive, <i>id.</i> at 8, and that the last three criteria are particularly important. <i>Id.</i> at 9. So far we are dealing with \"the law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When it comes to applying the law to the case at hand, the factfinder gets much greater deference. As to raw facts (<i>e.g.,</i> what happened, who said what, past company practice), the standard of review at a jury trial is whether a rational jury could make such a finding. <i>See Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 386 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2004). Further, the weighing of the factors and their application to the facts is treated in legal jargon as a mixed question &#8212; law application is a more accurate label &#8212; and reviewed with varying degrees of deference. <i>See Vinick II,</i> 250 F.3d at 6; <i>In re Extradition of Howard,</i> 996 F.2d 1320, 1328 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning now to the facts of this case, we think the jury could have found from the evidence that Lubetzky from the start of the critical six quarters was more than a bookkeeper; that he held the formal position of treasurer and chief financial officer; that in practice he had special responsibility for preparing lists of debts to be paid and for filing the withholding tax returns; that he had authority to sign checks; and that he was, according to a number of the relevant criteria, a \"responsible\" person-with one major qualification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The qualification is that during the period before he became president in April 1997, Lubetzky reasonably understood that he was expected by Saunders and Ponton to pay only the bills that one of them approved, and that Saunders wanted the tax payments delayed. Lubetzky so testified, adding that he would have regarded himself as \"stealing\" if he had paid out checks over management's objection. He was supported by another witness. No directly contradictory evidence is noted by the government. There is no obvious basis on which the jury could have disbelieved this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be easy, and perhaps conventional, to resolve this case by saying that the jury took everything into account and then reasonably, although not inevitably, \"found\" Lubetzky was a responsible party. Reserving some flexibility for the jury in weighing circumstances, as well as finding raw facts, makes sense in cases like this one &#8212; as it does in accident cases where the jury decides whether the known facts add up to negligence. Often, the jury's legal calculus is buried because one cannot know just what facts it found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, here Lubetzky is entitled to claim that regardless of the jury's view, a court ought not hold him responsible where, as he has established, he could not have paid out substantial sums for the taxes without ignoring the directions of the company's highest officials and quite possibly losing his job. The IRS regulation quoted above concedes that a mere bookkeeper who only wrote checks would not be liable in such a case even though he knew that taxes were unpaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, unless we avert our eyes, the jury verdict in this case depends on the legal proposition that someone in Lubetzky's position had to confront top management and quite possibly resign from his position if he wanted to avoid the risk of liability for the period before he became president (liability afterwards is even harder to avoid). This is a harsh dilemma with which to confront someone, and we have found little case law that deals with the issue in such stark terms. Perhaps this is not surprising, given the unusual starkness of the choice in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, what case law exists at the circuit level is mostly favorable to the government. Thus, in <i>Brounstein v. United States,</i> 979 F.2d 952 (3d Cir.1992), a former salesman who was the (perhaps nominal) president and (clearly actual) assistant treasurer and check-writer was held liable even though the Third Circuit assumed <i>arguendo</i> that Brounstein's effective superior might have told him not to pay &#8212; and might have fired Brounstein had he done otherwise. \"Instructions from a superior not to pay taxes do not,\" said the court, \"take a person otherwise responsible under [the statute] out of that category.\" <i>Id.</i> at 955.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar in effect is <i>Roth v. United States,</i> 779 F.2d 1567 (11th Cir.1986), where the Eleventh Circuit said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, no instruction by the president or the majority owner of [the corporation] could effectively bar an otherwise responsible officer from paying these funds in accordance with the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1572; <i>accord Howard v. United States,</i> 711 F.2d 729, 734 (5th Cir.1983) (\"The fact that Jennings might well have fired Howard had he disobeyed Jennings' instructions and paid the taxes does not make Howard any less responsible for their payment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own decision in <i>Vinick II</i> is perhaps the best case in Lubetzky's favor, but it is easily distinguishable. Vinick was formally the treasurer of a small company in which he was an investor; but &#8212; unlike Lubetzky &#8212; he was neither paid by the company nor engaged in day-to-day business affairs, had no office at the company, and did not sign checks in the relevant time frame. Throughout the period in question, Vinick was a CPA with his own private practice elsewhere. 205 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have not separately addressed the period after Lubetzky became president because, if anything, his responsibility was then enhanced &#8212; although perhaps not greatly, given his company's dominance by its U.K. parent and by Saunders. Nor, in light of our disposition, is it necessary to consider whether Lubetzky's authority in this later period independently obliged him to make payments for the <i>earlier</i> three quarters if the cash had been on hand. <i>Compare Slodov,</i> 436 U.S. at 259-260, 98 S.Ct. 1778.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also need not address in detail Lubetzky's challenge to the jury's finding that he became a responsible person on July 4, 1996. Lubetzky became an officer shortly before July 1996, and at trial the earliest check on which Lubetzky was the sole signer was dated July 4, 1996; the jury was entitled to find that this was the first day that Lubetzky had the requisite degree of control over MediaForum's financial affairs to render him a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, on this record, the party most directly responsible in this case for the failure to pay was Saunders, who gave the fatal instruction to Lubetzky. This is certainly true for the first three quarters, and most likely for a significant portion of the $90,000 plus interest now due. There is some possibility that Saunders &#8212; and perhaps Ponton &#8212; may be liable to Lubetzky, <i>see</i> I.R.C. &#167; 6672(d), but that issue is not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lubetzky has also sought review of the district court's denial of his alternative motion for a new trial. The district judge can order a new trial where the verdict is against the weight of the evidence &#8212; Lubetzky's main claim here. But such decisions are reviewed only with great deference, <i>Stuart,</i> 337 F.3d at 37, and in this instance the denial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In the fall of 1995, MediaForum, an American subsidiary of the British company UCM, Ltd., was engaged in producing interactive software and multimedia products. MediaForum's president was Peter Ponton, but UCM president Alan Saunders also took an active role in managing MediaForum. In September 1995, MediaForum hired Lubetzky as an independent consultant to design a financial management system for the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1996, Lubetzky's consultancy was extended and he began to prepare financial reports, including lists of \"aging\" debts and receivables. Ponton (or in his absence Saunders) reviewed these lists weekly and told Lubetzky which bills to pay; Lubetzky would then print up the checks and give them to Ponton or Saunders to sign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1996, Lubetzky joined MediaForum as an employee. He was appointed treasurer, thereby making him (under the by-laws) chief financial officer as well. Apparently he held himself out as an \"executive vice president\" when dealing with customers (and the IRS). At trial he described himself as a glorified bookkeeper, saying that he was unaware of his treasurer designation. From other evidence the jury could have disbelieved this disclaimer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even before June 1996 Lubetzky had check-signing authority, along with Saunders, Ponton and two other employees. Over the 14-month period from January 1996 through February 1997, Lubetzky signed over $200,000 in payroll checks as well as checks to suppliers, subcontractors and others. Although formally two signatures were required, the government at trial offered checks dating back to July 4, 1996, showing Lubetzky as the sole signer. From June 1996 onward, Lubetzky also began to prepare and sign MediaForum's federal employment tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lubetzky's filings after he assumed office began with the company's March 1996 return which, he discovered, had not been previously filed. When he informed Saunders and Ponton of this fact &#8212; and the fact that the company's taxes had not been paid &#8212; Saunders said that the taxes would be paid when money was available but that suppliers had to be paid now so the company could remain in business. Lubetzky again reminded his seniors of the problem in December 1996. Lubetzky filed three of MediaForum's 1996 quarterly returns, but paid none of the taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1997 UCM sold MediaForum's main assets, and by February 1997 Saunders had removed Ponton and the company's vice president. Lubetzky told Saunders that someone needed to take charge of the remaining operations &#8212; the company continued to do some work &#8212; and in April 1997 Lubetzky was appointed company president, saying that he proposed only to be a \"caretaker\" and wanted no corporate authority. Nevertheless, he continued to have check-writing authority and regularly filed employment tax returns &#8212; but without making payment (except for April and May 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, MediaForum ceased operations. Lubetzky asserted at trial that he then thought his role had come to an end; but, at the behest of the IRS, in January 1998 he filed returns for the company for July-December 1997. In the last three months of 1997 the company received customer payments amounting to over $190,000, and it continued to hold some assets in a bank account through the close of the year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1999, the IRS assessed a penalty of $78,239.45 against Lubetzky for willful failure to pay over MediaForum's federal withholding taxes for 1997 and part of 1996. Lubetzky paid the small amount due for the final quarter of 1997 and brought suit in the federal district court in Massachusetts, seeking a refund and an abatement of the balance claimed by the IRS. The IRS counterclaimed for the balance and a three-day trial was held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found for the government both on the refund claim and the counterclaim, concluding in a special verdict that Lubetzky had become a responsible person on July 4, 1996, and that he had willfully failed to pay taxes due during all six quarters at issue (the last two in 1996 and all four in 1997). The district court entered judgment for the government &#8212; with interest the amount due was now over $90,000 &#8212; and denied Lubetzky's motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With one exception (discussed below), all of Lubetzky's claims on appeal rest on the same contention: that the evidence was insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find him liable. On this central claim, our review is independent of the district judge but deferential to the jury unless the law was misstated or demonstrably misunderstood. <i>See Heinrich v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1778</span></a></span>). There are also a few general principles of some relevance: there can be more than one person so required, <i>Stuart,</i> 337 F.3d at 36; the statute has generally been read broadly to protect the government's interest in getting its money, <i>see Vinick v. Commissioner</i> (\"Vinick I \"), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197295\"><a href=\"/opinion/197295/vinick-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 172 (1st Cir.1997), and, in the present procedural context, the burden was upon Lubetzky to prove at trial that he was not a responsible person, <i>Stuart,</i> 337 F.3d at 36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there is a surprising gap at the center of the statute: it nowhere says <i>who</i> is so required or whether \"required\" refers to some statutory concept, common law doctrine, company by-laws or actual practice, or some mixture of all these. In response, the case law has spawned a laundry list of criteria that is well developed but moored only to some vague concept of power or control. <i>See, e.g., Vinick II,</i> 205 F.3d at 7-8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS definition is equally bland, saying that \"[r]esponsibility is a matter of status, duty, and authority.\" Internal Revenue Manual &#167; 1.2.1.5.14(3) (2004). More helpfully, it says that \"[i]n general, non-owner employees of the business entity, who act solely under the dominion and control of others, and who are not in a position to make independent decisions on behalf of the business entity\" will not be liable. <i>Id.</i> This might at first blush seem helpful to Lubetzky, but its application to corporate officers is left obscure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, we are back to the case law criteria to provide a framework. These indicia are said to include whether the defendant is a member of the board or an officer, has a stake in the company, is active in management and personnel decisions, makes decisions as to payment of bills, controls bank accounts, and has check-signing authority. <i>Vinick II,</i> 205 F.3d at 7-8. <i>Vinick II</i> also said of this list that corporate title is not decisive, <i>id.</i> at 8, and that the last three criteria are particularly important. <i>Id.</i> at 9. So far we are dealing with \"the law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When it comes to applying the law to the case at hand, the factfinder gets much greater deference. As to raw facts (<i>e.g.,</i> what happened, who said what, past company practice), the standard of review at a jury trial is whether a rational jury could make such a finding. <i>See Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201269\"><a href=\"/opinion/201269/gillespie-v-sears-roebuck/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2004). Further, the weighing of the factors and their application to the facts is treated in legal jargon as a mixed question &#8212; law application is a more accurate label &#8212; and reviewed with varying degrees of deference. <i>See Vinick II,</i> 250 F.3d at 6; <i>In re Extradition of Howard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610553\"><a href=\"/opinion/610553/in-re-extradition-of-curtis-andrew-howard-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span>, 1328 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning now to the facts of this case, we think the jury could have found from the evidence that Lubetzky from the start of the critical six quarters was more than a bookkeeper; that he held the formal position of treasurer and chief financial officer; that in practice he had special responsibility for preparing lists of debts to be paid and for filing the withholding tax returns; that he had authority to sign checks; and that he was, according to a number of the relevant criteria, a \"responsible\" person-with one major qualification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The qualification is that during the period before he became president in April 1997, Lubetzky reasonably understood that he was expected by Saunders and Ponton to pay only the bills that one of them approved, and that Saunders wanted the tax payments delayed. Lubetzky so testified, adding that he would have regarded himself as \"stealing\" if he had paid out checks over management's objection. He was supported by another witness. No directly contradictory evidence is noted by the government. There is no obvious basis on which the jury could have disbelieved this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be easy, and perhaps conventional, to resolve this case by saying that the jury took everything into account and then reasonably, although not inevitably, \"found\" Lubetzky was a responsible party. Reserving some flexibility for the jury in weighing circumstances, as well as finding raw facts, makes sense in cases like this one &#8212; as it does in accident cases where the jury decides whether the known facts add up to negligence. Often, the jury's legal calculus is buried because one cannot know just what facts it found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, here Lubetzky is entitled to claim that regardless of the jury's view, a court ought not hold him responsible where, as he has established, he could not have paid out substantial sums for the taxes without ignoring the directions of the company's highest officials and quite possibly losing his job. The IRS regulation quoted above concedes that a mere bookkeeper who only wrote checks would not be liable in such a case even though he knew that taxes were unpaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, unless we avert our eyes, the jury verdict in this case depends on the legal proposition that someone in Lubetzky's position had to confront top management and quite possibly resign from his position if he wanted to avoid the risk of liability for the period before he became president (liability afterwards is even harder to avoid). This is a harsh dilemma with which to confront someone, and we have found little case law that deals with the issue in such stark terms. Perhaps this is not surprising, given the unusual starkness of the choice in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, what case law exists at the circuit level is mostly favorable to the government. Thus, in <i>Brounstein v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595192\"><a href=\"/opinion/595192/lou-brounstein-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1992), a former salesman who was the (perhaps nominal) president and (clearly actual) assistant treasurer and check-writer was held liable even though the Third Circuit assumed <i>arguendo</i> that Brounstein's effective superior might have told him not to pay &#8212; and might have fired Brounstein had he done otherwise. \"Instructions from a superior not to pay taxes do not,\" said the court, \"take a person otherwise responsible under [the statute] out of that category.\" <i>Id.</i> at 955.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar in effect is <i>Roth v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462556\"><a href=\"/opinion/462556/charles-richard-roth-plaintiff-counterclaim-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1567</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1986), where the Eleventh Circuit said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, no instruction by the president or the majority owner of [the corporation] could effectively bar an otherwise responsible officer from paying these funds in accordance with the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1572; <i>accord Howard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421179\"><a href=\"/opinion/421179/waymon-leon-howard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span>, 734 (5th Cir.1983) (\"The fact that Jennings might well have fired Howard had he disobeyed Jennings' instructions and paid the taxes does not make Howard any less responsible for their payment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own decision in <i>Vinick II</i> is perhaps the best case in Lubetzky's favor, but it is easily distinguishable. Vinick was formally the treasurer of a small company in which he was an investor; but &#8212; unlike Lubetzky &#8212; he was neither paid by the company nor engaged in day-to-day business affairs, had no office at the company, and did not sign checks in the relevant time frame. Throughout the period in question, Vinick was a CPA with his own private practice elsewhere. 205 F.3d at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have not separately addressed the period after Lubetzky became president because, if anything, his responsibility was then enhanced &#8212; although perhaps not greatly, given his company's dominance by its U.K. parent and by Saunders. Nor, in light of our disposition, is it necessary to consider whether Lubetzky's authority in this later period independently obliged him to make payments for the <i>earlier</i> three quarters if the cash had been on hand. <i>Compare Slodov,</i> 436 U.S. at 259-260, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109863\"><a href=\"/opinion/109863/slodov-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1778</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also need not address in detail Lubetzky's challenge to the jury's finding that he became a responsible person on July 4, 1996. Lubetzky became an officer shortly before July 1996, and at trial the earliest check on which Lubetzky was the sole signer was dated July 4, 1996; the jury was entitled to find that this was the first day that Lubetzky had the requisite degree of control over MediaForum's financial affairs to render him a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, on this record, the party most directly responsible in this case for the failure to pay was Saunders, who gave the fatal instruction to Lubetzky. This is certainly true for the first three quarters, and most likely for a significant portion of the $90,000 plus interest now due. There is some possibility that Saunders &#8212; and perhaps Ponton &#8212; may be liable to Lubetzky, <i>see</i> I.R.C. &#167; 6672(d), but that issue is not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lubetzky has also sought review of the district court's denial of his alternative motion for a new trial. The district judge can order a new trial where the verdict is against the weight of the evidence &#8212; Lubetzky's main claim here. But such decisions are reviewed only with great deference, <i>Stuart,</i> 337 F.3d at 37, and in this instance the denial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
