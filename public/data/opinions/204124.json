This appeal grows out of an action\n\nbrought by four purchasers of allegedly defective products.            Their\n\ncomplaint, filed in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts, sought class certification and the\n\nrecovery   of    class-wide   damages   against   the   manufacturer,      its\n\nparent, and a firm that had acquired its assets.\n\n           Confronted    by   dispositive   motions,    Fed.   R.   Civ.   P.\n\n12(b)(6), the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief could be granted.                The court\n\nentered    judgment    accordingly.      The   plaintiffs      twice   moved\n\nunsuccessfully to set aside the judgment and file an amended\n\ncomplaint.      They now appeal only from the denial of the second of\n\nthese post-judgment motions.1\n\n           This appeal requires us to decide what legal standard\n\nobtained with respect to the motion under review.           That, in turn,\n\nrequires us to decide an antecedent question: what effect, if any,\n\ndoes a passing reference to a possible future motion to amend,\n\ncontained in an opposition to a motion to dismiss, have on the\n\ndistrict court's authority to allow amendment of a dismissed\n\ncomplaint after the entry of judgment?\n\n\n\n     1\n        All references in this opinion to the Civil Rules are to\nthe Civil Rules as they stood prior to the 2009 amendments. We\nnote, for the sake of completeness, that Rule 15(a) and Rule 59(e),\nboth discussed infra, have been amended, effective December 1,\n2009. These amendments are of no consequence for purposes of this\nappeal.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            We hold that such a passing request is without effect in\n\nthese circumstances. Thus, the plaintiffs must carry the burden of\n\nshowing that they are entitled to relief from the previously\n\nentered judgment.      They have not done so.        Accordingly, we affirm\n\nthe   denial   of    their    post-judgment     motion   (albeit   on   grounds\n\ndifferent than those relied on by the lower court).\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            The plaintiffs filed their original complaint on December\n\n27, 2007.      They alleged that Kadant Composites LLC (Composites)\n\nmanufactured and sold defective decking and railing products and\n\nfailed to honor its concomitant warranty obligations. In addition,\n\nthe complaint sought to pierce the corporate veil and recover\n\nagainst   Composites's       corporate    parent,   Kadant,   Inc.   (Kadant).\n\nAmong other things, Kadant allegedly had attempted to deflect\n\nliability by (i) using Composites as its alter ego; (ii) selling\n\nComposites's       assets    to   a   subsidiary    of   Liberty   Diversified\n\nIndustries, Inc. (LDI) in a purportedly fraudulent transaction; and\n\n(iii) helping to set up a deliberately underfunded pool for paying\n\nout warranty claims.         Finally, the complaint set forth breach-of-\n\nwarranty claims against LDI.\n\n            Each defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for failure\n\nto state an actionable claim.             Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).         The\n\nplaintiffs opposed the motions.               They did not, however, avail\n\nthemselves of their vested opportunity to amend as of right.               See\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (providing that a plaintiff may amend his\n\ncomplaint once, as a matter of right, before an answer is filed);\n\nsee also Connectu LLC v. Zuckerberg, 522 F.3d 82, 91, 95-96 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (illustrating operation of the rule).            Nor did the\n\nplaintiffs file a motion for leave to amend their complaint.\n\nInstead, in the last line of their opposition to the motions to\n\ndismiss, they stated: \"If and to the extent that this Court finds\n\nthe Complaint deficient in any respect, Plaintiffs request leave to\n\namend to plead additional facts to cure any deficiency.\"\n\n          In due course, the district court granted the Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motions and dismissed the case.        Fisher v. Kadant, Inc.,\n\nNo. 07-12375 (D. Mass. Nov. 19, 2008) (unpublished order).           As to\n\nComposites,   the   court   concluded   that   the   plaintiffs    had   not\n\nsufficiently pleaded any of the asserted causes of action.           As to\n\nKadant, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to plead\n\nfacts sufficient to pierce Composites's corporate veil.           And as to\n\nLDI, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to plead\n\nfacts sufficient to establish successor liability.        In the absence\n\nof any pending motion for leave to file an amended complaint, the\n\ncourt entered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiffs have not\n\nappealed from the entry of this judgment and, thus, the correctness\n\nof the order of dismissal is not before us.\n\n          On December 4, 2008, the plaintiffs moved to reconsider\n\nthe judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint.                 The\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fdefendants objected. The court denied the motion without prejudice\n\non January 12, 2009, explaining that the plaintiffs had failed to\n\nproffer a proposed amended complaint along with their motion.\n\nFisher v. Kadant, Inc., No. 07-12375 (D. Mass. Jan. 12, 2009)\n\n(unpublished order).    The plaintiffs have not appealed from the\n\ndenial of this motion and, thus, the correctness of this order is\n\nnot before us.\n\n            On January 27, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a renewed\n\nmotion seeking the same relief.    This time, however, they annexed\n\na proposed amended complaint to their motion. The defendants again\n\nobjected.     The district court analyzed this motion under the\n\nliberal pleading standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and found it\n\nwanting.    With respect to Kadant, the court determined that the\n\nproposed amended complaint did not adequately plead facts anent\n\nveil-piercing (alter ego liability).        Further, in the proposed\n\namended complaint the plaintiffs dropped their claims against LDI\n\nbut added claims against its subsidiary, LDI Composites Co. (the\n\nacquirer of Composites's assets).       The district court determined\n\nthat, notwithstanding the change in parties, the proposed amended\n\ncomplaint did not adequately plead successor liability.     As to all\n\nof these claims, the court made an explicit finding that any\n\nfurther attempt to amend would be futile.\n\n            The court also rejected the plaintiffs' importuning that\n\nthey should be allowed to assert new warranty claims against\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fComposites, noting that those claims were not supported by any new\n\nfacts and, accordingly, should have been raised earlier in the\n\nlitigation.         Because the proposed amended complaint stated no\n\nactionable claim against any defendant, the court denied the\n\nplaintiffs' motion with prejudice. Fisher v. Kadant, Inc., No. 07-\n\n12375 (D. Mass. Mar. 3, 2009) (unpublished order).\n\n            The plaintiffs took a timely appeal from this order.                 In\n\nthe appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the court below abused its\n\ndiscretion     by    denying   their    renewed    motion    for    post-judgment\n\nrelief. The defendants counter that the district court reached the\n\nright result even though the court applied too generous a legal\n\nstandard in evaluating the motion.            In this regard, the defendants\n\nreason that because the district court entered judgment before the\n\nfiling of the motion, the court should not have looked to Rule\n\n15(a) for guidance, but rather to the rules governing relief from\n\njudgment.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n            As said, the plaintiffs have appealed only a single\n\norder:   the   district     court's     denial    of   the   second    motion   for\n\nreconsideration.        To determine the soundness of that order, we\n\nfirst must identify the governing legal standard.                   In undertaking\n\nthat   task,   we    are   mindful     that   identifying     the    proper   legal\n\nstandard to be applied in ruling on a particular matter presents a\n\nquestion of law and, thus, the district court's identification of\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe standard is subject to de novo review.              Vinick v. United\n\nStates, 205 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2000); Inmates of Suffolk County\n\nJail v. Rufo, 12 F.3d 286, 291 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             Ordinarily, Rule 15(a) governs a motion to amend a\n\ncomplaint.    That rule directs that \"[t]he court should freely give\n\nleave [to amend] when justice so requires.\"             Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n15(a)(2).    If, however, a motion to amend is filed after the entry\n\nof judgment, the district court lacks authority to consider the\n\nmotion under Rule 15(a) unless and until the judgment is set aside.\n\nSee Palmer v. Champion Mortg., 465 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nMaldonado v. Dominguez, 137 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1998).         As long as\n\nthe judgment remains in effect, Rule 15(a) is inapposite.\n\n             A good statement of this black-letter law is found in\n\nAcevedo-Villalobos v. Hernández, 22 F.3d 384 (1st Cir. 1994), in\n\nwhich   we   wrote:   \"Unless   postjudgment   relief   is   granted,   the\n\ndistrict court lacks power to grant a motion to amend the complaint\n\nunder Rule 15(a).\"     Id. at 389.   The rationale for the principle is\n\nunassailable: once judgment has entered, the case is a dead letter,\n\nand the district court is without power to allow an amendment to\n\nthe complaint because there is no complaint left to amend. Mirpuri\n\nv. ACT Mfg., Inc., 212 F.3d 624, 628-29 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             In the instant case, the plaintiffs did not file a motion\n\nto amend their complaint until December 4, 2008.             That was well\n\nafter November 19, 2008, when the district court entered judgment.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fConsequently, the district court lacked authority to entertain the\n\nmotion to amend under the aegis of Rule 15(a) without first setting\n\naside the judgment under some rule geared to the accomplishment of\n\nthat task, say, Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b).\n\n           This court's reasoning in James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71 (1st\n\nCir. 1983) (Breyer, J.), is especially instructive.            There, the\n\nplaintiffs waited until after judgment had entered before moving\n\nfor leave to amend their complaint.        The court upheld a denial of\n\nthe motion, explaining:\n\n           To require the district court to permit\n           amendment here would allow plaintiffs to\n           pursue a case to judgment and then, if they\n           lose, to reopen the case by amending their\n           complaint to take account of the court's\n           decision. Such a practice would dramatically\n           undermine the ordinary rules governing the\n           finality of judicial decisions, and should not\n           be sanctioned in the absence of compelling\n           circumstances.\n\nId. at 78.\n\n           In an effort to deflect the force of this precedent, the\n\nplaintiffs   point   out   that,   in   their   memorandum   opposing   the\n\ndefendants' motions to dismiss, they made a passing request for\n\nleave to amend in the event that the court found the complaint\n\nwanting.     The district court did not refer to this contingent\n\nrequest when granting the motions to dismiss, but it later ruled\n\nthat because the plaintiffs had \"initially raised the possibility\n\nof amending the Complaint before dismissal,\" their second post-\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fjudgment motion should be treated \"as a Rule 15(a) motion to amend\n\nthe pleadings before judgment.\"\n\n              For present purposes, then, the controlling question is\n\nwhether a contingent request to amend a complaint, contained in an\n\nopposition to a motion to dismiss, trumps the final judgment rule\n\nand reinstates the liberal standard of Rule 15(a) for the purpose\n\nof adjudicating a motion for post-judgment relief, the object of\n\nwhich is to put into play a new version of the complaint.             We hold\n\nthat it does not.\n\n              Here, as is often the case, past is prologue.        In Gray v.\n\nEvercore Restructuring L.L.C., 544 F.3d 320 (1st Cir. 2008), this\n\ncourt dealt with the efficacy of such a contingent request to\n\namend.    There, the plaintiff's opposition to a motion to dismiss\n\nhis complaint declared that \"in the event that the Court finds that\n\nthe Amended Complaint fails to state a claim, Plaintiff requests\n\nleave    to   replead.\"    Id.   at   327.   We   refused   to    treat   this\n\ncontingent request as the functional equivalent of a pre-judgment\n\nmotion to amend; rather, we held flatly that such a \"statement does\n\nnot constitute a motion to amend a complaint.\"         Id.       We therefore\n\nconcluded that the district court had no obligation to perform a\n\nRule 15(a) analysis.      Id.\n\n              Earlier case law in this circuit is to the same effect.\n\nSee, e.g., ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v. Advest, Inc., 512 F.3d 46, 57\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (explaining that a contingent request to replead,\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fcontained in an opposition to a motion to dismiss, \"does not win\n\nthe day for the plaintiffs\" because, if honored, it \"would lead to\n\ndelays, inefficiencies, and wasted work\"); Wayne Inv., Inc. v. Gulf\n\nOil Corp., 739 F.2d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 1984) (holding that contingent\n\nrequest for leave to amend made in an opposition to motion to\n\ndismiss does not qualify as a motion to amend sufficient to\n\npreserve the amendment question for appeal).                 What Judge (now\n\nJustice) Breyer wrote in James, quoted supra, is apropos here:\n\nallowing    plaintiffs   to    hedge    their   bets   by   adding   a   cursory\n\ncontingent request in an opposition to a motion to dismiss would\n\nencourage plaintiffs to test the mettle of successive complaints\n\nand freely amend under Rule 15(a) if their original strategic\n\nchoices prove inadvisable.\n\n            The plaintiffs attempt to counterpunch by citing our\n\ndecision in United States ex rel. Rost v. Pfizer, Inc., 507 F.3d\n\n720 (1st Cir. 2007), abrogated on other grounds by Allison Engine\n\nCo. v. United States ex rel. Sanders, 128 S. Ct. 2123 (2008).\n\nThere, the plaintiff appealed directly from the district court's\n\ndismissal of his complaint and argued that, if the decision were\n\nnot reversed, he should at least be permitted to try anew by means\n\nof amending his complaint.       Id. at 733.      In support, he noted that\n\nhe had made a contingent request to amend prior to the entry of\n\njudgment.    Id. at 734.      The court of appeals upheld the dismissal\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fof the complaint and, without much elaboration, remanded for\n\nfurther consideration of whether to permit amendment.                 Id.\n\n              Rost is off point.    That case, unlike this one, involved\n\nan appeal from the granting of a motion to dismiss.                   See id. at\n\n723.   In that procedural posture, the court of appeals may, in its\n\ndiscretion and in the interests of justice, affirm the dismissal of\n\nthe complaint, yet nonetheless permit further amendment of it. See\n\nViqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 1998); Degnan v.\n\nPublicker Indus., Inc., 83 F.3d 27, 29 (1st Cir. 1996); Rivera-\n\nGomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 636 (1st Cir. 1988).                 Rost came\n\nto the court of appeals in this posture — and the existence of the\n\ncontingent request to amend was merely one of the factors that bore\n\non the exercise of the appellate court's discretion. Cf. Gray, 544\n\nF.3d     at   327   (cautioning    that     \"[t]here    may     be    exceptional\n\ncircumstances in which a [pre-judgment] request to amend will\n\nbecome    the   functional   equivalent      of   a    motion    to    amend\").\n\n              The case at hand is a horse of a different hue.               Here,\n\nthe plaintiffs did not appeal from the order of dismissal.                  Thus,\n\nthis case presents an entirely different question — a question\n\ndealing with the legal standard that a district court should employ\n\nin adjudicating a motion for reconsideration filed after the entry\n\nof judgment.        The Rost court did not deal with this question\n\n(indeed, the plaintiff there had not filed any post-judgment\n\nmotion).      To apply Rost to the materially different configuration\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fof this case would undercut the procedural protections erected by\n\nthe Civil Rules to safeguard the finality of judgments. See, e.g.,\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), 60(b).\n\n            That ends this aspect of the case.              We hold that a\n\npassing request for contingent leave to file an amended complaint,\n\nmade in an opposition to a motion to dismiss, is insufficient, in\n\nand of itself, to bring a post-judgment motion for reconsideration\n\nwithin the orbit of Rule 15(a).         Put another way, such a request is\n\nwithout effect where, as here, no appeal is taken from the granting\n\nof the underlying motion to dismiss. Consequently, the plaintiffs'\n\ncontingent request, embodied in a single sentence at the tail end\n\nof their lengthy and heated opposition to the defendants' motions\n\nto dismiss, did not transmogrify their post-judgment motion for\n\nreconsideration into a Rule 15(a) motion.         Accordingly, the denial\n\nof   that   motion   must   be    evaluated   under   the   more    stringent\n\nrequirements that apply to motions for relief from judgment.             Only\n\nif the plaintiffs have satisfied those requirements will we have\n\noccasion to decide whether the district court abused its discretion\n\nin denying leave to amend under Rule 15(a).\n\n            In   their   motion   for   reconsideration,    the    plaintiffs\n\nmention two such rules: Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b).          The former rule\n\nprovided at the relevant time, see supra note 1, that a \"motion to\n\nalter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than 10 days after\n\nthe entry of the judgment.\"          Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).        This time\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\flimit is mandatory.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b) (prohibiting any\n\nextension of time under Rule 59(e)). An untimely motion under Rule\n\n59(e) is a nullity.    Morris v. Unum Life Ins. Co., 430 F.3d 500,\n\n502 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            The   plaintiffs   filed    their   first   motion   for\n\nreconsideration on December 4, 2008.        Viewed as a Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion, that motion was timely; that is, the motion was filed\n\nwithin ten business days after the district court's entry of\n\njudgment.    But that motion is not before us: the district court\n\ndenied it without prejudice because it did not contain a proposed\n\namended complaint, and the plaintiffs did not appeal from that\n\norder.2\n\n            This brings us to the plaintiffs' second (renewed) motion\n\nfor reconsideration — a motion that likewise sought relief from the\n\nunderlying judgment of dismissal. The plaintiffs filed that motion\n\n\n\n     2\n       The district court had the authority to reserve decision on\nthe first motion to reconsider and allow the plaintiffs to\nsupplement it with a proposed amended complaint. That step would\nhave preserved the motion's timeliness. See, e.g., Dresdner Bank\nAG v. M/V Olympia Voyager, 465 F.3d 1267, 1271-72 (11th Cir. 2006);\nU.S. E. Telecomms., Inc. v. U.S. W. Info. Sys., 15 F.3d 261, 263\n(2d Cir. 1994). Here, however, that is not what the district court\ndid; rather, it denied the motion. The plaintiffs have not argued\nthat the district court's order was the functional equivalent of\nallowing supplementation. The fact that the order specified that\nthe denial of the first motion was \"without prejudice\" did not\nrender the second motion timely. Cf. Chico-Velez v. Roche Prods.,\nInc., 139 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding that an untimely\nrefiling of a complaint is not excused simply because the district\ncourt denied the initial filing without prejudice).\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fon January 27, 2009.    Because this motion was not filed within the\n\nten-day window that opened following the entry of judgment, the\n\ndistrict court was without authority to consider it under Rule\n\n59(e).    See id.   The fact that it was filed within ten days of the\n\ndenial of the first motion for reconsideration makes no difference.\n\nSee Acevedo-Villalobos, 22 F.3d at 390 (holding that even though\n\nmovant filed second Rule 59(e) motion within ten days of denial of\n\nfirst such motion, second motion, which sought relief from the\n\nunderlying judgment, was untimely because it was filed more than\n\nten days after the entry of that judgment).\n\n            The plaintiffs' alternative basis for their second motion\n\nfor reconsideration implicates Rule 60(b). Here, timeliness is not\n\nan issue: a motion under Rule 60(b) must be filed \"within a\n\nreasonable time,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1), and on certain grounds\n\nwithin one year from entry of the judgment, id. (identifying Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(3)).       Either way, the plaintiffs' second\n\nmotion for reconsideration, when viewed as a Rule 60(b) motion, was\n\ntimely.\n\n            Having isolated the only cognizable basis for the motion,\n\nwe next focus the lens of our inquiry on the standard of review.\n\nAn appellate court ordinarily reviews for abuse of discretion a\n\ntrial court's denial of a motion brought pursuant to Rule 60(b).3\n\n\n     3\n       Rule 60(b)(4), which permits relief from void judgments,\nimplicates different standards of review. See Shank/Balfour Beatty\nv. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers Local 99, 497 F.3d 83, 94 (1st Cir.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fCintrón-Lorenzo v. Departamento de Asuntos del Consumidor, 312 F.3d\n\n522, 527 (1st Cir. 2002).          Here, however, the district court did\n\nnot   review   the   motion     under    Rule   60(b)   at   all.     In   such   a\n\nsituation, one option is to remand to the district court for\n\nconsideration under the correct standard.                    See, e.g., Colón-\n\nSantiago v. Rosario, 438 F.3d 101, 112 (1st Cir. 2006); John G.\n\nAlden, Inc. v. John G. Alden Ins. Agency of Fla., Inc., 389 F.3d\n\n21, 25 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           In this case, we conclude that remand would be an empty\n\ngesture.       The   district    court    applied   a    more    relief-friendly\n\nstandard than that which obtains under Rule 60(b) — the Rule 15(a)\n\nstandard — yet nonetheless denied relief.               When, as in this case,\n\nthe trial court uses a standard that is more generous than the\n\ncorrect standard yet determines that the party seeking relief\n\ncannot prevail, the court of appeals is free to conclude that the\n\nsame result would obtain under the less generous standard (and,\n\nthus, need not remand).         See, e.g., TMF Tool Co. v. Siebengartner,\n\n899 F.2d 584, 588 n.4 (7th Cir. 1990).\n\n           Here, moreover, there is a second reason why remand is\n\nunnecessary. The plaintiffs have not made a prima facie showing of\n\nthe elements needed to secure Rule 60(b) relief.                This, then, is an\n\n\n\n2007). The present plaintiffs have not argued that the judgment\nagainst them is void, and nothing in our discussion of the\nplaintiffs' Rule 60(b) motion is meant to refer to motions under\nRule 60(b)(4).\n\n                                        -15-\n\fappropriate case for application of the principle that even if the\n\ndistrict court employs an incorrect legal standard, the court of\n\nappeals, in lieu of remanding, may affirm the challenged ruling on\n\nan alternate ground that is evident in the record.             See, e.g.,\n\nInterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2003); Inmates\n\nof Suffolk County Jail, 12 F.3d at 291; Amman v. Stow Sch. Sys.,\n\n982 F.2d 644, 649 (1st Cir. 1992); cf. Societe Des Produits Nestle,\n\nS.A. v. Casa Helvetia, Inc., 982 F.2d 633, 642 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(concluding that, in lieu of remanding based on the district\n\ncourt's use of an improper legal standard, the court of appeals may\n\napply the district court's key findings of fact to the correct\n\nstandard).\n\n           The Rule 60(b) standard is familiar.       Success under that\n\nrule requires more than merely casting doubt on the correctness of\n\nthe underlying judgment.       See Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288 F.3d\n\n15,   19   (1st     Cir.   2002).    Rather,   Rule   60(b)    relief   is\n\n\"extraordinary in nature\" and, thus, \"motions invoking that rule\n\nshould be granted sparingly.\"       Id.    A party seeking relief under\n\nRule 60(b) must demonstrate \"at a bare minimum, that his motion is\n\ntimely;      that    exceptional     circumstances    exist,     favoring\n\nextraordinary relief; that if the judgment is set aside, he has the\n\nright stuff to mount a potentially meritorious claim or defense;\n\nand that no unfair prejudice will accrue to the opposing parties\n\nshould the motion be granted.\"       Id.\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f           Rule 60(b) is not a monolith. It provides that the court\n\nmay relieve a party from a final judgment on any of six enumerated\n\ngrounds. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(6). The plaintiffs suggest\n\ntwo bases for invoking Rule 60(b).            We address these suggestions\n\nseparately.\n\n           First, the plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to\n\nrelief from judgment based on newly discovered evidence.                    They\n\nclaim to have adduced this newly discovered evidence through their\n\ncounsels' eleven-month investigation between the commencement of\n\nthe   action   and   the    service   of     their   sequential   motions   for\n\nreconsideration.\n\n           Motions    for    relief    from    judgment   based   upon   newly\n\ndiscovered evidence are typically analyzed under Rule 60(b)(2).\n\nSee, e.g., Karak, 288 F.3d at 19.            Although the plaintiffs do not\n\nexplicitly invoke subsection (2) of Rule 60(b) in their briefs on\n\nappeal,4 we have previously declared, and today reaffirm, that\n\npost-judgment relief will not normally be denied for the movant's\n\nfailure to designate the proper subsection of Rule 60(b).                   See\n\nMitchell v. Hobbs, 951 F.2d 417, 421 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991); see also\n\nAcevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 368 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(reviewing defendants' post-judgment motion under Rule 60(b)(6)\n\n\n      4\n       The plaintiffs' failure to develop this argument in their\nbriefs may well constitute either a waiver or a forfeiture. See\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). We give\nthem the benefit of the doubt and assume for argument's sake that\nno waiver or forfeiture transpired.\n\n                                      -17-\n\feven though defendants did not cite that subsection in their\n\nmotion).\n\n              Moving   to   the   substance     of   the    claim,    we    find   it\n\nunpersuasive.       The customary practice is to investigate first and\n\nsue later, not vice-versa.        In any event, \"a party who seeks relief\n\nfrom a judgment based on newly discovered evidence must, at the\n\nvery least, offer a convincing explanation as to why he could not\n\nhave proffered the crucial evidence at an earlier stage of the\n\nproceedings.\"       Karak, 288 F.3d at 19-20.\n\n              Here, the plaintiffs have not offered any cogent reason\n\nwhy they could not, in the exercise of due diligence, have obtained\n\nthe   evidence      earlier.      Nor    have    they      offered   a     plausible\n\nexplanation as to why they failed to seek leave to amend their\n\ncomplaint based on this evidence before judgment entered.                    That a\n\nstrategic choice may have backfired is not a ground for relief from\n\njudgment.\n\n              The   plaintiffs'     second      asserted     basis    for     relief\n\nimplicates Rule 60(b)(1).          This rule provides that the district\n\ncourt   may    grant   relief     from   a     judgment     based    on    \"mistake,\n\ninadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\"                  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n60(b)(1). The plaintiffs do not focus on their own inadvertence or\n\nneglect but, rather, allege that this rule applies because the\n\ndistrict court made a mistake.                 This alleged mistake has two\n\nclosely related aspects: the court (i) overlooked the plaintiffs'\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fcontingent      request   to   amend,    made   at   the   tail   end    of    their\n\nopposition to the motions to dismiss, and (ii) neglected to rule on\n\nthat request before entering final judgment.5\n\n           The district court's actions cannot reasonably be termed\n\n\"a mistake.\"     We were presented with the same situation in Gray, in\n\nwhich the district court did not make any reference to a passing\n\nrequest    to    preserve      a   contingent     future    right       to    amend,\n\nmemorialized      only    in   the   plaintiffs'     opposition     to       several\n\nsimultaneous motions to dismiss.          We held that the passing request\n\nwas not tantamount to a motion to amend and, thus, because the\n\nplaintiff had failed to move for leave to amend, \"the district\n\ncourt cannot be faulted for failing to grant such leave sua\n\nsponte.\"     Gray, 544 F.3d at 327.             The same is true here: the\n\ndistrict court did not make a \"mistake\" in failing to grant leave\n\nto amend before dismissing the case because no motion to amend was\n\npending at that time.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The courts of appeals do not agree on what circumstances\nentitle a party to Rule 60(b)(1) relief based on an error of the\ncourt. See 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2858, at 293-95 (2d ed.\n1995). Some courts hold that the term \"mistake,\" as used in Rule\n60(b)(1), applies to errors of the court, including errors of law.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Reyes, 307 F.3d 451, 455 (6th Cir.\n2002); Cashner v. Freedom Stores, Inc., 98 F.3d 572, 576 (10th Cir.\n1996). Conversely, this court has held that an error of law cannot\nbe regarded as a \"mistake\" within the purview of Rule 60(b)(1).\nSee Silk v. Sandoval, 435 F.2d 1266, 1267 (1st Cir. 1971). This\ncase does not require us to delve into this distraction.\n\n                                        -19-\n\f            We need go no further.          The short of it is that there are\n\nno   exceptional     circumstances       here   such   as    would    justify   the\n\ngranting of extraordinary relief.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n                To   summarize,    the    plaintiffs    have    not     shown   any\n\ncognizable basis for granting relief from judgment.                  Consequently,\n\nwe may simply affirm the only order appealed from — the order\n\ndenying   the    plaintiffs'      renewed    motion    for   reconsideration      —\n\nwithout reaching the logically subsequent question of whether the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend\n\nunder Rule 15(a).\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f",

This appeal grows out of an action\n\nbrought by four purchasers of allegedly defective products.            Their\n\ncomplaint, filed in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts, sought class certification and the\n\nrecovery   of    class-wide   damages   against   the   manufacturer,      its\n\nparent, and a firm that had acquired its assets.\n\n           Confronted    by   dispositive   motions,    Fed.   R.   Civ.   P.\n\n12(b)(6), the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief could be granted.                The court\n\nentered    judgment    accordingly.      The   plaintiffs      twice   moved\n\nunsuccessfully to set aside the judgment and file an amended\n\ncomplaint.      They now appeal only from the denial of the second of\n\nthese post-judgment motions.1\n\n           This appeal requires us to decide what legal standard\n\nobtained with respect to the motion under review.           That, in turn,\n\nrequires us to decide an antecedent question: what effect, if any,\n\ndoes a passing reference to a possible future motion to amend,\n\ncontained in an opposition to a motion to dismiss, have on the\n\ndistrict court's authority to allow amendment of a dismissed\n\ncomplaint after the entry of judgment?\n\n\n\n     1\n        All references in this opinion to the Civil Rules are to\nthe Civil Rules as they stood prior to the 2009 amendments. We\nnote, for the sake of completeness, that Rule 15(a) and Rule 59(e),\nboth discussed infra, have been amended, effective December 1,\n2009. These amendments are of no consequence for purposes of this\nappeal.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f            We hold that such a passing request is without effect in\n\nthese circumstances. Thus, the plaintiffs must carry the burden of\n\nshowing that they are entitled to relief from the previously\n\nentered judgment.      They have not done so.        Accordingly, we affirm\n\nthe   denial   of    their    post-judgment     motion   (albeit   on   grounds\n\ndifferent than those relied on by the lower court).\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            The plaintiffs filed their original complaint on December\n\n27, 2007.      They alleged that Kadant Composites LLC (Composites)\n\nmanufactured and sold defective decking and railing products and\n\nfailed to honor its concomitant warranty obligations. In addition,\n\nthe complaint sought to pierce the corporate veil and recover\n\nagainst   Composites's       corporate    parent,   Kadant,   Inc.   (Kadant).\n\nAmong other things, Kadant allegedly had attempted to deflect\n\nliability by (i) using Composites as its alter ego; (ii) selling\n\nComposites's       assets    to   a   subsidiary    of   Liberty   Diversified\n\nIndustries, Inc. (LDI) in a purportedly fraudulent transaction; and\n\n(iii) helping to set up a deliberately underfunded pool for paying\n\nout warranty claims.         Finally, the complaint set forth breach-of-\n\nwarranty claims against LDI.\n\n            Each defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for failure\n\nto state an actionable claim.             Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).         The\n\nplaintiffs opposed the motions.               They did not, however, avail\n\nthemselves of their vested opportunity to amend as of right.               See\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (providing that a plaintiff may amend his\n\ncomplaint once, as a matter of right, before an answer is filed);\n\nsee also Connectu LLC v. Zuckerberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203264\"><a href=\"/opinion/203264/connectu-llc-v-zuckerberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91, 95-96 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (illustrating operation of the rule).            Nor did the\n\nplaintiffs file a motion for leave to amend their complaint.\n\nInstead, in the last line of their opposition to the motions to\n\ndismiss, they stated: \"If and to the extent that this Court finds\n\nthe Complaint deficient in any respect, Plaintiffs request leave to\n\namend to plead additional facts to cure any deficiency.\"\n\n          In due course, the district court granted the Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motions and dismissed the case.        Fisher v. Kadant, Inc.,\n\nNo. 07-12375 (D. Mass. Nov. 19, 2008) (unpublished order).           As to\n\nComposites,   the   court   concluded   that   the   plaintiffs    had   not\n\nsufficiently pleaded any of the asserted causes of action.           As to\n\nKadant, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to plead\n\nfacts sufficient to pierce Composites's corporate veil.           And as to\n\nLDI, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to plead\n\nfacts sufficient to establish successor liability.        In the absence\n\nof any pending motion for leave to file an amended complaint, the\n\ncourt entered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiffs have not\n\nappealed from the entry of this judgment and, thus, the correctness\n\nof the order of dismissal is not before us.\n\n          On December 4, 2008, the plaintiffs moved to reconsider\n\nthe judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint.                 The\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fdefendants objected. The court denied the motion without prejudice\n\non January 12, 2009, explaining that the plaintiffs had failed to\n\nproffer a proposed amended complaint along with their motion.\n\nFisher v. Kadant, Inc., No. 07-12375 (D. Mass. Jan. 12, 2009)\n\n(unpublished order).    The plaintiffs have not appealed from the\n\ndenial of this motion and, thus, the correctness of this order is\n\nnot before us.\n\n            On January 27, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a renewed\n\nmotion seeking the same relief.    This time, however, they annexed\n\na proposed amended complaint to their motion. The defendants again\n\nobjected.     The district court analyzed this motion under the\n\nliberal pleading standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) and found it\n\nwanting.    With respect to Kadant, the court determined that the\n\nproposed amended complaint did not adequately plead facts anent\n\nveil-piercing (alter ego liability).        Further, in the proposed\n\namended complaint the plaintiffs dropped their claims against LDI\n\nbut added claims against its subsidiary, LDI Composites Co. (the\n\nacquirer of Composites's assets).       The district court determined\n\nthat, notwithstanding the change in parties, the proposed amended\n\ncomplaint did not adequately plead successor liability.     As to all\n\nof these claims, the court made an explicit finding that any\n\nfurther attempt to amend would be futile.\n\n            The court also rejected the plaintiffs' importuning that\n\nthey should be allowed to assert new warranty claims against\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fComposites, noting that those claims were not supported by any new\n\nfacts and, accordingly, should have been raised earlier in the\n\nlitigation.         Because the proposed amended complaint stated no\n\nactionable claim against any defendant, the court denied the\n\nplaintiffs' motion with prejudice. Fisher v. Kadant, Inc., No. 07-\n\n12375 (D. Mass. Mar. 3, 2009) (unpublished order).\n\n            The plaintiffs took a timely appeal from this order.                 In\n\nthe appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the court below abused its\n\ndiscretion     by    denying   their    renewed    motion    for    post-judgment\n\nrelief. The defendants counter that the district court reached the\n\nright result even though the court applied too generous a legal\n\nstandard in evaluating the motion.            In this regard, the defendants\n\nreason that because the district court entered judgment before the\n\nfiling of the motion, the court should not have looked to Rule\n\n15(a) for guidance, but rather to the rules governing relief from\n\njudgment.\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n            As said, the plaintiffs have appealed only a single\n\norder:   the   district     court's     denial    of   the   second    motion   for\n\nreconsideration.        To determine the soundness of that order, we\n\nfirst must identify the governing legal standard.                   In undertaking\n\nthat   task,   we    are   mindful     that   identifying     the    proper   legal\n\nstandard to be applied in ruling on a particular matter presents a\n\nquestion of law and, thus, the district court's identification of\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe standard is subject to de novo review.

There, the\n\nplaintiffs waited until after judgment had entered before moving\n\nfor leave to amend their complaint.        The court upheld a denial of\n\nthe motion, explaining:\n\n           To require the district court to permit\n           amendment here would allow plaintiffs to\n           pursue a case to judgment and then, if they\n           lose, to reopen the case by amending their\n           complaint to take account of the court's\n           decision. Such a practice would dramatically\n           undermine the ordinary rules governing the\n           finality of judicial decisions, and should not\n           be sanctioned in the absence of compelling\n           circumstances.\n\nId. at 78.\n\n           In an effort to deflect the force of this precedent, the\n\nplaintiffs   point   out   that,   in   their   memorandum   opposing   the\n\ndefendants' motions to dismiss, they made a passing request for\n\nleave to amend in the event that the court found the complaint\n\nwanting.     The district court did not refer to this contingent\n\nrequest when granting the motions to dismiss, but it later ruled\n\nthat because the plaintiffs had \"initially raised the possibility\n\nof amending the Complaint before dismissal,\" their second post-\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fjudgment motion should be treated \"as a Rule 15(a) motion to amend\n\nthe pleadings before judgment.\"\n\n              For present purposes, then, the controlling question is\n\nwhether a contingent request to amend a complaint, contained in an\n\nopposition to a motion to dismiss, trumps the final judgment rule\n\nand reinstates the liberal standard of Rule 15(a) for the purpose\n\nof adjudicating a motion for post-judgment relief, the object of\n\nwhich is to put into play a new version of the complaint.             We hold\n\nthat it does not.\n\n              Here, as is often the case, past is prologue.

There, the plaintiff's opposition to a motion to dismiss\n\nhis complaint declared that \"in the event that the Court finds that\n\nthe Amended Complaint fails to state a claim, Plaintiff requests\n\nleave    to   replead.\"    Id.   at   327.   We   refused   to    treat   this\n\ncontingent request as the functional equivalent of a pre-judgment\n\nmotion to amend; rather, we held flatly that such a \"statement does\n\nnot constitute a motion to amend a complaint.\"         Id.       We therefore\n\nconcluded that the district court had no obligation to perform a\n\nRule 15(a) analysis.

Rost came\n\nto the court of appeals in this posture — and the existence of the\n\ncontingent request to amend was merely one of the factors that bore\n\non the exercise of the appellate court's discretion. Cf. Gray, 544\n\nF.3d     at   327   (cautioning    that     \"[t]here    may     be    exceptional\n\ncircumstances in which a [pre-judgment] request to amend will\n\nbecome    the   functional   equivalent      of   a    motion    to    amend\").\n\n              The case at hand is a horse of a different hue.               Here,\n\nthe plaintiffs did not appeal from the order of dismissal.                  Thus,\n\nthis case presents an entirely different question — a question\n\ndealing with the legal standard that a district court should employ\n\nin adjudicating a motion for reconsideration filed after the entry\n\nof judgment.        The Rost court did not deal with this question\n\n(indeed, the plaintiff there had not filed any post-judgment\n\nmotion).      To apply Rost to the materially different configuration\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fof this case would undercut the procedural protections erected by\n\nthe Civil Rules to safeguard the finality of judgments. See, e.g.,\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), 60(b).\n\n            That ends this aspect of the case.              We hold that a\n\npassing request for contingent leave to file an amended complaint,\n\nmade in an opposition to a motion to dismiss, is insufficient, in\n\nand of itself, to bring a post-judgment motion for reconsideration\n\nwithin the orbit of Rule 15(a).         Put another way, such a request is\n\nwithout effect where, as here, no appeal is taken from the granting\n\nof the underlying motion to dismiss. Consequently, the plaintiffs'\n\ncontingent request, embodied in a single sentence at the tail end\n\nof their lengthy and heated opposition to the defendants' motions\n\nto dismiss, did not transmogrify their post-judgment motion for\n\nreconsideration into a Rule 15(a) motion.         Accordingly, the denial\n\nof   that   motion   must   be    evaluated   under   the   more    stringent\n\nrequirements that apply to motions for relief from judgment.             Only\n\nif the plaintiffs have satisfied those requirements will we have\n\noccasion to decide whether the district court abused its discretion\n\nin denying leave to amend under Rule 15(a).\n\n            In   their   motion   for   reconsideration,    the    plaintiffs\n\nmention two such rules: Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b).          The former rule\n\nprovided at the relevant time, see supra note 1, that a \"motion to\n\nalter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than 10 days after\n\nthe entry of the judgment.\"          Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).        This time\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\flimit is mandatory.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b) (prohibiting any\n\nextension of time under Rule 59(e)).

Viewed as a Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion, that motion was timely; that is, the motion was filed\n\nwithin ten business days after the district court's entry of\n\njudgment.    But that motion is not before us: the district court\n\ndenied it without prejudice because it did not contain a proposed\n\namended complaint, and the plaintiffs did not appeal from that\n\norder.2\n\n            This brings us to the plaintiffs' second (renewed) motion\n\nfor reconsideration — a motion that likewise sought relief from the\n\nunderlying judgment of dismissal.

Siebengartner,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538858\"><a href=\"/opinion/538858/tmf-tool-company-incorporated-and-anton-kastory-v-robert-c-siebengartner/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588 n.4 (7th Cir. 1990).\n\n           Here, moreover, there is a second reason why remand is\n\nunnecessary. The plaintiffs have not made a prima facie showing of\n\nthe elements needed to secure Rule 60(b) relief.                This, then, is an\n\n\n\n2007). The present plaintiffs have not argued that the judgment\nagainst them is void, and nothing in our discussion of the\nplaintiffs' Rule 60(b) motion is meant to refer to motions under\nRule 60(b)(4).\n\n                                        -15-\n\fappropriate case for application of the principle that even if the\n\ndistrict court employs an incorrect legal standard, the court of\n\nappeals, in lieu of remanding, may affirm the challenged ruling on\n\nan alternate ground that is evident in the record.

Success under that\n\nrule requires more than merely casting doubt on the correctness of\n\nthe underlying judgment.       See Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199935\"><a href=\"/opinion/199935/karak-v-bursaw-oil-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   19   (1st     Cir.   2002).    Rather,   Rule   60(b)    relief   is\n\n\"extraordinary in nature\" and, thus, \"motions invoking that rule\n\nshould be granted sparingly.\"       Id.    A party seeking relief under\n\nRule 60(b) must demonstrate \"at a bare minimum, that his motion is\n\ntimely;      that    exceptional     circumstances    exist,     favoring\n\nextraordinary relief; that if the judgment is set aside, he has the\n\nright stuff to mount a potentially meritorious claim or defense;\n\nand that no unfair prejudice will accrue to the opposing parties\n\nshould the motion be granted.\"       Id.\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f           Rule 60(b) is not a monolith. It provides that the court\n\nmay relieve a party from a final judgment on any of six enumerated\n\ngrounds. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(6). The plaintiffs suggest\n\ntwo bases for invoking Rule 60(b).            We address these suggestions\n\nseparately.\n\n           First, the plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to\n\nrelief from judgment based on newly discovered evidence.                    They\n\nclaim to have adduced this newly discovered evidence through their\n\ncounsels' eleven-month investigation between the commencement of\n\nthe   action   and   the    service   of     their   sequential   motions   for\n\nreconsideration.\n\n           Motions    for    relief    from    judgment   based   upon   newly\n\ndiscovered evidence are typically analyzed under Rule 60(b)(2).\n\nSee, e.g., Karak, 288 F.3d at 19.            Although the plaintiffs do not\n\nexplicitly invoke subsection (2) of Rule 60(b) in their briefs on\n\nappeal,4 we have previously declared, and today reaffirm, that\n\npost-judgment relief will not normally be denied for the movant's\n\nfailure to designate the proper subsection of Rule 60(b).                   See\n\nMitchell v. Hobbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573872\"><a href=\"/opinion/573872/sebastian-infanzon-mitchell-as-trustee-of-r-cacho-co-inc-v-boyd/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991); see also\n\nAcevedo-Garcia v.

See\nUnited States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). We give\nthem the benefit of the doubt and assume for argument's sake that\nno waiver or forfeiture transpired.\n\n                                      -17-\n\feven though defendants did not cite that subsection in their\n\nmotion).\n\n              Moving   to   the   substance     of   the    claim,    we    find   it\n\nunpersuasive.       The customary practice is to investigate first and\n\nsue later, not vice-versa.        In any event, \"a party who seeks relief\n\nfrom a judgment based on newly discovered evidence must, at the\n\nvery least, offer a convincing explanation as to why he could not\n\nhave proffered the crucial evidence at an earlier stage of the\n\nproceedings.\"       Karak, 288 F.3d at 19-20.\n\n              Here, the plaintiffs have not offered any cogent reason\n\nwhy they could not, in the exercise of due diligence, have obtained\n\nthe   evidence      earlier.      Nor    have    they      offered   a     plausible\n\nexplanation as to why they failed to seek leave to amend their\n\ncomplaint based on this evidence before judgment entered.                    That a\n\nstrategic choice may have backfired is not a ground for relief from\n\njudgment.\n\n              The   plaintiffs'     second      asserted     basis    for     relief\n\nimplicates Rule 60(b)(1).          This rule provides that the district\n\ncourt   may    grant   relief     from   a     judgment     based    on    \"mistake,\n\ninadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\"                  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n60(b)(1). The plaintiffs do not focus on their own inadvertence or\n\nneglect but, rather, allege that this rule applies because the\n\ndistrict court made a mistake.                 This alleged mistake has two\n\nclosely related aspects: the court (i) overlooked the plaintiffs'\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fcontingent      request   to   amend,    made   at   the   tail   end    of    their\n\nopposition to the motions to dismiss, and (ii) neglected to rule on\n\nthat request before entering final judgment.5\n\n           The district court's actions cannot reasonably be termed\n\n\"a mistake.\"     We were presented with the same situation in Gray, in\n\nwhich the district court did not make any reference to a passing\n\nrequest    to    preserve      a   contingent     future    right       to    amend,\n\nmemorialized      only    in   the   plaintiffs'     opposition     to       several\n\nsimultaneous motions to dismiss.          We held that the passing request\n\nwas not tantamount to a motion to amend and, thus, because the\n\nplaintiff had failed to move for leave to amend, \"the district\n\ncourt cannot be faulted for failing to grant such leave sua\n\nsponte.\"     Gray, 544 F.3d at 327.             The same is true here: the\n\ndistrict court did not make a \"mistake\" in failing to grant leave\n\nto amend before dismissing the case because no motion to amend was\n\npending at that time.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       The courts of appeals do not agree on what circumstances\nentitle a party to Rule 60(b)(1) relief based on an error of the\ncourt. See 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2858, at 293-95 (2d ed.\n1995). Some courts hold that the term \"mistake,\" as used in Rule\n60(b)(1), applies to errors of the court, including errors of law.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Reyes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779459\"><a href=\"/opinion/779459/united-states-v-juan-reyes-juan-a-acevedo-claimant-appellant/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455 (6th Cir.\n2002); Cashner v. Freedom Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"154059\"><a href=\"/opinion/154059/cashner-v-freedom-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576 (10th Cir.\n1996). Conversely, this court has held that an error of law cannot\nbe regarded as a \"mistake\" within the purview of Rule 60(b)(1).\nSee Silk v. Sandoval, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"293893\"><a href=\"/opinion/293893/beatrice-silk-v-hilary-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1267 (1st Cir. 1971). This\ncase does not require us to delve into this distraction.\n\n                                        -19-\n\f            We need go no further.          The short of it is that there are\n\nno   exceptional     circumstances       here   such   as    would    justify   the\n\ngranting of extraordinary relief.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n                To   summarize,    the    plaintiffs    have    not     shown   any\n\ncognizable basis for granting relief from judgment.                  Consequently,\n\nwe may simply affirm the only order appealed from — the order\n\ndenying   the    plaintiffs'      renewed    motion    for   reconsideration      —\n\nwithout reaching the logically subsequent question of whether the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend\n\nunder Rule 15(a).\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f</pre>",
