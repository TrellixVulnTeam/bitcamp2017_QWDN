We affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of his claim, relying on our prior\n\ndispositions in Igartúa de la Rosa v. United States, 32 F.3d 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1049 (1995) (\"Igartúa I\") and\n\nIgartúa de la Rosa v. United States, 229 F.3d 80 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(\"Igartúa II\").      In Igartúa II, referring to Igartúa I, we noted\n\nthat \"this court held with undeniable clarity that the Constitution\n\nof the United States does not confer upon United States citizens\n\nresiding in Puerto Rico a right to participate in the national\n\nelection for President and Vice-President.\"             Igartúa II, 229 F.3d\n\nat 83.\n\n           Our prior opinions canvass the relevant constitutional\n\nlandscape.    Igartúa II, 229 F.3d at 83-84; Igartúa I, 32 F.3d at 9-\n\n11.   We need only observe that Igartúa has raised no argument that\n\nwould bring    the   matter    outside    the   usual   \"rule    that   earlier\n\ndecisions are binding.\" Igartúa II, 229 F.3d at 84 (discussing the\n\ntwo exceptions to the rule).

Only the en banc court, i.e. all the judges\n\nof the First Circuit sitting together, can alter a prior panel\n\nprecedent.    See Williams v.

And, of course, the Supreme\n\nCourt of     the   United   States     may,   by   certiorari   or    subsequent\n\nprecedent, overrule a circuit opinion.               Id.   Indeed, it seems\n\napparent that a definitive constitutional ruling of the magnitude\n\nsought   here      can,     in   the    final      analysis,    only        emanate\n\nauthoritatively from the Supreme Court itself.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                     (Dissenting Opinion follows.)\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).   David Hume, that\n\nmost seminal of British philosophers, in his essay That Politics\n\nMay Be Reduced To A Science,2 stated that \"[i]t may easily be\n\nobserved that though free governments have been commonly the most\n\nhappy for those who partake of their freedom, yet are they most\n\nruinous and oppressive to their provinces.\"    Although this was a\n\nstatement made with more direct reference to England's relationship\n\nto Ireland and its people, it is not one that is totally irrelevant\n\nto that between the United States and Puerto Rico and the four\n\nmillion United States citizens who reside there.\n\n           If on the one hand it can be argued that Puerto Rico and\n\nits \"citizens\" are better off materially than they were when the\n\nisland was invaded 106 years ago,3 the undeniable fact is that it\n\n\n2\n    David Hume, Political Essays 15 (Charles W.

One indicium of this condition is its comparative\n\neconomic condition. Its residents have an annual per capita income\n\nof $16,800 in contrast with those of Mississippi, the poorest\n\nstate, at $23,448 per capita.      It is even more disparate if we look\n\nto the national average, which is $37,800.4      The unemployment rates\n\nofficially average over 11%, although they are de facto much\n\nhigher.     Even at the official rate, however, they stand at twice\n\nthe national average.5       While these dismal statistics prevail,\n\nPuerto Rico is second only to Mexico as a market for U.S. goods in\n\nLatin   America6   and   several   billion   dollars   are   \"repatriated\"\n\n\n\n\nRico amounted to $12.1 billion.

Balzac, 182 U.S. 298 (1922), not only gives underlying support\n\nto this subservient condition, but more importantly, it relegates\n\nthe U.S. citizens who reside in Puerto Rico to perpetual inequality\n\nby   insulating   the    political    branches   of     government    from    any\n\neffective pressure from these citizens, who have neither voting\n\nrepresentation in Congress nor the right to vote for the offices of\n\n\n\n11\n    For a starter, see Juan R.

United\nStates, 182 U.S. 222 (1901); De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1 (1901).\nIn a nutshell, these cases created the status of unincorporated\nterritory whereby Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippine Islands were\nheld to be subject to Congress's plenary power pursuant to the\nterritorial clause of the Constitution. See U.S. Const. art. IV,\n§ 3, cl. 2. Together with the ruling in Balzac, decided after the\ngrant of U.S. citizenship to the residents of Puerto Rico, the\nCourt decided that only \"fundamental rights\" under the Constitution\nwere extended to Puerto Rico. See Balzac, 258 U.S. at 312-13.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fPresident and Vice-President.      Additionally, the laws enacted by\n\nCongress are applied to them without their participation in their\n\nenactment, or consent in their application.          This abusive shield\n\nand    undemocratic   condition   can    only   be   penetrated     by     the\n\nunpolitical branch of government.        Only the judicial branch can\n\ncorrect this denigrating and unacceptable condition, one which was\n\ncreated in the first place by that branch in the Insular Cases, et\n\nal.\n\n             The dead end with which these citizens are today faced\n\nwas forecast by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Downes when he\n\nsaid: \"The idea that this country may acquire territories anywhere\n\nupon the earth, by conquest or treaty, and hold them as mere\n\ncolonies or provinces -- the people inhabiting them to enjoy only\n\nthose rights as Congress chooses to accord to them -- is wholly\n\ninconsistent with the spirit and genius, as well as with the words,\n\nof    the   Constitution.\"   Downes,    182   U.S.   at   380   (Harlan,   J.\n\ndissenting).\n\n             The doctrine of inequality created by the Supreme Court\n\nin the Insular Cases stands on the same discredited theoretical\n\nfooting as that espoused by the majority in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163\n\nU.S. 537 (1896),14 and which was put to rest by the Supreme Court\n\nin Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).                Had the\n\n\n\n14\n   Justice Harlan also dissented, famously, in Plessy.             163 U.S.\nat 552.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fSupreme Court awaited for the political branches to correct the\n\ngross injustice perpetrated by Plessy upon the discrete minority\n\nagainst which it was directed, it is likely that state-sponsored\n\nracial segregation would still be with us.        Equally on point, it is\n\nthe judicial branch that is called upon to protect minorities from\n\nthe   otherwise    unchecked   abuses    of   a   potentially   oppressive\n\nmajority.15    \"[P]rejudice against discrete and insular minorities\n\nmay be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the\n\noperation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon\n\nto protect minorities, and . . . may call for correspondingly more\n\nsearching judicial inquiry.\" United States v. Carolene Prods. Co.,\n\n304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938).\n\n            Although   the   political   rights   of   the   United   States\n\ncitizens residing in Puerto Rico are at stake, the issue presented\n\nis not a \"political question\" any more than were the rights claimed\n\nin Brown.     Cf. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1802) (\"The province\n\nof the court is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals\n\n. . . .\").\n\n            Those born in Puerto Rico have since 1917 been born\n\ncitizens of the United States.     See Jones Act (Puerto Rico), Act of\n\nMarch 2, 1917, § 5, ch. 145, 39 Stat. 951 (1917); 8 U.S.C. § 1402.\n\nThe right to vote is a fundamental right inherent in citizenship.\n\n\n15\n    See John Stuart Mill, On Liberty 10 (Prometheus ed. 1986)\n(\"'[T]he tyranny of the majority' is now generally included among\nthe evils against which society requires to be on guard.\").\n\n                                   -9-\n\fTashjian v. Republican Party, 479 U.S. 208, 217 (1986).               It is\n\nfundamental because it is preservative of all other rights by\n\nadding the validating imprimatur of the ballot box to the business\n\nof government.     Furthermore, it has been considered a fundamental\n\nright since at least 1886, see Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356,\n\n370     (1886),   and    repeatedly     thereafter   in    a   variety    of\n\ncircumstances, see Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000); Buckley\n\nv. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 49 n.55 (1976); Lubin v. Panish, 415 U.S.\n\n709, 721 (1974); Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134 (1972); Phoenix v.\n\nKolodziejski, 399 U.S. 204 (1970);           Harper v.

Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 198\n\n(1992), and as being \"too important in our free society to be\n\nstripped of judicial protection,\" Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1,\n\n7     (1964).     This   is   particularly   relevant     in   the   present\n\ncircumstances since even under the notorious Insular Cases, the\n\nConstitution extends fundamental rights to Puerto Rico.                  See\n\nBalzac, 258 U.S. at 312-13.\n\n            The indefinite disenfranchisement of the United States\n\ncitizens residing in Puerto Rico constitutes a gross violation of\n\ntheir civil rights as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and by\n\ninternational treaties to which our Nation is a signatory.               The\n\nFifth Amendment is fully applicable to the actions of the U.S.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fGovernment in Puerto Rico.   Cf. Examining Bd. of Eng'rs v. Flores,\n\n446 U.S. 572 (1976).     An equal protection component, similar to\n\nthat in the Fourteenth Amendment, is part of the due process clause\n\ncontained in the Fifth Amendment and serves as a constraint on the\n\nUnited States.   Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954).   The utter\n\nfailure of the Government of the United States to protect its\n\ncitizens in Puerto Rico from continued national disenfranchisement\n\nis a violation of due process.\n\n          It is also a violation of Article 21 of the Universal\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights, G.A. Res. 217 A (III), U.N. Doc. A/810\n\nat 71 (1948) (\"UDHR\"), proclaimed by the member nations of the U.N.\n\nGeneral Assembly shortly after World War II.     The UDHR provides\n\nthat:\n\n          (1)Everyone has the right to take part in the\n          government of his country, directly or through\n          freely chosen representatives.\n          . . .\n\n          (3) The will of the people shall be . . .\n          expressed in periodic and genuine elections\n          which shall be by universal and equal suffrage\n          . . . .\n\nAlthough the UDHR does \"not of its own force impose obligations of\n\ninternational law,\" Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 125 S. Ct. 2739, 2767\n\n(2004), it has been recognized for its \"moral authority\" by the\n\nSupreme Court.

See 138 Cong. Rec. S-\n\n4781, S-4783.   Although the Senate added an Understanding that the\n\nICCPR would not be self-executing, id., I cannot countenance that\n\nthis Nation would have committed to the ICCPR by signature and\n\nratification if compliance with the obligations enumerated therein\n\nwas not contemplated.    The duplicity and cynicism that would be\n\nimplicit if such were the case would be a stain on our national\n\nhonor and integrity of monstrous proportions.   Because I refuse to\n\nbelieve that the United States would so act, I cannot but conclude\n\nthat there is no legal excuse for continued non-compliance with\n\nthese agreements.\n\n          Although there exists no individual cause of action to\n\nenforce the ICCPR in the instant case,17 I am nonetheless compelled\n\n\n17\n   Most courts to address the ICCPR have found that its non-self-\nexecuting nature precludes the existence of a private right of\naction to enforce its provisions. See, e.g., Igartúa I, 32 F.3d at\n10 n.1; see also United States v. Duarte-Acero, 132 F. Supp. 2d\n1036, 1040 n.8 (summarizing caselaw). Nevertheless, federal courts\nhave found that provisions of the ICCPR can be enforced via the\nimplementing legislation of the Alien Tort Claims Act. See Estate\nof Cabello v. Fernández-Larios, 157 F. Supp. 2d 1345, (S.D. Fla.\n2001) (finding that plaintiff may bring claim under ATCA for\nviolation of ICCPR Article 6 right to life); Ralk v. Lincoln\nCounty, Ga., 81 F. Supp. 2d 1372, 1380 (S.D. Ga. 2000) (finding\nplaintiff could bring claim under ATCA for violation of ICCPR)\n(relying on Abebe-Jira v. Negewo, 72 F.3d 844 (11th Cir. 1996)).\n\n                                -14-\n\fto   recognize   that   the   United   States      is   in   violation     of   its\n\nobligation under Article 25 to afford universal suffrage to its\n\ncitizens.   See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the\n\nUnited States § 321 (1987) (\"Every international agreement in force\n\nis binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in\n\ngood faith.\").\n\n            The United States has taken some actions to meet some of\n\nits obligations both under domestic and international law to\n\nvalidate the right of all citizens to vote in national elections.\n\nThe Constitution       was   thus   amended   in   1961      to   allow   citizens\n\nresident of the District of Columbia, (an unincorporated territory\n\nof the United States, as is Puerto Rico), to vote for the offices\n\nof   President   and    Vice-President.       U.S.      Const.    amend.    XXIII.\n\nHowever, said citizens continue to be represented in Congress on an\n\nunequal footing with the U.S. citizens residing in the States, as\n\nare, of course, the United States citizens of Puerto Rico.\n\n            Furthermore, in 1986, Congress passed the Uniformed and\n\nOverseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973ff-1973ff-\n\n6, which allows United States citizens residing outside the United\n\nStates to vote in federal elections as absentee voters in their\n\n\n\nMoreover, at least one court has determined that the individual\nrights guaranteed by the ICCPR may be raised defensively.

Supp. 2d at 1040 n.8, aff'd, 296 F.3d 1277 (11th Cir.\n2002) (recognizing defense, but determining that procedural\nrequirements of ICCPR do not apply to United States action carried\nout on foreign territory).\n\n                                     -15-\n\flast state of residence.   But because the statute's definition of\n\n\"United States\" includes Puerto Rico, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973ff-6(8), the\n\nresidents of Puerto Rico who would otherwise qualify to vote\n\npursuant to this statute are disqualified.\n\n            Since we decided Igartúa II in 2000, the United States\n\nhas taken no action towards the national enfranchisement of its\n\ncitizens in Puerto Rico or towards ending the present colonial\n\nrelationship. This total inaction is particularly poignant at this\n\nmoment in our history, when we seek to convince the inhabitants of\n\nfar-flung places of the world of the democratic process and the\n\nvalidity of its expression through the ballot box.18   It is nothing\n\nshort of ironic that close to 3,500 U.S. citizens from Puerto Rico\n\nsupport these goals by their presence in Iraq and Afghanistan as\n\nmembers of our Armed Forces, while they are themselves denied these\n\nrights particularly with regards to the election of their Commander\n\nin Chief.     Their presence in these distant lands has not been\n\nwithout some cost.19\n\n\n18\n   See David Roche & Carlotta Gall, Afghans Studying the Art of\nVoting, N.Y.
