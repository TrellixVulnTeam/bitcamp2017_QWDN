Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                     Souter, Associate Justice,*\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Vicki J.

Torrence and Littler\nMendelson, P.C. were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                             August 17, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f            SOUTER, Associate Justice.         This is an appeal from a\n\ndistrict court judgment sustaining denial of disability benefits\n\nunder an employee health plan subject to the Employee Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1001-1461.               The\n\nissue was joined on cross motions for summary judgment on which the\n\ntrial court sat in an essentially appellate capacity, see Cusson v.\n\nLiberty Life Assurance Co., 592 F.3d 215, 224 (1st Cir. 2010),\n\nsubject to this court’s de novo review, see Orndoff v. Paul Revere\n\nLife Ins. Co., 404 F.3d 510, 516-17 (1st Cir. 2005).1\n\n            The appellant, Kathleen Kindelan, has had serious back\n\ntrouble for over thirty years, with a number of surgeries, the most\n\nrecent being a lumbar fusion in 2005.          Dr. Mark Palumbo saw her on\n\nSeptember    25,   2007,   and   noted    that    she    was   getting   along\n\n“reasonably well” and “doing well from a functional standpoint.”\n\nOn October 3, however, she returned to report back and lower\n\nextremity pain.      The doctor noted anxiety and agitation, and\n\nrecommended four to six weeks at home, with back exercises and pain\n\nkillers.\n\n            Kindelan followed the advice and applied for benefits to\n\nthe defendant UnitedHealth Group Short Term Disability Plan, which\n\ndelegated    benefits administration      to     the    defendant   Disability\n\n\n\n     1\n      A plenary recitation of the facts and procedural history of\nthis case can be found in the district court’s opinion. See\nKindelan v. Disability Mgmt. Alts., LLC, 706 F. Supp. 2d 210\n(D.R.I. 2010).\n\n                                    -2-\n\fManagement Alternatives (DMA). After a false start, DMA denied the\n\nclaim on October 24, 2007, a decision which was affirmed after\n\nfurther consideration on November 5, 2007, and was affirmed again\n\non February 21, 2008, after an appeal that included review by an\n\noutside physician on contract with the Plan, Dr. Amy Hopkins.\n\n            The October letter simply listed a series of disabilities\n\nnot covered, including those whose courses “cannot be verified and\n\nmeasured using generally accepted standard medical procedures and\n\npractices    .   .   .   .   [C]onditions     commonly   referred   to   as\n\nself-reported conditions [including without limitation] fatigue,\n\nloss of energy, [and] pain . . . .”         The November letter explained\n\nthat material from Dr. Palumbo in support of Kindelan’s application\n\n“provides no evidence of any physical and functional limitations”\n\nthat would preclude working and advised that any appeal should be\n\nsupported by medical records for the period after October 1,\n\nincluding “the results of diagnostic studies such as x-rays and\n\nlaboratory tests . . . .”      Finally, the February 2008 letter after\n\nthe administrative appeal noted “no evidence of any physical or\n\nfunctional limitation” on work and summarized the gist of the\n\nreasons for denial in these words:\n\n                 It is not clear why an individual would\n            go from being fully functional at work and at\n            home to unable to work at all in such a short\n            time period with no documented change in\n            examination or diagnostic test results and\n            with no aggressive treatment ordered.     Dr.\n            Palumbo ordered x-rays of the lumbar spine,\n            which were unremarkable, but no further\n\n                                   -3-\n\f          testing, such as MRI, to explain this sudden\n          change in your condition.    While you have a\n          long and complicated musculoskeletal history,\n          it appears that there may be more than\n          physical reasons why you went out of work.\n          The medical record does not convincingly\n          document your inability to work full time from\n          October, 1, 2007 onwards.\n\n          At the outset, several issues may be placed to one side\n\nas inconsequential to the outcome. First, although Kindelan claims\n\nshe had no adequate chance to rebut Dr. Hopkins’s reasons for\n\naffirming denial, she was given the opportunity ERISA and its\n\nregulations guarantee, of submitting evidence and information. See\n\n29 C.F.R. § 2560.503-1(h). In effect, Kindelan is claiming a right\n\nto a further administrative appeal.   Second, there is no reason to\n\nthink that the appeal decision suffered from according inadequate\n\nweight to the decision of the Social Security Administration to\n\nprovide disability benefits. Although the federal scheme restricts\n\nsuch benefits to claimants who can perform no work (not just their\n\nprior job, as under the Plan’s terms), there is no indication that\n\nSocial Security restricts qualifying disabilities to those that can\n\nbe proven on the evidence required by the Plan.    The evidentiary\n\nsignificance of any federal determination is accordingly limited.\n\nSee Pari-Fasano v. ITT Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d\n\n415, 420 (1st Cir. 2000).      Third, as will be seen from the\n\ndiscussion of the basis for denial that follows, it does not matter\n\nhere whether the Plan’s decision is subject to review simply for\n\narbitrary or capricious action, or abuse of discretion, as in the\n\n                               -4-\n\fordinary case,    or    should   be    subjected to      that    standard with\n\nparticular consideration of any conflict of interest on the part of\n\nthe administrative decision makers (as alleged here on the part of\n\nDMA owing to the amount of business it gets from the Plan, and on\n\nthe part of Dr. Hopkins due to the volume of her work for DMA).\n\nEnhanced scrutiny would not affect the result.                   For the same\n\nreason, it does not matter that the district court struck from the\n\nrecord opinions from other courts critical of Dr. Hopkins, which\n\nKindelan   offered     as   evidence    of   bias   in   favor   of   insurance\n\nproviders.\n\n           With these matters out of the way, the heart of the case\n\ncan be simply stated.        Although Kindelan’s chronic back trouble\n\ngenerated a history of test results confirming the symptoms she\n\nreported over the years, her burden in order to obtain the desired\n\ndisability coverage is to document what she claims to have been a\n\ndebilitating change in the course of the week after her regular\n\nperiodic examination.       Because she says that the allegedly covered\n\ndisability occurred after her September visit to the doctor, what\n\ncounts under the Plan is her condition in that ensuing period.               On\n\nSeptember 26, Dr. Palumbo noted that she had no serious functional\n\ndifficulties.    On October 3 she reported such pain that the doctor\n\nrecommended time off from work. But she and her treating physician\n\nprovided no test results or medical diagnostic evidence to explain\n\nthe sudden deterioration.        After the October 3 visit, Dr. Palumbo\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdid not order any additional tests, medical or psychological.\n\nWhile the doctor speculated that the explanation might well lie in\n\nthe mind, not the spine, that is as far as he followed his line of\n\nthinking, and at the end of the day Kindelan offered nothing to\n\nexplain the change she claimed, beyond the “self-reported” pain\n\nthat the plan expressly excludes as an independently covered\n\ndisability.   On this record, it is difficult to see how any Plan\n\nadministrator or appellate reviewer could have concluded that she\n\nhad shown a covered disability falling within the Plan definitions\n\nand supported by the evidence they require for proof of a claim.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
