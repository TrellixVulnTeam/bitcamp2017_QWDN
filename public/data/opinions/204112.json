DÍAZ-FONTÁNEZ,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                      Boudin, Stahl and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Charles F. Willson and Nevins & Nevins LLP on brief for\nappellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Julia M.\nMeconiates, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-\nVelez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          December 18, 2009\n\f            Per Curiam.    This is the defendant's appeal from his\n\nresentencing on remand from this court.      Because the district\n\ncourt followed this court's remand instructions and did not\n\notherwise err or abuse its discretion in resentencing the\n\ndefendant, we affirm.\n\n            On the defendant's previous appeal, we held that,\n\nunder the guidelines, the defendant might be entitled to credit\n\nfor time spent in state custody.          United States v. Díaz-\n\nFontánez, No. 06-2061, 317 F. App'x 9, 10 (1st Cir. Aug. 8,\n\n2008) (per curiam).       In so holding, we relied on application\n\nnote 2 to USSG § 5G13, which directs the sentencing court to\n\n\"adjust for any term of imprisonment already served as a result\n\nof the conduct taken into account in determining the sentence\n\nfor   the   instant   offense.\"     Id.   However,   because   that\n\nadjustment applies only to time not credited by the Bureau of\n\nPrisons, id. at 10 (citing USSG § 5G1.3(b) as amended by\n\namendment 535 (effective Nov. 1, 1995)), a remand was required\n\nto determine how much time the defendant had already served for\n\nhis related state firearms offense and how much of that time\n\nwould be credited to the defendant by the Bureau of Prisons\n\n(\"BOP\").    Id.\n\n            On remand, it was determined that the defendant had\n\nalready served his entire state sentence by the time his\n\nfederal sentence had been imposed and that the BOP would not\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fcredit any of that time, 69 months and 19 days, against his\n\nfederal sentence.          Although the state sentence had thus been\n\nfully    discharged,       and   section      5G1.3   applies    primarily   to\n\nundischarged       state    sentences,        the   guidelines    nevertheless\n\npermit the downward departure granted by the district court to\n\naccount for that time, see USSG § 5G1.3, comment. (n.4), as the\n\ndistrict court itself recognized.\n\n            However, there is no basis in section 5G1.3 for\n\ncrediting the time spent in custody after the defendant's state\n\nfirearms sentence was fully discharged but before he was\n\nsentenced    for    the    instant      federal     offense.      The   parties\n\ndisagree on whether the defendant was in state or federal\n\ncustody during that time. However, either way, that time would\n\nnot be creditable under section 5G1.3(b) because, once the\n\ndefendant completed serving his state firearms sentence, he was\n\nnot in custody for an offense \"that was the basis for an\n\nincrease in the offense level for the instant offense,\" an\n\nessential    prerequisite         for    an     adjustment      under   section\n\n5G1.3(b).    Regardless whether or not the district court had\n\ndiscretion to vary downward to account for that time, it was\n\nnot required to do so in calculating the defendant's guideline\n\nrange.    And we see no abuse of discretion in rejecting the\n\ndefendant's plea for a further credit on that basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f            The only other purported error pressed on appeal is\n\nthe district court's failure to vary downward based on the\n\nguidelines' relatively harsh treatment of crack--as compared to\n\npowder--cocaine offenses. The short answer to that argument is\n\nthat while the district court may vary downward on that basis,\n\n\"'nothing . . . requires the district court to take [the\n\ncrack/powder sentencing] disparity into account in every crack\n\ncase.'\"     United States v. Gibbons, 553 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir.\n\n2009) (quoting Díaz-Fontánez, 317 F. App'x at 11).             Here, the\n\ndistrict    court   considered    that   and   the   other    purportedly\n\nmitigating factors identified by the defendant but nevertheless\n\nconcluded that the within-guidelines sentence imposed was no\n\ngreater than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing set\n\nforth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).       Given the violent nature of the\n\ndefendant's criminal record, which was not fully accounted for\n\nin his criminal history score, and the fact that the court did\n\nreduce the defendant's sentence by more than ten years from the\n\nsentence previously imposed, we see no abuse of discretion in\n\ndeclining to reduce it even further.           \"We will not disturb a\n\nwell-reasoned decision to give greater weight to particular\n\nsentencing factors over others.\"         Gibbons, 553 F.3d at 47.\n\n            Consequently,   the    district     court's      judgment   is\n\naffirmed.    See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
