Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert M. Joost on brief pro se.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant U.S.\nAttorneys, and Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              April 9, 2007\n\f           Per Curiam.     Petitioner Robert Joost appeals pro se\n\nfrom a district court decision dismissing his 28 U.S.C. § 2255\n\npetition as untimely.      See 336 F. Supp. 2d 185 (D.R.I. 2004).\n\nHe there sought to advance a single claim under Brady v.\n\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), based on documents he obtained\n\nthrough a post-judgment Freedom of Information Act request, see\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552 (FOIA).\n\n           Joost received a certificate of appealability (COA)\n\nto address the timeliness issue; but that issue turns out to\n\nraise difficult questions which we are reluctant to resolve in\n\nthis pro se setting, and which might well require a remand for\n\nfurther inquiries. Further, the substantive Brady claim, which\n\nthe parties have adequately briefed, proves to lack merit, so\n\nwe expand the scope of the COA sua sponte and affirm on that\n\nbasis alone.     Villot v. Varner, 373 F.3d 327, 337 n.13 (3d Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n           In separate trials, Joost was convicted of conspiring\n\nto obstruct commerce by robbery of an armored car, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1951 (the Hobbs Act), and of being a felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm,   id.    §   922(g).   This   court   affirmed   the   former\n\nconviction, see 1996 WL 480215 (1st Cir. 1996) (unpublished),\n\nbut vacated the latter because of the lack of an entrapment\n\ninstruction, see 92 F.3d 7 (1st Cir. 1996).         Joost was again\n\ntried and again convicted of the firearms charge, and we\n\n                                 -2-\n\faffirmed.    See 133 F.3d 125 (1st Cir. 1998).          The Supreme Court\n\ndenied certiorari on April 20, 1998.\n\n             To establish a Brady violation, Joost would need to\n\ndemonstrate    that     the   government    suppressed     exculpatory   or\n\nimpeaching evidence valuable to him and that prejudice ensued.\n\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999); Conley v.\n\nUnited   States,    415    F.3d   183,    188   (1st   Cir.   2005).     The\n\nlikelihood of a different result is the key issue in assessing\n\nprejudice.     United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985).\n\n             Joost relied on an entrapment defense at trial--a\n\ndefense that he now claims would have been significantly\n\nbolstered    by   the   FOIA    material.       The    entrapment   defense\n\nrequires proof of improper government inducement--usually undue\n\npressure--to commit the crime, and lack of predisposition by\n\nthe defendant to engage in criminal conduct.             United States v.\n\nGendron, 18 F.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n             The original investigation of Joost spanned four\n\nmonths, from March 23 to July 24, 1994, and initially focused\n\non counterfeiting.        Joost’s partner (Tracy) was caught passing\n\nfake tokens at a nearby casino, agreed to cooperate with state\n\nauthorities and introduced Joost to detectives DelPrete and\n\nO’Donnell, who pretended to be petty thieves; one claimed to\n\nhave a cousin employed in the casino’s cashier cage.\n\n             Joost was struggling financially at the time and\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\freadily accepted the detectives’ offer to pay him fifty cents\n\nfor each counterfeit dollar token.           During April, the focus of\n\nthe investigation broadened as Joost began speaking of other\n\ncriminal ventures, both past and future.                Joost mentioned\n\ndozens of possibilities including robbery of an armored car in\n\nRhode   Island    and   of   a   tractor     trailer   or   warehouse    in\n\nPennsylvania.\n\n            Joost later testified that he was just trying to\n\nsustain    the   detectives'     interest.      And    he   did   tell   the\n\ndetectives (which one of them confirmed at trial) that he did\n\nnot perform armed robberies, noting that because of his past\n\nconvictions he would face severe penalties if caught with a\n\nfirearm.    Nonetheless, it was Joost who first mentioned the\n\npossible use of a gun, stating on April 24 that the armored-car\n\nrobbery would require a gun.\n\n            The detectives several times asked for a gun and\n\nJoost stated he might be able to comply, but nothing was\n\nforthcoming. The trio drove to Pennsylvania on May 28 with the\n\nidea of robbing a tractor trailer or related warehouse, but--by\n\narrangement with the authorities--the scheme was aborted by a\n\npolice stop.     O’Donnell later testified simply that: “We had a\n\nmeeting between the State Police and the FBI, and it was\n\ndetermined that we couldn’t allow it to happen.”\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f          On July 21 the detectives told Joost that they would\n\nneed no more counterfeit coins.      They knew at the time that he\n\nwas in financial difficulties and facing imminent foreclosure\n\non his home.   The detectives proposed a plan to rob a Cape Cod\n\nnightclub and asked Joost once again to procure a firearm.\n\nAfter a lengthy discussion in which the need for a gun was\n\nmentioned some six times, Joost agreed to obtain one.     On July\n\n24, the day of the supposed robbery, he handed the detectives\n\na 25-caliber Barretta, prompting his arrest.\n\n          This, with additional detail, was the gist of what\n\nthe jury learned at Joost's retrial. An entrapment instruction\n\nwas given but a guilty verdict was again returned.       The main\n\nquestion now before us is whether there is any reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the result would have been different if, at the\n\ntime of the trial, Joost had had available three FBI documents\n\nhe later received in response to his FOIA request.\n\n          These documents comprise two teletypes and one airtel\n\nwritten in the second half of May 1994.     They discuss possible\n\nmeans by which the FBI, in coordination with local police,\n\ncould prevent the planned May 28 trailer theft in Pennsylvania\n\nfrom occurring.    A principal goal, the documents explain, was\n\nto do so without arresting Joost so that he could continue\n\nplotting the robbery of an armored car and thereby receive a\n\nhigher sentence.\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f           Based on conversations with the federal prosecutor,\n\nthe FBI noted in one report that Joost would likely receive\n\n“only a 6 month sentence” for the counterfeiting charge and\n\n“only a 10 to 16 month sentence” for the trailer theft, but\n\nwould get “at least a 15 year sentence” for an armored-car\n\nrobbery.       “[I]t   is   therefore   operationally   desirable   to\n\ndissuade him from this [trailer theft] crime in lieu of a Hobbs\n\nAct [offense].”        Other comments to the same effect are as\n\nfollows:\n\n           C      the undercover officers “have pressed Joost to\n                  show them the armed courier target”;\n\n           C      “[t]he second desirable result is that Joost\n                  and the unsub [unidentified subject] not be\n                  arrested, but indicted at a later date”;\n\n           C      “As stated [i]n 5/19/94 teletype ..., the\n                  purpose of the operation is to fully [material\n                  deleted]. This should result in a fifteen year\n                  sentence of Joost, a career criminal.”;\n\n           C      any search warrant must not “expose the UCOs\n                  [undercover officers] in order that Joost will\n                  conspire with the UCOs to commit a Hobbs Act\n                  armed courier robbery”;\n\n           C      “The UCOs will encourage this abandonment of\n                  the [Pennsylvania] theft.”\n\n           The only reference to firearms is the following:\n\n                Joost has clearly stated that no\n           weapons are to be used on this [trailer]\n           theft as he is fully aware of the\n           extensive jail time he would face for\n           possessing a weapon. UCOs are aware that\n           if Joost at any point in the ... operation\n           possesses a weapon he will be arrested\n           immediately. [The federal prosecutor] has\n\n                                  -6-\n\f           advised that the possession of a weapon by\n           Joost, in light of his arrest record, will\n           sentence him to a fifteen (15) year jail\n           term.\n\n           It is clear from this material, as it was from the\n\ncourt testimony, that the agents were seeking to direct Joost's\n\nenergies to a high-penalty armored-car robbery or firearms\n\ncrime rather than the other serious ventures which did not\n\ninvolve firearms. But there is nothing in the details provided\n\nby the FOIA material that alters the main thrust of what the\n\njury learned at the trial.\n\n           Postponing an arrest in the expectation that a more\n\nserious offense might be attempted is ordinarily             permissible.\n\nUnited States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 792 (1977); cf. United\n\nStates v. Winchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 554 (1st Cir. 1999).                It\n\nis   unclear   why   Joost   thinks   that   the   details    as   to   the\n\nauthorities' efforts to frustrate the Pennsylvania robbery--\n\nwhich was fictitious anyway--add anything to his case.             It was\n\nsimply a part of the sting.\n\n           The FOIA material does confirm that Joost \"clearly\n\nstated that no weapons are to be used [during the Pennsylvania]\n\ntheft\" because of his \"aware[ness] of the extensive jail time\n\nhe would face for possessing a weapon.\" But this simply echoes\n\ntestimony provided at trial by DelPrete--describing Joost's\n\nApril 24 pronouncement that he did not perform armed robberies\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fand that, because of prior convictions, he would face severe,\n\nmandatory penalties if caught with a firearm.\n\n           If it had only been Joost who testified to his\n\nreluctance to engage in a firearms crime, then independent\n\ncorroboration from FBI files might have been very valuable.\n\nBut here Joost's reluctance, and the reason for it, were\n\nexpressly acknowledged by one of the detectives testifying for\n\nthe government and were confirmed by the delays in getting the\n\nfirearm.   Cf. United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 618 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (\"the unavailability of cumulative evidence does not\n\ndeprive the defendant of due process\").\n\n           Joost had an entrapment defense minimally sufficient\n\nto get to a jury, but it was far from powerful.        He was the\n\nfirst to raise the subject of firearms, proposed several\n\ncriminal   ventures   requiring   their   use,   and   offered   to\n\npersonally transport any firearm used in a Fall River attack.\n\nIn the end he was readily able to obtain a handgun.              The\n\nadditional detail derived from the FBI reports would not have\n\naltered the result.\n\n           Separately, Joost argues that the FOIA material shows\n\nthat the detectives committed perjury at the firearms trial\n\n(and at his Hobbs Act trial).     We have examined the specific\n\nallegations and transcripts with care and conclude that the\n\ndiscrepancies do not show perjury but at best furnish minor\n\n\n                              -8-\n\fpoints for cross examination in the firearms trial that would\n\nnot have undermined the detectives' basic testimony.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -9-\n\f",

The trio drove to Pennsylvania on May 28 with the\n\nidea of robbing a tractor trailer or related warehouse, but--by\n\narrangement with the authorities--the scheme was aborted by a\n\npolice stop.     O’Donnell later testified simply that: “We had a\n\nmeeting between the State Police and the FBI, and it was\n\ndetermined that we couldn’t allow it to happen.”\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f          On July 21 the detectives told Joost that they would\n\nneed no more counterfeit coins.      They knew at the time that he\n\nwas in financial difficulties and facing imminent foreclosure\n\non his home.   The detectives proposed a plan to rob a Cape Cod\n\nnightclub and asked Joost once again to procure a firearm.\n\nAfter a lengthy discussion in which the need for a gun was\n\nmentioned some six times, Joost agreed to obtain one.     On July\n\n24, the day of the supposed robbery, he handed the detectives\n\na 25-caliber Barretta, prompting his arrest.\n\n          This, with additional detail, was the gist of what\n\nthe jury learned at Joost's retrial. An entrapment instruction\n\nwas given but a guilty verdict was again returned.       The main\n\nquestion now before us is whether there is any reasonable\n\nlikelihood that the result would have been different if, at the\n\ntime of the trial, Joost had had available three FBI documents\n\nhe later received in response to his FOIA request.\n\n          These documents comprise two teletypes and one airtel\n\nwritten in the second half of May 1994.     They discuss possible\n\nmeans by which the FBI, in coordination with local police,\n\ncould prevent the planned May 28 trailer theft in Pennsylvania\n\nfrom occurring.    A principal goal, the documents explain, was\n\nto do so without arresting Joost so that he could continue\n\nplotting the robbery of an armored car and thereby receive a\n\nhigher sentence.\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f           Based on conversations with the federal prosecutor,\n\nthe FBI noted in one report that Joost would likely receive\n\n“only a 6 month sentence” for the counterfeiting charge and\n\n“only a 10 to 16 month sentence” for the trailer theft, but\n\nwould get “at least a 15 year sentence” for an armored-car\n\nrobbery.       “[I]t   is   therefore   operationally   desirable   to\n\ndissuade him from this [trailer theft] crime in lieu of a Hobbs\n\nAct [offense].”        Other comments to the same effect are as\n\nfollows:\n\n           C      the undercover officers “have pressed Joost to\n                  show them the armed courier target”;\n\n           C      “[t]he second desirable result is that Joost\n                  and the unsub [unidentified subject] not be\n                  arrested, but indicted at a later date”;\n\n           C      “As stated [i]n 5/19/94 teletype ..., the\n                  purpose of the operation is to fully [material\n                  deleted]. This should result in a fifteen year\n                  sentence of Joost, a career criminal.”;\n\n           C      any search warrant must not “expose the UCOs\n                  [undercover officers] in order that Joost will\n                  conspire with the UCOs to commit a Hobbs Act\n                  armed courier robbery”;\n\n           C      “The UCOs will encourage this abandonment of\n                  the [Pennsylvania] theft.”\n\n           The only reference to firearms is the following:\n\n                Joost has clearly stated that no\n           weapons are to be used on this [trailer]\n           theft as he is fully aware of the\n           extensive jail time he would face for\n           possessing a weapon. UCOs are aware that\n           if Joost at any point in the ... operation\n           possesses a weapon he will be arrested\n           immediately. [The federal prosecutor] has\n\n                                  -6-\n\f           advised that the possession of a weapon by\n           Joost, in light of his arrest record, will\n           sentence him to a fifteen (15) year jail\n           term.\n\n           It is clear from this material, as it was from the\n\ncourt testimony, that the agents were seeking to direct Joost's\n\nenergies to a high-penalty armored-car robbery or firearms\n\ncrime rather than the other serious ventures which did not\n\ninvolve firearms. But there is nothing in the details provided\n\nby the FOIA material that alters the main thrust of what the\n\njury learned at the trial.\n\n           Postponing an arrest in the expectation that a more\n\nserious offense might be attempted is ordinarily             permissible.\n\nUnited States v.

It\n\nis   unclear   why   Joost   thinks   that   the   details    as   to   the\n\nauthorities' efforts to frustrate the Pennsylvania robbery--\n\nwhich was fictitious anyway--add anything to his case.             It was\n\nsimply a part of the sting.\n\n           The FOIA material does confirm that Joost \"clearly\n\nstated that no weapons are to be used [during the Pennsylvania]\n\ntheft\" because of his \"aware[ness] of the extensive jail time\n\nhe would face for possessing a weapon.\" But this simply echoes\n\ntestimony provided at trial by DelPrete--describing Joost's\n\nApril 24 pronouncement that he did not perform armed robberies\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fand that, because of prior convictions, he would face severe,\n\nmandatory penalties if caught with a firearm.\n\n           If it had only been Joost who testified to his\n\nreluctance to engage in a firearms crime, then independent\n\ncorroboration from FBI files might have been very valuable.\n\nBut here Joost's reluctance, and the reason for it, were\n\nexpressly acknowledged by one of the detectives testifying for\n\nthe government and were confirmed by the delays in getting the\n\nfirearm.   Cf. United States v. Sanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550638\"><a href=\"/opinion/550638/united-states-v-edwin-sanchez-united-states-of-america-v-gregorio/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (\"the unavailability of cumulative evidence does not\n\ndeprive the defendant of due process\").\n\n           Joost had an entrapment defense minimally sufficient\n\nto get to a jury, but it was far from powerful.        He was the\n\nfirst to raise the subject of firearms, proposed several\n\ncriminal   ventures   requiring   their   use,   and   offered   to\n\npersonally transport any firearm used in a Fall River attack.\n\nIn the end he was readily able to obtain a handgun.              The\n\nadditional detail derived from the FBI reports would not have\n\naltered the result.\n\n           Separately, Joost argues that the FOIA material shows\n\nthat the detectives committed perjury at the firearms trial\n\n(and at his Hobbs Act trial).     We have examined the specific\n\nallegations and transcripts with care and conclude that the\n\ndiscrepancies do not show perjury but at best furnish minor\n\n\n                              -8-\n\fpoints for cross examination in the firearms trial that would\n\nnot have undermined the detectives' basic testimony.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -9-\n\f</pre>",
