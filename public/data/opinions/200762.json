Hyundai Motor Company (\"Hyundai\")\n\nappeals from a judgment entered in favor of the Estate of Eduardo\n\nCabrera (the \"estate\") after a jury found Hyundai liable for\n\nnegligently testing or designing an airbag which killed Eduardo in\n\na car accident.1     We affirm.\n\n                              I. Background\n\n           The tragic circumstances that gave rise to this case\n\noccurred on the night of September 13, 1996 in Nashua, New\n\nHampshire.     Eduardo Cabrera, five-years-old, was a passenger in\n\nthe front seat of his parents', Jose and Miriam Cabrera's, 1995\n\nHyundai Sonata.2     Mr. Cabrera was driving the Sonata home from a\n\nfamily outing to the movies.        At an intersection, the Sonata was\n\nstruck by another car on the right side.          The collision pushed the\n\nSonata into a light pole.          Upon striking the light pole, the\n\nSonata's driver and passenger airbags deployed.           At the moment of\n\nimpact, Eduardo was located between three and ten inches from the\n\nairbag.    The airbag hit Eduardo under the chin with such force\n\nthat it severed his spinal cord from his brain and killed him.\n\n           As a result of the accident, the estate invoked the\n\nfederal    court's   diversity     jurisdiction    and   sued   Hyundai   for\n\nwrongful     death   under   New    Hampshire's     \"crashworthiness\"      or\n\n\n     1\n       The estate is represented by its administrator, Arthur M.\nConnelly.\n     2\n      The Cabreras purchased the Sonata from Hyundai in the summer\nof 1995.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f\"enhanced injury\" doctrine.3            The estate presented its case under\n\ntwo theories.        First, the estate alleged that Hyundai was strictly\n\nliable      for   Eduardo's    death.      Under      this    theory,     the   estate\n\ncomplained that the airbag system which killed Eduardo had an\n\noverly aggressive design and that this defective design caused\n\nEduardo's death.         Second, the estate alleged that Hyundai had\n\nnegligently designed and/or tested its airbag system and that\n\nthese lapses proximately caused Eduardo's death. Hyundai defended\n\nby introducing evidence tending to show, inter alia, that the\n\nairbag system was not defectively designed and that Eduardo's\n\ndeath was caused by his failure to wear his seatbelt at the time\n\nof the accident.\n\n              After an eleven-day trial, the jury returned general\n\nverdicts exonerating Hyundai on the strict liability count but\n\nfinding it liable on the negligence count.                   The jury did not make\n\nany       specific   factual   findings        as    part    of   these     verdicts.\n\nImmediately after the jury returned its verdicts, Hyundai moved to\n\nset   them     aside   as   inconsistent       and    asked    that   the    jury   be\n\nrecharged because it could not rationally have reached differing\n\nconclusions on the strict liability and negligence counts.                          See\n\n\n\n      3\n       The crashworthiness or enhanced injury doctrine extends the\nmanufacturer's liability to cases in which the plaintiff suffers\nseparate or enhanced injuries in the course of an initial accident\ncaused by his own vehicle. See Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,\n761 A.2d 477, 479 (N.H. 2000).\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. 49(b).      The district court denied Hyundai's\n\nrequest, accepted the verdicts, and discharged the jury.       Hyundai\n\nsubsequently moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new\n\ntrial.   The court denied the motion, and Hyundai timely appealed.\n\n                          II. Discussion\n\n          Hyundai raises three claims on appeal.     First, it argues\n\nthat the district court erroneously permitted the negligence count\n\nto go to the jury and that as a result of this error the jury\n\nreturned inconsistent   verdicts.     Second,   it   claims   that   the\n\ndistrict court incorrectly instructed the jury on the limited\n\nrelevance of evidence showing that Eduardo was not wearing his\n\nseatbelt at the time of the accident.   Third, it contends that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by excluding evidence that,\n\non two occasions prior to the accident, Mr. Cabrera had been cited\n\nfor violating New Hampshire's mandatory seatbelt for minors law,\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 265:107-a (the \"seatbelt law\").\n\n          A. The Negligence Count and the Inconsistent Verdicts\n\n          Hyundai makes two closely-related arguments concerning\n\nthe negligence count.   First, it argues that the district court\n\nerred by instructing the jury on the negligence count.         Hyundai\n\nbelieves that the district court should have declined to instruct\n\nthe jury on this count because \"the existence of a defect is a\n\ndeterminative factor in both negligent design and strict liability\n\ndesign defect claims,\" which makes it unnecessary and confusing\n\n\n                                -5-\n\ffor the jury to consider both claims.                    Second, Hyundai asserts\n\nthat the jury's verdicts were inconsistent because both counts\n\nrequired the jury to find, as an essential element, that the\n\nairbag system contained a design defect.\n\n           Hyundai's claims are not new to this court.                    We recently\n\ndecided    two    cases       in    which    automobile      manufacturers       raised\n\nessentially these same arguments.                 See Trull v. Volkswagen of Am.,\n\nInc., 320 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, -- U.S.--, 2003 WL\n\n2129086 (Oct. 6, 2003); Babcock v. Gen. Motors Corp., 299 F.3d 60\n\n(1st    Cir.    2002).        In    those    cases,     we   did   not   address    the\n\nmanufacturers' arguments de novo because the manufacturers had\n\nfailed to preserve them.              We reviewed the claims only for plain\n\nerror     and    permitted          the     verdicts    to      stand    because    the\n\nmanufacturers       had       not     met     the      \"stringent\"       plain     error\n\nrequirements.      See Trull, 320 F.3d at 6; Babcock, 299 F.3d at 62-\n\n66.\n\n                Unlike the defendants in Trull and Babcock, Hyundai\n\nfollowed the strictures of Fed. R. Civ. P. 51 and preserved its\n\ncontention      that    the    district      court     should    have    withheld    the\n\nnegligence count from the jury.                Accordingly, we will review the\n\ndistrict court's decision to instruct the jury on the negligence\n\ncount de novo.         See Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 303 F.3d 387, 394\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           In interpreting New Hampshire law, \"our task is to\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fascertain the rule the state court would most likely follow under\n\nthe   circumstances,       even    if    our    independent        judgment    on   the\n\nquestion might differ.\"           Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d 14, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (quoting Blinzler v. Marriot Int'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148,\n\n1151 (1st Cir. 1996)).             In performing this function, we hew\n\nclosely to the path established by the state's highest court.                       See\n\nDoyle v. Hasbro, Inc., 103 F.3d 186, 192 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"we are\n\nreluctant to extend state law beyond its well-marked boundaries\")\n\n(internal quotations omitted).                 We therefore turn to the New\n\nHampshire Supreme Court's case law to determine whether, as a\n\nmatter   of   law,   the    district          court   erred   by    submitting      the\n\nnegligence count to the jury.\n\n            The New Hampshire Supreme Court has consistently declined\n\nto adopt the rule urged by Hyundai--that a trial court may not\n\ninstruct a jury on both strict liability and negligence counts in\n\na product liability action.         Indeed, on several occasions, the New\n\nHampshire     Supreme      Court        has     approved      of    a   jury    being\n\nsimultaneously charged on both counts.                  See Trull, 761 A.2d at\n\n481; Cyr v. J.I. Case Co., 652 A.2d 685, 693 (N.H. 1995); Thibault\n\nv. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 395 A.2d 843, 849 (N.H. 1978).                         As we\n\nobserved in Babcock, \"the most that can be said is that submission\n\nof both claims is frowned upon.\"              299 F.3d at 65 (citing Thibault,\n\n395 A.2d at 849 (\"While . . . both counts are permitted, we do not\n\nrecommend to plaintiffs that counts in both negligence and strict\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fliability . . . be submitted to the jury because of the confusion\n\nwhich is created.\")) (emphasis supplied).          As this underscored\n\nlanguage from Thibault suggests, the decision whether to risk\n\nconfusion by submitting both counts to the jury rests with the\n\nplaintiff, not the trial court.\n\n          To support its claim that New Hampshire law required the\n\ndistrict court to withdraw the negligence count from the jury,\n\nHyundai relies   heavily    on   the   New   Hampshire   Supreme   Court's\n\ndecision in Greenland v. Ford Motor Co., 347 A.2d 159 (N.H. 1975).4\n\nGreenland does not support Hyundai's position.\n\n          In Greenland, the plaintiffs were injured when their car\n\nspun out of control.       Id. at 161.        They asserted that their\n\ninjuries were caused by a defective ball and socket assembly in\n\none of the front wheels.    Id. at 162.      At trial, they proceeded on\n\na strict liability theory of design defect and a negligence theory\n\nthat the defendant's failure to test the vehicle permitted the\n\ndesign defect to persist.    Id. at 163.      The trial court permitted\n\nthe jury to consider the strict liability claim but dismissed the\n\nnegligence claim.     Id. at 162-63.          The plaintiffs appealed,\n\n\n     4\n       Hyundai also relies on our decision in Mello v. K-Mart\nCorp., 792 F.2d 1228, 1233 (1st Cir. 1986), where we held that\nunder Tennessee law, the jury's finding that a product was not\ndefective precluded a finding that the seller was liable in\nnegligence for its design. Putting aside the factual differences\nbetween Mello and this case (including that the jury in Mello\nissued a factual finding that the product at issue was not\ndangerous), Mello provides little help because it applies Tennessee\nlaw. Our focus here is on the requirements of New Hampshire law.\n\n                                  -8-\n\farguing that the jury should have been instructed on both claims.\n\nGreenland, 347 A.2d at 162-63.\n\n            The New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed the decision to\n\nwithhold the negligence claim from the jury.                 Id.    It concluded\n\nthat when a negligence claim is premised on the same design defect\n\nas a strict liability claim, the trial court has \"discretion\" to\n\nexclude the negligence claim because asking the jury to consider\n\nboth claims could be \"confusing.\"             Id. at 163.     In the course of\n\nits discussion, however, the court observed that \"it is clear that\n\na products liability action grounded on strict liability may be\n\njoined    with   an   action   grounded       on    negligence.\"     Id.   at   163\n\n(internal citations omitted) (emphasis supplied). Thus, Greenland\n\nstands only for the proposition that in cases where the negligence\n\nclaim is premised on a design defect, a trial court may, in its\n\ndiscretion, withhold the negligence claim from the jury.                   It does\n\nnot, as Hyundai suggests, establish a rule that a court must keep\n\nthe negligence claim from the jury in these circumstances.\n\n            In sum, the New Hampshire Supreme Court permits a \"strict\n\nliability action based upon a theory of defective design [to] be\n\njoined with an action grounded in negligence.\"               Trull, 761 A.2d at\n\n481.     Thus, the district court did not violate New Hampshire law\n\nby   instructing      the   jury   on   both       the   strict    liability    and\n\nnegligence counts.\n\n            Having determined that the district court did not err in\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\finstructing the jury on both counts, we turn to whether Hyundai is\n\nnonetheless entitled to relief because the jury's verdicts finding\n\nnegligence, but not strict liability, are inconsistent.      \"We note,\n\ninitially, our substantial reluctance to consider inconsistency in\n\ncivil jury verdicts a basis for new trials.\"         Kavanaugh v.\n\nGreenlee Tool Co., 944 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting McIsaac\n\nv. Didriksen Fishing Corp., 809 F.2d 129, 133 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\nBefore disregarding a verdict, we \"must attempt to reconcile the\n\njury's findings, by exegesis if necessary.\"        Acevedo-Diaz v.\n\nAponte, 1 F.3d 62, 74 n.15 (1st Cir. 1993).        To perform this\n\nanalysis, we determine whether the jury, consistent with its\n\ninstructions, could have found negligence but not strict liability\n\nunder the facts taken in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n\nSee Merchant v. Ruhle, 740 F.2d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 1984).\n\n         The court instructed the jury that the estate had to\n\nprove four elements to hold Hyundai strictly liable:\n\n                One, that the design of the 1995\n                Hyundai Sonata . . . created a\n                defective condition unreasonably\n                dangerous to the user;\n\n                Two, the condition existed when the product was\n                sold by a seller in the business of selling such\n                products;\n\n                Three, the use of the product          was\n                reasonably foreseeable by the\n                manufacturer;\n\n                And,   four,   the    condition    caused\n                Eduardo's death.\n\n\n                              -10-\n\fTo find negligence, the court instructed the jury that the estate\n\nhad to prove only two elements:\n\n                 One, that [Hyundai] failed to exercise\n                 reasonable care in designing and testing\n                 the airbag in the 1995 Hyundai Sonata,\n                 and\n\n                 Two,   that   [Hyundai's]   failure   to\n                 exercise reasonable care in designing\n                 and testing the airbag in the 1995\n                 Hyundai Sonata caused or contributed to\n                 the cause of Eduardo's death which would\n                 not otherwise have occurred in the\n                 accident.\n\n          There are at least two important differences between the\n\ndistrict court's negligence and strict liability instructions.5\n\nFirst, for negligence, the estate was not even required to prove\n\nthat the airbag system contained a design defect.   It was required\n\nto prove only that Hyundai was negligent in testing or designing\n\nthe airbag system and that this negligence caused or contributed\n\nto Eduardo's death.    Second, the instructions for each theory\n\npresented different standards for assessing the adequacy of the\n\nairbag system's design.   To find Hyundai strictly liable, the jury\n\nwas instructed that it had to perform a risk-utility analysis in\n\nwhich it determined that \"the magnitude of the danger [of the\n\n\n\n     5\n      Hyundai did not object to the district court's instructions\non the elements of negligence or strict liability. Indeed, before\nthis Court, Hyundai conceded that the instructions \"captured the\nNew Hampshire law on each claim.\" Thus, in attempting to reconcile\nthe verdicts, we rely on the law as described by the district\ncourt, without passing on whether these instructions correctly\nstated the applicable law.\n\n                               -11-\n\fairbag system] outweighed the usefulness and desirability of the\n\nproduct\" to \"the public as a whole.\"            To find Hyundai liable for\n\nnegligent design, the jury was told that it had to conclude that\n\nHyundai   failed    to   \"design    the     vehicle   .   .   .   to    avoid   an\n\nunreasonable risk of injury to the occupant.\"\n\n          Even     assuming,   as    Hyundai     argues,      that     the   jury\n\nnecessarily based its liability verdict on a determination that\n\nHyundai   negligently     designed     the    airbag      system,      the   jury,\n\nconsistent with its instructions and the evidence, could have\n\nfound negligence without finding Hyundai strictly liable.6                      The\n\njury could have rejected the strict liability count because it\n\ndecided that, on balance, the benefit to the public of including\n\nthe overly aggressive airbag system in the Sonata outweighed the\n\ndanger caused by the airbag system (because the system saved many\n\nmore lives than it took).\n\n          At the same time, however, the jury could have concluded\n\nthat Hyundai was negligent in failing to develop a less aggressive\n\nairbag system for the Sonata.         The jury heard testimony from an\n\n\n\n     6\n       We note that we are not abundantly confident in this\nassumption. The jury, instead of finding negligent design, could\nhave found negligent testing. This would have permitted the jury\nto find Hyundai liable for negligence without finding that the\nairbag system was negligently designed. See Trull, 320 F.3d at 7\n(a verdict finding negligence was consistent with a verdict\nrejecting strict liability, where the jury was instructed that the\nmanufacturer could be liable for \"negligent design and/or testing,\"\nbecause the jury could have found the manufacturer liable solely\nfor negligent testing).\n\n                                     -12-\n\fexpert witness who testified that the Sonata's airbag system\n\ncontained an unnecessarily aggressive inflator.              The same expert\n\nalso testified that other cars on the market in 1995 contained\n\nless aggressive airbag system designs.         In light of this evidence,\n\nthe jury could have decided that a less aggressive design was\n\nreadily available and in use by other automobile manufacturers.\n\n            Under the circumstances, the \"jury's efforts to apply the\n\ninstructions     were   understandable   and    had   some   basis\"   in   the\n\nevidence.    Merchant, 740 F.2d at 91.         There is nothing before us\n\nto suggest that the jury was confused by its task or that it\n\nshirked its responsibility.      Indeed, it appears from the verdicts\n\nthat the jury understood that \"the focus of strict liability is on\n\nwhether the design itself was unreasonably dangerous whereas in a\n\nnegligence case the focus is on the conduct of the manufacturer.\"\n\nTrull, 320 F.3d at 7.        Thus, we have no reason to reverse the\n\njudgment because the jury returned opposite verdicts on the strict\n\nliability and negligence counts.\n\n            B.      Instruction on Seatbelt Evidence\n\n            Hyundai's second challenge concerns the district court's\n\ninstruction limiting the jury's consideration of the evidence that\n\nEduardo was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident.\n\nWhile the court permitted Hyundai to introduce evidence that\n\nEduardo was not wearing his seatbelt, it instructed the jury that\n\nits consideration of \"[e]vidence of whether or not Eduardo was\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fseatbelted is . . . for the limited purpose of deciding whether or\n\nnot [Hyundai] has proved the superseding cause defense.\"7\n\n                Hyundai asserts that the district court committed two\n\nerrors in so limiting the jury's consideration of this evidence.\n\nFirst, it claims that the court should have instructed the jury\n\nthat it could consider this evidence for the purpose of evaluating\n\nwhether the Sonata's airbag system was negligently designed.8\n\nSecond, it claims that the court should have instructed the jury\n\nthat       it   could    consider     this    evidence   for   the    purpose    of\n\ndetermining whether the negligently designed airbag system was a\n\nproximate cause of Eduardo's injuries.9\n\n                The     appropriate     use     of   seatbelt        evidence    in\n\ncrashworthiness cases has been a source of much controversy.                    See\n\nGen. Motors Corp. v. Wolhar, 686 A.2d 170, 173 (Del. 1996).                     For\n\na long period, many courts refused to permit the introduction of\n\nevidence that a victim was not wearing a seatbelt in a product\n\nliability action.          See 2 Madden & Owen, Prod. Liab., ยง 21:7 (3d\n\n\n       7\n       The superseding cause defense allows a manufacturer to avoid\nliability by showing that a third person's negligence or misuse of\nthe product was the sole proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.\nSee Reid v. Spadone Mach. Co., 404 A.2d 1094, 1099 (N.H. 1979).\n       8\n       Hyundai also argues that this evidence was relevant to the\ndefect prong of the strict liability count. Since the jury found\nfor Hyundai on the strict liability count, any error in the\ninstructions concerning this count is harmless.\n       9\n       To prove negligence, the estate had the burden of showing\nthat the negligent design was a proximate cause of Eduardo's\ninjuries. See Trull, 761 A.2d at 482.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fed. 2000).    Courts provided several reasons for this resistance:\n\nthere is no duty to mitigate damages prior to sustaining an\n\ninjury; a defendant must take the plaintiff as it finds him or\n\nher; there is no common law duty to wear a seatbelt; and seatbelt\n\nevidence leads to excessive speculation by experts (and thus\n\nprotracted litigation).         See Swajian v. Gen. Motors Corp., 559\n\nA.2d 1041, 1043 (R.I. 1989).\n\n            State legislatures, in enacting mandatory seatbelt laws,\n\nfurther complicated this issue by including limitations on the\n\nintroduction of seatbelt evidence in civil trials.                For example,\n\nNew Hampshire's seatbelt law contains such a limitation.              See N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. ยง 265:107-a IV.          The statute requires minors to\n\nwear seatbelts but prohibits a defendant from proving comparative\n\nnegligence through evidence that the plaintiff was not wearing his\n\nor her seatbelt.10    Id. (stating that a \"violation of [the child\n\npassenger    restraint   law]    shall     not   be   used   as   evidence   of\n\ncontributory negligence in any civil action.\"); see Forsberg v.\n\nVolkswagen of Am., Inc., 769 F. Supp. 33, 36 (D.N.H. 1990).\n\n            More recently, some courts have relaxed their skepticism\n\n\n\n     10\n       Some other states provide even greater restrictions on the\nadmission of seatbelt evidence, including preventing the admission\nof the failure to wear seatbelts \"in any civil action.\"      E.g.,\nConn. Gen. Stat. Ann. ยง 14-100a(c)(4). Other states permit the\nevidence of the plaintiff's failure to wear a seatbelt to mitigate\ndamages, e.g., Fla. Stat. Ann. ยง 316.614(9), and yet other states\nleave the issue to the courts, e.g., N.J. Stat. Ann. ยง 39:3-\n76.2(h).\n\n                                    -15-\n\fto the introduction of seatbelt evidence in product liability\n\nactions.    See, e.g., Jimenez v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 269 F.3d\n\n439, 457 (4th Cir. 2001);       Wolhar, 686 A.2d at 176-77.            However,\n\nin deciding whether to admit seatbelt evidence, courts                carefully\n\nadhere to the limitations placed on the use of this evidence by\n\nstate legislatures.     See, e.g., Rougeau v. Hyundai Motor Am., 805\n\nSo.2d 147, 157 (La. 2002); Ulm v. Ford Motor Co., 750 A.2d 981,\n\n987-88 (Vt. 2000).\n\n            As   discussed   above,     the   New   Hampshire      seatbelt   law\n\nprohibits the introduction of seatbelt evidence for the purpose of\n\nestablishing the comparative negligence of the plaintiff.                     See\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 265:107-a.             It does not, however, prevent\n\nthe admission of seatbelt evidence for other purposes.                  See id.\n\nHere, the district court permitted the jury to consider evidence\n\nthat the Cabreras' Sonata was equipped with seatbelts in assessing\n\nthe overall design of the airbag system.               The court concluded,\n\nhowever, that whether Eduardo was actually wearing his seatbelt at\n\nthe time of the accident was not relevant to the safety of the\n\ndesign.     Thus, the court instructed the jury to ignore evidence\n\nthat Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt for the purpose of\n\ndeciding    whether   the    Sonata's    airbag     system   was    negligently\n\ndesigned.\n\n            The district court's analysis was correct.                To find a\n\nnegligent design, the jury had to conclude that Hyundai failed to\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fexercise \"reasonable care in designing a vehicle for those uses\n\nwhich    could    be    reasonably       foreseen     in    order    to    avoid    an\n\nunreasonable risk of injury to the occupant.\"                         In assessing\n\nHyundai's care in designing the airbag system, the jury could\n\nconsider the Sonata's overall airbag system design and not merely\n\nthe design       of the airbag which struck Eduardo.                      See, e.g.,\n\nJimenez, 269 F.3d at 459; Wolhar, 686 A.2d at 175; Lowe v. Estate\n\nMotors Ltd., 410 N.W.2d 706, 719-20 (Mich. 1987). Thus, as the\n\ndistrict court         concluded,   the    presence        of   safety    devices   in\n\naddition to the airbags (e.g., seatbelts) could be relevant to the\n\njury's determination of whether the Sonata's airbag system was\n\nnegligently designed.        Id.\n\n           But while the presence of seatbelts in the Sonata was\n\npotentially      relevant    to    the    negligent    design       issue,   whether\n\nEduardo actually was wearing his seatbelt during the accident was\n\nnot.    The point at which the jury was to determine whether Hyundai\n\nnegligently designed the airbag system was the date when Hyundai\n\nsold the Sonata to the Cabreras in the summer of 1995.                    See Trull,\n\n761 A.2d at 481; Chellman v. Saab-Scania AB, 637 A.2d 148, 150\n\n(N.H. 1993).       Obviously, Eduardo's conduct on the day of the\n\naccident, over a year after the Cabreras bought the Sonata, was\n\nirrelevant to this determination.               In short, Eduardo's \"conduct\n\nand its causal relation to [his] injuries [was] not relevant to\n\nthe issue of the vehicle's design.\"              Lowe, 410 N.W.2d at 720; see\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fDePaepe v.

See Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc., 289 F.3d 128,\n\n134 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1001 (2002).

Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 766 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n            Prior    to     trial,   Hyundai   requested     an    instruction\n\ninforming     the   jury,    inter   alia,   that   it   could    consider   the\n\nevidence that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt \"[i]n deciding\n\n\n    11\n        Hyundai claimed that because Eduardo was not wearing his\nseatbelt and sitting too close to the airbag at the time of the\naccident, any airbag (no matter its aggressiveness) would have\nkilled him. Therefore the defect in the airbag system was not the\nproximate cause of his death.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fwhether the allegedly defective airbag was the proximate cause of\n\n[his] death.\"    The district court refused to give this instruction\n\nand instead instructed the jury that it could only consider the\n\nevidence that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt on the issue of\n\nsuperseding cause.      After the court instructed the jury and before\n\nthe    jury   retired   to   deliberate,   Hyundai   objected   to   this\n\ninstruction.    However, at that time, Hyundai objected only on the\n\nground that the jury should have been instructed that evidence of\n\nEduardo's failure to wear his seatbelt could be considered in\n\ndeciding if the Sonata's design was crashworthy.12        This was not\n\nsufficient.13\n\n\n      12\n        Hyundai's objection to the district court's             limiting\ninstruction was, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n      [W]e object and preserve our exception and ask you to charge\n      the jury regarding the crashworthiness claim so that the jury\n      is instructed that they may consider the seatbelt evidence in\n      the context of the crashworthiness claim, and we have as you\n      know repeatedly asked the Court to provide the jury with a\n      further instruction that in the context of the overwhelming\n      evidence in this case, that the system is an integrative\n      system and that it must be considered with all its component\n      parts; that the failure by the parents in this case to use the\n      product properly by using the seatbelt should be considered in\n      the context of determining the crashworthiness of the vehicle\n      . . . Certainly the vast majority of jurisdictions we believe\n      would allow the introduction of seatbelt evidence in a product\n      case where you are providing it for purposes other than of\n      comparative fault or damage mitigation, and particularly\n      where it is part of the underlying system, and I would again\n      just briefly mention the [Rougeau v. Hyundai case]. That was\n      in Louisiana. Also Gardner v. Chrysler.\n\n\n     13\n        In support of this conclusion, we note that Hyundai cited\nRougeau v. Hyundai Motors Am., 805 So.2d 147 (La. 2002) and Gardner\n\n                                   -20-\n\f              When an objection to a jury instruction is forfeited, we\n\napply the plain error standard.         See Gray, 289 F.3d at 134.      To\n\nobtain relief under this standard, the party claiming error must\n\nshow (1) an error, (2) that is plain (i.e., obvious and clear\n\nunder current law) (3) that is likely to alter the outcome, and\n\n(4) that is sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness or\n\nintegrity or public reputation of the judicial process.                 See\n\nBabcock, 299 F.3d at 65.        Plain error is reserved for only \"the\n\nmost egregious circumstances.\"        See Moore v.    Murphy, 47 F.3d 8,\n\n11 (1st Cir. 1995).         Such egregious circumstances do not exist\n\nhere.\n\n              Hyundai has a plausible argument that the district court\n\nshould have instructed the jury to consider the evidence that\n\nEduardo was not wearing his seatbelt on the issue of proximate\n\ncause.       Indeed, some courts have so held.      See MacDonald v. Gen.\n\nMotors Corp., 784 F. Supp. 486, 499 (M.D. Tenn. 1992); LaHue, 716\n\nF. Supp. at 416; Wolhar, 686 A.2d at 176-77.           However, there is\n\nalso        substantial   contrary   authority.14      See   Milbrand    v.\n\n\nv. Chrysler, 89 F.3d 729 (10th Cir. 1996) to the district court as\nthe primary bases for its objection. Both of these cases dealt\nwith the admission of seatbelt evidence to prove negligent or\ndefective design. Gardner, 89 F.3d at 737; Rougeau, 805 So.2d at\n157. Neither case supports the position pressed by Hyundai here--\nthat evidence showing that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt\nshould be admitted on the issue of causation.\n\n       14\n       Neither this Court nor the New Hampshire Supreme Court has\naddressed the issue.\n\n                                     -21-\n\fDaimlerChrysler Corp., 105 F. Supp. 2d 601, 606 (E.D. Tex. 2000);\n\nRougeau, 805 So.2d at 157; Swajian, 559 A.2d at 1046; Lowe, 410\n\nN.W.2d at 720-21; Horn v. Gen. Motors Corp., 551 P.2d 398, 404\n\n(Ca. 1976). As one treatise recently stated, \"the appropriateness\n\nof evidence of seat belt non-use (as opposed to availability)\n\nraises difficult issues apart from the defectiveness vel non of a\n\nvehicle's design, and the propriety of such evidence is not so\n\nclear.\"      2 Madden & Owen at ยง 21:7 (emphasis and parenthesis in\n\noriginal).        In a similar vein, one court observed:\n\n             Enough   has   been  written   about   the\n             \"seatbelt defense\" to show the body of law\n             related to it is split, fragmented and\n             changing.    It varies in time, place,\n             rationale, effect and implementation. No\n             doubt the law varies so much because the\n             theory   does    not   fit   neatly   into\n             traditional tort doctrines of negligence\n             (including duty, breach of duty and\n             causation), strict liability, contributory\n             negligence,    mitigation   of    damages,\n             avoidance of consequences, and comparative\n             fault.\"\n\n\nLaHue,      716    F.    Supp.    at    410    (internal     citations      omitted)\n\n(parenthesis in original).              As should be evident, the most that\n\ncan be said on this issue is that the law is unsettled.                            See\n\nUnited      States      v.   Marino,    277    F.3d   11,   32    (1st   Cir.   2002)\n\n(concluding that there cannot be plain error where the law is\n\nunsettled), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 948 (2002).                          Thus, to the\n\nextent that the district court erred by failing to instruct the\n\njury   to    consider        evidence   that    Eduardo     was   not    wearing   his\n\n                                         -22-\n\fseatbelt on the proximate cause issue, the error was not so\n\n\"obvious or clear under current law\" that it can be considered a\n\nplain error.    Babcock, 299 F.3d at 65.\n\n           C.        Evidence of Seatbelt Law Citations\n\n           Finally, Hyundai challenges the district court's decision\n\nto exclude evidence that         Mr. Cabrera had been cited on two\n\nprevious occasions for driving his car without fastening Eduardo's\n\nseatbelt in violation of the New Hampshire seatbelt law.                       We\n\nreview a district court's decision to exclude evidence for an\n\nabuse of discretion.      See Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera, 133\n\nF.3d 92, 98 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           Hyundai   claims     that    evidence    of    the   citations   was\n\nrelevant   to   whether   Mr.    Cabrera       operated   the    Sonata   in   a\n\nreasonably foreseeable manner at the time of the accident.                  See\n\nReid, 404 A.2d at 1099 (stating that to prove superseding cause\n\ndefendant must show that third party used product in manner\n\nunforeseeable to manufacturer).               The primary evidence on the\n\nforeseeability issue was the evidence of Mr. Cabrera's supposed\n\nmisuse of the Sonata on the date of the accident (i.e., operating\n\nthe Sonata without fastening Eduardo's seatbelt).                In addition,\n\nevidence showing that states have enacted mandatory seatbelt laws\n\ncould be relevant to the foreseeability issue because the jury\n\nconceivably could factor the existence of this legal duty into its\n\ndetermination whether Hyundai could foresee a parent operating an\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fautomobile without fastening a child's seatbelt.15            Cf.

See supra,\n\nat p. 23 n.15.         Rather, it challenges the district court's\n\nrefusal to admit evidence that Mr. Cabrera had received two\n\ncitations for violating the seatbelt law.              We fail to see how\n\nevidence of the citations could demonstrate that Mr. Cabrera's use\n\nof the Sonata on the date of the accident was unforeseeable to\n\nHyundai.     This information was not available to Hyundai when it\n\nsold the Sonata to the Cabreras.             See 72 C.J.S. Supp., Prods.\n\nLiab. ยง 31 n.93 (1975) (stating that only information available to\n\nthe seller at the time of the sale is relevant in determining\n\nreasonably    foreseeable   uses   of    product).      Evidence    that    Mr.\n\nCabrera had been cited for failing to seatbelt Eduardo on two\n\nprior occasions suggests only that he likely failed to seatbelt\n\nEduardo on the date of the accident.            But use of Mr. Cabrera's\n\nprior acts for this purpose is prohibited by Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).\n\n\n\n    15\n       Hyundai sought to introduce evidence showing the existence\nof mandatory seatbelt laws, but the district court excluded this\nevidence as more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid.\n403.\n\n                                   -24-\n\fSee Lataille v. Ponte, 754 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"It is\n\nwell settled that prior acts may not be admitted to prove that a\n\nperson acted in a similar fashion in the case at hand.\").16\n\n           Hyundai argues alternatively that even if the evidence\n\nof the citations was not admissible to show foreseeability, it was\n\nadmissible to impeach Mr. Cabrera's trial testimony.              On cross-\n\nexamination, Mr. Cabrera testified that he did not remember a\n\npolice officer advising him, for safety reasons, that Eduardo had\n\nto be wearing his seatbelt when the car was moving.            In response\n\nto this answer, Hyundai sought to impeach Mr. Cabrera's testimony\n\nby questioning him about the two citations.           The district court\n\nforbade Hyundai from questioning Mr. Cabrera about the citations\n\nbut did permit it to impeach him with his deposition in which he\n\nacknowledged that a police officer had told him that his son had\n\nto be wearing a seatbelt while he was driving.\n\n          \"When a witness's credibility is at issue, the trial\n\ncourt may limit cross-examination as long as the court allows\n\nsufficient leeway to establish a reasonably complete picture of\n\nthe witness's veracity, bias and motivation.\"             United States v.\n\nGonzalez-Vazquez,   219   F.3d   37,   45   (1st   Cir.   2000)   (internal\n\nquotations omitted).      Here, the district court chose to permit\n\n\n    16\n       Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) permits the admission of prior acts\nfor other purposes such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or\naccident. None of these reasons for admitting the citations is\npresent here.\n\n                                  -25-\n\fHyundai to impeach Mr. Cabrera by confronting him with a prior\n\ninconsistent statement from his deposition rather than by allowing\n\nit to inquire about the citations.      Such a determination was well\n\nwithin the district court's considerable discretion to exclude\n\nevidence as overly prejudicial.     See Ferrara & DiMercurio v. St.\n\nPaul Mercury Ins. Co., 240 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001).             The\n\ndistrict court reasonably concluded that presenting the prior\n\ninconsistent    statement   sufficiently   impeached   Mr.   Cabrera's\n\nveracity and that presenting the evidence concerning the citations\n\nwould have been overly prejudicial to the estate's case.      See Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 403.\n\n                            III. Conclusion\n\n         For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment in\n\nfavor of the Estate of Eduardo Cabrera.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\f",

Eduardo Cabrera, five-years-old, was a passenger in the front seat of his parents', Jose and Miriam Cabrera's, 1995 Hyundai Sonata.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Mr. Cabrera was driving the Sonata home from a family outing to the movies. At an intersection, the Sonata was struck by another car on the right side. The collision pushed the Sonata into a light pole. Upon striking the light pole, the Sonata's driver and passenger airbags deployed. At the moment of impact, Eduardo was located between three and ten inches from the airbag. The airbag hit Eduardo under the chin with such force that it severed his spinal cord from his brain and killed him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the accident, the estate invoked the federal court's diversity jurisdiction and sued Hyundai for wrongful death under New Hampshire's \"crashworthiness\" or \"enhanced injury\" doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The estate presented its case under two theories. First, the estate alleged that Hyundai was strictly liable for Eduardo's death. Under this theory, the estate complained that the airbag system which killed Eduardo had an overly aggressive design and that this defective design caused Eduardo's death. Second, the estate alleged that Hyundai had negligently designed and/or tested its airbag system and that these lapses proximately caused Eduardo's death. Hyundai defended by introducing evidence tending to show, <i>inter alia,</i> that the airbag system was not defectively designed and that Eduardo's death was caused by his failure to wear his seatbelt at the time of the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an eleven-day trial, the jury returned general verdicts exonerating Hyundai on the strict liability count but finding it liable on the negligence count. The jury did not make any specific factual findings as part of these verdicts. Immediately after the jury returned its verdicts, Hyundai moved to set them aside as inconsistent and asked that the jury be recharged because it could not rationally have reached differing conclusions on the strict liability and negligence counts. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b). The district court denied Hyundai's request, accepted the verdicts, and discharged the jury. Hyundai subsequently moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial. The court denied the motion, and Hyundai timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai raises three claims on appeal. First, it argues that the district court erroneously permitted the negligence count to go to the jury and that as a result of this error the jury returned inconsistent verdicts. Second, it claims that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on the limited relevance of evidence showing that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident. Third, it contends that the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence that, on two occasions prior to the accident, Mr. Cabrera had been cited for violating New Hampshire's mandatory seatbelt for minors law, N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 265:107-a (the \"seatbelt law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Negligence Count and the Inconsistent Verdicts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai makes two closely-related arguments concerning the negligence count. First, it argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on the negligence count. Hyundai believes that the district court should have declined to instruct the jury on this count because \"the existence of a defect is a determinative factor in both negligent design and strict liability design defect claims,\" which makes it unnecessary and confusing for the jury to consider both claims. Second, Hyundai asserts that the jury's verdicts were inconsistent because both counts required the jury to find, as an essential element, that the airbag system contained a design defect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai's claims are not new to this court. We recently decided two cases in which automobile manufacturers raised essentially these same arguments. <i>See Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,</i> 320 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 74, 157 L.Ed.2d 250 (2003); <i>Babcock v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 299 F.3d 60 (1st Cir.2002). In those cases, we did not address the manufacturers' arguments <i>de novo</i> because the manufacturers had failed to preserve them. We reviewed the claims only for plain error and permitted the verdicts to stand because the manufacturers had not met the \"stringent\" plain error requirements. <i>See Trull,</i> 320 F.3d at 6; <i>Babcock,</i> 299 F.3d at 62-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the defendants in <i>Trull</i> and <i>Babcock,</i> Hyundai followed the strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 and preserved its contention that the district court should have withheld the negligence count from the jury. Accordingly, we will review the district court's decision to instruct the jury on the negligence count <i>de novo. See Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 387, 394 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting New Hampshire law, \"our task is to ascertain the rule the state court would most likely follow under the circumstances, even if our independent judgment on the question might differ.\" <i>Cruz v. Melecio,</i> 204 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting <i>Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,</i> 81 F.3d 1148, 1151 (1st Cir.1996)). In performing this function, we hew closely to the path established by the state's highest court. <i>See Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc.,</i> 103 F.3d 186, 192 (1st Cir.1996) (\"we are reluctant to extend state law beyond its well-marked boundaries\") (internal quotations omitted). We therefore turn to the New Hampshire Supreme Court's case law to determine whether, as a matter of law, the district court erred by submitting the negligence count to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire Supreme Court has consistently declined to adopt the rule urged by Hyundai &#8212; that a trial court may not instruct a jury on both strict liability and negligence counts in a product liability action. Indeed, on several occasions, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has approved of a jury being simultaneously charged on both counts. <i>See Trull,</i> 761 A.2d at 481; <i>Cyr v. J.I. Case Co.,</i> 139 N.H. 193, 652 A.2d 685, 693 (1995); <i>Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 118 N.H. 802, 395 A.2d 843, 849 (1978). As we observed in <i>Babcock,</i> \"the most that can be said is that submission of both claims is frowned upon.\" 299 F.3d at 65 (citing <i>Thibault,</i> 395 A.2d at 849 (\"While ... both counts are permitted, we do not recommend <i>to plaintiffs</i> that counts in both negligence and strict liability ... be submitted to the jury because of the confusion which is created.\")) (emphasis supplied). As this underscored language from <i>Thibault</i> suggests, the decision whether to risk confusion by submitting both counts to the jury rests with the plaintiff, not the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support its claim that New Hampshire law required the district court to withdraw the negligence count from the jury, Hyundai relies heavily on the New Hampshire Supreme Court's decision in <i>Greenland v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 115 N.H. 564, 347 A.2d 159 (1975).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Greenland</i> does not support Hyundai's position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Greenland,</i> the plaintiffs were injured when their car spun out of control. <i>Id.</i> at 161. They asserted that their injuries were caused by a defective ball and socket assembly in one of the front wheels. <i>Id.</i> at 162. At trial, they proceeded on a strict liability theory of design defect and a negligence theory that the defendant's failure to test the vehicle permitted the design defect to persist. <i>Id.</i> at 163. The trial court permitted the jury to consider the strict liability claim but dismissed the negligence claim. <i>Id.</i> at 162-63. The plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the jury should have been instructed on both claims. <i>Greenland,</i> 347 A.2d at 162-63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed the decision to withhold the negligence claim from the jury. <i>Id.</i> It concluded that when a negligence claim is premised on the same design defect as a strict liability claim, the trial court has \"discretion\" to exclude the negligence claim because asking the jury to consider both claims could be \"confusing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 163. In the course of its discussion, however, the court observed that \"it is clear that a products liability action grounded on strict liability <i>may</i> be joined with an action grounded on negligence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 163 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis supplied). Thus, <i>Greenland</i> stands only for the proposition that in cases where the negligence claim is premised on a design defect, a trial court <i>may,</i> in its discretion, withhold the negligence claim from the jury. It does not, as Hyundai suggests, establish a rule that a court <i>must</i> keep the negligence claim from the jury in these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the New Hampshire Supreme Court permits a \"strict liability action based upon a theory of defective design [to] be joined with an action grounded in negligence.\" <i>Trull,</i> 761 A.2d at 481. Thus, the district court did not violate New Hampshire law by instructing the jury on both the strict liability and negligence counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the district court did not err in instructing the jury on both counts, we turn to whether Hyundai is nonetheless entitled to relief because the jury's verdicts finding negligence, but not strict liability, are inconsistent. \"We note, initially, our substantial reluctance to consider inconsistency in civil jury verdicts a basis for new trials.\" <i>Kavanaugh v. Greenlee Tool Co.,</i> 944 F.2d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting <i>McIsaac v. Didriksen Fishing Corp.,</i> 809 F.2d 129, 133 (1st Cir. 1987)). Before disregarding a verdict, we \"must attempt to reconcile the jury's findings, by exegesis if necessary.\" <i>Acevedo-Diaz v. Aponte,</i> 1 F.3d 62, 74 n. 15 (1st Cir.1993). To perform this analysis, we determine whether the jury, consistent with its instructions, could have found negligence but not strict liability under the facts taken in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See Merchant v. Ruhle,</i> 740 F.2d 86, 91 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court instructed the jury that the estate had to prove four elements to hold Hyundai strictly liable:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One, that the design of the 1995 Hyundai Sonata ... created a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two, the condition existed when the product was sold by a seller in the business of selling such products;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three, the use of the product was reasonably foreseeable by the manufacturer; And, four, the condition caused Eduardo's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To find negligence, the court instructed the jury that the estate had to prove only two elements:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One, that [Hyundai] failed to exercise reasonable care in designing and testing the airbag in the 1995 Hyundai Sonata, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two, that [Hyundai's] failure to exercise reasonable care in designing and testing the airbag in the 1995 Hyundai Sonata caused or contributed to the cause of Eduardo's death which would not otherwise have occurred in the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least two important differences between the district court's negligence and strict liability instructions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> First, for negligence, the estate was not even required to prove that the airbag system contained a design defect. It was required to prove only that Hyundai was negligent in testing or designing the airbag system and that this negligence caused or contributed to Eduardo's death. Second, the instructions for each theory presented different standards for assessing the adequacy of the airbag system's design. To find Hyundai strictly liable, the jury was instructed that it had to perform a risk-utility analysis in which it determined that \"the magnitude of the danger [of the airbag system] outweighed the usefulness and desirability of the product\" to \"the public as a whole.\" To find Hyundai liable for negligent design, the jury was told that it had to conclude that Hyundai failed to \"design the vehicle ... to avoid an unreasonable risk of injury to the occupant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, as Hyundai argues, that the jury necessarily based its liability verdict on a determination that Hyundai negligently designed the airbag system, the jury, consistent with its instructions and the evidence, could have found negligence without finding Hyundai strictly liable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The jury could have rejected the strict liability count because it decided that, on balance, the benefit to the public of including the overly aggressive airbag system in the Sonata outweighed the danger caused by the airbag system (because the system saved many more lives than it took).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, however, the jury could have concluded that Hyundai was negligent in failing to develop a less aggressive airbag system for the Sonata. The jury heard testimony from an expert witness who testified that the Sonata's airbag system contained an unnecessarily aggressive inflator. The same expert also testified that other cars on the market in 1995 contained less aggressive airbag system designs. In light of this evidence, the jury could have decided that a less aggressive design was readily available and in use by other automobile manufacturers. Under the circumstances, the \"jury's efforts to apply the instructions were understandable and had some basis\" in the evidence. <i>Merchant,</i> 740 F.2d at 91. There is nothing before us to suggest that the jury was confused by its task or that it shirked its responsibility. Indeed, it appears from the verdicts that the jury understood that \"the focus of strict liability is on whether the design itself was unreasonably dangerous whereas in a negligence case the focus is on the conduct of the manufacturer.\" <i>Trull,</i> 320 F.3d at 7. Thus, we have no reason to reverse the judgment because the jury returned opposite verdicts on the strict liability and negligence counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Instruction on Seatbelt Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai's second challenge concerns the district court's instruction limiting the jury's consideration of the evidence that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident. While the court permitted Hyundai to introduce evidence that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt, it instructed the jury that its consideration of \"[e]vidence of whether or not Eduardo was seatbelted is ... for the limited purpose of deciding whether or not [Hyundai] has proved the superseding cause defense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai asserts that the district court committed two errors in so limiting the jury's consideration of this evidence. First, it claims that the court should have instructed the jury that it could consider this evidence for the purpose of evaluating whether the Sonata's airbag system was negligently designed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Second, it claims that the court should have instructed the jury that it could consider this evidence for the purpose of determining whether the negligently designed airbag system was a proximate cause of Eduardo's injuries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appropriate use of seatbelt evidence in crashworthiness cases has been a source of much controversy. <i>See Gen. Motors Corp. v. Wolhar,</i> 686 A.2d 170, 173 (Del. 1996). For a long period, many courts refused to permit the introduction of evidence that a victim was not wearing a seatbelt in a product liability action. <i>See</i> 2 Madden &amp; Owen, <i>Prod. Liab.,</i> &#167; 21:7 (3d ed.2000). Courts provided several reasons for this resistance: there is no duty to mitigate damages prior to sustaining an injury; a defendant must take the plaintiff as it finds him or her; there is no common law duty to wear a seatbelt; and seatbelt evidence leads to excessive speculation by experts (and thus protracted litigation). <i>See Swajian v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 559 A.2d 1041, 1043 (R.I.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">State legislatures, in enacting mandatory seat belt laws, further complicated this issue by including limitations on the introduction of seatbelt evidence in civil trials. For example, New Hampshire's seatbelt law contains such a limitation. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 265:107-a IV. The statute requires minors to wear seatbelts but prohibits a defendant from proving comparative negligence through evidence that the plaintiff was not wearing his or her seatbelt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>Id.</i> (stating that a \"violation of [the child passenger restraint law] shall not be used as evidence of contributory negligence in any civil action.\"); <i>see Forsberg v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,</i> 769 F.Supp. 33, 36 (D.N.H.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More recently, some courts have relaxed their skepticism to the introduction of seatbelt evidence in product liability actions. <i>See, e.g., Jimenez v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.,</i> 269 F.3d 439, 457 (4th Cir.2001); <i>Wolhar,</i> 686 A.2d at 176-77. However, in deciding whether to admit seatbelt evidence, courts carefully adhere to the limitations placed on the use of this evidence by state legislatures. <i>See, e.g., Rougeau v. Hyundai Motor Am.,</i> 805 So.2d 147, 157 (La.2002); <i>Ulm v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 170 Vt. 281, 750 A.2d 981, 987-88 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, the New Hampshire seatbelt law prohibits the introduction of seatbelt evidence for the purpose of establishing the comparative negligence of the plaintiff. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 265:107-a. It does not, however, prevent the admission of seatbelt evidence for other purposes. <i>See id.</i> Here, the district court permitted the jury to consider evidence that the Cabreras' Sonata was equipped with seatbelts in assessing the overall design of the airbag system. The court concluded, however, that whether Eduardo was actually wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident was not relevant to the safety of the design. Thus, the court instructed the jury to ignore evidence that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt for the purpose of deciding whether the Sonata's airbag system was negligently designed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's analysis was correct. To find a negligent design, the jury had to conclude that Hyundai failed to exercise \"reasonable care in designing a vehicle for those uses which could be reasonably foreseen in order to avoid an unreasonable risk of injury to the occupant.\" In assessing Hyundai's care in designing the airbag system, the jury could consider the Sonata's overall airbag system design and not merely the design of the airbag which struck Eduardo. <i>See, e.g., Jimenez,</i> 269 F.3d at 459; <i>Wolhar,</i> 686 A.2d at 175; <i>Lowe v. Estate Motors Ltd.,</i> 428 Mich. 439, 410 N.W.2d 706, 719-20 (1987). Thus, as the district court concluded, the <i>presence</i> of safety devices in addition to the airbags (<i>e.g.,</i> seatbelts) could be relevant to the jury's determination of whether the Sonata's airbag system was negligently designed. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But while the presence of seatbelts in the Sonata was potentially relevant to the negligent design issue, whether Eduardo actually was wearing his seatbelt during the accident was not. The point at which the jury was to determine whether Hyundai negligently designed the airbag system was the date when Hyundai sold the Sonata to the Cabreras in the summer of 1995. <i>See Trull,</i> 761 A.2d at 481; <i>Chellman v. Saab-Scania AB,</i> 138 N.H. 73, 637 A.2d 148, 150 (1993). Obviously, Eduardo's conduct on the day of the accident, over a year after the Cabreras bought the Sonata, was irrelevant to this determination. In short, Eduardo's \"conduct and its causal relation to [his] injuries [was] not relevant to the issue of the vehicle's design.\" <i>Lowe,</i> 410 N.W.2d at 720; <i>see DePaepe v.</i> <i>Gen.

Genlyte Group, Inc.,</i> 289 F.3d 128, 134 (1st Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 1001, 123 S.Ct. 485, 154 L.Ed.2d 397 (2002). It is well-settled in this Circuit that \"[e]ven if the initial request for an instruction is made in detail, the requesting party must object again after the instructions are given but before the jury retires for deliberations.\" <i>Foley v. Commonwealth Elec. Co.,</i> 312 F.3d 517, 521 (1st Cir.2002); <i>see Gray,</i> 289 F.3d at 134; <i>Smith v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 877 F.2d 1106, 1109 (1st Cir.1989). It is also well-settled \"that an objection on one ground does not preserve appellate review of a different ground.\" <i>Negron v. Caleb Brett U.S.A., Inc.,</i> 212 F.3d 666, 672 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see Cambridge Plating Co. v.

After the court instructed the jury and before the jury retired to deliberate, Hyundai objected to this instruction. However, at that time, Hyundai objected only on the ground that the jury should have been instructed that evidence of Eduardo's failure to wear his seatbelt could be considered in deciding if the Sonata's design was crashworthy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> This was not sufficient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When an objection to a jury instruction is forfeited, we apply the plain error standard. <i>See Gray,</i> 289 F.3d at 134. To obtain relief under this standard, the party claiming error must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain (<i>i.e.,</i> obvious and clear under current law) (3) that is likely to alter the outcome, and (4) that is sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial process. <i>See Babcock,</i> 299 F.3d at 65. Plain error is reserved for only \"the most egregious circumstances.\" <i>See Moore v. Murphy,</i> 47 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.1995). Such egregious circumstances do not exist here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai has a plausible argument that the district court should have instructed the jury to consider the evidence that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt on the issue of proximate cause. Indeed, some courts have so held. <i>See MacDonald v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 784 F.Supp. 486, 499 (M.D.Tenn.1992); <i>LaHue,</i> 716 F.Supp. at 416; <i>Wolhar,</i> 686 A.2d at 176-77. However, there is also substantial contrary authority.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>See Milbrand v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.,</i> 105 F.Supp.2d 601, 606 (E.D.Tex.2000); <i>Rougeau,</i> 805 So.2d at 157; <i>Swajian,</i> 559 A.2d at 1046; <i>Lowe,</i> 410 N.W.2d at 720-21; <i>Horn v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 17 Cal.3d 359, 131 Cal.Rptr. 78, 551 P.2d 398, 404 (Ca.1976). As one treatise recently stated, \"the appropriateness of evidence of seat belt <i>non-use</i> (as opposed to availability) raises difficult issues apart from the defectiveness vel non of a vehicle's design, and the propriety of such evidence is not so clear.\" 2 Madden &amp; Owen at &#167; 21:7 (emphasis and parenthesis in original). In a similar vein, one court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enough has been written about the \"seatbelt defense\" to show the body of law related to it is split, fragmented and changing. It varies in time, place, rationale, effect and implementation. No doubt the law varies so much because the theory does not fit neatly into traditional tort doctrines of negligence (including duty, breach of duty and causation), strict liability, contributory negligence, mitigation of damages, avoidance of consequences, and comparative fault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>LaHue,</i> 716 F.Supp. at 410 (internal citations omitted) (parenthesis in original). As should be evident, the most that can be said on this issue is that the law is unsettled. <i>See United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 32 (1st Cir.2002) (concluding that there cannot be plain error where the law is unsettled), <i>cert. denied,</i> 536 U.S. 948, 122 S.Ct. 2639, 153 L.Ed.2d 819 (2002). Thus, to the extent that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury to consider evidence that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt on the proximate cause issue, the error was not so \"obvious or clear under current law\" that it can be considered a plain error. <i>Babcock,</i> 299 F.3d at 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidence of Seatbelt Law Citations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Hyundai challenges the district court's decision to exclude evidence that Mr. Cabrera had been cited on two previous occasions for driving his car without fastening Eduardo's seatbelt in violation of the New Hampshire seatbelt law. We review a district court's decision to exclude evidence for an abuse of discretion. <i>See Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera,</i> 133 F.3d 92, 98 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai claims that evidence of the citations was relevant to whether Mr. Cabrera operated the Sonata in a reasonably foreseeable manner at the time of the accident. <i>See Reid,</i> 404 A.2d at 1099 (stating that to prove superseding cause defendant must show that third party used product in manner unforeseeable to manufacturer). The primary evidence on the foreseeability issue was the evidence of Mr. Cabrera's supposed misuse of the Sonata on the date of the accident (<i>i.e.,</i> operating the Sonata without fastening Eduardo's seatbelt). In addition, evidence showing that states have enacted mandatory seatbelt laws could be relevant to the foreseeability issue because the jury conceivably could factor the existence of this legal duty into its determination whether Hyundai could foresee a parent operating an automobile without fastening a child's seatbelt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>Cf. Bexiga v. Havir Mfg. Corp.,</i> 60 N.J. 402, 290 A.2d 281, 286 (1972) (stating that existence of statute concerning appropriate use of product was relevant but not dispositive to whether use of product in violation of statute was reasonably foreseeable to manufacturer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai, however, does not challenge the district court's refusal to admit the <i>existence</i> of state seatbelt laws. <i>See supra,</i> at p. 546 n. 15. Rather, it challenges the district court's refusal to admit evidence that Mr. Cabrera had received two citations for violating the seatbelt law. We fail to see how evidence of the citations could demonstrate that Mr. Cabrera's use of the Sonata on the date of the accident was unforeseeable to Hyundai. This information was not available to Hyundai when it sold the Sonata to the Cabreras. <i>See</i> 72 C.J.S. Supp., <i>Prods. Liab.</i> &#167; 31 n. 93 (1975) (stating that only information available to the seller at the time of the sale is relevant in determining reasonably foreseeable uses of product). Evidence that Mr. Cabrera had been cited for failing to seatbelt Eduardo on two prior occasions suggests only that he likely failed to seatbelt Eduardo on the date of the accident. But use of Mr. Cabrera's prior acts for this purpose is prohibited by Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). <i>See Lataille v. Ponte,</i> 754 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir.1985) (\"It is well settled that prior acts may not be admitted to prove that a person acted in a similar fashion in the case at hand.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai argues alternatively that even if the evidence of the citations was not admissible to show foreseeability, it was admissible to impeach Mr. Cabrera's trial testimony. On cross-examination, Mr. Cabrera testified that he did not remember a police officer advising him, for safety reasons, that Eduardo had to be wearing his seatbelt when the car was moving. In response to this answer, Hyundai sought to impeach Mr. Cabrera's testimony by questioning him about the two citations. The district court forbade Hyundai from questioning Mr. Cabrera about the citations but did permit it to impeach him with his deposition in which he acknowledged that a police officer had told him that his son had to be wearing a seatbelt while he was driving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"When a witness's credibility is at issue, the trial court may limit cross-examination as long as the court allows sufficient leeway to establish a reasonably complete picture of the witness's veracity, bias and motivation.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,</i> 219 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotations omitted). Here, the district court chose to permit Hyundai to impeach Mr. Cabrera by confronting him with a prior inconsistent statement from his deposition rather than by allowing it to inquire about the citations. Such a determination was well within the district court's considerable discretion to exclude evidence as overly prejudicial. <i>See Ferrara &amp; DiMercurio v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co.,</i> 240 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2001). The district court reasonably concluded that presenting the prior inconsistent statement sufficiently impeached Mr. Cabrera's veracity and that presenting the evidence concerning the citations would have been overly prejudicial to the estate's case. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we <i>affirm</i> the judgment in favor of the Estate of Eduardo Cabrera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The estate is represented by its administrator, Arthur M.

Eduardo Cabrera, five-years-old, was a passenger in the front seat of his parents', Jose and Miriam Cabrera's, 1995 Hyundai Sonata.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Mr. Cabrera was driving the Sonata home from a family outing to the movies. At an intersection, the Sonata was struck by another car on the right side. The collision pushed the Sonata into a light pole. Upon striking the light pole, the Sonata's driver and passenger airbags deployed. At the moment of impact, Eduardo was located between three and ten inches from the airbag. The airbag hit Eduardo under the chin with such force that it severed his spinal cord from his brain and killed him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the accident, the estate invoked the federal court's diversity jurisdiction and sued Hyundai for wrongful death under New Hampshire's \"crashworthiness\" or \"enhanced injury\" doctrine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The estate presented its case under two theories. First, the estate alleged that Hyundai was strictly liable for Eduardo's death. Under this theory, the estate complained that the airbag system which killed Eduardo had an overly aggressive design and that this defective design caused Eduardo's death. Second, the estate alleged that Hyundai had negligently designed and/or tested its airbag system and that these lapses proximately caused Eduardo's death. Hyundai defended by introducing evidence tending to show, <i>inter alia,</i> that the airbag system was not defectively designed and that Eduardo's death was caused by his failure to wear his seatbelt at the time of the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an eleven-day trial, the jury returned general verdicts exonerating Hyundai on the strict liability count but finding it liable on the negligence count. The jury did not make any specific factual findings as part of these verdicts. Immediately after the jury returned its verdicts, Hyundai moved to set them aside as inconsistent and asked that the jury be recharged because it could not rationally have reached differing conclusions on the strict liability and negligence counts. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b). The district court denied Hyundai's request, accepted the verdicts, and discharged the jury. Hyundai subsequently moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial. The court denied the motion, and Hyundai timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai raises three claims on appeal. First, it argues that the district court erroneously permitted the negligence count to go to the jury and that as a result of this error the jury returned inconsistent verdicts. Second, it claims that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on the limited relevance of evidence showing that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident. Third, it contends that the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence that, on two occasions prior to the accident, Mr. Cabrera had been cited for violating New Hampshire's mandatory seatbelt for minors law, N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 265:107-a (the \"seatbelt law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Negligence Count and the Inconsistent Verdicts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai makes two closely-related arguments concerning the negligence count. First, it argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury on the negligence count. Hyundai believes that the district court should have declined to instruct the jury on this count because \"the existence of a defect is a determinative factor in both negligent design and strict liability design defect claims,\" which makes it unnecessary and confusing for the jury to consider both claims. Second, Hyundai asserts that the jury's verdicts were inconsistent because both counts required the jury to find, as an essential element, that the airbag system contained a design defect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hyundai's claims are not new to this court.

In those cases, we did not address the manufacturers' arguments <i>de novo</i> because the manufacturers had failed to preserve them. We reviewed the claims only for plain error and permitted the verdicts to stand because the manufacturers had not met the \"stringent\" plain error requirements. <i>See Trull,</i> 320 F.3d at 6; <i>Babcock,</i> 299 F.3d at 62-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike the defendants in <i>Trull</i> and <i>Babcock,</i> Hyundai followed the strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 and preserved its contention that the district court should have withheld the negligence count from the jury.

Indeed, on several occasions, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has approved of a jury being simultaneously charged on both counts. <i>See Trull,</i> 761 A.2d at 481; <i>Cyr v. J.I.

At trial, they proceeded on a strict liability theory of design defect and a negligence theory that the defendant's failure to test the vehicle permitted the design defect to persist. <i>Id.</i> at 163. The trial court permitted the jury to consider the strict liability claim but dismissed the negligence claim. <i>Id.</i> at 162-63.

In the course of its discussion, however, the court observed that \"it is clear that a products liability action grounded on strict liability <i>may</i> be joined with an action grounded on negligence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 163 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis supplied). Thus, <i>Greenland</i> stands only for the proposition that in cases where the negligence claim is premised on a design defect, a trial court <i>may,</i> in its discretion, withhold the negligence claim from the jury. It does not, as Hyundai suggests, establish a rule that a court <i>must</i> keep the negligence claim from the jury in these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the New Hampshire Supreme Court permits a \"strict liability action based upon a theory of defective design [to] be joined with an action grounded in negligence.\" <i>Trull,</i> 761 A.2d at 481.

It was required to prove only that Hyundai was negligent in testing or designing the airbag system and that this negligence caused or contributed to Eduardo's death. Second, the instructions for each theory presented different standards for assessing the adequacy of the airbag system's design. To find Hyundai strictly liable, the jury was instructed that it had to perform a risk-utility analysis in which it determined that \"the magnitude of the danger [of the airbag system] outweighed the usefulness and desirability of the product\" to \"the public as a whole.\" To find Hyundai liable for negligent design, the jury was told that it had to conclude that Hyundai failed to \"design the vehicle ... to avoid an unreasonable risk of injury to the occupant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming, as Hyundai argues, that the jury necessarily based its liability verdict on a determination that Hyundai negligently designed the airbag system, the jury, consistent with its instructions and the evidence, could have found negligence without finding Hyundai strictly liable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The jury could have rejected the strict liability count because it decided that, on balance, the benefit to the public of including the overly aggressive airbag system in the Sonata outweighed the danger caused by the airbag system (because the system saved many more lives than it took).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, however, the jury could have concluded that Hyundai was negligent in failing to develop a less aggressive airbag system for the Sonata. The jury heard testimony from an expert witness who testified that the Sonata's airbag system contained an unnecessarily aggressive inflator. The same expert also testified that other cars on the market in 1995 contained less aggressive airbag system designs. In light of this evidence, the jury could have decided that a less aggressive design was readily available and in use by other automobile manufacturers. Under the circumstances, the \"jury's efforts to apply the instructions were understandable and had some basis\" in the evidence. <i>Merchant,</i> 740 F.2d at 91. There is nothing before us to suggest that the jury was confused by its task or that it shirked its responsibility. Indeed, it appears from the verdicts that the jury understood that \"the focus of strict liability is on whether the design itself was unreasonably dangerous whereas in a negligence case the focus is on the conduct of the manufacturer.\" <i>Trull,</i> 320 F.3d at 7. Thus, we have no reason to reverse the judgment because the jury returned opposite verdicts on the strict liability and negligence counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Liab.,</i> &#167; 21:7 (3d ed.2000). Courts provided several reasons for this resistance: there is no duty to mitigate damages prior to sustaining an injury; a defendant must take the plaintiff as it finds him or her; there is no common law duty to wear a seatbelt; and seatbelt evidence leads to excessive speculation by experts (and thus protracted litigation). <i>See Swajian v.

It does not, however, prevent the admission of seatbelt evidence for other purposes. <i>See id.</i> Here, the district court permitted the jury to consider evidence that the Cabreras' Sonata was equipped with seatbelts in assessing the overall design of the airbag system. The court concluded, however, that whether Eduardo was actually wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident was not relevant to the safety of the design. Thus, the court instructed the jury to ignore evidence that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt for the purpose of deciding whether the Sonata's airbag system was negligently designed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's analysis was correct. To find a negligent design, the jury had to conclude that Hyundai failed to exercise \"reasonable care in designing a vehicle for those uses which could be reasonably foreseen in order to avoid an unreasonable risk of injury to the occupant.\" In assessing Hyundai's care in designing the airbag system, the jury could consider the Sonata's overall airbag system design and not merely the design of the airbag which struck Eduardo. <i>See, e.g., Jimenez,</i> 269 F.3d at 459; <i>Wolhar,</i> 686 A.2d at 175; <i>Lowe v.

The primary evidence on the foreseeability issue was the evidence of Mr. Cabrera's supposed misuse of the Sonata on the date of the accident (<i>i.e.,</i> operating the Sonata without fastening Eduardo's seatbelt). In addition, evidence showing that states have enacted mandatory seatbelt laws could be relevant to the foreseeability issue because the jury conceivably could factor the existence of this legal duty into its determination whether Hyundai could foresee a parent operating an automobile without fastening a child's seatbelt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> <i>Cf.

Rather, it challenges the district court's refusal to admit evidence that Mr. Cabrera had received two citations for violating the seatbelt law. We fail to see how evidence of the citations could demonstrate that Mr. Cabrera's use of the Sonata on the date of the accident was unforeseeable to Hyundai. This information was not available to Hyundai when it sold the Sonata to the Cabreras. <i>See</i> 72 C.J.S. Supp., <i>Prods. Liab.</i> &#167; 31 n. 93 (1975) (stating that only information available to the seller at the time of the sale is relevant in determining reasonably foreseeable uses of product). Evidence that Mr. Cabrera had been cited for failing to seatbelt Eduardo on two prior occasions suggests only that he likely failed to seatbelt Eduardo on the date of the accident. But use of Mr. Cabrera's prior acts for this purpose is prohibited by Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). <i>See Lataille v.

On cross-examination, Mr. Cabrera testified that he did not remember a police officer advising him, for safety reasons, that Eduardo had to be wearing his seatbelt when the car was moving. In response to this answer, Hyundai sought to impeach Mr. Cabrera's testimony by questioning him about the two citations. The district court forbade Hyundai from questioning Mr. Cabrera about the citations but did permit it to impeach him with his deposition in which he acknowledged that a police officer had told him that his son had to be wearing a seatbelt while he was driving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"When a witness's credibility is at issue, the trial court may limit cross-examination as long as the court allows sufficient leeway to establish a reasonably complete picture of the witness's veracity, bias and motivation.\" <i>United States v.

Here, the district court chose to permit Hyundai to impeach Mr. Cabrera by confronting him with a prior inconsistent statement from his deposition rather than by allowing it to inquire about the citations. Such a determination was well within the district court's considerable discretion to exclude evidence as overly prejudicial. <i>See Ferrara &amp; DiMercurio v. St. Paul Mercury Ins.

Gen.Stat. Ann. &#167; 14-100a(c)(4). Other states permit the evidence of the plaintiff's failure to wear a seatbelt to mitigate damages, <i>e.g.,</i> Fla. Stat. Ann. &#167; 316.614(9), and yet other states leave the issue to the courts, <i>e.g.,</i> N.J. Stat.

Certainly the vast majority of jurisdictions we believe would allow the introduction of seatbelt evidence in a product case where you are providing it for purposes other than of comparative fault or damage mitigation, and particularly where it is part of the underlying system, and I would again just briefly mention the [<i>Rougeau v. Hyundai</i> case]. That was in Louisiana. Also <i>Gardner v.

Both of these cases dealt with the admission of seatbelt evidence to prove negligent or defective design. <i>Gardner,</i> 89 F.3d at 737; <i>Rougeau,</i> 805 So.2d at 157. Neither case supports the position pressed by Hyundai here &#8212; that evidence showing that Eduardo was not wearing his seatbelt should be admitted on the issue of causation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Neither this Court nor the New Hampshire Supreme Court has addressed the issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Hyundai sought to introduce evidence showing the existence of mandatory seatbelt laws, but the district court excluded this evidence as more prejudicial than probative<i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Evid 404(b) permits the admission of prior acts for other purposes such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.
