Keener, Deputy Director, were on brief, for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                         February 3, 2005\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.           This petition for review of an\n\norder of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") requires us to\n\nconsider under what circumstances a permanent resident may be\n\nexcluded    from   the   United   States     for   abandoning    his   permanent\n\nresident status.     An immigration judge (\"IJ\") found that petitioner\n\nFarhad Katebi abandoned his permanent resident status by traveling\n\nto Iran and Canada.      The BIA summarily affirmed.        We deny Katebi's\n\npetition for review.\n\n            Katebi, a native and citizen of Iran, arrived in Canada\n\nin 1989 as a landed immigrant.                In 1990, Katebi's father, a\n\npermanent resident of the United States, sponsored Katebi for\n\npermanent    resident    status   in   this    country.     See    8   U.S.C.   ยง\n\n1153(a)(2)(B).      Katebi's permanent resident application was not\n\napproved until early 1995.        Meanwhile, in 1993, Katebi applied for\n\nCanadian citizenship.\n\n            Katebi entered the United States as a permanent resident\n\non January 5, 1995.      He moved from Canada to Florida where he lived\n\nwith one of his brothers (who is a U.S. citizen) and worked as a\n\nsecurity guard. Katebi returned to Canada in March of 1995 and\n\nreceived Canadian citizenship sometime in 1996.                 After receiving\n\ncitizenship, Katebi remained in Canada for several more months to\n\nawait the issuance of his passport, which he received at some point\n\nin 1997.    While in Canada, Katebi lived in an apartment with his\n\ngirlfriend, worked as a taxi driver, maintained a Canadian bank\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\faccount, and purchased and registered a car.               He remained in Canada\n\nfor several months after receiving the passport.\n\n               Meanwhile, Katebi's father had returned to Iran from the\n\nUnited States and become gravely ill.                  In October 1997, Katebi\n\ntraveled to Iran to visit his father.                He stayed in Iran for two\n\nmonths.      After leaving, he initially went to Canada to retrieve his\n\ncar before returning to the United States in mid-January 1998. Upon\n\nreturning      to   the   United     States,     Katebi   moved   to    the       Boston,\n\nMassachusetts area.         Once settled in Massachusetts, he worked as a\n\ntaxi driver.\n\n               In   October       1998,   Katebi's   father     died,       and    Katebi\n\nreturned to Iran to attend the funeral.               He returned to Boston in\n\nlate    February     1999     and    was    interviewed    by     Immigration         and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\") agents at Logan Airport.                      The agents\n\nconcluded that Katebi had abandoned his permanent resident status.1\n\nThey permitted him to enter the United States but did not formally\n\nadmit       him.    The     INS     subsequently     placed     him    in    exclusion\n\nproceedings.\n\n               At the conclusion of these proceedings, an IJ ordered\n\nKatebi removed to Canada because he had abandoned his lawful\n\n\n\n        1\n      On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an agency\nwithin the Department of Justice. Its enforcement functions were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002).\nBecause the events at issue here predate that reorganization, we\nrefer to the INS in this opinion.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fpermanent resident status in the United States.            The IJ based his\n\nabandonment ruling on three independent grounds: (1) Katebi's trips\n\nto Iran; (2) his conduct after returning to Canada in March of 1995;\n\nand (3) his becoming a Canadian citizen. The BIA summarily affirmed\n\nthe IJ's order.     Because there is substantial evidence to support\n\nthe IJ's second ground of decision, we confine our discussion to\n\nthat basis.\n\n           Where,    as   here,   the   BIA summarily affirms the IJ's\n\ndecision, we review the IJ's decision directly.              See Quevedo v.\n\nAshcroft, 336 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 2003).           Because we face the\n\nfact-intensive question of whether Katebi abandoned his permanent\n\nresidence status, we review the IJ's decision under the substantial\n\nevidence test.    See Khodagholian v. Ashcroft, 335 F.3d 1003, 1006\n\n(9th Cir. 2003); Moin v. Ashcroft, 335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.\n\n2003).   Substantial      evidence   exists   if   the    IJ's   decision   is\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the\n\nrecord considered as a whole.\" INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478,\n\n481 (1992).\n\n           We have not previously considered a case concerning the\n\nabandonment of permanent resident status; however, other circuits\n\nhave addressed the governing legal framework.            Returning permanent\n\nresidents are permitted to reenter the country after foreign travel.\n\nSee Aleem v. Perryman, 114 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir. 1997).                   To\n\nqualify as a returning permanent resident, the resident \"must have\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\facquired lawful permanent resident status . . ., must have retained\n\nthat status from the time that [he] acquired it, and must be\n\nreturning to an unrelinquished lawful permanent residence after a\n\ntemporary visit abroad.\"   Moin, 335 F.3d at 418 (quoting Matter of\n\nHuang, 19 I. & N. Dec. 749, 753 (BIA 1988)).            If, however, the\n\nresident is not returning from \"a temporary visit abroad,\" he will\n\nbe deemed to have abandoned permanent resident status and be\n\nexcluded from the United States.        See Aleem, 114 F.3d at 676.\n\nTherefore, the determinative question is whether Katebi's trips\n\nconstitute \"temporary visits abroad.\"\n\n           While the term \"temporary visit abroad\" is \"inherently\n\nnebulous,\" id. at 677 (internal citations omitted), there is general\n\nagreement that\n\n           a permanent resident returns from a\n           temporary visit abroad only when (a) the\n           permanent resident's visit is for a period\n           relatively short, fixed by some early\n           event, or (b) the permanent resident's\n           visit will terminate upon the occurrence\n           of   an   event   having    a   reasonable\n           possibility   of    occurring   within   a\n           relatively short period of time. If as in\n           (b), the length of the visit is contingent\n           upon the occurrence of an event and is not\n           fixed in time and if the event does not\n           occur within a relatively short period of\n           time, the visit will be considered a\n           temporary visit abroad only if the alien\n           has a continuous, uninterrupted intention\n           to return to the United States during the\n           entirety of his visit.\n\nChavez-Ramirez v.   INS,   792   F.2d   932,   936-37   (9th   Cir.   1986)\n\n(internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Khodagholian,\n\n                                  -5-\n\f335 F.3d at 1006-07; Aleem, 114 F.3d at 677.     Ultimately, the issue\n\nis one of intent.   See Ahmed v. Ashcroft, 286 F.3d 611, 613 (2d Cir.\n\n2002) (per curiam) (citing United States ex rel. Polymeris v.\n\nTrudell, 49 F.2d 730, 732 (2d Cir. 1931)).     \"The relevant intent is\n\nnot the intent to return ultimately, but the intent to return to the\n\nUnited States within a relatively short period of time.\"     Singh v.\n\nReno, 113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir. 1997).      Nonetheless, \"what is\n\na temporary visit cannot be defined in terms of elapsed time alone.\"\n\nAleem, 114 F.3d at 677 (quoting Trudell, 49 F.2d at 732).     In other\n\nwords, a returning resident does not necessarily abandon his status\n\nif he extends his trip beyond a relatively short period; the key\n\nremains whether his activities are consistent with an intent to\n\nreturn to the United States as soon as practicable.     See Singh, 113\n\nF.3d at 1514.\n\n           Factors to be considered in evaluating the alien's intent\n\ninclude the alien's family ties, property holdings, and business\n\naffiliations within the United States, and the alien's family,\n\nproperty, and business ties in the foreign country.      See Moin, 335\n\nF.3d at 419.    An applicant's desire to maintain his permanent\n\nresident status, without more, is insufficient; the alien's intent\n\nmust be supported by his actions.      See Singh, 113 F.3d at 1514-15.\n\n           The IJ concluded that Katebi's actions, commencing with\n\nhis return to Canada in March of 1995, indicated his intent to\n\nabandon his permanent resident status in the United States in favor\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fof residence in Canada.    Applying the factors mentioned above and\n\nthe substantial evidence standard, we cannot disturb the IJ's\n\nconclusion.\n\n           Between 1995 and 1998, Katebi's ties to the United States\n\nwere minimal.    He came to the United States in January 1995 after\n\nreceiving permanent resident status.     But after obtaining this\n\nstatus, Katebi stayed in the United States for fewer than three\n\nmonths.   During that time, he lived in Florida and worked briefly\n\nas a security guard.    Other than this brief period of employment,\n\nKatebi did not work in the United States between 1995 and 1998.   He\n\nowned no property and did not pay taxes in 1996 and 1997.    Katebi\n\ndoes have two brothers who are United States citizens, but he\n\ntestified that he rarely saw them.\n\n           By contrast, after returning to Canada in March 1995,\n\nKatebi established (or more likely resumed) significant ties with\n\nthat country.2    He rented an apartment where he lived with his\n\ngirlfriend; he worked as a taxi cab driver; he maintained a bank\n\naccount; he purchased and registered a car; and he continued to\n\npursue his Canadian citizenship application. In short, the evidence\n\nsupports the view that Katebi's stay in Canada was more consistent\n\nwith him resuming his prior residency than with him making a\n\n\"temporary visit.\"\n\n\n     2\n      Up to this point, Katebi had lived in Canada continuously\nsince 1989, except for the fewer than three months that he had\nlived in the United States.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           Katebi   contends   that   his   actions   in   Canada   do   not\n\nindicate his intent to abandon his permanent resident status in the\n\nUnited States because he was only there to await the granting of his\n\nCanadian citizenship application and to obtain a passport.               This\n\nargument is unpersuasive for several reasons.         First, proof that\n\nKatebi was actively pursuing more favorable immigration status in\n\nCanada could be considered itself suggestive of Katebi's ultimate\n\nintent to abandon his permanent resident status in the United States\n\nin favor of residency in Canada.        See In re Ruiz-Barba, 13 Immig.\n\nRptr. B1-9 (BIA 1995).   Second, Katebi has not demonstrated that it\n\nwas necessary that he be present in Canada for the processing of his\n\ncitizenship or passport applications.3      Finally, even after gaining\n\nCanadian citizenship and obtaining the passport, Katebi lived for\n\nseveral additional months in Canada before leaving for Iran because\n\nof a family emergency.   The IJ was permitted to find that at least\n\nfrom the point that he received his passport, Katebi had no reason\n\nto stay in Canada other than the desire to reside there.\n\n           To be sure, the record could support a finding that,\n\n\n\n     3\n      The INS has suggested that Katebi had to be in Canada because\nCanadian law required him to maintain Canadian permanent residency\nin order to obtain citizenship.     Katebi did not challenge this\ninterpretation of Canadian law before the IJ. We do not decide\nwhether Canadian law actually required Katebi to maintain permanent\nresidency during the pendency of his citizenship application. We\nnote only that his actions were consistent with such a requirement\nand inconsistent with characterizing his stay as a \"temporary\nvisit.\"\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fbeginning in 1998, Katebi decided that he wanted to live permanently\n\nin the United States. But this evidence does not undermine the IJ's\n\nconclusion that Katebi had    previously abandoned his permanent\n\nresident status in the United States.\n\n           Petition denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

An applicant's desire to maintain his permanent resident status, without more, is insufficient; the alien's intent must be supported by his actions. <i>See Singh,</i> 113 F.3d at 1514-15. The IJ concluded that Katebi's actions, commencing with his return to Canada in March of 1995, indicated his intent to abandon his permanent resident status in the United States in favor of residence in Canada.

This argument is unpersuasive for several reasons. First, proof that Katebi was actively pursuing more favorable immigration status in Canada could be considered itself suggestive of Katebi's ultimate intent to abandon his permanent resident status in the United States in favor of residency in Canada. <i>See In re Ruiz-Barba,</i> 13 Immig.

An immigration judge (\"IJ\") found that petitioner Farhad Katebi abandoned his permanent resident status by traveling to Iran and Canada. The BIA summarily affirmed. We deny Katebi's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katebi, a native and citizen of Iran, arrived in Canada in 1989 as a landed immigrant. In 1990, Katebi's father, a permanent resident of the United States, sponsored Katebi for permanent resident status in this country. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1153(a)(2)(B). Katebi's permanent resident application was not approved until early 1995. Meanwhile, in 1993, Katebi applied for Canadian citizenship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katebi entered the United States as a permanent resident on January 5, 1995. He moved from Canada to Florida where he lived with one of his brothers (who is a U.S. citizen) and worked as a security guard. Katebi returned to Canada in March of 1995 and received Canadian citizenship sometime in 1996. After receiving citizenship, Katebi remained in Canada for several more months to await the issuance of his passport, which he received at some point in 1997. While in Canada, Katebi lived in an apartment with his girlfriend, worked as a taxi driver, maintained a Canadian bank account, and purchased and registered a car. He remained in Canada for several months after receiving the passport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Katebi's father had returned to Iran from the United States and become gravely ill. In October 1997, Katebi traveled to Iran to visit his father. He stayed in Iran for two months. After leaving, he initially went to Canada to retrieve his car before returning to the United States in mid-January 1998. Upon returning to the United States, Katebi moved to the Boston, Massachusetts area. Once settled in Massachusetts, he worked as a taxi driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1998, Katebi's father died, and Katebi returned to Iran to attend the funeral. He returned to Boston in late February 1999 and was interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") agents at Logan Airport. The agents concluded that Katebi had abandoned his permanent resident status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They permitted him to enter the United States but did not formally admit him. The INS subsequently placed him in exclusion proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of these proceedings, an IJ ordered Katebi removed to Canada because he had abandoned his lawful permanent resident status in the United States. The IJ based his abandonment ruling on three independent grounds: (1) Katebi's trips to Iran; (2) his conduct after returning to Canada in March of 1995; and (3) his becoming a Canadian citizen. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's order. Because there is substantial evidence to support the IJ's second ground of decision, we confine our discussion to that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ's decision, we review the IJ's decision directly. <i>See Quevedo v.

Because we face the fact-intensive question of whether Katebi abandoned his permanent residence status, we review the IJ's decision under the substantial evidence test. <i>See Khodagholian v.

Dec. 749, 753 (BIA 1988)). If, however, the resident is not returning from \"a temporary visit abroad,\" he will be deemed to have abandoned permanent resident status and be excluded from the United States. <i>See Aleem,</i> 114 F.3d at 676.
