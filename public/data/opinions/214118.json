BACKGROUND\n\n             On March 19, 2008, a federal grand jury sitting in the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts returned an indictment that charged the\n\nappellant      with      two   counts     of    attempted       receipt    of    child\n\npornography, 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), (b)(1), and one count of\n\nknowing possession of child pornography, id. § 2252(a)(4)(B).                       We\n\nrehearse the relevant facts through the prism of the ensuing trial.\n\n             The government's case relied in large part on testimony\n\nfrom agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).                        Byron\n\nMitchell, a member of the FBI's cyber crime unit, related that, on\n\nDecember 19, 2006, he mounted an online undercover investigation.\n\nTo   that    end,   he    availed    himself      of    LimeWire,   a   commercially\n\navailable peer-to-peer networking program that allows file-sharing\n\nbetween unrelated computers.             He entered a search term (\"Lolita\")\n\nthat he knew to be favored by individuals who fancied child\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fpornography.     His query returned a number of files available for\n\ndownload, each associated with a particular Internet protocol (IP)\n\naddress.\n\n             Because some of the file names were suggestive of child\n\npornography,     Mitchell     activated      LimeWire's   \"browse     the   host\"\n\nfunction, which allowed him to view all of the files available for\n\ndownload from a particular user's \"shared files\" folder.                Several\n\nof the revealed files contained words that Mitchell, an experienced\n\nagent, knew to be associated with child pornography. He downloaded\n\na number of those files from that user's folder and confirmed that\n\nsome appeared to contain child pornography.                He then traced the\n\nassociated IP address directly to the appellant.\n\n             At that point, another FBI agent, Sarah De Lair, took\n\ncharge.      After performing some preliminary investigation of her\n\nown, she obtained a search warrant for the appellant's home.                   On\n\nApril 10, 2007, De Lair, accompanied by other law enforcement\n\npersonnel, executed the warrant.\n\n             De Lair testified that when she knocked on the door,\n\nidentified herself, and announced that she had a search warrant,\n\nthe appellant permitted entry.          Following a protective sweep, De\n\nLair   and    another   FBI   agent,   Bryan     Zinn,    conversed   with   the\n\nappellant.     De Lair explained that the agents would be searching\n\nthe premises for evidence of child pornography and advised the\n\nappellant of his Miranda rights.          See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f436, 444 (1966).       The appellant replied that he understood his\n\nrights and signed a written waiver to that effect.\n\n           De   Lair   proceeded   to    question   the     appellant.   The\n\ninterview was not recorded, nor was the appellant ever asked to\n\nsign a written statement.      The agents' version of the interview\n\nfollows.\n\n           The appellant told De Lair that he, his sister, and his\n\nfiancée all used the computers that were on the premises and that\n\nthese computers held a goodly amount of child pornography (at least\n\n15 files).      He initially stated that he did not intentionally\n\ndownload any child pornography.         He acknowledged, however, that he\n\nhad opened suspiciously titled files obtained through LimeWire\n\nbecause he was curious about whether the file names reflected the\n\nactual contents of the files.\n\n           He claimed that he had used the LimeWire program to\n\nsearch for images of the World Trade Center.              After downloading\n\nsome such images, he clicked on a link entitled \"Vicki willing\" and\n\nwatched a video of a young girl, eight to nine years of age, who\n\nwas naked and engaged in a sexual act with an adult.            The girl, he\n\nobserved, was \"not doing anything good.\"           The appellant estimated\n\nthat he saw approximately five videos related to \"Vicki willing.\"\n\n           In the course of the interview, the appellant admitted to\n\nusing search terms such as \"Lolita\" and \"young preteen.\"             He also\n\nadmitted   that    those   searches      yielded    files     that   depicted\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fprepubescent children, approximately seven or eight years old, \"not\n\ndoing anything good.\"        He acknowledged that he knew children were\n\ninvolved in child pornography and that he could tell if someone was\n\nless than 17 years of age.       When De Lair showed him the titles of\n\nthe two files containing child pornography that Agent Mitchell had\n\ndownloaded and descriptions of their contents, the appellant stated\n\nthat he recognized the titles but not the descriptions.              Queried\n\nabout   whether   he   was    \"attracted\"    to   child    pornography,   the\n\nappellant said that he was uncomfortable with the term \"attracted\"\n\nbut admitted that he had been \"interested\" in child pornography\n\n(specifically, images depicting seven-to-ten-year-old children) for\n\nat least a year.       Elaborating on this point, he noted that he\n\nlooked at pornographic images of children three or four times per\n\nweek and that he downloaded five to six such images once or twice\n\nper week.\n\n            As fruits of the search, the agents seized two computers.\n\nA forensic examination of one computer's hard drive revealed, among\n\nother   files   containing     child    pornography   in    the   appellant's\n\nLimeWire shared files folder, the two videos that Agent Mitchell\n\nhad downloaded.    These two video files, each of which forms the\n\nbasis for a separate count in the indictment, bore a creation date\n\nof October 21, 2006.\n\n            Nearly a year after the search, Agent De Lair tried to\n\ninterview the appellant's sister at the sister's residence.                By\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fhappenstance, she encountered the appellant, who told her that if\n\nhe had known either that it was wrong or that anyone was watching,\n\nhe would not have downloaded the files.      Later, he left a voice\n\nmessage for De Lair, in which he indicated that he had made a\n\nmistake by having the materials on his computer.     The government\n\nintroduced a recording of this voice message at trial.\n\n            The appellant testified in his own defense.   His account\n\nof these interactions diverged from the agents' accounts in some\n\nrespects.   We summarize portions of his version of what he told the\n\nagents.\n\n            The appellant maintained that he had used LimeWire to\n\nsearch for adult pornography and sometimes would (inadvertently)\n\ncome across child pornography.     If he opened a video that turned\n\nout to be child pornography, he would click out of it.       While he\n\nadmitted using search terms like \"Lolita,\" he did not understand\n\nthem to be associated with child pornography.    He viewed the video\n\nentitled \"Vicki willing\" and clicked out of it.           He did not,\n\nhowever, delete it.     He never searched for child pornography or\n\nintentionally downloaded any child pornography.\n\n            The appellant did admit to having told the agents that\n\nthere was child pornography on his computer, but explained that\n\nthere were also other items on the computer that he did not want\n\nand had not sought.     He denied having said that he was interested\n\nin child pornography.    He had used LimeWire for only about a year,\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthree or four times a week, and would download five or six \"search\n\nterms\" per week,1 but without any intention of searching for, or\n\ndownloading, child pornography.          He denied having told Agent De\n\nLair that he would not have downloaded the images in question had\n\nhe known either that it was wrong or that someone was watching.\n\nFinally, he tried to explain away the \"mistake\" voicemail; he had\n\nmeant to say \"I made a mistake by having the child pornography on\n\nthe computer, but not intentionally.\"\n\n            Faced with this chiaroscuro record, the jury found the\n\nappellant    guilty   of   one   count   of   attempted   receipt   of   child\n\npornography (count two) and one count of possession of child\n\npornography (count three), and acquitted him on the other attempted\n\nreceipt count (count one).       Prior to the submission of the case to\n\nthe jury, the appellant had moved for a judgment of acquittal as to\n\ncount two.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).          He renewed that motion\n\npost-verdict, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c), and he simultaneously\n\nmoved for a new trial, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a).              The district\n\ncourt denied both motions, and on January 6, 2010, sentenced the\n\nappellant to a five-year incarcerative term.              This timely appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            The appellant has briefed four claims of error. For ease\n\n\n      1\n       Although this phraseology seems odd, we think that the jury\nreasonably could have inferred from it that the appellant\ndownloaded the results of five or six searches each week.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fin exposition, we divide our analysis into segments that correspond\n\nto these claims.    We start with the one claim that seeks acquittal\n\nand then assay the three claims that seek the granting of a new\n\ntrial.\n\n                   A.   Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\n          The   appellant   contends       that,   as     to   count   two,   the\n\nevidence was insufficient to prove the offense's knowledge and\n\ninterstate   commerce    elements.         We   address    these     contentions\n\nsequentially.   First, however, we rehearse the standard of review.\n\n          We assess preserved challenges to evidentiary sufficiency\n\nde novo, considering the evidence in the light most agreeable to\n\nthe verdict.    United States v. Rodríguez-Vélez, 597 F.3d 32, 38\n\n(1st Cir. 2010).    Our appraisal is aimed at determining whether on\n\nthis view of the record a reasonable juror could conclude that the\n\ngovernment proved each element of the offense beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); United\n\nStates v. Troy, 618 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n          1.       Knowledge.    The       appellant      contends     that   the\n\ngovernment failed to introduce evidence sufficient to establish\n\nthat he knew, when he received the relevant video file, that it\n\ndepicted real minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.                    This\n\ncontention operates at three different but overlapping levels.\n\n          First, the appellant tries to engraft an extra layer of\n\nmens rea onto the offense.           In his view, the government, by\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcharging that he \"knowingly attempted to receive\" the images, had\n\nto prove that he knew the character of the material at the very\n\nmoment of its acquisition.             He insists that when he downloaded the\n\nfile, he was aware only of its title, and he refers to testimony\n\npresented at trial for the proposition that titles do not always\n\nreliably indicate a file's actual contents. The appellant believes\n\nthat this testimony demonstrates that he could not have known the\n\nvideo's    actual    contents       on   the     basis    of     its    name     alone      and\n\ntherefore could not knowingly have attempted to receive it.\n\n            This argument is belied by the language of section\n\n2252(a)(2),      which    criminalizes         the   knowing       receipt          of   child\n\npornography.       We simply do not see how incorporating the statutory\n\nlanguage    into    the       charging    document       could    have        elevated      the\n\nnecessary proof beyond the elements required by the statute itself.\n\n            This brings us to the second level of the argument.                             To\n\nprove attempt, the government must show both that the accused\n\nintended    to   commit       the   underlying       substantive         offense         (here,\n\nknowing    receipt       of    child     pornography)       and        that    he    took    a\n\nsubstantial step toward committing that crime.                         United States v.\n\nGobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 2006).                   But this does not mean\n\nthat the government bore a burden to prove each element of the\n\nunderlying offense.            While the underlying offense in this case\n\nrequires the receipt of images of real-life minors engaged in\n\nsexually explicit conduct, see United States v. McNealy, 625 F.3d\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f858, 870 & nn.47-48 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing United States v. X-\n\nCitement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 78 (1994)), the government in an\n\n\"attempt\" case has no burden to prove that the appellant knew that\n\nthe downloaded file actually contained such images.                   Rather, the\n\ngovernment is required to prove that the appellant believed that\n\nthe received file contained such images.             See United States v.\n\nBauer, 626 F.3d 1004, 1008 (8th Cir. 2010).           No other view of the\n\nrelevant threshold of proof comports with the Supreme Court's\n\nreasoning in United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285 (2008), in\n\nwhich the Court explained that \"[t]here is no First Amendment\n\nexception from the general principle of criminal law that a person\n\nattempting to commit a crime need not be exonerated because he has\n\na mistaken view of the facts.\"       Id. at 304.\n\n           The third layer of the appellant's argument rests on the\n\ndistrict court's jury instructions.          Contrary to what the statute\n\nof   conviction   requires,   the    court    told   the       jury    that    \"the\n\ngovernment has to prove not just that the defendant voluntarily and\n\nintentionally, not by mistake, received a depiction, a video, but\n\nthat he knew at the time of receipt that the production of that\n\nvideo involved the use of a real minor and that the video showed a\n\nreal minor.\"    This instruction plainly overstates the government's\n\nburden.\n\n           In   circumstances   where,       as   here,    a   district       court\n\noverstates the government's burden of proof to the defendant's\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fbenefit in its charge to the jury, a reviewing court faced with a\n\nchallenge to the sufficiency of the evidence must measure that\n\nchallenge against the correct legal standard, not against the\n\nerroneous standard set forth in the charge.             See United States v.\n\nBayes, 210 F.3d 64, 69 (1st Cir. 2000).            With the correct standard\n\nas our metric, we conclude that the evidence, taken in the light\n\nmost   agreeable    to     the   verdict,    is   sufficient   to   ground   the\n\nconviction.\n\n            \"[A] showing of scienter . . . can (and often will) be\n\nmade through circumstantial evidence.\"             United States v. Hussein,\n\n351 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).              Here, the jury heard testimony\n\nfrom two FBI agents confirming that, by his own admission, the\n\nappellant deliberately used search terms associated with child\n\npornography (such as \"Lolita\" and \"young preteen\") when trolling on\n\nLimeWire.   This evidence is significant because a defendant's use\n\nof search terms associated with child pornography can support a\n\nfinding that he knew that the images retrieved contained child\n\npornography.    See McNealy, 625 F.3d at 870-71.           Such an inference\n\nis strengthened in this case by the appellant's statement to the\n\nagents   that      those     searches       yielded   videos   of    children,\n\napproximately seven or eight years old, \"not doing anything good.\"\n\nIn addition, the appellant admitted to the agents that he had had\n\nan interest in child pornography for about a year and that he had\n\nlooked at child pornography three or four times a week, downloading\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\ffive to six images containing child pornography once or twice a\n\nweek.       Nor was this all.   The title of the file that underbraced\n\ncount two was highly suggestive of child pornography.2\n\n              Taking this tapestry of facts as a whole, we believe that\n\nthe jury reasonably could have inferred that the appellant, having\n\nseen the name of the file, proceeded to download it; and that when\n\nhe did so, he was seeking to acquire child pornography.         Thus, the\n\nevidence supports a finding that the appellant acted \"knowingly\"\n\nwith respect to count two.\n\n              2.   Interstate Commerce.    The appellant's complaint that\n\nthe government failed to prove the \"interstate commerce\" element of\n\nthe offense of conviction — that is, that the video file he\n\nattempted to receive traveled in interstate commerce — is squarely\n\nforeclosed by circuit precedent.          See United States v. Lewis, 554\n\nF.3d 208 (1st Cir. 2009).        In Lewis, we held that \"the government\n\nproved the images traveled interstate when it introduced evidence\n\nthat [the defendant] received images that were transmitted over the\n\nInternet.\"      Id. at 215.   Given that the video file underlying count\n\ntwo in this case was also transmitted over the Internet, the\n\nholding in Lewis is of decretory significance.\n\n              For the most part, newly constituted panels in a federal\n\n\n\n        2\n       The file name was: \"cp tvg 13 Bond 10-11-12Yo Childlover\nLittle Collection Video 0039 Girl-Vicky String Bikini Pthc 11Yo\nPedofilia.mpg.\"\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fappellate court are bound by prior panel decisions closely on\n\npoint.    Troy, 618 F.3d at 35; United States v. Rodríguez, 527 F.3d\n\n221, 224 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446,\n\n1449 (1st Cir. 1991). Although this permutation of the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis does not constitute an \"immutable rule,\" Carpenters\n\nLocal Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 215 F.3d 136, 142 (1st\n\nCir.   2000),   it    is   subject    to    only    a   few   \"narrowly   cabined\n\nexceptions,\" Troy, 618 F.3d at 36; San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R. Tel.\n\nCo., 612 F.3d 25, 33 (1st Cir. 2010).              To be specific, a departure\n\nfrom circuit precedent is warranted only where the previous holding\n\nis \"contradicted by controlling authority, subsequently announced\n\n(say, a decision of the authoring court en banc, a Supreme Court\n\nopinion    directly    on    point,    or    a     legislative    overruling),\"\n\nRodríguez, 527 F.3d at 225, or in \"those relatively rare instances\n\nin which authority that postdates the original decision, although\n\nnot directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for\n\nbelieving that the former panel, in light of fresh developments,\n\nwould change its collective mind,\" Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,\n\n45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            The appellant offers no serious claim that any of the\n\nexceptions to the law of the circuit rule applies.               While he points\n\nto United States v. Schaefer, 501 F.3d 1197, 1200-01 (10th Cir.\n\n2007), to suggest that our holding in Lewis is incorrect, the Tenth\n\nCircuit's decision in Schaefer predates Lewis.                 Consequently, it\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fdoes not trigger any of the isthmian exceptions to the law of the\n\ncircuit rule.\n\n             That ends this aspect of the matter.               The holding in\n\nLewis — that evidence showing that images were received via the\n\nInternet is sufficient to satisfy the interstate commerce element\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2) — applies here.             Hence, the evidence\n\nof the appellant's use of the Internet to procure files via\n\nLimeWire is sufficient to ground a finding that the interstate\n\ncommerce element of the offense was satisfied.\n\n                  B.     Exclusion of Expert Testimony.\n\n             During pretrial proceedings, the government moved to\n\nexclude certain expert testimony that the appellant proposed to\n\npresent at trial.        This testimony was to come from a forensic\n\npsychologist, Dr. Carol Ball.         Her report stated in pertinent part\n\nthat the appellant was \"free of major mental illness, antisocial\n\npersonality traits, and sexual deviance\" and was \"not a pedophile\n\nor sexual psychopath.\"        The parties sharply disagreed about the\n\nadmissibility of this testimony: the appellant asserted that it was\n\nrelevant because it \"demonstrates the absence of motive for the\n\nalleged crimes\"; the government asserted that it was not relevant\n\nto any element of the charged crimes.               The district court found\n\nthat   the   proffered    testimony    might   be    relevant    but   that   its\n\nrelevance was \"outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues\n\nor misleading the jury.\"       Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fcourt granted the motion in limine.          It later denied a motion for\n\nreconsideration.    The appellant assigns error to the exclusion of\n\nthis testimony.\n\n           We review a trial court's decision to exclude evidence\n\nfor abuse of discretion.      United States v. Stierhoff, 549 F.3d 19,\n\n27 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v. Zaccaria, 240 F.3d 75, 78 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).   This deferential standard normally precludes us from\n\nsubstituting our judgment for that of the district court absent an\n\nobvious mistake.    Torres-Arroyo v. Rullán, 436 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    Within this rubric, abstract legal questions are reviewed\n\nde novo with the understanding that a material error of law is\n\nalways an abuse of discretion.        United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d\n\n65, 67 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           In this case the expert witness, Dr. Ball, was prepared\n\nto testify that the appellant did not have major mental illness,\n\nantisocial    personality    traits,       sexual    deviance,    or   prurient\n\ninterest in children of any age.             The appellant advances three\n\nrelated   objections   to    the    exclusion       of   her   testimony.     He\n\nasseverates that the court applied an incorrect legal standard,\n\nthat it undervalued the probative worth of the proffered evidence\n\nwhile simultaneously overvaluing its potential as a source of jury\n\nconfusion,    and   that    the    order    in   limine    infringed    on   his\n\nconstitutionally assured right to present a defense.                We examine\n\neach component of this asseverational array.\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f          1.   Rule 403 Standard.   The appellant's plaint that the\n\ndistrict court failed to apply the correct legal standard does not\n\nwithstand scrutiny.   This plaint focuses on language in Rule 403\n\nthat states: \"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its\n\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\n\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury . . . .\"\n\nThe appellant suggests that the district court skewed this standard\n\nby considering whether the prejudicial effect of the evidence\n\nmerely outweighed its probative value, rather than whether the\n\nformer substantially outweighed the latter.    This argument rests\n\nalmost exclusively on the court's statement, in the order granting\n\nthe motion in limine, that the evidence's \"probative value is\n\noutweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues or misleading\n\nthe jury.\" To the appellant's way of thinking, the court's failure\n\nto use the modifying adverb \"substantially\" reflects that it\n\napplied an incorrect standard.\n\n          We disagree.    Elsewhere in the same order, the court\n\nquoted the pertinent language of Rule 403, correctly describing the\n\n\"substantially outweighed\" benchmark.      Nothing in the court's\n\ndiscussion indicates that it ignored that articulated standard when\n\nbalancing the competing interests and deciding to exclude Dr.\n\nBall's testimony. Where, as here, a court's fidelity to the proper\n\nlegal standard is fairly discernable from the whole of an order, we\n\nwill not infer the worst from a misspoken word or misplaced phrase.\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fSee, e.g., United States v. Pelletier, 469 F.3d 194, 204 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1088 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).    So long as its overall meaning is clear, each word of a\n\ncourt's decision need not be precise to the point of pedantry.\n\n              2.   Balancing.       We turn next to the appellant's claim\n\nthat the district court miscalibrated the balance between probative\n\nvalue and potential jury confusion.              To begin, evidence that bears\n\non the question of motive ordinarily has some probative value in a\n\ncriminal case.        See, e.g., United States v. MacPherson, 424 F.3d\n\n183, 185 n.2 (2d Cir. 2005); United States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90,\n\n100    (1st    Cir.      2002).     The    district   court    recognized   this\n\nconnection, stating that evidence of the appellant's \"lack of\n\ninterest in images of children makes it somewhat less likely that\n\nhe was searching for child pornography.\"               On the same basis, the\n\nproffered testimony had some probative value with respect to the\n\nissue of intent.          See United States v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113,\n\n120 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[P]roof of motive must be offered to show\n\nsome other element, for example, . . . the accused's requisite\n\nmental state.\")\n\n              Here, however, the appropriate analysis is more nuanced.\n\nIn    enacting     the    federal   child    pornography      statute,   Congress\n\nproscribed certain conduct without regard to the underlying motive.\n\nSee United States v. Dyer, 589 F.3d 520, 529 (1st Cir. 2009);\n\nUnited States v. Matthews, 209 F.3d 338, 350-52 (4th Cir. 2000).\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fThus,   other    courts   have   upheld    evidentiary   rulings     excluding\n\nevidence of lack of motive in cases brought under the statute of\n\nconviction. Of particular note is United States v. Wallenfang, 568\n\nF.3d 649 (8th Cir. 2009), in which the Eighth Circuit upheld the\n\nexclusion of expert testimony about the defendant's psychosexual\n\nproclivities, offered to show lack of motive, because his motive\n\nfor possessing child pornography was \"immaterial and irrelevant\"\n\nand the relevant inquiry was instead \"whether, on their face, [the\n\npictures] appear to be of a sexual character.\"           Id. at 660 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Kemmerling, 285 F.3d 644, 646 (8th Cir. 2002)).\n\n            In this case, the relevant images plainly appeared to be\n\nchild pornography.        Moreover, the appellant admitted possessing\n\nthem.    The key question, then, centered on his intent, that is,\n\nwhether he knowingly received and possessed them.                  Under these\n\ncircumstances, the proffered testimony was of diminished relevance.\n\nThe district court appears to have appreciated this distinction,\n\nnoting the likelihood that Dr. Ball's testimony, if admitted, might\n\nwell    \"shift   attention   away   from    [a]   key   question    —   whether\n\ndefendant had knowledge of the contents of the videos — to a wholly\n\nirrelevant one — whether or not he is a pedophile.\"           While the two\n\ninquiries are more intertwined than the district court's analysis\n\nmight suggest, we agree that the proposed testimony was likely to\n\nconfuse the jury and divert its attention from the central question\n\nin the case.\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f           The fact that the excluded evidence took the form of\n\nexpert testimony figures conspicuously in the decisional calculus.\n\nQualified expert witnesses generally may offer opinion testimony if\n\nthat testimony \"will assist the trier of fact to understand the\n\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"           Fed. R. Evid. 702.        But\n\nexpert testimony remains subject to exclusion under Rule 403.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 783 (1st Cir. 1994).                 Indeed,\n\nsuch   evidence    presents    a      special     level   of    complexity     in\n\nconstructing the balance between probative value and unfairly\n\nprejudicial effect.      This complexity arises out of the concern\n\nthat, because of an expert's stature qua expert, jurors may assign\n\nmore weight to expert testimony than it deserves.                     See United\n\nStates v. Rodríguez-Berríos, 573 F.3d 55, 72 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\nBecause such testimony can carry with it an unwarranted \"aura of\n\nspecial reliability and trustworthiness,\" United States v. Fosher,\n\n590 F.2d 381, 383 (1st Cir. 1979), courts must guard against\n\nletting   it   intrude   in   areas    that     jurors,   by   dint   of    common\n\nexperience, are uniquely competent to judge without the aid of\n\nexperts. This concern, where pertinent, should legitimately factor\n\ninto a trial court's Rule 403 analysis.           See, e.g., Montas, 41 F.3d\n\nat 784.\n\n           So it is here.      The intent issue in this case presents\n\nthe type of judgment that jurors historically have made without the\n\nassistance of expert testimony.          It follows, we think, that the\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fproffered testimony presented a special risk of jury confusion.\n\n          In    arguing   against    exclusion,   the   appellant   relies\n\nheavily on United States v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126 (1st Cir. 1995), in\n\nwhich we concluded that the district court erred in excluding,\n\nunder Rule 702, expert testimony from a psychiatrist who was\n\nprepared to testify that the defendant suffered from a recognized\n\nmental disorder that caused him to tell self-aggrandizing lies in\n\norder to place himself at the center of attention.         Id. at 129-30,\n\n133-34.   But Shay and the case at hand are not fair congeners.\n\nFirst, the court in Shay focused on Rule 702, not Rule 403.           Second\n\n— and more important — the proffers in the two cases were quite\n\ndifferent.    In Shay, the expert testimony, if believed, would have\n\nexculpated     the   defendant,    conclusively   explaining   away    what\n\nappeared to be damning admissions on which the government's case\n\nrelied.   See id. at 133.         In this case, however, the proffered\n\nexpert testimony was much more peripheral; at best, it may have\n\nborne on the appellant's lack of motive and thus, indirectly, on\n\nthe question of whether he had the level of knowledge required by\n\nthe statute.     A jury, accepting everything that Dr. Ball had to\n\nsay, could very well have convicted the appellant anyway.\n\n          \"Where (as here) a piece of evidence is determined to be\n\nrelevant, the district court has wide discretion in steadying the\n\nRule 403 seesaw.\"      Onujiogu v. United States, 817 F.2d 3, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 1987).      \"Only rarely — and in extraordinarily compelling\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fcircumstances — will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record,\n\nreverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the\n\nrelative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\"     Freeman\n\nv. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988).   Whether\n\nthe danger of jury confusion here substantially outweighs the\n\nprobative value of Dr. Ball's testimony is fairly debatable, but\n\nthe very closeness of the question favors the district court's\n\nreconciliation of the competing centrifugal and centripetal forces.\n\nConsequently, this is not one of the rare cases in which appellate\n\nintervention is justified.    Given the circumstances of this case,\n\nthe district court's ruling was within the universe of reasonable\n\ndecisions and, thus, was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n          3. Constitutional Claim. It is a bedrock principle that\n\na criminal defendant's right \"to offer witnesses in his defense is\n\na fundamental component of due process.\"   United States v. Brown,\n\n500 F.3d 48, 57 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing Washington v. Texas, 388\n\nU.S. 14, 19 (1967)).    But \"the mere assertion of that right does\n\nnot automatically and inevitably ensure the admissibility of the\n\nproffered testimony.\"   Id.   (citing Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S.\n\n400, 414-15 (1988)). In particular, the right to present a defense\n\ndoes not trump valid rules of evidence.\n\n          Here, our conclusion that the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in excluding the proffered expert testimony\n\nundermines the appellant's constitutional claim. This exclusionary\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fdecision fell within the ambit of discretion afforded under Rule\n\n403.       The   appellant   has   not    developed   any   argument     that\n\nmeaningfully distinguishes his constitutional claim from his more\n\ngeneric assertion, previously rejected, that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in excluding Dr. Ball's testimony.          Nor does\n\nhe argue that Rule 403 itself offends the Constitution.\n\n            To say more about this claim would be supererogatory. We\n\nhold, without serious question, that the exclusion of the evidence\n\ndid not abridge the appellant's constitutional right to present a\n\ndefense.    See Rodríguez-Berríos, 573 F.3d at 72 n.16.\n\n                     C.   Prosecutorial Misconduct.\n\n            The appellant argues that prosecutorial misstatements\n\nduring closing argument entitle him to a new trial.              He lodged\n\ncontemporaneous objections to only two of the statements that he\n\nidentifies.      As to those two statements, our review is de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Ayala-García, 574 F.3d 5, 16 (1st Cir. 2009).           The\n\nremainder of the statements engender review for plain error.\n\nUnited States v. Sánchez-Berríos, 424 F.3d 65, 73 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nWe therefore analyze the statements in two groups.\n\n            1.     Preserved   Claims.      During    the   summation,    the\n\nappellant objected to the following statement by the prosecutor:\n\n            [I]n   this   case   knowing    possession   is\n            essentially   conceded.      In   the   opening\n            statement   by   defense    counsel    and   in\n            defendant's own words, he told you he knew he\n            had child pornography on his computer.\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fThe appellant protests that this assertion erroneously equates\n\n\"knowing\" in the colloquial sense of \"being aware\" with the legal\n\ndefinition that applies to the charges brought in this case.\n\n          The   prosecutor's   statement   must   be   evaluated   in\n\nconjunction with the law applicable to the case.        To be found\n\nguilty of knowing possession, an individual need only have known\n\nthat there was child pornography on his computer yet declined to\n\ndelete it.   United States v. Carani, 492 F.3d 867, 875 (7th Cir.\n\n2007).   He need not know the material's character at the moment\n\nthat he downloads it, as long as he thereafter learns its character\n\nand nevertheless retains it.      Id.   Evidence of a defendant's\n\nawareness that computer files contain child pornography is adequate\n\nto show that he knowingly possessed that material.     United States\n\nv. Hilton, 257 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          In the instant case, the appellant admitted that he was\n\naware that there were files containing child pornography on his\n\ncomputer and that at least some of them had not been deleted.      The\n\nprosecutor's statement was, therefore, an accurate rendition of\n\nboth the law and the record.   Consequently, the district court did\n\nnot err in overruling the appellant's objection to it.\n\n          The appellant also objected to the prosecutor's assertion\n\nthat the appellant told the FBI agents \"that he viewed five 'Vicki\n\nwilling' files.\"   He protests that this statement was inconsistent\n\nwith Agent De Lair's testimony that the appellant had stated that\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f\"there were approximately five videos associated with the 'Vicki\n\nwilling' link.\"       That testimony, the appellant says, did not\n\nclearly   indicate    that   he   actually    viewed   the   videos.    The\n\nappellant's complaint, however, overlooks entirely testimony from\n\nAgent Zinn, who stated that the appellant \"estimated that he saw\n\nabout — approximately five videos that were related to 'Vicki\n\nwilling.'\"       Agent Zinn's testimony made multiple references to\n\nvideos and images that the appellant told him that he \"saw\" and\n\nincluded descriptions of the contents of these files, indicating\n\nthat the appellant had actually viewed them.             The prosecutor's\n\nstatement    regarding    the     \"Vicki\"    videos    was   thus   a   fair\n\ncharacterization of the agents' testimony, taken in context.\n\n            Viewed against this backdrop, the appellant's objection\n\nwas appropriately overruled.\n\n            2.    Unpreserved Claims.       We can deal swiftly with the\n\nremainder of the challenged statements (which we review only for\n\nplain error).      To establish plain error, an appellant must make\n\nfour showings: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or\n\nobvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial\n\nrights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"              United States v.\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).          He must satisfy all of\n\nthese requirements in order to obtain relief. Sánchez-Berríos, 424\n\nF.3d at 73.       This is a daunting standard: \"under plain error\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\freview, we have leeway to correct only the most egregious of\n\nunpreserved errors.\"   Id.\n\n           When   determining     whether   alleged     prosecutorial\n\nmisstatements sink to the level of plain error, we evaluate the\n\nstatements within the context of the case as a whole.          United\n\nStates v. Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d 849, 854 (1st Cir. 1993). We\n\nwill intervene only if a statement \"so poisoned the well that the\n\ntrial's outcome was likely affected.\"    United States v. Taylor, 54\n\nF.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Mejia-\n\nLozano, 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir. 1987)).      \"We are guided in\n\nmaking this determination by a number of factors, including the\n\nfrequency and deliberateness of the prosecutor's comments, the\n\nstrength and clarity of the trial judge's instructions, and the\n\nstrength of the government's case against the defendant.\" Morales-\n\nCartagena, 987 F.2d at 854.\n\n           We need not recount in detail the statements about which\n\nthe appellant now complains.    For present purposes, it suffices to\n\nsay that we have reviewed each of them in the context of the record\n\nas a whole.   Most involve instances in which the prosecutor asked\n\njurors to draw inferences from the evidence.          It is eminently\n\nproper for a prosecutor — like any other lawyer — to attempt to\n\npersuade the jury to draw reasonable inferences favorable to her\n\ncase.   United States v. O'Shea, 426 F.3d 475, 485 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Hamie, 165 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 1999).     With one\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fpossible exception, the challenged statements fell within this safe\n\nharbor.\n\n          The    only   statement    that   requires   specific   comment\n\ninvolves a misquotation of the appellant's voicemail message.         The\n\nprosecutor told the jury that in this message the appellant said,\n\n\"I got caught.    I'm sorry.\"   Those precise words were never spoken.\n\nAt best the prosecutor's account was a rough paraphrase of what the\n\nappellant had said.\n\n          There is nothing in the record, however, to indicate that\n\nthis misquotation was deliberate. Moreover, the likelihood of harm\n\nwas minuscule. A recording of the voicemail message was introduced\n\ninto evidence, and the jury took it into the jury room.           This is\n\nparticularly important because the court instructed the jurors that\n\nthe statements of counsel were not evidence but, rather, that their\n\nrecollection of the evidence, not the lawyers' recollections,\n\nshould control.     We have noted before, and today reaffirm, that\n\nsuch a prophylactic instruction is a significant safeguard against\n\nan advocate's tendency to confuse what a witness actually said with\n\nwhat he wished the witness had said.        See, e.g., United States v.\n\nOrtiz, 447 F.3d 28, 36 (1st Cir. 2006); Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d\n\nat 855.\n\n          In the circumstances of this case, we discern nothing\n\napproximating plain error.      There is no realistic possibility that\n\nthis isolated comment made the slightest difference in the outcome.\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f                                      D.   Multiplicity.\n\n               Finally, the appellant posits that he is entitled to a\n\nnew trial on count two because counts one and two of the indictment\n\nwere multiplicitous.              Specifically, he says that the government\n\nfailed to offer evidence to show that the two video files alleged\n\nto have been received on or about October 21, 2006 (each of which\n\nwas the basis of a discrete count) were downloaded in separate and\n\ndistinct transactions.                 Assuming for argument's sake that this\n\nchallenge remains open,3 it fails on the merits.\n\n               \"A district court's disposition of a Rule 33 motion for\n\na new trial in a criminal case is ordinarily a 'judgment call.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Connolly, 504 F.3d 206, 211 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(quoting United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 489 F.3d 60, 65 (1st\n\nCir.       2007)).         Such   a   ruling   engenders   review   for    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.          Id.    Here, however, the appellant's thesis depends on\n\nan abstract question of law, which we review de novo.                     See United\n\nStates v. Huddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir. 1999); see also\n\nSnyder, 136 F.3d at 67.\n\n               The rule against multiplicitous prosecutions is grounded\n\nin the Double Jeopardy Clause, which \"protects against multiple\n\npunishments for the same offense.\"                  Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U.S.\n\n\n\n       3\n      The government asserts that this challenge was waived by the\nappellant's failure to attack the indictment prior to trial. See\nFed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(B).     We take no view on the waiver\nquestion.\n\n                                             -27-\n\f410, 415 (1980) (quoting North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711,\n\n717 (1969)).    When an indictment includes multiple counts charging\n\na   violation   of   the   same   statutory   provision   and   a   claim   of\n\nmultiplicity is raised, an inquiring court must determine whether\n\nthe facts undergirding each count can be treated as a distinct unit\n\nof prosecution.      See United States v. Hinkeldey, 626 F.3d 1010,\n\n1013 (8th Cir. 2010); cf. United States v. LeMoure, 474 F.3d 37, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 2007) (observing, with respect to claim of multiplicity,\n\nthat \"[m]ultiple punishments for the same offense . . . are\n\npermissible if the legislature so intended\").               \"The critical\n\ninquiry is whether Congress intended to punish each statutory\n\nviolation separately.\" Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 155\n\n(1977).\n\n           Counts one and two both charged the appellant with\n\nattempted receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2252(a)(2), which makes it unlawful to \"knowingly receive[] . . .\n\nany visual depiction\" involving \"the use of a minor engaging in\n\nsexually explicit conduct.\"4       The record contains no evidence that\n\nmight establish that the two files at issue here were received in\n\nseparate and distinct transactions.           The government appears to\n\nconcede that the allowable unit of prosecution for the appellant's\n\n\n\n      4\n       Each count also mentions 18 U.S.C. § 2252(b)(1), which\ncriminalizes the attempted violation of section 2252(a)(2). This\nadditional reference is of no consequence in the multiplicity\nanalysis.\n\n                                     -28-\n\fattempted receipt of videos containing child pornography, on a\n\nsingle day and without proof of multiple transactions, is one, not\n\ntwo.   See United States v. Polouizzi, 564 F.3d 142, 158 (2d Cir.\n\n2009) (concluding that the rule of lenity requires that a person\n\nwho receives multiple prohibited images in a single transaction can\n\nonly be charged with one violation under section 2252(a)(2)).\n\nThus, there is a credible basis for a multiplicity claim.\n\n            The potential for such a claim dissipated, however, once\n\nthe jury acquitted the appellant on count one and convicted him on\n\ncount two.    This split decision eliminated any prospect of double\n\njeopardy.    That makes a dispositive difference.\n\n            The appellant attempts to blunt the impact of this split\n\ndecision by suggesting that, had the district court recognized the\n\nmultiplicity concern when that concern was first voiced (at the\n\nclose of the government's case in chief), the government would have\n\nbeen compelled to elect between counts one and two — and it might\n\nhave guessed wrong as to which count it should jettison.        This\n\nsuggestion misses the mark.\n\n            There is no inflexible rule that the exclusive remedy for\n\nmultiplicitous counts is election between them. See Ball v. United\n\nStates, 470 U.S. 856, 864 (1985).        Requiring election is one\n\noption, but not the only option; the court may, for example, simply\n\nvacate both the conviction and the sentence as to all but one\n\ncount, essentially merging the offending counts.     See, e.g., id.;\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\fUnited States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 306 (1st Cir. 1992).                  This\n\nflexible approach makes good sense because \"the Double Jeopardy\n\nClause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the\n\nsame offense, so long as no more than one punishment is eventually\n\nimposed.\"     United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir.\n\n2006) (per curiam).\n\n             In the case at hand, the appellant was convicted and\n\nsentenced on only one of the two purportedly multiplicitous counts.\n\nConsequently, his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause were not\n\ninfracted.        See id.   That fact is fatal to the thesis that he\n\nadvances here: a multiplicity claim is necessarily premised on\n\ndouble   jeopardy     concerns,    and   where   such   concerns    have    been\n\neliminated, the multiplicity claim evaporates. The court below did\n\nnot    err   in   denying   the   appellant's    motion   for   a   new    trial\n\npredicated on this ground.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nthe appellant's challenges come to naught.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On March 19, 2008, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment that charged the appellant with two counts of attempted receipt of child pornography, 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), (b)(1), and one count of knowing possession of child pornography, <i>id.</i> § 2252(a)(4)(B). We rehearse the relevant facts through the prism of the ensuing trial. The government's case relied in large part on testimony from agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Byron Mitchell, a member of the FBI's cyber crime unit, related that, on December 19, 2006, he mounted an online undercover investigation. To that end, he availed himself of LimeWire, a commercially available peer-to-peer networking program that allows file-sharing between unrelated computers. He entered a search term (\"Lolita\") that he knew to be favored by individuals who fancied child pornography. His query returned a number of files available for download, each associated with a particular Internet protocol (IP) address.</p>\n<p>Because some of the file names were suggestive of child pornography, Mitchell activated LimeWire's \"browse the host\" function, which allowed him to view all of the files available for download from a particular user's \"shared files\" folder. Several of the revealed files contained words that Mitchell, an experienced agent, knew to be associated with child pornography. He downloaded a number of those files from that user's folder and confirmed that some appeared to contain child pornography. He then traced the associated IP address directly to the appellant.</p>\n<p>At that point, another FBI agent, Sarah De Lair, took charge. After performing some preliminary investigation of her own, she obtained a search warrant for the appellant's home. On April 10, 2007, De Lair, accompanied by other law enforcement personnel, executed the warrant.</p>\n<p>De Lair testified that when she knocked on the door, identified herself, and announced that she had a search warrant, the appellant permitted entry. Following a protective sweep, De Lair and another FBI agent, Bryan Zinn, conversed with the appellant. De Lair explained that the agents would be searching the premises for evidence of child pornography and advised the appellant of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>See </i><i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The appellant replied that he understood his rights and signed a written waiver to that effect.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> De Lair proceeded to question the appellant. The interview was not recorded, nor was the appellant ever asked to sign a written statement. The agents' version of the interview follows.</p>\n<p>The appellant told De Lair that he, his sister, and his fiancée all used the computers that were on the premises and that these computers held a goodly amount of child pornography (at least 15 files). He initially stated that he did not intentionally download any child pornography. He acknowledged, however, that he had opened suspiciously titled files obtained through LimeWire because he was curious about whether the file names reflected the actual contents of the files.</p>\n<p>He claimed that he had used the LimeWire program to search for images of the World Trade Center. After downloading some such images, he clicked on a link entitled \"Vicki willing\" and watched a video of a young girl, eight to nine years of age, who was naked and engaged in a sexual act with an adult. The girl, he observed, was \"not doing anything good.\" The appellant estimated that he saw approximately five videos related to \"Vicki willing.\"</p>\n<p>In the course of the interview, the appellant admitted to using search terms such as \"Lolita\" and \"young preteen.\" He also admitted that those searches yielded files that depicted prepubescent children, approximately seven or eight years old, \"not doing anything good.\" He acknowledged that he knew children were involved in child pornography and that he could tell if someone was less than 17 years of age. When De Lair showed him the titles of the two files containing child pornography that Agent Mitchell had downloaded and descriptions of their contents, the appellant stated that he recognized the titles but not the descriptions. Queried about whether he was \"attracted\" to child pornography, the appellant said that he was uncomfortable with the term \"attracted\" but admitted that he had been \"interested\" in child pornography (specifically, images depicting seven-to-ten-year-old children) for at least a year. Elaborating on this point, he noted that he looked at pornographic images of children three or four times per week and that he downloaded five to six such images once or twice per week.</p>\n<p>As fruits of the search, the agents seized two computers. A forensic examination of one computer's hard drive revealed, among other files containing child pornography in the appellant's LimeWire shared files folder, the two videos that Agent Mitchell had downloaded. These two video files, each of which forms the basis for a separate count in the indictment, bore a creation date of October 21, 2006.</p>\n<p>Nearly a year after the search, Agent De Lair tried to interview the appellant's sister at the sister's residence. By happenstance, she encountered the appellant, who told her that if he had known either that it was wrong or that anyone was watching, he would not have downloaded the files. Later, he left a voice message for De Lair, in which he indicated that he had made a mistake by having the materials on his computer. The government introduced a recording of this voice message at trial.</p>\n<p>The appellant testified in his own defense. His account of these interactions diverged from the agents' accounts in some respects. We summarize portions of his version of what he told the agents.</p>\n<p>The appellant maintained that he had used LimeWire to search for adult pornography and sometimes would (inadvertently) come across child pornography. If he opened a video that turned out to be child pornography, he would click out of it. While he admitted using search terms like <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> \"Lolita,\" he did not understand them to be associated with child pornography. He viewed the video entitled \"Vicki willing\" and clicked out of it. He did not, however, delete it. He never searched for child pornography or intentionally downloaded any child pornography.</p>\n<p>The appellant did admit to having told the agents that there was child pornography on his computer, but explained that there were also other items on the computer that he did not want and had not sought. He denied having said that he was interested in child pornography. He had used LimeWire for only about a year, three or four times a week, and would download five or six \"search terms\" per week,<sup>[1]</sup> but without any intention of searching for, or downloading, child pornography. He denied having told Agent De Lair that he would not have downloaded the images in question had he known either that it was wrong or that someone was watching. Finally, he tried to explain away the \"mistake\" voicemail; he had meant to say \"I made a mistake by having the child pornography on the computer, but not intentionally.\"</p>\n<p>Faced with this chiaroscuro record, the jury found the appellant guilty of one count of attempted receipt of child pornography (count two) and one count of possession of child pornography (count three), and acquitted him on the other attempted receipt count (count one). Prior to the submission of the case to the jury, the appellant had moved for a judgment of acquittal as to count two. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 29(a). He renewed that motion post-verdict, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c), and he simultaneously moved for a new trial, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a). The district court denied both motions, and on January 6, 2010, sentenced the appellant to a five-year incarcerative term. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The appellant has briefed four claims of error. For ease in exposition, we divide our analysis into segments that correspond to these claims. We start with the one claim that seeks acquittal and then assay the three claims that seek the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellant contends that, as to count two, the evidence was insufficient to prove the offense's knowledge and interstate commerce elements. We address these contentions sequentially. First, however, we rehearse the standard of review.</p>\n<p>We assess preserved challenges to evidentiary sufficiency de novo, considering the evidence in the light most agreeable to the verdict. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Vélez,</i> 597 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2010). Our appraisal is aimed at determining whether on this view of the record a reasonable juror could conclude that the government proved each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <i>United States v. Troy,</i> 618 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>1. <i>Knowledge.</i> The appellant contends that the government failed to introduce evidence sufficient to establish that he knew, when he received the relevant video file, that it depicted real minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. This contention operates at three different but overlapping levels.</p>\n<p>First, the appellant tries to engraft an extra layer of mens rea onto the offense. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> In his view, the government, by charging that he \"knowingly attempted to receive\" the images, had to prove that he knew the character of the material at the very moment of its acquisition. He insists that when he downloaded the file, he was aware only of its title, and he refers to testimony presented at trial for the proposition that titles do not always reliably indicate a file's actual contents. The appellant believes that this testimony demonstrates that he could not have known the video's actual contents on the basis of its name alone and therefore could not knowingly have attempted to receive it.</p>\n<p>This argument is belied by the language of section 2252(a)(2), which criminalizes the knowing receipt of child pornography. We simply do not see how incorporating the statutory language into the charging document could have elevated the necessary proof beyond the elements required by the statute itself.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the second level of the argument. To prove attempt, the government must show both that the accused intended to commit the underlying substantive offense (here, knowing receipt of child pornography) and that he took a substantial step toward committing that crime. <i>United States v. Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d 302, 309 (1st Cir.2006). But this does not mean that the government bore a burden to prove each element of the underlying offense. While the underlying offense in this case requires the receipt of images of real-life minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, <i>see </i><i>United States v. McNealy,</i> 625 F.3d 858, 870 &amp; nn. 47-48 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing <i>United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,</i> 513 U.S. 64, 78, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994)), the government in an \"attempt\" case has no burden to prove that the appellant knew that the downloaded file actually contained such images. Rather, the government is required to prove that the appellant <i>believed</i> that the received file contained such images. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bauer,</i> 626 F.3d 1004, 1008 (8th Cir.2010). No other view of the relevant threshold of proof comports with the Supreme Court's reasoning in <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 553 U.S. 285, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 (2008), in which the Court explained that \"[t]here is no First Amendment exception from the general principle of criminal law that a person attempting to commit a crime need not be exonerated because he has a mistaken view of the facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 304, 128 S.Ct. 1830.</p>\n<p>The third layer of the appellant's argument rests on the district court's jury instructions. Contrary to what the statute of conviction requires, the court told the jury that \"the government has to prove not just that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally, not by mistake, received a depiction, a video, but that he knew at the time of receipt that the production of that video involved the use of a real minor and that the video showed a real minor.\" This instruction plainly overstates the government's burden.</p>\n<p>In circumstances where, as here, a district court overstates the government's burden of proof to the defendant's benefit in its charge to the jury, a reviewing court faced with a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence must measure that challenge against the correct legal standard, not against the erroneous standard set forth in the charge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bayes,</i> 210 F.3d 64, 69 (1st Cir. 2000). With the correct standard as our metric, we conclude that the evidence, taken in the light most agreeable to the verdict, is sufficient to ground the conviction.</p>\n<p>\"[A] showing of scienter ... can (and often will) be made through circumstantial evidence.\" <i>United States v. Hussein,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> 351 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir.2003). Here, the jury heard testimony from two FBI agents confirming that, by his own admission, the appellant deliberately used search terms associated with child pornography (such as \"Lolita\" and \"young preteen\") when trolling on LimeWire. This evidence is significant because a defendant's use of search terms associated with child pornography can support a finding that he knew that the images retrieved contained child pornography. <i>See </i><i>McNealy,</i> 625 F.3d at 870-71. Such an inference is strengthened in this case by the appellant's statement to the agents that those searches yielded videos of children, approximately seven or eight years old, \"not doing anything good.\" In addition, the appellant admitted to the agents that he had had an interest in child pornography for about a year and that he had looked at child pornography three or four times a week, downloading five to six images containing child pornography once or twice a week. Nor was this all. The title of the file that underbraced count two was highly suggestive of child pornography.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Taking this tapestry of facts as a whole, we believe that the jury reasonably could have inferred that the appellant, having seen the name of the file, proceeded to download it; and that when he did so, he was seeking to acquire child pornography. Thus, the evidence supports a finding that the appellant acted \"knowingly\" with respect to count two.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Interstate Commerce.</i> The appellant's complaint that the government failed to prove the \"interstate commerce\" element of the offense of convictionthat is, that the video file he attempted to receive traveled in interstate commerce is squarely foreclosed by circuit precedent. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lewis,</i> 554 F.3d 208 (1st Cir.2009). In <i>Lewis,</i> we held that \"the government proved the images traveled interstate when it introduced evidence that [the defendant] received images that were transmitted over the Internet.\" <i>Id.</i> at 215. Given that the video file underlying count two in this case was also transmitted over the Internet, the holding in <i>Lewis</i> is of decretory significance.</p>\n<p>For the most part, newly constituted panels in a federal appellate court are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point. <i>Troy,</i> 618 F.3d at 35; <i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> 527 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991). Although this permutation of the doctrine of stare decisis does not constitute an \"immutable rule,\" <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> 215 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir.2000), it is subject to only a few \"narrowly cabined exceptions,\" <i>Troy,</i> 618 F.3d at 36; <i>San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 612 F.3d 25, 33 (1st Cir.2010). To be specific, a departure from circuit precedent is warranted only where the previous holding is \"contradicted by controlling authority, subsequently announced (say, a decision of the authoring court en banc, a Supreme Court opinion directly on point, or a legislative overruling),\" <i>Rodríguez,</i> 527 F.3d at 225, or in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind,\" <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>The appellant offers no serious claim that any of the exceptions to the law of the circuit rule applies. While he points to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> <i>United States v. Schaefer,</i> 501 F.3d 1197, 1200-01 (10th Cir.2007), to suggest that our holding in <i>Lewis</i> is incorrect, the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>Schaefer</i> predates <i>Lewis.</i> Consequently, it does not trigger any of the isthmian exceptions to the law of the circuit rule.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. The holding in <i>Lewis</i>that evidence showing that images were received via the Internet is sufficient to satisfy the interstate commerce element under 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2)applies here. Hence, the evidence of the appellant's use of the Internet to procure files via LimeWire is sufficient to ground a finding that the interstate commerce element of the offense was satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Exclusion of Expert Testimony.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>During pretrial proceedings, the government moved to exclude certain expert testimony that the appellant proposed to present at trial. This testimony was to come from a forensic psychologist, Dr. Carol Ball. Her report stated in pertinent part that the appellant was \"free of major mental illness, antisocial personality traits, and sexual deviance\" and was \"not a pedophile or sexual psychopath.\" The parties sharply disagreed about the admissibility of this testimony: the appellant asserted that it was relevant because it \"demonstrates the absence of motive for the alleged crimes\"; the government asserted that it was not relevant to any element of the charged crimes. The district court found that the proffered testimony might be relevant but that its relevance was \"outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues or misleading the jury.\" Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the court granted the motion in limine. It later denied a motion for reconsideration. The appellant assigns error to the exclusion of this testimony.</p>\n<p>We review a trial court's decision to exclude evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Stierhoff,</i> 549 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Zaccaria,</i> 240 F.3d 75, 78 (1st Cir.2001). This deferential standard normally precludes us from substituting our judgment for that of the district court absent an obvious mistake. <i>Torres-Arroyo v. Rullán,</i> 436 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2006). Within this rubric, abstract legal questions are reviewed de novo with the understanding that a material error of law is always an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>In this case the expert witness, Dr. Ball, was prepared to testify that the appellant did not have major mental illness, antisocial personality traits, sexual deviance, or prurient interest in children of any age. The appellant advances three related objections to the exclusion of her testimony. He asseverates that the court applied an incorrect legal standard, that it undervalued the probative worth of the proffered evidence while simultaneously overvaluing its potential as a source of jury confusion, and that the order in limine infringed on his constitutionally assured right to present a defense. We examine each component of this asseverational array.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Rule 403 Standard.</i> The appellant's plaint that the district court failed to apply the correct legal standard does not withstand scrutiny. This plaint focuses on language in Rule 403 that states: \"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury....\" The appellant suggests that the district court skewed this standard by considering whether the prejudicial effect of the evidence merely outweighed its probative value, rather than whether the former <i>substantially</i> outweighed the latter. This <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> argument rests almost exclusively on the court's statement, in the order granting the motion in limine, that the evidence's \"probative value is outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues or misleading the jury.\" To the appellant's way of thinking, the court's failure to use the modifying adverb \"substantially\" reflects that it applied an incorrect standard.</p>\n<p>We disagree. Elsewhere in the same order, the court quoted the pertinent language of Rule 403, correctly describing the \"substantially outweighed\" benchmark. Nothing in the court's discussion indicates that it ignored that articulated standard when balancing the competing interests and deciding to exclude Dr. Ball's testimony. Where, as here, a court's fidelity to the proper legal standard is fairly discernable from the whole of an order, we will not infer the worst from a misspoken word or misplaced phrase. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Pelletier,</i> 469 F.3d 194, 204 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm.,</i> 998 F.2d 1083, 1088 (1st Cir.1993). So long as its overall meaning is clear, each word of a court's decision need not be precise to the point of pedantry.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Balancing.</i> We turn next to the appellant's claim that the district court miscalibrated the balance between probative value and potential jury confusion. To begin, evidence that bears on the question of motive ordinarily has some probative value in a criminal case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. MacPherson,</i> 424 F.3d 183, 185 n. 2 (2d Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 292 F.3d 90, 100 (1st Cir.2002). The district court recognized this connection, stating that evidence of the appellant's \"lack of interest in images of children makes it somewhat less likely that he was searching for child pornography.\" On the same basis, the proffered testimony had some probative value with respect to the issue of intent. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Varoudakis,</i> 233 F.3d 113, 120 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[P]roof of motive must be offered to show some other element, for example, ... the accused's requisite mental state.\")</p>\n<p>Here, however, the appropriate analysis is more nuanced. In enacting the federal child pornography statute, Congress proscribed certain conduct without regard to the underlying motive. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Dyer,</i> 589 F.3d 520, 529 (1st Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Matthews,</i> 209 F.3d 338, 350-52 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, other courts have upheld evidentiary rulings excluding evidence of lack of motive in cases brought under the statute of conviction. Of particular note is <i>United States v. Wallenfang,</i> 568 F.3d 649 (8th Cir.2009), in which the Eighth Circuit upheld the exclusion of expert testimony about the defendant's psychosexual proclivities, offered to show lack of motive, because his motive for possessing child pornography was \"immaterial and irrelevant\" and the relevant inquiry was instead \"whether, on their face, [the pictures] appear to be of a sexual character.\" <i>Id.</i> at 660 (quoting <i>United States v. Kemmerling,</i> 285 F.3d 644, 646 (8th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p>In this case, the relevant images plainly appeared to be child pornography. Moreover, the appellant admitted possessing them. The key question, then, centered on his intent, that is, whether he <i>knowingly</i> received and possessed them. Under these circumstances, the proffered testimony was of diminished relevance. The district court appears to have appreciated this distinction, noting the likelihood that Dr. Ball's testimony, if admitted, might well \"shift attention away from [a] key questionwhether defendant had knowledge of the contents of the videosto a wholly irrelevant onewhether or not he is a pedophile.\" While the two inquiries are more intertwined than the district court's analysis might suggest, we agree <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> that the proposed testimony was likely to confuse the jury and divert its attention from the central question in the case.</p>\n<p>The fact that the excluded evidence took the form of expert testimony figures conspicuously in the decisional calculus. Qualified expert witnesses generally may offer opinion testimony if that testimony \"will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Fed.R.Evid. 702. But expert testimony remains subject to exclusion under Rule 403. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Montas,</i> 41 F.3d 775, 783 (1st Cir.1994). Indeed, such evidence presents a special level of complexity in constructing the balance between probative value and unfairly prejudicial effect. This complexity arises out of the concern that, because of an expert's stature <i>qua</i> expert, jurors may assign more weight to expert testimony than it deserves. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez-Berríos,</i> 573 F.3d 55, 72 (1st Cir.2009). Because such testimony can carry with it an unwarranted \"aura of special reliability and trustworthiness,\" <i>United States v. Fosher,</i> 590 F.2d 381, 383 (1st Cir.1979), courts must guard against letting it intrude in areas that jurors, by dint of common experience, are uniquely competent to judge without the aid of experts. This concern, where pertinent, should legitimately factor into a trial court's Rule 403 analysis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Montas,</i> 41 F.3d at 784.</p>\n<p>So it is here. The intent issue in this case presents the type of judgment that jurors historically have made without the assistance of expert testimony. It follows, we think, that the proffered testimony presented a special risk of jury confusion.</p>\n<p>In arguing against exclusion, the appellant relies heavily on <i>United States v. Shay,</i> 57 F.3d 126 (1st Cir.1995), in which we concluded that the district court erred in excluding, under Rule 702, expert testimony from a psychiatrist who was prepared to testify that the defendant suffered from a recognized mental disorder that caused him to tell self-aggrandizing lies in order to place himself at the center of attention. <i>Id.</i> at 129-30, 133-34. But <i>Shay</i> and the case at hand are not fair congeners. First, the court in <i>Shay</i> focused on Rule 702, not Rule 403. Secondand more importantthe proffers in the two cases were quite different. In <i>Shay,</i> the expert testimony, if believed, would have exculpated the defendant, conclusively explaining away what appeared to be damning admissions on which the government's case relied. <i>See id.</i> at 133. In this case, however, the proffered expert testimony was much more peripheral; at best, it may have borne on the appellant's lack of motive and thus, indirectly, on the question of whether he had the level of knowledge required by the statute. A jury, accepting everything that Dr. Ball had to say, could very well have convicted the appellant anyway.</p>\n<p>\"Where (as here) a piece of evidence is determined to be relevant, the district court has wide discretion in steadying the Rule 403 seesaw.\" <i>Onujiogu v. United States,</i> 817 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir.1987). \"Only rarelyand in extraordinarily compelling circumstanceswill we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Freeman v. Package Mach. Co.,</i> 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988). Whether the danger of jury confusion here substantially outweighs the probative value of Dr. Ball's testimony is fairly debatable, but the very closeness of the question favors the district court's reconciliation of the competing centrifugal and centripetal forces. Consequently, this is not one of the rare cases in which appellate intervention is justified. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> Given the circumstances of this case, the district court's ruling was within the universe of reasonable decisions and, thus, was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Constitutional Claim.</i> It is a bedrock principle that a criminal defendant's right \"to offer witnesses in his defense is a fundamental component of due process.\" <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 500 F.3d 48, 57 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>Washington v. Texas,</i> 388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967)). But \"the mere assertion of that right does not automatically and inevitably ensure the admissibility of the proffered testimony.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> 484 U.S. 400, 414-15, 108 S.Ct. 646, 98 L.Ed.2d 798 (1988)). In particular, the right to present a defense does not trump valid rules of evidence.</p>\n<p>Here, our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the proffered expert testimony undermines the appellant's constitutional claim. This exclusionary decision fell within the ambit of discretion afforded under Rule 403. The appellant has not developed any argument that meaningfully distinguishes his constitutional claim from his more generic assertion, previously rejected, that the district court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Ball's testimony. Nor does he argue that Rule 403 itself offends the Constitution.</p>\n<p>To say more about this claim would be supererogatory. We hold, without serious question, that the exclusion of the evidence did not abridge the appellant's constitutional right to present a defense. <i>See </i><i>Rodríguez-Berríos,</i> 573 F.3d at 72 n. 16.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Prosecutorial Misconduct.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellant argues that prosecutorial misstatements during closing argument entitle him to a new trial. He lodged contemporaneous objections to only two of the statements that he identifies. As to those two statements, our review is de novo. <i>United States v. Ayala-García,</i> 574 F.3d 5, 16 (1st Cir.2009). The remainder of the statements engender review for plain error. <i>United States v. Sánchez-Berríos,</i> 424 F.3d 65, 73 (1st Cir.2005). We therefore analyze the statements in two groups.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Preserved Claims.</i> During the summation, the appellant objected to the following statement by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]n this case knowing possession is essentially conceded. In the opening statement by defense counsel and in defendant's own words, he told you he knew he had child pornography on his computer.</blockquote>\n<p>The appellant protests that this assertion erroneously equates \"knowing\" in the colloquial sense of \"being aware\" with the legal definition that applies to the charges brought in this case.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor's statement must be evaluated in conjunction with the law applicable to the case. To be found guilty of knowing possession, an individual need only have known that there was child pornography on his computer yet declined to delete it. <i>United States v. Carani,</i> 492 F.3d 867, 875 (7th Cir.2007). He need not know the material's character at the moment that he downloads it, as long as he thereafter learns its character and nevertheless retains it. <i>Id.</i> Evidence of a defendant's awareness that computer files contain child pornography is adequate to show that he knowingly possessed that material. <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 257 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>In the instant case, the appellant admitted that he was aware that there were files containing child pornography on his computer and that at least some of them had not been deleted. The prosecutor's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> statement was, therefore, an accurate rendition of both the law and the record. Consequently, the district court did not err in overruling the appellant's objection to it.</p>\n<p>The appellant also objected to the prosecutor's assertion that the appellant told the FBI agents \"that he viewed five `Vicki willing' files.\" He protests that this statement was inconsistent with Agent De Lair's testimony that the appellant had stated that \"there were approximately five videos associated with the `Vicki willing' link.\" That testimony, the appellant says, did not clearly indicate that he actually viewed the videos. The appellant's complaint, however, overlooks entirely testimony from Agent Zinn, who stated that the appellant \"estimated that he <i>saw</i> about approximately five videos that were related to `Vicki willing.'\" Agent Zinn's testimony made multiple references to videos and images that the appellant told him that he \"saw\" and included descriptions of the contents of these files, indicating that the appellant had actually viewed them. The prosecutor's statement regarding the \"Vicki\" videos was thus a fair characterization of the agents' testimony, taken in context.</p>\n<p>Viewed against this backdrop, the appellant's objection was appropriately overruled.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Unpreserved Claims.</i> We can deal swiftly with the remainder of the challenged statements (which we review only for plain error). To establish plain error, an appellant must make four showings: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). He must satisfy all of these requirements in order to obtain relief. <i>Sánchez-Berríos,</i> 424 F.3d at 73. This is a daunting standard: \"under plain error review, we have leeway to correct only the most egregious of unpreserved errors.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>When determining whether alleged prosecutorial misstatements sink to the level of plain error, we evaluate the statements within the context of the case as a whole. <i>United States v. Morales-Cartagena,</i> 987 F.2d 849, 854 (1st Cir. 1993). We will intervene only if a statement \"so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>United States v. Mejia-Lozano,</i> 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir.1987)). \"We are guided in making this determination by a number of factors, including the frequency and deliberateness of the prosecutor's comments, the strength and clarity of the trial judge's instructions, and the strength of the government's case against the defendant.\" <i>Morales-Cartagena,</i> 987 F.2d at 854.</p>\n<p>We need not recount in detail the statements about which the appellant now complains. For present purposes, it suffices to say that we have reviewed each of them in the context of the record as a whole. Most involve instances in which the prosecutor asked jurors to draw inferences from the evidence. It is eminently proper for a prosecutorlike any other lawyerto attempt to persuade the jury to draw reasonable inferences favorable to her case. <i>United States v. O'Shea,</i> 426 F.3d 475, 485 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Hamie,</i> 165 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.1999). With one possible exception, the challenged statements fell within this safe harbor.</p>\n<p>The only statement that requires specific comment involves a misquotation of the appellant's voicemail message. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> prosecutor told the jury that in this message the appellant said, \"I got caught. I'm sorry.\" Those precise words were never spoken. At best the prosecutor's account was a rough paraphrase of what the appellant had said.</p>\n<p>There is nothing in the record, however, to indicate that this misquotation was deliberate. Moreover, the likelihood of harm was minuscule. A recording of the voicemail message was introduced into evidence, and the jury took it into the jury room. This is particularly important because the court instructed the jurors that the statements of counsel were not evidence but, rather, that their recollection of the evidence, not the lawyers' recollections, should control. We have noted before, and today reaffirm, that such a prophylactic instruction is a significant safeguard against an advocate's tendency to confuse what a witness actually said with what he wished the witness had said. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 447 F.3d 28, 36 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Morales-Cartagena,</i> 987 F.2d at 855.</p>\n<p>In the circumstances of this case, we discern nothing approximating plain error. There is no realistic possibility that this isolated comment made the slightest difference in the outcome.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Multiplicity.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, the appellant posits that he is entitled to a new trial on count two because counts one and two of the indictment were multiplicitous. Specifically, he says that the government failed to offer evidence to show that the two video files alleged to have been received on or about October 21, 2006 (each of which was the basis of a discrete count) were downloaded in separate and distinct transactions. Assuming for argument's sake that this challenge remains open,<sup>[3]</sup> it fails on the merits.</p>\n<p>\"A district court's disposition of a Rule 33 motion for a new trial in a criminal case is ordinarily a `judgment call.'\" <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> 504 F.3d 206, 211 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,</i> 489 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.2007)). Such a ruling engenders review for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> Here, however, the appellant's thesis depends on an abstract question of law, which we review de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Huddleston,</i> 194 F.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also </i><i>Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d at 67.</p>\n<p>The rule against multiplicitous prosecutions is grounded in the Double Jeopardy Clause, which \"protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\" <i>Illinois v. Vitale,</i> 447 U.S. 410, 415, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980) (quoting <i>North Carolina v. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969)). When an indictment includes multiple counts charging a violation of the same statutory provision and a claim of multiplicity is raised, an inquiring court must determine whether the facts undergirding each count can be treated as a distinct unit of prosecution. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hinkeldey,</i> 626 F.3d 1010, 1013 (8th Cir.2010); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. LeMoure,</i> 474 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir.2007) (observing, with respect to claim of multiplicity, that \"[m]ultiple punishments for the same offense ... are permissible if the legislature so intended\"). \"The critical inquiry is whether Congress intended to punish each statutory violation separately.\" <i>Jeffers v. United States,</i> 432 U.S. 137, 155, 97 S.Ct. 2207, 53 L.Ed.2d 168 (1977).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> Counts one and two both charged the appellant with attempted receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), which makes it unlawful to \"knowingly receive[] ... any visual depiction\" involving \"the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\"<sup>[4]</sup> The record contains no evidence that might establish that the two files at issue here were received in separate and distinct transactions. The government appears to concede that the allowable unit of prosecution for the appellant's attempted receipt of videos containing child pornography, on a single day and without proof of multiple transactions, is one, not two. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Polouizzi,</i> 564 F.3d 142, 158 (2d Cir.2009) (concluding that the rule of lenity requires that a person who receives multiple prohibited images in a single transaction can only be charged with one violation under section 2252(a)(2)). Thus, there is a credible basis for a multiplicity claim.</p>\n<p>The potential for such a claim dissipated, however, once the jury acquitted the appellant on count one and convicted him on count two. This split decision eliminated any prospect of double jeopardy. That makes a dispositive difference.</p>\n<p>The appellant attempts to blunt the impact of this split decision by suggesting that, had the district court recognized the multiplicity concern when that concern was first voiced (at the close of the government's case in chief), the government would have been compelled to elect between counts one and twoand it might have guessed wrong as to which count it should jettison. This suggestion misses the mark.</p>\n<p>There is no inflexible rule that the exclusive remedy for multiplicitous counts is election between them. <i>See </i><i>Ball v. United States,</i> 470 U.S. 856, 864, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 84 L.Ed.2d 740 (1985). Requiring election is one option, but not the only option; the court may, for example, simply vacate both the conviction and the sentence as to all but one count, essentially merging the offending counts. <i>See, e.g., id.; </i><i>United States v. Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d 300, 306 (1st Cir.1992). This flexible approach makes good sense because \"the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.\" <i>United States v. Josephberg,</i> 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the appellant was convicted and sentenced on only one of the two purportedly multiplicitous counts. Consequently, his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause were not infracted. <i>See id.</i> That fact is fatal to the thesis that he advances here: a multiplicity claim is necessarily premised on double jeopardy concerns, and where such concerns have been eliminated, the multiplicity claim evaporates. The court below did not err in denying the appellant's motion for a new trial predicated on this ground.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, the appellant's challenges come to naught.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Hon. David H.

BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>On March 19, 2008, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment that charged the appellant with two counts of attempted receipt of child pornography, 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2), (b)(1), and one count of knowing possession of child pornography, <i>id.</i> § 2252(a)(4)(B). We rehearse the relevant facts through the prism of the ensuing trial. The government's case relied in large part on testimony from agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Byron Mitchell, a member of the FBI's cyber crime unit, related that, on December 19, 2006, he mounted an online undercover investigation. To that end, he availed himself of LimeWire, a commercially available peer-to-peer networking program that allows file-sharing between unrelated computers. He entered a search term (\"Lolita\") that he knew to be favored by individuals who fancied child pornography. His query returned a number of files available for download, each associated with a particular Internet protocol (IP) address.</p>\n<p>Because some of the file names were suggestive of child pornography, Mitchell activated LimeWire's \"browse the host\" function, which allowed him to view all of the files available for download from a particular user's \"shared files\" folder. Several of the revealed files contained words that Mitchell, an experienced agent, knew to be associated with child pornography. He downloaded a number of those files from that user's folder and confirmed that some appeared to contain child pornography. He then traced the associated IP address directly to the appellant.</p>\n<p>At that point, another FBI agent, Sarah De Lair, took charge. After performing some preliminary investigation of her own, she obtained a search warrant for the appellant's home. On April 10, 2007, De Lair, accompanied by other law enforcement personnel, executed the warrant.</p>\n<p>De Lair testified that when she knocked on the door, identified herself, and announced that she had a search warrant, the appellant permitted entry. Following a protective sweep, De Lair and another FBI agent, Bryan Zinn, conversed with the appellant. De Lair explained that the agents would be searching the premises for evidence of child pornography and advised the appellant of his <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>See </i><i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 444, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1602</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966). The appellant replied that he understood his rights and signed a written waiver to that effect.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> De Lair proceeded to question the appellant. The interview was not recorded, nor was the appellant ever asked to sign a written statement. The agents' version of the interview follows.</p>\n<p>The appellant told De Lair that he, his sister, and his fiancée all used the computers that were on the premises and that these computers held a goodly amount of child pornography (at least 15 files). He initially stated that he did not intentionally download any child pornography. He acknowledged, however, that he had opened suspiciously titled files obtained through LimeWire because he was curious about whether the file names reflected the actual contents of the files.</p>\n<p>He claimed that he had used the LimeWire program to search for images of the World Trade Center. After downloading some such images, he clicked on a link entitled \"Vicki willing\" and watched a video of a young girl, eight to nine years of age, who was naked and engaged in a sexual act with an adult. The girl, he observed, was \"not doing anything good.\" The appellant estimated that he saw approximately five videos related to \"Vicki willing.\"</p>\n<p>In the course of the interview, the appellant admitted to using search terms such as \"Lolita\" and \"young preteen.\" He also admitted that those searches yielded files that depicted prepubescent children, approximately seven or eight years old, \"not doing anything good.\" He acknowledged that he knew children were involved in child pornography and that he could tell if someone was less than 17 years of age. When De Lair showed him the titles of the two files containing child pornography that Agent Mitchell had downloaded and descriptions of their contents, the appellant stated that he recognized the titles but not the descriptions. Queried about whether he was \"attracted\" to child pornography, the appellant said that he was uncomfortable with the term \"attracted\" but admitted that he had been \"interested\" in child pornography (specifically, images depicting seven-to-ten-year-old children) for at least a year. Elaborating on this point, he noted that he looked at pornographic images of children three or four times per week and that he downloaded five to six such images once or twice per week.</p>\n<p>As fruits of the search, the agents seized two computers. A forensic examination of one computer's hard drive revealed, among other files containing child pornography in the appellant's LimeWire shared files folder, the two videos that Agent Mitchell had downloaded. These two video files, each of which forms the basis for a separate count in the indictment, bore a creation date of October 21, 2006.</p>\n<p>Nearly a year after the search, Agent De Lair tried to interview the appellant's sister at the sister's residence. By happenstance, she encountered the appellant, who told her that if he had known either that it was wrong or that anyone was watching, he would not have downloaded the files. Later, he left a voice message for De Lair, in which he indicated that he had made a mistake by having the materials on his computer. The government introduced a recording of this voice message at trial.</p>\n<p>The appellant testified in his own defense. His account of these interactions diverged from the agents' accounts in some respects. We summarize portions of his version of what he told the agents.</p>\n<p>The appellant maintained that he had used LimeWire to search for adult pornography and sometimes would (inadvertently) come across child pornography. If he opened a video that turned out to be child pornography, he would click out of it. While he admitted using search terms like <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> \"Lolita,\" he did not understand them to be associated with child pornography. He viewed the video entitled \"Vicki willing\" and clicked out of it. He did not, however, delete it. He never searched for child pornography or intentionally downloaded any child pornography.</p>\n<p>The appellant did admit to having told the agents that there was child pornography on his computer, but explained that there were also other items on the computer that he did not want and had not sought. He denied having said that he was interested in child pornography. He had used LimeWire for only about a year, three or four times a week, and would download five or six \"search terms\" per week,<sup>[1]</sup> but without any intention of searching for, or downloading, child pornography. He denied having told Agent De Lair that he would not have downloaded the images in question had he known either that it was wrong or that someone was watching. Finally, he tried to explain away the \"mistake\" voicemail; he had meant to say \"I made a mistake by having the child pornography on the computer, but not intentionally.\"</p>\n<p>Faced with this chiaroscuro record, the jury found the appellant guilty of one count of attempted receipt of child pornography (count two) and one count of possession of child pornography (count three), and acquitted him on the other attempted receipt count (count one). Prior to the submission of the case to the jury, the appellant had moved for a judgment of acquittal as to count two. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 29(a). He renewed that motion post-verdict, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c), and he simultaneously moved for a new trial, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a). The district court denied both motions, and on January 6, 2010, sentenced the appellant to a five-year incarcerative term. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>The appellant has briefed four claims of error. For ease in exposition, we divide our analysis into segments that correspond to these claims. We start with the one claim that seeks acquittal and then assay the three claims that seek the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellant contends that, as to count two, the evidence was insufficient to prove the offense's knowledge and interstate commerce elements. We address these contentions sequentially. First, however, we rehearse the standard of review.</p>\n<p>We assess preserved challenges to evidentiary sufficiency de novo, considering the evidence in the light most agreeable to the verdict. <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Vélez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18\"><a href=\"/opinion/18/united-states-v-rodriguez-velez/\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir. 2010). Our appraisal is aimed at determining whether on this view of the record a reasonable juror could conclude that the government proved each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2781</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span> (1979); <i>United States v. Troy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174119\"><a href=\"/opinion/174119/united-states-v-troy/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>1. <i>Knowledge.</i> The appellant contends that the government failed to introduce evidence sufficient to establish that he knew, when he received the relevant video file, that it depicted real minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. This contention operates at three different but overlapping levels.</p>\n<p>First, the appellant tries to engraft an extra layer of mens rea onto the offense. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> In his view, the government, by charging that he \"knowingly attempted to receive\" the images, had to prove that he knew the character of the material at the very moment of its acquisition. He insists that when he downloaded the file, he was aware only of its title, and he refers to testimony presented at trial for the proposition that titles do not always reliably indicate a file's actual contents. The appellant believes that this testimony demonstrates that he could not have known the video's actual contents on the basis of its name alone and therefore could not knowingly have attempted to receive it.</p>\n<p>This argument is belied by the language of section 2252(a)(2), which criminalizes the knowing receipt of child pornography. We simply do not see how incorporating the statutory language into the charging document could have elevated the necessary proof beyond the elements required by the statute itself.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the second level of the argument. To prove attempt, the government must show both that the accused intended to commit the underlying substantive offense (here, knowing receipt of child pornography) and that he took a substantial step toward committing that crime. <i>United States v. Gobbi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202578\"><a href=\"/opinion/202578/united-states-v-gobbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir.2006). But this does not mean that the government bore a burden to prove each element of the underlying offense. While the underlying offense in this case requires the receipt of images of real-life minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, <i>see </i><i>United States v. McNealy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"178853\"><a href=\"/opinion/178853/united-states-v-mcnealy/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span>, 870 &amp; nn. 47-48 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing <i>United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117881\"><a href=\"/opinion/117881/united-states-v-x-citement-video-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 78, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117881\"><a href=\"/opinion/117881/united-states-v-x-citement-video-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117881\"><a href=\"/opinion/117881/united-states-v-x-citement-video-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span> (1994)), the government in an \"attempt\" case has no burden to prove that the appellant knew that the downloaded file actually contained such images. Rather, the government is required to prove that the appellant <i>believed</i> that the received file contained such images. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bauer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180247\"><a href=\"/opinion/180247/united-states-v-bauer/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1008 (8th Cir.2010). No other view of the relevant threshold of proof comports with the Supreme Court's reasoning in <i>United States v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145810\"><a href=\"/opinion/145810/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145810\"><a href=\"/opinion/145810/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1830</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145810\"><a href=\"/opinion/145810/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span> (2008), in which the Court explained that \"[t]here is no First Amendment exception from the general principle of criminal law that a person attempting to commit a crime need not be exonerated because he has a mistaken view of the facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 304, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145810\"><a href=\"/opinion/145810/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1830</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The third layer of the appellant's argument rests on the district court's jury instructions. Contrary to what the statute of conviction requires, the court told the jury that \"the government has to prove not just that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally, not by mistake, received a depiction, a video, but that he knew at the time of receipt that the production of that video involved the use of a real minor and that the video showed a real minor.\" This instruction plainly overstates the government's burden.</p>\n<p>In circumstances where, as here, a district court overstates the government's burden of proof to the defendant's benefit in its charge to the jury, a reviewing court faced with a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence must measure that challenge against the correct legal standard, not against the erroneous standard set forth in the charge. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bayes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198897\"><a href=\"/opinion/198897/united-states-v-bayes/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir. 2000). With the correct standard as our metric, we conclude that the evidence, taken in the light most agreeable to the verdict, is sufficient to ground the conviction.</p>\n<p>\"[A] showing of scienter ... can (and often will) be made through circumstantial evidence.\" <i>United States v. Hussein,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200713\"><a href=\"/opinion/200713/united-states-v-hussein/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2003). Here, the jury heard testimony from two FBI agents confirming that, by his own admission, the appellant deliberately used search terms associated with child pornography (such as \"Lolita\" and \"young preteen\") when trolling on LimeWire. This evidence is significant because a defendant's use of search terms associated with child pornography can support a finding that he knew that the images retrieved contained child pornography. <i>See </i><i>McNealy,</i> 625 F.3d at 870-71. Such an inference is strengthened in this case by the appellant's statement to the agents that those searches yielded videos of children, approximately seven or eight years old, \"not doing anything good.\" In addition, the appellant admitted to the agents that he had had an interest in child pornography for about a year and that he had looked at child pornography three or four times a week, downloading five to six images containing child pornography once or twice a week. Nor was this all. The title of the file that underbraced count two was highly suggestive of child pornography.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Taking this tapestry of facts as a whole, we believe that the jury reasonably could have inferred that the appellant, having seen the name of the file, proceeded to download it; and that when he did so, he was seeking to acquire child pornography. Thus, the evidence supports a finding that the appellant acted \"knowingly\" with respect to count two.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Interstate Commerce.</i> The appellant's complaint that the government failed to prove the \"interstate commerce\" element of the offense of convictionthat is, that the video file he attempted to receive traveled in interstate commerce is squarely foreclosed by circuit precedent. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lewis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203652\"><a href=\"/opinion/203652/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2009). In <i>Lewis,</i> we held that \"the government proved the images traveled interstate when it introduced evidence that [the defendant] received images that were transmitted over the Internet.\" <i>Id.</i> at 215. Given that the video file underlying count two in this case was also transmitted over the Internet, the holding in <i>Lewis</i> is of decretory significance.</p>\n<p>For the most part, newly constituted panels in a federal appellate court are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point. <i>Troy,</i> 618 F.3d at 35; <i>United States v. Rodríguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203311\"><a href=\"/opinion/203311/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1449 (1st Cir.1991). Although this permutation of the doctrine of stare decisis does not constitute an \"immutable rule,\" <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198969\"><a href=\"/opinion/198969/ma-carpenters-coll-v-us-fidelity-guar/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 142 (1st Cir.2000), it is subject to only a few \"narrowly cabined exceptions,\" <i>Troy,</i> 618 F.3d at 36; <i>San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150718\"><a href=\"/opinion/150718/san-juan-cable-llc-v-puerto-rico-telephone/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2010). To be specific, a departure from circuit precedent is warranted only where the previous holding is \"contradicted by controlling authority, subsequently announced (say, a decision of the authoring court en banc, a Supreme Court opinion directly on point, or a legislative overruling),\" <i>Rodríguez,</i> 527 F.3d at 225, or in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind,\" <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 592 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>The appellant offers no serious claim that any of the exceptions to the law of the circuit rule applies. While he points to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> <i>United States v. Schaefer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169725\"><a href=\"/opinion/169725/united-states-v-schaefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span>, 1200-01 (10th Cir.2007), to suggest that our holding in <i>Lewis</i> is incorrect, the Tenth Circuit's decision in <i>Schaefer</i> predates <i>Lewis.</i> Consequently, it does not trigger any of the isthmian exceptions to the law of the circuit rule.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. The holding in <i>Lewis</i>that evidence showing that images were received via the Internet is sufficient to satisfy the interstate commerce element under 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2)applies here. Hence, the evidence of the appellant's use of the Internet to procure files via LimeWire is sufficient to ground a finding that the interstate commerce element of the offense was satisfied.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Exclusion of Expert Testimony.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>During pretrial proceedings, the government moved to exclude certain expert testimony that the appellant proposed to present at trial. This testimony was to come from a forensic psychologist, Dr. Carol Ball. Her report stated in pertinent part that the appellant was \"free of major mental illness, antisocial personality traits, and sexual deviance\" and was \"not a pedophile or sexual psychopath.\" The parties sharply disagreed about the admissibility of this testimony: the appellant asserted that it was relevant because it \"demonstrates the absence of motive for the alleged crimes\"; the government asserted that it was not relevant to any element of the charged crimes. The district court found that the proffered testimony might be relevant but that its relevance was \"outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues or misleading the jury.\" Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the court granted the motion in limine. It later denied a motion for reconsideration. The appellant assigns error to the exclusion of this testimony.</p>\n<p>We review a trial court's decision to exclude evidence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Stierhoff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203577\"><a href=\"/opinion/203577/united-states-v-stierhoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Zaccaria,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199272\"><a href=\"/opinion/199272/united-states-v-zaccaria/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir.2001). This deferential standard normally precludes us from substituting our judgment for that of the district court absent an obvious mistake. <i>Torres-Arroyo v. Rullán,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202017\"><a href=\"/opinion/202017/torres-arroyo-v-rullan/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2006). Within this rubric, abstract legal questions are reviewed de novo with the understanding that a material error of law is always an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197800\"><a href=\"/opinion/197800/united-states-v-snyder/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>In this case the expert witness, Dr. Ball, was prepared to testify that the appellant did not have major mental illness, antisocial personality traits, sexual deviance, or prurient interest in children of any age. The appellant advances three related objections to the exclusion of her testimony. He asseverates that the court applied an incorrect legal standard, that it undervalued the probative worth of the proffered evidence while simultaneously overvaluing its potential as a source of jury confusion, and that the order in limine infringed on his constitutionally assured right to present a defense. We examine each component of this asseverational array.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Rule 403 Standard.</i> The appellant's plaint that the district court failed to apply the correct legal standard does not withstand scrutiny. This plaint focuses on language in Rule 403 that states: \"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury....\" The appellant suggests that the district court skewed this standard by considering whether the prejudicial effect of the evidence merely outweighed its probative value, rather than whether the former <i>substantially</i> outweighed the latter. This <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> argument rests almost exclusively on the court's statement, in the order granting the motion in limine, that the evidence's \"probative value is outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues or misleading the jury.\" To the appellant's way of thinking, the court's failure to use the modifying adverb \"substantially\" reflects that it applied an incorrect standard.</p>\n<p>We disagree. Elsewhere in the same order, the court quoted the pertinent language of Rule 403, correctly describing the \"substantially outweighed\" benchmark. Nothing in the court's discussion indicates that it ignored that articulated standard when balancing the competing interests and deciding to exclude Dr. Ball's testimony. Where, as here, a court's fidelity to the proper legal standard is fairly discernable from the whole of an order, we will not infer the worst from a misspoken word or misplaced phrase. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Pelletier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796023\"><a href=\"/opinion/796023/united-states-v-joseph-pellether/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 204 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611562\"><a href=\"/opinion/611562/daniel-lenn-etc-v-portland-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span>, 1088 (1st Cir.1993). So long as its overall meaning is clear, each word of a court's decision need not be precise to the point of pedantry.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Balancing.</i> We turn next to the appellant's claim that the district court miscalibrated the balance between probative value and potential jury confusion. To begin, evidence that bears on the question of motive ordinarily has some probative value in a criminal case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. MacPherson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791968\"><a href=\"/opinion/791968/united-states-v-william-macpherson/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 185 n. 2 (2d Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199997\"><a href=\"/opinion/199997/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 100 (1st Cir.2002). The district court recognized this connection, stating that evidence of the appellant's \"lack of interest in images of children makes it somewhat less likely that he was searching for child pornography.\" On the same basis, the proffered testimony had some probative value with respect to the issue of intent. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Varoudakis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199172\"><a href=\"/opinion/199172/united-states-v-varoudakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 120 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[P]roof of motive must be offered to show some other element, for example, ... the accused's requisite mental state.\")</p>\n<p>Here, however, the appropriate analysis is more nuanced. In enacting the federal child pornography statute, Congress proscribed certain conduct without regard to the underlying motive. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Dyer,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></span>, 529 (1st Cir.2009); <i>United States v. Matthews,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768331\"><a href=\"/opinion/768331/united-states-v-lawrence-charles-matthews-aka-mrmature-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">338</span></a></span>, 350-52 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, other courts have upheld evidentiary rulings excluding evidence of lack of motive in cases brought under the statute of conviction. Of particular note is <i>United States v. Wallenfang,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1459445\"><a href=\"/opinion/1459445/united-states-v-wallenfang/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span> (8th Cir.2009), in which the Eighth Circuit upheld the exclusion of expert testimony about the defendant's psychosexual proclivities, offered to show lack of motive, because his motive for possessing child pornography was \"immaterial and irrelevant\" and the relevant inquiry was instead \"whether, on their face, [the pictures] appear to be of a sexual character.\" <i>Id.</i> at 660 (quoting <i>United States v. Kemmerling,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777127\"><a href=\"/opinion/777127/united-states-v-david-kemmerling/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, 646 (8th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p>In this case, the relevant images plainly appeared to be child pornography. Moreover, the appellant admitted possessing them. The key question, then, centered on his intent, that is, whether he <i>knowingly</i> received and possessed them. Under these circumstances, the proffered testimony was of diminished relevance. The district court appears to have appreciated this distinction, noting the likelihood that Dr. Ball's testimony, if admitted, might well \"shift attention away from [a] key questionwhether defendant had knowledge of the contents of the videosto a wholly irrelevant onewhether or not he is a pedophile.\" While the two inquiries are more intertwined than the district court's analysis might suggest, we agree <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> that the proposed testimony was likely to confuse the jury and divert its attention from the central question in the case.</p>\n<p>The fact that the excluded evidence took the form of expert testimony figures conspicuously in the decisional calculus. Qualified expert witnesses generally may offer opinion testimony if that testimony \"will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Fed.R.Evid. 702. But expert testimony remains subject to exclusion under Rule 403. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Montas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195767\"><a href=\"/opinion/195767/united-states-v-felix-montas/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 783 (1st Cir.1994). Indeed, such evidence presents a special level of complexity in constructing the balance between probative value and unfairly prejudicial effect. This complexity arises out of the concern that, because of an expert's stature <i>qua</i> expert, jurors may assign more weight to expert testimony than it deserves. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez-Berríos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203923\"><a href=\"/opinion/203923/united-states-v-rodriguez-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2009). Because such testimony can carry with it an unwarranted \"aura of special reliability and trustworthiness,\" <i>United States v. Fosher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362769\"><a href=\"/opinion/362769/united-states-v-michael-p-fosher/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 383 (1st Cir.1979), courts must guard against letting it intrude in areas that jurors, by dint of common experience, are uniquely competent to judge without the aid of experts. This concern, where pertinent, should legitimately factor into a trial court's Rule 403 analysis. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Montas,</i> 41 F.3d at 784.</p>\n<p>So it is here. The intent issue in this case presents the type of judgment that jurors historically have made without the assistance of expert testimony. It follows, we think, that the proffered testimony presented a special risk of jury confusion.</p>\n<p>In arguing against exclusion, the appellant relies heavily on <i>United States v. Shay,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196160\"><a href=\"/opinion/196160/united-states-v-shay/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995), in which we concluded that the district court erred in excluding, under Rule 702, expert testimony from a psychiatrist who was prepared to testify that the defendant suffered from a recognized mental disorder that caused him to tell self-aggrandizing lies in order to place himself at the center of attention. <i>Id.</i> at 129-30, 133-34. But <i>Shay</i> and the case at hand are not fair congeners. First, the court in <i>Shay</i> focused on Rule 702, not Rule 403. Secondand more importantthe proffers in the two cases were quite different. In <i>Shay,</i> the expert testimony, if believed, would have exculpated the defendant, conclusively explaining away what appeared to be damning admissions on which the government's case relied. <i>See id.</i> at 133. In this case, however, the proffered expert testimony was much more peripheral; at best, it may have borne on the appellant's lack of motive and thus, indirectly, on the question of whether he had the level of knowledge required by the statute. A jury, accepting everything that Dr. Ball had to say, could very well have convicted the appellant anyway.</p>\n<p>\"Where (as here) a piece of evidence is determined to be relevant, the district court has wide discretion in steadying the Rule 403 seesaw.\" <i>Onujiogu v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487236\"><a href=\"/opinion/487236/anne-onujiogu-etc-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">817</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1987). \"Only rarelyand in extraordinarily compelling circumstanceswill we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Freeman v. Package Mach. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517427\"><a href=\"/opinion/517427/49-fair-emplpraccas-1139-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38456-27-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1340 (1st Cir.1988). Whether the danger of jury confusion here substantially outweighs the probative value of Dr. Ball's testimony is fairly debatable, but the very closeness of the question favors the district court's reconciliation of the competing centrifugal and centripetal forces. Consequently, this is not one of the rare cases in which appellate intervention is justified. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> Given the circumstances of this case, the district court's ruling was within the universe of reasonable decisions and, thus, was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Constitutional Claim.</i> It is a bedrock principle that a criminal defendant's right \"to offer witnesses in his defense is a fundamental component of due process.\" <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202905\"><a href=\"/opinion/202905/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2007) (citing <i>Washington v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107481\"><a href=\"/opinion/107481/washington-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107481\"><a href=\"/opinion/107481/washington-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span> (1967)). But \"the mere assertion of that right does not automatically and inevitably ensure the admissibility of the proffered testimony.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Taylor v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111986\"><a href=\"/opinion/111986/taylor-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 414-15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111986\"><a href=\"/opinion/111986/taylor-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span> (1988)). In particular, the right to present a defense does not trump valid rules of evidence.</p>\n<p>Here, our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the proffered expert testimony undermines the appellant's constitutional claim. This exclusionary decision fell within the ambit of discretion afforded under Rule 403. The appellant has not developed any argument that meaningfully distinguishes his constitutional claim from his more generic assertion, previously rejected, that the district court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Ball's testimony. Nor does he argue that Rule 403 itself offends the Constitution.</p>\n<p>To say more about this claim would be supererogatory. We hold, without serious question, that the exclusion of the evidence did not abridge the appellant's constitutional right to present a defense. <i>See </i><i>Rodríguez-Berríos,</i> 573 F.3d at 72 n. 16.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Prosecutorial Misconduct.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellant argues that prosecutorial misstatements during closing argument entitle him to a new trial. He lodged contemporaneous objections to only two of the statements that he identifies. As to those two statements, our review is de novo. <i>United States v. Ayala-García,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203928\"><a href=\"/opinion/203928/united-states-v-ayala-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2009). The remainder of the statements engender review for plain error. <i>United States v. Sánchez-Berríos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201833\"><a href=\"/opinion/201833/united-states-v-sanchez-berrios/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2005). We therefore analyze the statements in two groups.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Preserved Claims.</i> During the summation, the appellant objected to the following statement by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]n this case knowing possession is essentially conceded. In the opening statement by defense counsel and in defendant's own words, he told you he knew he had child pornography on his computer.</blockquote>\n<p>The appellant protests that this assertion erroneously equates \"knowing\" in the colloquial sense of \"being aware\" with the legal definition that applies to the charges brought in this case.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor's statement must be evaluated in conjunction with the law applicable to the case. To be found guilty of knowing possession, an individual need only have known that there was child pornography on his computer yet declined to delete it. <i>United States v. Carani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1447430\"><a href=\"/opinion/1447430/united-states-v-carani/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 875 (7th Cir.2007). He need not know the material's character at the moment that he downloads it, as long as he thereafter learns its character and nevertheless retains it. <i>Id.</i> Evidence of a defendant's awareness that computer files contain child pornography is adequate to show that he knowingly possessed that material. <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199515\"><a href=\"/opinion/199515/united-states-v-hilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>In the instant case, the appellant admitted that he was aware that there were files containing child pornography on his computer and that at least some of them had not been deleted. The prosecutor's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> statement was, therefore, an accurate rendition of both the law and the record. Consequently, the district court did not err in overruling the appellant's objection to it.</p>\n<p>The appellant also objected to the prosecutor's assertion that the appellant told the FBI agents \"that he viewed five `Vicki willing' files.\" He protests that this statement was inconsistent with Agent De Lair's testimony that the appellant had stated that \"there were approximately five videos associated with the `Vicki willing' link.\" That testimony, the appellant says, did not clearly indicate that he actually viewed the videos. The appellant's complaint, however, overlooks entirely testimony from Agent Zinn, who stated that the appellant \"estimated that he <i>saw</i> about approximately five videos that were related to `Vicki willing.'\" Agent Zinn's testimony made multiple references to videos and images that the appellant told him that he \"saw\" and included descriptions of the contents of these files, indicating that the appellant had actually viewed them. The prosecutor's statement regarding the \"Vicki\" videos was thus a fair characterization of the agents' testimony, taken in context.</p>\n<p>Viewed against this backdrop, the appellant's objection was appropriately overruled.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Unpreserved Claims.</i> We can deal swiftly with the remainder of the challenged statements (which we review only for plain error). To establish plain error, an appellant must make four showings: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). He must satisfy all of these requirements in order to obtain relief. <i>Sánchez-Berríos,</i> 424 F.3d at 73. This is a daunting standard: \"under plain error review, we have leeway to correct only the most egregious of unpreserved errors.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>When determining whether alleged prosecutorial misstatements sink to the level of plain error, we evaluate the statements within the context of the case as a whole. <i>United States v. Morales-Cartagena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601780\"><a href=\"/opinion/601780/united-states-v-angel-luis-morales-cartagena-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, 854 (1st Cir. 1993). We will intervene only if a statement \"so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 977 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>United States v. Mejia-Lozano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494593\"><a href=\"/opinion/494593/united-states-v-martha-mejia-lozano/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 274 (1st Cir.1987)). \"We are guided in making this determination by a number of factors, including the frequency and deliberateness of the prosecutor's comments, the strength and clarity of the trial judge's instructions, and the strength of the government's case against the defendant.\" <i>Morales-Cartagena,</i> 987 F.2d at 854.</p>\n<p>We need not recount in detail the statements about which the appellant now complains. For present purposes, it suffices to say that we have reviewed each of them in the context of the record as a whole. Most involve instances in which the prosecutor asked jurors to draw inferences from the evidence. It is eminently proper for a prosecutorlike any other lawyerto attempt to persuade the jury to draw reasonable inferences favorable to her case. <i>United States v. O'Shea,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201866\"><a href=\"/opinion/201866/united-states-v-oshea/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></a></span>, 485 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Hamie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198286\"><a href=\"/opinion/198286/united-states-v-hamie/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.1999). With one possible exception, the challenged statements fell within this safe harbor.</p>\n<p>The only statement that requires specific comment involves a misquotation of the appellant's voicemail message. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> prosecutor told the jury that in this message the appellant said, \"I got caught. I'm sorry.\" Those precise words were never spoken. At best the prosecutor's account was a rough paraphrase of what the appellant had said.</p>\n<p>There is nothing in the record, however, to indicate that this misquotation was deliberate. Moreover, the likelihood of harm was minuscule. A recording of the voicemail message was introduced into evidence, and the jury took it into the jury room. This is particularly important because the court instructed the jurors that the statements of counsel were not evidence but, rather, that their recollection of the evidence, not the lawyers' recollections, should control. We have noted before, and today reaffirm, that such a prophylactic instruction is a significant safeguard against an advocate's tendency to confuse what a witness actually said with what he wished the witness had said. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202188\"><a href=\"/opinion/202188/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Morales-Cartagena,</i> 987 F.2d at 855.</p>\n<p>In the circumstances of this case, we discern nothing approximating plain error. There is no realistic possibility that this isolated comment made the slightest difference in the outcome.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Multiplicity.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Finally, the appellant posits that he is entitled to a new trial on count two because counts one and two of the indictment were multiplicitous. Specifically, he says that the government failed to offer evidence to show that the two video files alleged to have been received on or about October 21, 2006 (each of which was the basis of a discrete count) were downloaded in separate and distinct transactions. Assuming for argument's sake that this challenge remains open,<sup>[3]</sup> it fails on the merits.</p>\n<p>\"A district court's disposition of a Rule 33 motion for a new trial in a criminal case is ordinarily a `judgment call.'\" <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202977\"><a href=\"/opinion/202977/united-states-v-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 211 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>United States v.

Such a ruling engenders review for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> Here, however, the appellant's thesis depends on an abstract question of law, which we review de novo. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Huddleston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766478\"><a href=\"/opinion/766478/united-states-v-mark-e-huddleston/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 218 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also </i><i>Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d at 67.</p>\n<p>The rule against multiplicitous prosecutions is grounded in the Double Jeopardy Clause, which \"protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\" <i>Illinois v.

When an indictment includes multiple counts charging a violation of the same statutory provision and a claim of multiplicity is raised, an inquiring court must determine whether the facts undergirding each count can be treated as a distinct unit of prosecution. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hinkeldey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180426\"><a href=\"/opinion/180426/united-states-v-hinkeldey/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span>, 1013 (8th Cir.2010); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v.

The government appears to concede that the allowable unit of prosecution for the appellant's attempted receipt of videos containing child pornography, on a single day and without proof of multiple transactions, is one, not two. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Polouizzi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1192491\"><a href=\"/opinion/1192491/united-states-v-polouizzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span>, 158 (2d Cir.2009) (concluding that the rule of lenity requires that a person who receives multiple prohibited images in a single transaction can only be charged with one violation under section 2252(a)(2)). Thus, there is a credible basis for a multiplicity claim.</p>\n<p>The potential for such a claim dissipated, however, once the jury acquitted the appellant on count one and convicted him on count two. This split decision eliminated any prospect of double jeopardy. That makes a dispositive difference.</p>\n<p>The appellant attempts to blunt the impact of this split decision by suggesting that, had the district court recognized the multiplicity concern when that concern was first voiced (at the close of the government's case in chief), the government would have been compelled to elect between counts one and twoand it might have guessed wrong as to which count it should jettison. This suggestion misses the mark.</p>\n<p>There is no inflexible rule that the exclusive remedy for multiplicitous counts is election between them. <i>See </i><i>Ball v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111384\"><a href=\"/opinion/111384/ball-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span>, 864, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111384\"><a href=\"/opinion/111384/ball-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span> (1985). Requiring election is one option, but not the only option; the court may, for example, simply vacate both the conviction and the sentence as to all but one count, essentially merging the offending counts. <i>See, e.g., id.; </i><i>United States v. Lilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 306 (1st Cir.1992). This flexible approach makes good sense because \"the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.\" <i>United States v. Josephberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795357\"><a href=\"/opinion/795357/united-states-v-richard-josephberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 355 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, the appellant was convicted and sentenced on only one of the two purportedly multiplicitous counts. Consequently, his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause were not infracted. <i>See id.</i> That fact is fatal to the thesis that he advances here: a multiplicity claim is necessarily premised on double jeopardy concerns, and where such concerns have been eliminated, the multiplicity claim evaporates. The court below did not err in denying the appellant's motion for a new trial predicated on this ground.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We need go no further.

Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Although this phraseology seems odd, we think that the jury reasonably could have inferred from it that the appellant downloaded the results of five or six searches each week.</p>\n<p>[2]  The file name was: \"cp tvg 13 Bond 10-11-12Yo Childlover Little Collection Video 0039 Girl-Vicky String Bikini Pthc 11Yo Pedofilia.mpg.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  The government asserts that this challenge was waived by the appellant's failure to attack the indictment prior to trial. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). We take no view on the waiver question.</p>\n<p>[4]  Each count also mentions 18 U.S.C. § 2252(b)(1), which criminalizes the attempted violation of section 2252(a)(2). This additional reference is of no consequence in the multiplicity analysis.</p>\n\n</div>",
