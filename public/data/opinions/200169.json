Gibson,   of   the   Eighth   Circuit,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.             This is an appeal from a\n\ndistrict court order to arbitrate a post-expiration grievance that\n\n\"arose under\" the parties' expired collective bargaining agreement.\n\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n            Plaintiff-appellant,       Providence       Journal    Company   (the\n\n\"Journal\"),    publishes     The   Providence      Journal   and    The   Sunday\n\nJournal, newspapers of general circulation in the State of Rhode\n\nIsland and     surrounding    areas.         Defendant-appellee,     Providence\n\nNewspaper     Guild   (the   \"Guild\"),       is   the   exclusive    collective\n\nbargaining representative for certain Journal employees.                     The\n\nJournal and the Guild entered into several successive collective\n\nbargaining agreements, the last of which expired by its terms on\n\nDecember 31, 1999.     The parties later extended that agreement (the\n\n\"1994-1999 Contract\") through January 31, 2000. Because there were\n\nno further extensions, both parties agree that the Contract expired\n\nafter January 31, 2000.\n\n            Article V of the Contract generally creates a grievance\n\narbitration procedure for the resolution of contractual disputes.1\n\nHowever, the Contract is silent as to whether the parties are\n\n\n\n1\n   Article V reads, in relevant part: \"In order that harmonious\nrelations shall continue unbroken between the Parties, any dispute\narising from the interpretation of this contract, disputes\nregarding discharges, discipline, wages and disputes concerning\nemployment or operating conditions [shall be] subject to grievance\narbitration.\"\n\n                                       -2-\n\fobligated to submit disputes to arbitration after the expiration of\n\nthe Contract.\n\n            After expiration of the Contract, in a letter dated\n\nFebruary 8, 2000, the Journal notified the Guild that the dues\n\ncheckoff,      union   security,       and    arbitration   provisions    of    the\n\nContract were no longer valid.               The Guild filed a grievance with\n\nthe Journal on February 11, 2000, eleven days after the expiration\n\nof the Contract, asserting violations of both Article II of the\n\nContract and Memorandum of Agreement No. 8 (\"MOA 8\"), a side\n\nagreement      incorporated    into     the    Contract.     Specifically,      the\n\ngrievance protested the Employer’s unilateral termination of the\n\nparties’ union security and dues checkoff procedures following the\n\nexpiration of the Guild Contracts.\n\n            The    union    security     clause,    detailed   in   Article     II,\n\nSection   5,    required,     as   a   condition    of   employment,     that   the\n\nJournal's employees covered by the Contract be Guild members \"for\n\nthe duration of this Agreement.\"                By the terms of MOA 8,          the\n\nparties negotiated an \"evergreen clause\" intended to ensure the\n\nuninterrupted effectiveness of the union security provision through\n\nthe expiration of the next succeeding agreement.               MOA 8 states in\n\nrelevant part at paragraph 11:\n\n            The provisions of Article II, Section 5 in the\n            News and Advertising Agreements shall be\n            continuously in force, to the extent permitted\n            by law, from the date of this Agreement until\n            expiration   of  the   Collective   Bargaining\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f            Agreement   which    succeeds   the           current\n            Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nThe Guild argued that the Journal’s cancellation of union security\n\nduring the current contractual hiatus was a violation of MOA 8.\n\n            The Guild further protested the Journal’s unilateral\n\ntermination of dues checkoff, asserting a violation of Article II,\n\nSection 4 of the Contract. Appellees argue that this provision, on\n\nits face, contemplated the continued effectiveness of dues checkoff\n\nfollowing   contract     expiration     because   dues   checkoff     required\n\nrevocation by the employee and not the employer.                Specifically,\n\nArticle II, Section 4 provides that this provision \"shall remain in\n\neffect until revoked by the employee . . . but shall be irrevocable\n\nfor a period of one (1) year from the date of the assignment, or\n\nuntil the termination of the collective bargaining agreement,\n\nwhichever occurs sooner.\"\n\n            The Guild ultimately invoked arbitration by a letter\n\ndated March 9, 2000.       The Journal refused to participate in the\n\narbitration of the Guild’s grievance and instead commenced suit in\n\nthe   District   Court    of   Rhode    Island    to   enjoin   the   American\n\nArbitration Association from processing the matter.              The District\n\nCourt held a hearing on March 15, 2001, on the parties' cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment.            The district court granted the\n\nGuild's motion for summary judgment and ordered the Journal to\n\narbitrate the dispute in accordance with the Contract. The Journal\n\nfiled this appeal.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f                                       II.\n\n           Summary    judgment    is    appropriate    where   \"there   is   no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"           Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\nThis Court reviews the district court's entry of summary judgment\n\nde novo, re-examining the facts in the light most amiable to the\n\nunsuccessful party.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Nat'l Tower LLC v.\n\nPlainville Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 297 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n           The expiration of a collective bargaining agreement does\n\nnot   necessarily    extinguish   a    party's   obligation    to   arbitrate\n\ngrievances.   In fact, a presumption favors arbitration in such\n\ncircumstances.      Litton Fin. Printing Div. v. NLRB, 501 U.S. 190,\n\n204 (1991) (finding a presumption in favor of post-expiration\n\narbitration of matters and disputes arising out of the relation\n\ngoverned by the contract unless \"negated expressly or by clear\n\nimplication\") (hereinafter Litton); Nolde Bros., Inc. v. Local No.\n\n358, 430 U.S. 243, 255 (1977) (stating that \"the parties' failure\n\nto exclude from arbitrability contract disputes arising after\n\ntermination . . . affords a basis for concluding that they intended\n\nto arbitrate all grievances\").         We believe that the district court\n\ncorrectly employed this presumption in the present case.\n\n           Much of the district court's decision rests on the\n\nprecise language of the three provisions at issue here.                      The\n\ndistrict court found that, on their face, MOA 8 and the dues\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcheckoff and union security provisions evidenced the parties'\n\nintent, and contractual obligation, to arbitrate all disputes.              A\n\nliteral reading of these provisions, according to the district\n\ncourt,   confirms    that   the   parties    intended   these   benefits   to\n\ncontinue after expiration.        They, thus, \"arose under the contract\"\n\nand satisfy the Litton test for post-expiration arbitrability.2\n\n501   U.S.   at   205-06.    After   further    examining   both   of   these\n\nprovisions, we too believe that they survive expiration of the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.\n\n             A.   Dues Checkoff\n\n             Because Article II, Section 4 clearly contemplates the\n\ncontinued effectiveness of the dues checkoff provision, it is\n\nproperly subject to arbitration.            While employers do not have a\n\nstatutory obligation to continue such dues checkoff once collective\n\nbargaining agreements have expired, such obligations may be imposed\n\nby contract. Frito-Lay, Inc., 243 N.L.R.B. 137, 139 (1979).             Here,\n\nJournal employees \"voluntarily executed checkoff authorizations\n\nwhich expressly contemplated the possibility of periods when no\n\n\n2\n    In Litton, the Court explained:\n\n      A post-expiration grievance can be said to arise under\n      the contract only where it involves facts and occurrences\n      that arose before expiration, where an action taken after\n      expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under\n      the agreement, or where, under normal principles of\n      contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right\n      survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.\n\n501 U.S. at 205-06 (emphasis added).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcontract would be in effect.\"          Id.    This creates a contractual\n\nobligation.      See Lowell Corrugated Container Corp., 177 N.L.R.B.\n\n169, 173 (1969).       Furthermore, \"where, under normal principles of\n\ncontract interpretation the disputed contractual right survives\n\nexpiration of the remainder of the agreement,\" a post expiration\n\ngrievance     is     arbitrable.      Litton,    501     U.S.   at   207-08.\n\nConsequently,       the   dues   checkoff    provision   continues   to   be\n\narbitrable.\n\n            B.     Union Security\n\n            While MOA 8's evergreen clause clearly provides that the\n\nunion security provision remains in force until the subsequent\n\ncontract expires, the parties dispute whether the original contract\n\nwas the one which expired on January 31, 2000 or a prior contract.\n\nThis dispute is central because it determines whether MOA 8 remains\n\nin force or expired on January 31, 2000.          Both parties agree that\n\nthey enacted MOA 8 during the 1994-1996 contract.               However, the\n\nJournal argues that the 1994-1999 Contract was the \"succeeding\"\n\nagreement contemplated by MOA 8, and as such, the evergreen clause\n\nexpired on January 31, 2000.        The Guild, on the other hand, argues\n\nthat the 1994-1999 Contract was a contract extension, rather than\n\na distinct successor agreement. Under this argument, the evergreen\n\nclause does not come into effect until January 31, 2000, when it\n\nprovides union security through the contractual hiatus and any\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fsuccessor agreement.       Since the parties have yet to agree on a\n\nsucceeding contract, it remains in effect.\n\n            Fortunately,    the   language   of   the   1994-1999   Contract\n\nresolves the issue.        The title page of the 1994-1999 Contract\n\ninstructs    that   the    parties’    agreements   are    in   effect   from\n\n\"January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1996 as amended and extended\n\nJanuary 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999.\"               (Emphasis added.)\n\nFurthermore, the preamble of the 1994-1999 Contract further states:\n\n            It is agreed that the Collective Bargaining\n            Agreement dated April 25, 1995, and effective\n            January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1996, is\n            extended in all its terms and conditions,\n            including Side Letters of Agreement, except as\n            provided hereinafter, and this AGREEMENT is\n            made a part hereof.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    It is clear from this language that the parties\n\nintended to extend their existing agreement rather than create a\n\nnew, succeeding, one.       As a result, MOA 8 continues to make the\n\nissue of union security arbitrable.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            For the reasons outlined in the text of this opinion, the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment is affirmed.             Costs are\n\ntaxed against appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f",

Defendant-appellee,     Providence\n\nNewspaper     Guild   (the   \"Guild\"),       is   the   exclusive    collective\n\nbargaining representative for certain Journal employees.                     The\n\nJournal and the Guild entered into several successive collective\n\nbargaining agreements, the last of which expired by its terms on\n\nDecember 31, 1999.     The parties later extended that agreement (the\n\n\"1994-1999 Contract\") through January 31, 2000. Because there were\n\nno further extensions, both parties agree that the Contract expired\n\nafter January 31, 2000.\n\n            Article V of the Contract generally creates a grievance\n\narbitration procedure for the resolution of contractual disputes.1\n\nHowever, the Contract is silent as to whether the parties are\n\n\n\n1\n   Article V reads, in relevant part: \"In order that harmonious\nrelations shall continue unbroken between the Parties, any dispute\narising from the interpretation of this contract, disputes\nregarding discharges, discipline, wages and disputes concerning\nemployment or operating conditions [shall be] subject to grievance\narbitration.\"\n\n                                       -2-\n\fobligated to submit disputes to arbitration after the expiration of\n\nthe Contract.\n\n            After expiration of the Contract, in a letter dated\n\nFebruary 8, 2000, the Journal notified the Guild that the dues\n\ncheckoff,      union   security,       and    arbitration   provisions    of    the\n\nContract were no longer valid.               The Guild filed a grievance with\n\nthe Journal on February 11, 2000, eleven days after the expiration\n\nof the Contract, asserting violations of both Article II of the\n\nContract and Memorandum of Agreement No. 8 (\"MOA 8\"), a side\n\nagreement      incorporated    into     the    Contract.     Specifically,      the\n\ngrievance protested the Employer’s unilateral termination of the\n\nparties’ union security and dues checkoff procedures following the\n\nexpiration of the Guild Contracts.\n\n            The    union    security     clause,    detailed   in   Article     II,\n\nSection   5,    required,     as   a   condition    of   employment,     that   the\n\nJournal's employees covered by the Contract be Guild members \"for\n\nthe duration of this Agreement.\"                By the terms of MOA 8,          the\n\nparties negotiated an \"evergreen clause\" intended to ensure the\n\nuninterrupted effectiveness of the union security provision through\n\nthe expiration of the next succeeding agreement.

Appellees argue that this provision, on\n\nits face, contemplated the continued effectiveness of dues checkoff\n\nfollowing   contract     expiration     because   dues   checkoff     required\n\nrevocation by the employee and not the employer.                Specifically,\n\nArticle II, Section 4 provides that this provision \"shall remain in\n\neffect until revoked by the employee . . . but shall be irrevocable\n\nfor a period of one (1) year from the date of the assignment, or\n\nuntil the termination of the collective bargaining agreement,\n\nwhichever occurs sooner.\"\n\n            The Guild ultimately invoked arbitration by a letter\n\ndated March 9, 2000.

We believe that the district court\n\ncorrectly employed this presumption in the present case.\n\n           Much of the district court's decision rests on the\n\nprecise language of the three provisions at issue here.                      The\n\ndistrict court found that, on their face, MOA 8 and the dues\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcheckoff and union security provisions evidenced the parties'\n\nintent, and contractual obligation, to arbitrate all disputes.              A\n\nliteral reading of these provisions, according to the district\n\ncourt,   confirms    that   the   parties    intended   these   benefits   to\n\ncontinue after expiration.        They, thus, \"arose under the contract\"\n\nand satisfy the Litton test for post-expiration arbitrability.2\n\n501   U.S.   at   205-06.    After   further    examining   both   of   these\n\nprovisions, we too believe that they survive expiration of the\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.\n\n             A.   Dues Checkoff\n\n             Because Article II, Section 4 clearly contemplates the\n\ncontinued effectiveness of the dues checkoff provision, it is\n\nproperly subject to arbitration.            While employers do not have a\n\nstatutory obligation to continue such dues checkoff once collective\n\nbargaining agreements have expired, such obligations may be imposed\n\nby contract. Frito-Lay, Inc., 243 N.L.R.B. 137, 139 (1979).             Here,\n\nJournal employees \"voluntarily executed checkoff authorizations\n\nwhich expressly contemplated the possibility of periods when no\n\n\n2\n    In Litton, the Court explained:\n\n      A post-expiration grievance can be said to arise under\n      the contract only where it involves facts and occurrences\n      that arose before expiration, where an action taken after\n      expiration infringes a right that accrued or vested under\n      the agreement, or where, under normal principles of\n      contract interpretation, the disputed contractual right\n      survives expiration of the remainder of the agreement.\n\n501 U.S. at 205-06 (emphasis added).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fcontract would be in effect.\"          Id.    This creates a contractual\n\nobligation.      See Lowell Corrugated Container Corp., 177 N.L.R.B.\n\n169, 173 (1969).       Furthermore, \"where, under normal principles of\n\ncontract interpretation the disputed contractual right survives\n\nexpiration of the remainder of the agreement,\" a post expiration\n\ngrievance     is     arbitrable.      Litton,    501     U.S.   at   207-08.\n\nConsequently,       the   dues   checkoff    provision   continues   to   be\n\narbitrable.\n\n            B.     Union Security\n\n            While MOA 8's evergreen clause clearly provides that the\n\nunion security provision remains in force until the subsequent\n\ncontract expires, the parties dispute whether the original contract\n\nwas the one which expired on January 31, 2000 or a prior contract.\n\nThis dispute is central because it determines whether MOA 8 remains\n\nin force or expired on January 31, 2000.          Both parties agree that\n\nthey enacted MOA 8 during the 1994-1996 contract.               However, the\n\nJournal argues that the 1994-1999 Contract was the \"succeeding\"\n\nagreement contemplated by MOA 8, and as such, the evergreen clause\n\nexpired on January 31, 2000.        The Guild, on the other hand, argues\n\nthat the 1994-1999 Contract was a contract extension, rather than\n\na distinct successor agreement. Under this argument, the evergreen\n\nclause does not come into effect until January 31, 2000, when it\n\nprovides union security through the contractual hiatus and any\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fsuccessor agreement.       Since the parties have yet to agree on a\n\nsucceeding contract, it remains in effect.\n\n            Fortunately,    the   language   of   the   1994-1999   Contract\n\nresolves the issue.        The title page of the 1994-1999 Contract\n\ninstructs    that   the    parties’    agreements   are    in   effect   from\n\n\"January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1996 as amended and extended\n\nJanuary 1, 1997 through December 31, 1999.\"               (Emphasis added.)\n\nFurthermore, the preamble of the 1994-1999 Contract further states:\n\n            It is agreed that the Collective Bargaining\n            Agreement dated April 25, 1995, and effective\n            January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1996, is\n            extended in all its terms and conditions,\n            including Side Letters of Agreement, except as\n            provided hereinafter, and this AGREEMENT is\n            made a part hereof.\n\n(Emphasis added.)    It is clear from this language that the parties\n\nintended to extend their existing agreement rather than create a\n\nnew, succeeding, one.       As a result, MOA 8 continues to make the\n\nissue of union security arbitrable.\n\n                                      III.\n\n            For the reasons outlined in the text of this opinion, the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment is affirmed.             Costs are\n\ntaxed against appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f</pre>",
