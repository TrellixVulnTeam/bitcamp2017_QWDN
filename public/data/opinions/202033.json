Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the\nUnited States on February 3, 2005. We have substituted him for\nJohn Ashcroft, previous holder of that office, as the respondent in\nNo. 04-1694. See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f            STAHL,    Senior   Circuit    Judge.    In    this   consolidated\n\npetition for review, Jin Dong Zeng contests two decisions by the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA), one upholding the Immigration\n\nJudge's order of removal and the other denying Zeng's motion to\n\nreconsider or reopen the removal proceedings below.              After careful\n\nreview, discerning no error, we affirm both decisions.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            Zeng is a native and citizen of the People's Republic of\n\nChina.   He entered the United States at Los Angeles International\n\nAirport on August 29, 2001, and removal proceedings were initiated\n\nagainst him about two weeks later.           Zeng's attempt to enter the\n\nUnited States stemmed, he said, from China's family planning policy\n\nthat allows each family to have only one child.             In rural areas,\n\nthe policy is sometimes relaxed and families are permitted two\n\nchildren.   Zeng alleges that he and his wife, who lived in a rural\n\ncommunity in Fujian Province, had had two children without major\n\nincident but that the arrival of their third child in 1998 caused\n\nproblems with the authorities.\n\n            According to Zeng, after the birth of the third child,\n\nZeng's   wife   was   arrested,   detained    for   one   month,    and   later\n\nsterilized.     In addition, Zeng was ordered to pay a fine of 30,000\n\nyuan (roughly $3,000).         When the authorities approached him to\n\ncollect the fine, an altercation ensued and Zeng fled to Fuzhou\n\nCity.    He later left the country, traveled to Burma and Thailand\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fand eventually, with the assistance of a human smuggler known as a\n\n\"snakehead,\" came to the United States.\n\n          Before   the   Immigration   Judge   (IJ),   Zeng   conceded\n\nremovability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).      A non-citizen\n\nseeking asylum in this country \"bears the burden of establishing\n\nhis eligibility by proving that he qualifies as a refugee.\"       Nai\n\nQing Xu v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)).    Zeng's asylum application was premised on\n\nthe 1996 amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act, which\n\nexpanded the Act's definition of \"refugee\" to encompass persons who\n\nhave \"been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary\n\nsterilization, or who ha[ve] been persecuted for failure to undergo\n\nsuch a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population\n\ncontrol program.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42). The BIA interprets this\n\nprovision to protect not only those people who have themselves been\n\nforcibly sterilized, but also their spouses.      See Gi Kuan Tai v.\n\nGonzales, 423 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing In re C-Y-Z-, 21 I.\n\n& N. Dec. 915 (BIA 1997)).\n\n          At the hearing before the IJ, Zeng attempted to prove\n\nthat he qualified for asylum based on the Chinese government's\n\nforced sterilization of his wife.      Zeng's lawyer, however, was\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fquite unprepared to present his client's case.1   He did not provide\n\ncertified translations of relevant documents or proper foundations\n\nfor photographs and x-rays, and the IJ correspondingly refused to\n\nadmit those items into evidence.      As a result, the IJ rested her\n\ndecision primarily on the evidence provided by Zeng in his own\n\ntestimony.   She found his account to lack \"internal coherence or\n\nconsistency\" and that key details, such as when Zeng left China and\n\nwhat he did afterward, had not been elucidated adequately.    The IJ\n\nconcluded that Zeng had failed to establish either that his wife\n\nwas sterilized or that such sterilization had been involuntary.\n\nBecause Zeng had not proved eligibility for asylum, the IJ denied\n\nhis application and ordered him removed to China.\n\n          After the BIA approved the removal order, Zeng filed a\n\ntimely petition for review with this court.    He then moved the BIA\n\nto reconsider or reopen his case, this time appending a report from\n\nan American physician who had analyzed his wife's medical records\n\nand x-rays and concluded that the documents were \"consistent with\n\na forced sterilization.\"   When that motion was denied, Zeng again\n\npetitioned to this court; the two petitions have been consolidated\n\ninto the present case.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(6).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In her decision, the IJ described the proceeding as \"without\na doubt one of the most poorly prepared and presented asylum cases\nthat I have come across in my over eight years on the bench.\"\n\n                                -4-\n\f                                      II.\n\n           We review the BIA's denial of Zeng's motion to reconsider\n\nor reopen for abuse of discretion.          See Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289,\n\n293 (1st Cir. 2003).2      Abuse of discretion occurs \"where the BIA\n\nmisinterprets the law, or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.\"\n\nDe Xin Wang v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      A.\n\n           A    motion    to    reopen      must   satisfy    two    threshold\n\nrequirements.    First, it must \"establish 'a prima facie case for\n\nthe underlying substantive relief sought.'\"            Fesseha v. Ashcroft,\n\n333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94,\n\n107 (1988)).    Second, the motion must offer previously unavailable\n\nmaterial   evidence;     that   is,   material     evidence   that   \"was   not\n\navailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the\n\nformer hearing.\"    Orehhova v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1)). Even if both showings are\n\nmade, the BIA still retains discretion to deny the motion.                  See\n\nFesseha, 333 F.3d at 20.\n\n           Zeng contended in his motion to reopen that he now had\n\nnew evidence to demonstrate that his wife was forcibly sterilized\n\n\n     2\n      A motion to reconsider asks the BIA, on the existing record\nonly, to correct an error of fact or law in a previous BIA\ndecision. A motion to reopen, by contrast, offers new evidence for\nthe BIA's consideration. See Zhang, 348 F.3d at 292-93. Because\nZeng's claim centers around the newly proffered medical evidence he\nsubmitted with the motion, we address the issues presented by a\nchallenge to a denial of a motion to reopen.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fand, consequently, that he is eligible for asylum.3    The evidence\n\nhe now offers consists of a letter from a Boston physician who had\n\nread Zeng's wife's medical records and x-rays, consulted with a\n\nradiologist, and determined that \"[t]he story/history presented is\n\nconsistent with a forced sterilization bilaterally.\"        The BIA\n\nconsidered this evidence insufficient to warrant reopening the case\n\nbecause it \"fails to prove [Zeng's] prima facie eligibility for\n\nasylum and that, specifically, the [sterilization] procedure was\n\ncoerced. . . . Moreover, the evidence is simply not new as the fact\n\nof her sterilization existed at the time of the hearing.\"       The\n\nquestion for us is whether the BIA abused its discretion in\n\nreaching this conclusion.\n\n          Zeng urges us to follow the Second Circuit case of Ke\n\nZhen Zhao v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 265 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\nZhao also involved a Chinese man seeking to reopen his application\n\nfor asylum on the ground that he had new evidence to demonstrate\n\nhis wife had been forcibly sterilized.   The court held that the BIA\n\n\n     3\n      In addition to asylum, Zeng initially sought withholding of\nremoval and relief under the CAT. Because a claim for withholding\nof removal requires a more stringent offer of proof from the\napplicant than does a claim for asylum, if an applicant does not\nsucceed on the latter, he cannot succeed on the former.         See\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005).\nTherefore, our disposition of Zeng's asylum claim means we need not\ndiscuss separately his claim for withholding of removal. As for\nZeng's claimed entitlement to relief under the CAT, the IJ found\nthat \"there simply is no evidence to establish that claim on any\nground.\" We have seen nothing in the record that would cause us to\ndisagree with the IJ's assessment, and in any event Zeng does not\npress his CAT claim before us.\n\n                               -6-\n\fabused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.                Id. at 93.\n\nDespite some similarity in the background facts, however, there are\n\ndispositive differences between Zhao and the present case.\n\n            To begin with, Zhao's hearing took place before the 1996\n\nstatutory amendments that allowed an alien to qualify for asylum\n\nbased on his spouse's coerced sterilization. At that hearing, Zhao\n\nclaimed not only that his wife was forcibly sterilized but that he\n\nhimself feared being subjected to the procedure should he return to\n\nChina.     Id. at 86.           In addition, the Zhao holding seemingly\n\ncontemplated two different possible scenarios - either the BIA\n\nitself    found   as    fact     that    the   petitioner's   wife        had   been\n\nsterilized, or it had not made such a finding.4                     Id.     at 93.\n\nAssuming the first scenario, the Second Circuit held that the BIA\n\nacted arbitrarily in denying asylum to Zhao when it had recently\n\ngranted    asylum      to   a    different     alien   on   facts    that       were\n\nsubstantially parallel.           Id. at 95.     But this scenario does not\n\nhelp Zeng in the case at bar, because here, the BIA made no finding\n\nabout the nature or truth of his wife's sterilization.                      To the\n\ncontrary, it cited the IJ's finding that Zeng's testimony was\n\ninconclusive on that point.5            The second scenario in Zhao involved\n\n\n     4\n      Whether the BIA had made this finding was debatable from the\nlanguage of its order. See Zhao, 265 F.3d at 93.\n     5\n      Zeng points to the BIA's statement that the doctor's report\nhe submitted with his motion to reopen was \"not new\" because \"the\nfact of [the wife's] sterilization existed at the time of the\nhearing.\" It is true that this statement appears to presume that\n\n                                         -7-\n\fan assumption that the BIA did not find that the petitioner's wife\n\nhad been sterilized.     The Second Circuit found it was unfair for\n\nthe BIA to then treat the evidence as not \"new.\"               Id.     Again,\n\nhowever, this is no help to Zeng, because in Zhao, the BIA had sua\n\nsponte converted the alien's motion to reconsider – which does not\n\nrequire a proffer of previously unavailable evidence - into a\n\nmotion to reopen, which does.       Id.   The court thus held that the\n\nBIA should have given the petitioner a chance to explain why the\n\nnewly   offered   evidence   was   previously   unavailable.         Id.   In\n\naddition, the court noted that the relevance of the new evidence\n\nwould not have been apparent at the time of the hearing four years\n\nearlier, because dispositive changes in the law had occurred in the\n\ninterim.   Id. at 95-96.     None of those circumstances is present in\n\nthis case.\n\n           Thus, we find Zhao inapposite to this case.               We focus\n\ninstead on the BIA's determination that the doctor's report Zeng\n\nsubmitted with his motion to reopen was \"not new\" within the\n\nmeaning of the regulation because it was previously available.             We\n\nsee no flaw in this conclusion.      Because Zeng claimed his wife had\n\n\n\nthe wife was in fact sterilized. However, we believe it fair to\nconstrue the statement to mean that the sterilization, if it\noccurred, had already taken place by the time of Zeng's hearing.\nAlternatively, the BIA could have been stating that, after looking\nat the newly proffered doctor's report, now it was clear that the\nsterilization had occurred. This later elucidation, however, does\nnot change the fact that the sterilization was not proven at the\ninitial hearing.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fbeen sterilized well before the hearing and had her x-rays in hand\n\nall along, the doctor's report could have been sought in time to be\n\npresented at that hearing.    We conclude that the BIA was within its\n\ndiscretion to deny Zeng's motion solely on the ground that it did\n\nnot include the required new evidence.6\n\n                                    B.\n\n           It appears to us that Zeng's underlying argument is that\n\nhe should be excused from failing to present the Boston doctor's\n\nreport at his removal hearing because his lawyer, not he, is to\n\nblame for offering only unauthenticated documents at the hearing.\n\nThis is a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.7         An asylum\n\npetitioner   may   satisfy   the   \"previously   unavailable   evidence\"\n\nrequirement by claiming that he received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel at the initial hearing.           See Orehhova, 417 F.3d at 52\n\n(citing Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001)).       However,\n\na motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel must\n\nbe   accompanied   by   certain    specific   documents   regarding   the\n\n\n     6\n      Because we find that the BIA was justified in denying Zeng's\nmotion to reopen solely because it did not include the requisite\nnew evidence, we do not address the BIA's finding that the Boston\nphysician's x-ray analysis failed to prove Zeng's prima facie case\nbecause it did not demonstrate that his wife's sterilization was\ncoerced.\n     7\n      Although Zeng's briefs to this court do not make this\nargument in so many words, they do cite to First Circuit cases\ngoverning ineffective assistance of counsel claims in removal\nproceedings, invoke key phrases from those cases, and describe the\nflawed performance of the lawyer below. We thus do not deem the\nargument waived.\n\n                                    -9-\n\frelationship between attorney and client. See Saakian, 252 F.3d at\n\n25-26 (discussing Matter of Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA\n\n1988)).   In its opinion affirming the IJ's order of removal, the\n\nBIA noted that \"[i]nsofar as the respondent seeks remand on the\n\nbasis of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that he has\n\nfailed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in\n\n[Lozada].\"8\n\n           It is firmly within the BIA's discretion to deny motions\n\nto reopen for failure to meet the Lozada requirements, \"as long as\n\nit does so in a non-arbitrary manner.\"       Asaba v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d\n\n9, 11 (1st Cir. 2004).      Zeng argues that the BIA acted arbitrarily\n\nin denying his motion when his lawyer's ineffective performance was\n\nclear from the face of the record.          See Escobar-Grijalva v. INS,\n\n206 F.3d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir. 2000) (BIA abused its discretion by\n\nholding   petitioner   to   Lozada    requirements   when   facts   showing\n\nlawyer's extreme lack of preparedness were \"plain on the face of\n\n     8\n      This finding was made in the first of the BIA's two decisions\nin Zeng's case, that is, its order affirming the IJ's order of\nremoval. In its subsequent order denying Zeng's motion to reopen,\nthe BIA noted that it had \"already determined that the respondent\ndid not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.\" Zeng argues\nthat this statement is incorrect because the BIA had, previously,\ndetermined only that Zeng had not complied with the procedural\nLozada requirements, and had not made a determination on the merits\nof Zeng's claim. However, Zeng fails to note that, in its first\ndecision, the BIA stated it was \"not persuaded\" that Zeng would\nhave prevailed in his asylum petition, regardless of his attorney's\nalleged misconduct. To prevail on the merits of an ineffective\nassistance claim, an alien must show prejudice to his case, see In\nre Assaad, 23 I. & N. Dec. 553, 561-62 (BIA 2003), and here the BIA\ndetermined – albeit perfunctorily – that Zeng failed to show such\nprejudice.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fthe administrative record\").             This circuit has not recognized the\n\n\"plain   on    the   face    of    the   record\"    exception     to   the    Lozada\n\nrequirements; we have chosen to assess each case for arbitrariness\n\non its own facts.         Compare Saakian, 252 F.3d at 26-27 (BIA acted\n\narbitrarily     in   not    excusing      failure   to   strictly      meet   Lozada\n\nrequirements where alien, acting pro se, filed timely motion and IJ\n\nfalsely implied to alien that he had no right to re-file) with Gi\n\nKuan Tai, 423 F.3d at 6 (BIA did not act arbitrarily in dismissing\n\nfor failure to comply with Lozada where mitigating factors like\n\nthose in Saakian were not present).\n\n              In this case, the transcript of the hearing before the IJ\n\ncertainly suggests that Zeng's counsel was more of a liability to\n\nhis client than an asset.           Nonetheless, Zeng was represented by a\n\nnew attorney on appeal.           There is no indication that the IJ misled\n\nhim in any way, nor that the Lozada documents were ever ultimately\n\nproduced, as they were in Saakian.               We conclude, therefore, that\n\n\"unlike Saakian, this is not a case where petitioner 'did what he\n\nwas supposed to do in order to be heard on the merits' and\n\nnonetheless never received a merits hearing.\"                  Gi Kuan Tai, 423\n\nF.3d at 6 (quoting Saakian, 252 F.3d at 27).                Thus, the BIA did not\n\nact   arbitrarily    in     declining     to    entertain    Zeng's    ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f                               C.\n\n          We are left with only the petition for direct review of\n\nthe BIA's order affirming the IJ's order that Zeng be removed to\n\nChina.   We may reverse that decision \"only if the petitioner's\n\nevidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that\n\nrelief was warranted.\"   Nai Qing Xu, 424 F.3d at 48 (citation\n\nomitted). In light of the foregoing discussion, we have no problem\n\nconcluding that Zeng's evidence would not compel a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to find in his favor.\n\n                              III.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decisions of\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the\nUnited States on February 3, 2005. We have substituted him for\nJohn Ashcroft, previous holder of that office, as the respondent in\nNo. 04-1694. See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f            STAHL,    Senior   Circuit    Judge.    In    this   consolidated\n\npetition for review, Jin Dong Zeng contests two decisions by the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA), one upholding the Immigration\n\nJudge's order of removal and the other denying Zeng's motion to\n\nreconsider or reopen the removal proceedings below.              After careful\n\nreview, discerning no error, we affirm both decisions.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            Zeng is a native and citizen of the People's Republic of\n\nChina.   He entered the United States at Los Angeles International\n\nAirport on August 29, 2001, and removal proceedings were initiated\n\nagainst him about two weeks later.           Zeng's attempt to enter the\n\nUnited States stemmed, he said, from China's family planning policy\n\nthat allows each family to have only one child.             In rural areas,\n\nthe policy is sometimes relaxed and families are permitted two\n\nchildren.   Zeng alleges that he and his wife, who lived in a rural\n\ncommunity in Fujian Province, had had two children without major\n\nincident but that the arrival of their third child in 1998 caused\n\nproblems with the authorities.\n\n            According to Zeng, after the birth of the third child,\n\nZeng's   wife   was   arrested,   detained    for   one   month,    and   later\n\nsterilized.     In addition, Zeng was ordered to pay a fine of 30,000\n\nyuan (roughly $3,000).         When the authorities approached him to\n\ncollect the fine, an altercation ensued and Zeng fled to Fuzhou\n\nCity.    He later left the country, traveled to Burma and Thailand\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fand eventually, with the assistance of a human smuggler known as a\n\n\"snakehead,\" came to the United States.\n\n          Before   the   Immigration   Judge   (IJ),   Zeng   conceded\n\nremovability but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).      A non-citizen\n\nseeking asylum in this country \"bears the burden of establishing\n\nhis eligibility by proving that he qualifies as a refugee.\"       Nai\n\nQing Xu v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201828\"><a href=\"/opinion/201828/xu-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)).    Zeng's asylum application was premised on\n\nthe 1996 amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act, which\n\nexpanded the Act's definition of \"refugee\" to encompass persons who\n\nhave \"been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary\n\nsterilization, or who ha[ve] been persecuted for failure to undergo\n\nsuch a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population\n\ncontrol program.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42). The BIA interprets this\n\nprovision to protect not only those people who have themselves been\n\nforcibly sterilized, but also their spouses.      See Gi Kuan Tai v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201792\"><a href=\"/opinion/201792/tai-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing In re C-Y-Z-, 21 I.\n\n& N. Dec. 915 (BIA 1997)).\n\n          At the hearing before the IJ, Zeng attempted to prove\n\nthat he qualified for asylum based on the Chinese government's\n\nforced sterilization of his wife.      Zeng's lawyer, however, was\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fquite unprepared to present his client's case.1   He did not provide\n\ncertified translations of relevant documents or proper foundations\n\nfor photographs and x-rays, and the IJ correspondingly refused to\n\nadmit those items into evidence.      As a result, the IJ rested her\n\ndecision primarily on the evidence provided by Zeng in his own\n\ntestimony.   She found his account to lack \"internal coherence or\n\nconsistency\" and that key details, such as when Zeng left China and\n\nwhat he did afterward, had not been elucidated adequately.    The IJ\n\nconcluded that Zeng had failed to establish either that his wife\n\nwas sterilized or that such sterilization had been involuntary.\n\nBecause Zeng had not proved eligibility for asylum, the IJ denied\n\nhis application and ordered him removed to China.\n\n          After the BIA approved the removal order, Zeng filed a\n\ntimely petition for review with this court.    He then moved the BIA\n\nto reconsider or reopen his case, this time appending a report from\n\nan American physician who had analyzed his wife's medical records\n\nand x-rays and concluded that the documents were \"consistent with\n\na forced sterilization.\"   When that motion was denied, Zeng again\n\npetitioned to this court; the two petitions have been consolidated\n\ninto the present case.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(6).\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In her decision, the IJ described the proceeding as \"without\na doubt one of the most poorly prepared and presented asylum cases\nthat I have come across in my over eight years on the bench.\"\n\n                                -4-\n\f                                      II.\n\n           We review the BIA's denial of Zeng's motion to reconsider\n\nor reopen for abuse of discretion.

Second, the motion must offer previously unavailable\n\nmaterial   evidence;     that   is,   material     evidence   that   \"was   not\n\navailable and could not have been discovered or presented at the\n\nformer hearing.\"    Orehhova v.

Even if both showings are\n\nmade, the BIA still retains discretion to deny the motion.                  See\n\nFesseha, 333 F.3d at 20.\n\n           Zeng contended in his motion to reopen that he now had\n\nnew evidence to demonstrate that his wife was forcibly sterilized\n\n\n     2\n      A motion to reconsider asks the BIA, on the existing record\nonly, to correct an error of fact or law in a previous BIA\ndecision. A motion to reopen, by contrast, offers new evidence for\nthe BIA's consideration. See Zhang, 348 F.3d at 292-93. Because\nZeng's claim centers around the newly proffered medical evidence he\nsubmitted with the motion, we address the issues presented by a\nchallenge to a denial of a motion to reopen.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fand, consequently, that he is eligible for asylum.3    The evidence\n\nhe now offers consists of a letter from a Boston physician who had\n\nread Zeng's wife's medical records and x-rays, consulted with a\n\nradiologist, and determined that \"[t]he story/history presented is\n\nconsistent with a forced sterilization bilaterally.\"        The BIA\n\nconsidered this evidence insufficient to warrant reopening the case\n\nbecause it \"fails to prove [Zeng's] prima facie eligibility for\n\nasylum and that, specifically, the [sterilization] procedure was\n\ncoerced. . . . Moreover, the evidence is simply not new as the fact\n\nof her sterilization existed at the time of the hearing.\"       The\n\nquestion for us is whether the BIA abused its discretion in\n\nreaching this conclusion.\n\n          Zeng urges us to follow the Second Circuit case of Ke\n\nZhen Zhao v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774878\"><a href=\"/opinion/774878/ke-zhen-zhao-v-united-states-department-of-justice-janet-reno-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 2001).\n\nZhao also involved a Chinese man seeking to reopen his application\n\nfor asylum on the ground that he had new evidence to demonstrate\n\nhis wife had been forcibly sterilized.   The court held that the BIA\n\n\n     3\n      In addition to asylum, Zeng initially sought withholding of\nremoval and relief under the CAT. Because a claim for withholding\nof removal requires a more stringent offer of proof from the\napplicant than does a claim for asylum, if an applicant does not\nsucceed on the latter, he cannot succeed on the former.         See\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (1st Cir. 2005).\nTherefore, our disposition of Zeng's asylum claim means we need not\ndiscuss separately his claim for withholding of removal. As for\nZeng's claimed entitlement to relief under the CAT, the IJ found\nthat \"there simply is no evidence to establish that claim on any\nground.\" We have seen nothing in the record that would cause us to\ndisagree with the IJ's assessment, and in any event Zeng does not\npress his CAT claim before us.\n\n                               -6-\n\fabused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.                Id. at 93.\n\nDespite some similarity in the background facts, however, there are\n\ndispositive differences between Zhao and the present case.\n\n            To begin with, Zhao's hearing took place before the 1996\n\nstatutory amendments that allowed an alien to qualify for asylum\n\nbased on his spouse's coerced sterilization. At that hearing, Zhao\n\nclaimed not only that his wife was forcibly sterilized but that he\n\nhimself feared being subjected to the procedure should he return to\n\nChina.     Id. at 86.           In addition, the Zhao holding seemingly\n\ncontemplated two different possible scenarios - either the BIA\n\nitself    found   as    fact     that    the   petitioner's   wife        had   been\n\nsterilized, or it had not made such a finding.4                     Id.     at 93.\n\nAssuming the first scenario, the Second Circuit held that the BIA\n\nacted arbitrarily in denying asylum to Zhao when it had recently\n\ngranted    asylum      to   a    different     alien   on   facts    that       were\n\nsubstantially parallel.           Id. at 95.     But this scenario does not\n\nhelp Zeng in the case at bar, because here, the BIA made no finding\n\nabout the nature or truth of his wife's sterilization.                      To the\n\ncontrary, it cited the IJ's finding that Zeng's testimony was\n\ninconclusive on that point.5            The second scenario in Zhao involved\n\n\n     4\n      Whether the BIA had made this finding was debatable from the\nlanguage of its order. See Zhao, 265 F.3d at 93.\n     5\n      Zeng points to the BIA's statement that the doctor's report\nhe submitted with his motion to reopen was \"not new\" because \"the\nfact of [the wife's] sterilization existed at the time of the\nhearing.\" It is true that this statement appears to presume that\n\n                                         -7-\n\fan assumption that the BIA did not find that the petitioner's wife\n\nhad been sterilized.     The Second Circuit found it was unfair for\n\nthe BIA to then treat the evidence as not \"new.\"               Id.     Again,\n\nhowever, this is no help to Zeng, because in Zhao, the BIA had sua\n\nsponte converted the alien's motion to reconsider – which does not\n\nrequire a proffer of previously unavailable evidence - into a\n\nmotion to reopen, which does.       Id.   The court thus held that the\n\nBIA should have given the petitioner a chance to explain why the\n\nnewly   offered   evidence   was   previously   unavailable.         Id.   In\n\naddition, the court noted that the relevance of the new evidence\n\nwould not have been apparent at the time of the hearing four years\n\nearlier, because dispositive changes in the law had occurred in the\n\ninterim.   Id. at 95-96.     None of those circumstances is present in\n\nthis case.\n\n           Thus, we find Zhao inapposite to this case.               We focus\n\ninstead on the BIA's determination that the doctor's report Zeng\n\nsubmitted with his motion to reopen was \"not new\" within the\n\nmeaning of the regulation because it was previously available.             We\n\nsee no flaw in this conclusion.      Because Zeng claimed his wife had\n\n\n\nthe wife was in fact sterilized. However, we believe it fair to\nconstrue the statement to mean that the sterilization, if it\noccurred, had already taken place by the time of Zeng's hearing.\nAlternatively, the BIA could have been stating that, after looking\nat the newly proffered doctor's report, now it was clear that the\nsterilization had occurred. This later elucidation, however, does\nnot change the fact that the sterilization was not proven at the\ninitial hearing.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fbeen sterilized well before the hearing and had her x-rays in hand\n\nall along, the doctor's report could have been sought in time to be\n\npresented at that hearing.    We conclude that the BIA was within its\n\ndiscretion to deny Zeng's motion solely on the ground that it did\n\nnot include the required new evidence.6\n\n                                    B.\n\n           It appears to us that Zeng's underlying argument is that\n\nhe should be excused from failing to present the Boston doctor's\n\nreport at his removal hearing because his lawyer, not he, is to\n\nblame for offering only unauthenticated documents at the hearing.\n\nThis is a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.7         An asylum\n\npetitioner   may   satisfy   the   \"previously   unavailable   evidence\"\n\nrequirement by claiming that he received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel at the initial hearing.

In its opinion affirming the IJ's order of removal, the\n\nBIA noted that \"[i]nsofar as the respondent seeks remand on the\n\nbasis of ineffective assistance of counsel, we find that he has\n\nfailed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in\n\n[Lozada].\"8\n\n           It is firmly within the BIA's discretion to deny motions\n\nto reopen for failure to meet the Lozada requirements, \"as long as\n\nit does so in a non-arbitrary manner.\"       Asaba v.

However, Zeng fails to note that, in its first\ndecision, the BIA stated it was \"not persuaded\" that Zeng would\nhave prevailed in his asylum petition, regardless of his attorney's\nalleged misconduct. To prevail on the merits of an ineffective\nassistance claim, an alien must show prejudice to his case, see In\nre Assaad, 23 I. & N.

Nonetheless, Zeng was represented by a\n\nnew attorney on appeal.           There is no indication that the IJ misled\n\nhim in any way, nor that the Lozada documents were ever ultimately\n\nproduced, as they were in Saakian.               We conclude, therefore, that\n\n\"unlike Saakian, this is not a case where petitioner 'did what he\n\nwas supposed to do in order to be heard on the merits' and\n\nnonetheless never received a merits hearing.\"                  Gi Kuan Tai, 423\n\nF.3d at 6 (quoting Saakian, 252 F.3d at 27).
