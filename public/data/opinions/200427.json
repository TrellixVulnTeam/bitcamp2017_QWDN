Rodriguez-Burgos and Jaime Mercado-Almodovar,\nAssistant Solicitor General, with whom Fiddler, Gonzalez &\nRodriguez, PSC, Roberto J. Sanchez-Ramos, Solicitor General, and\nVanessa Lugo Flores, Deputy Solicitor General, were on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n                            April 11, 2003\n\f      Per curiam.         Plaintiffs-appellants Luis A. Lugo, his wife,\n\nand their conjugal partnership appeal from the district court's\n\ndecision granting         summary    judgment      to   defendants-appellees          on\n\nappellants'      political       discrimination      claims.       We       review   the\n\ndistrict court's decision de novo, see ATC Realty, LLC v. Town of\n\nKingston, 303 F.3d 91, 94 (1st Cir. 2002), but find no error.\n\n      Appellant Lugo was the Supervisor of Internal Auditing in the\n\nInternal    Auditing      Office    of    the     Puerto    Rico   Electric      Power\n\nAuthority (PREPA) in 1997, when a reorganization caused him to be\n\ntransferred to a supervisory position in a different department, at\n\na higher pay grade with generally the same responsibilities, but at\n\na   lower   classification        level.         Appellants    alleged       that    the\n\nreorganization was effectuated in order to demote Lugo due to\n\nhostility to his affiliation with the Popular Democratic Party\n\n(PDP) by management aligned with the New Progressive Party.                          The\n\ncourt    held    that,     assuming      Lugo's    transfer    was      a    demotion,\n\nappellants had not produced evidence to show that appellees knew\n\nof, much less were motivated by, Lugo's political persuasion in\n\ncausing his transfer.\n\n        On appeal, appellants make three arguments.                     First, they\n\ncontend     that   they     provided      sufficient       evidence     to    allow    a\n\nreasonable fact finder to determine that appellees were aware of\n\nLugo's political affiliation. Second, they argue that they adduced\n\nsufficient      evidence    to    show    that    the   reorganization         was    not\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\flegitimate.     Third, appellants suggest that the district court\n\nerred in making a factual finding that the 1997 reorganization was\n\napproved by PREPA's Governing Board.\n\n      The district court appropriately began its analysis from the\n\npremise that appellants \"would have to point to evidence in the\n\nrecord, that if credited, would permit the rational fact finder to\n\nconclude that the challenged adverse action occurred and stemmed\n\nfrom a politically based discriminatory animus,\" in order to\n\novercome appellees' summary judgment motion, citing Rivera-Cotto v.\n\nRivera,   38   F.3d    611,   613-14     (1st   Cir.       1994).      The   court\n\nspecifically addressed the first two contentions made by appellants\n\non appeal, holding that they did not produce sufficient evidence\n\nfor a fact finder to conclude either that appellees knew of Lugo's\n\nPDP   affiliation     or   that   the   reorganization        was   illegitimate.\n\nReviewing the record, we agree with the district court and find no\n\nneed to elaborate on its thorough treatment of these two points.\n\n      Appellants' final argument is that the court incorrectly held\n\nthat the 1997 reorganization was approved by the Governing Board.\n\nThe district court precisely held that the Governing Board had\n\napproved the     reorganization plan promulgated in February 1994.\n\nReviewing this finding for clear error, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a),\n\nwe find none, as it is evidenced by the Governing Board's Resolve\n\nNumber 2487, appended to appellees' motion for summary judgment.\n\nAlthough appellants        characterize       the   1997    reorganization,    not\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fseparately approved by the Governing Board, as distinct from the\n\n1994 plan, the 1997 reorganization appears to have been the full\n\nimplementation of the 1994 plan.\n\n     For the reasons stated above, the decision of the district\n\ncourt is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f",
