Garcia, United States Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres-Pabon,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          March 2, 2004\n\f      COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge. Appellants Victor Fajardo-Velez\n\nand   Jose    Omar     Cruz-Mercado    were   the   Secretary    and   Associate\n\nSecretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Education (PRDE) when\n\nthey devised an extortion and kickback scheme that allegedly\n\ninvolved fraudulent payments of more than $4.3 million in cash and\n\nproperty from PRDE contractors.             Appellants entered into separate\n\ncooperation agreements with the government and pled guilty to\n\nseveral counts in exchange for what they hoped would be shorter\n\nsentences.     Those hopes were not realized, however, and appellants\n\nnow raise a series of challenges to their sentences.1                  Finding no\n\nreversible error, we affirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n      We     briefly    summarize     the   relevant   facts    and    procedural\n\nhistory, drawing from appellants' cooperation agreements, and from\n\nthe transcripts of their sentencing proceedings and Fajardo's bail\n\nrevocation hearing.         See United States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11, 13\n\n(lst Cir. 2001).        According to their agreements, Fajardo recruited\n\n\n\n      1\n       Fajardo also claims that his plea to Count Five of the\nindictment, which charged a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666, should be\nvacated and the count dismissed because the count as alleged lacked\nan essential jurisdictional element of the offense. Section 666\ngoverns theft or bribery involving programs that receive federal\nfunds. The government agrees that omission of an allegation that\nthe program received more than $10,000 in federal funds in a single\nyear renders the count insufficient, see 18 U.S.C. § 666(b), and\nconcedes that it therefore should be dismissed. Although Cruz did\nnot raise this issue, the government states that he is entitled to\nthe same action. Consequently, we direct the district court to\ndismiss Count Five as to both appellants.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fCruz   to     collaborate     in   a    scheme      to    extort      money    from   PRDE\n\ncontractors initially for the purpose of financing their political\n\nparty obligations and later for personal purposes.                            Among other\n\nactivities, the two administrators orchestrated the creation of a\n\ncorporation to act as a front for their illegal activities.                            The\n\ncorporation, Research & Management Group, Inc., submitted three\n\ncontract proposals totaling more than $4 million to the PRDE and\n\nalso generated false invoices seeking payments from other PRDE\n\ncontractors.        Fajardo approved the Research & Management contracts\n\nand    also    awarded    contracts       to    a    number      of   companies       whose\n\nprincipals – charged as co-defendants in the indictment – had made\n\npayments to         appellants.        Fajardo      and   Cruz     also   ordered      that\n\ninvoices for their political party activities be distributed to\n\nvarious PRDE contractors for payment.                     In addition to the cash\n\npayments extorted from the contractors between 1994 and 2001,\n\nappellants         received   \"items    for     personal      use.\"       Hundreds       of\n\nthousands of dollars in cash were kept in a safe in Fajardo's\n\noffice, and appellants dipped into it for various political and\n\npersonal purposes.\n\n       Appellants were charged in January 2002 with fifteen co-\n\ndefendants in an eight-count indictment.                    In February 2002, both\n\nmen pled guilty to three counts (Counts One, Five and Eight)\n\npursuant      to    non-binding    plea    and      cooperation       agreements       that\n\nspecified the sentencing calculations that the government would\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\frecommend and provided that the government would file motions for\n\ndownward departure if appellants provided substantial assistance in\n\nthe   investigation   or   prosecution   of   others.    For   Cruz,   the\n\nanticipated recommended sentence was set at 46-57 months; for\n\nFajardo, the recommendation was to be for 70-87 months.          Fajardo\n\npaid $1,352,000 in restitution before tendering his guilty plea;\n\nCruz agreed to forfeit $600,000, of which approximately $14,700 was\n\npaid before his cooperation agreement was signed.        Both testified\n\nbefore the Grand Jury and provided considerable information to\n\nauthorities about their own activities and the activities of\n\nothers.\n\n      In September 2002, Fajardo was called by the government as the\n\nfirst witness at the trial of three co-defendants.         On the fifth\n\nday of his testimony, during cross-examination, the trial was\n\naborted when the government accused Fajardo of committing perjury\n\nand moved to revoke his bond, requesting in addition that the case\n\nbe dismissed with prejudice as to all remaining defendants (the\n\nthree on trial as well as ten others).        The district court granted\n\nthe motions.   Maintaining that he had been truthful, Fajardo moved\n\nfor release on bail and also sought enforcement of the government's\n\nobligations under the plea agreement. Following a hearing in which\n\nthe court explored the government's allegations of untruthfulness,\n\nsee infra at 14-19, the court denied Fajardo's motions.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f       Sentencing for both appellants took place on December 11,\n\n2002.       Without any benefit from their plea agreements, their terms\n\npursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines were roughly twice as long as\n\nthey had hoped to receive.2         Fajardo was sentenced to a term of 151\n\nmonths on Counts One and Eight and 120 months to be served\n\nconcurrently on Count Five.             The court ordered restitution in the\n\namount of $4.3 million.        Cruz was sentenced to a term of 132 months\n\non the three counts, with the previously agreed upon forfeiture\n\namount of $600,000.         These appeals followed.\n\n                        II. Appeal of Cruz-Mercado\n\n       Cruz asserts generally that, in light of his substantial\n\nassistance to the government, he is entitled to be sentenced in\n\naccordance with his plea agreement.                Presumably recognizing that\n\nthe     district    court    was        not    bound   by    the   agreement,   he\n\nparticularizes that contention by identifying three specific flaws\n\nin    his    sentencing:    (1)    he    was    improperly    denied   a   downward\n\ndeparture for substantial assistance; (2) his sentence should not\n\nhave been calculated based on the total loss alleged in the\n\nindictment, $4.3 million; and (3) the court made several statements\n\nduring sentencing that reflected bias toward him.                  We address each\n\nin turn.\n\n\n\n       2\n       The government did not renounce Cruz's agreement, but\nsimply declined to move for a downward departure for substantial\nassistance. The court, however, refused to accept the agreement\nand instead imposed sentence without regard to it.\n\n                                          -6-\n\f       A. Downward Departure.          Under Cruz's plea agreement, the\n\ngovernment    was   obliged    to    move    for    downward    departure   under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 if prosecutors \"determine[d] that the defendant\n\nhas   provided   substantial        assistance      in   the   investigation    or\n\nprosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\"                   The\n\nagreement also provided that it was \"conditioned upon the defendant\n\nproviding full, complete, truthful and substantial cooperation,\"\n\nand that the government would be released from compliance if the\n\ndefendant failed \"in any way\" to fulfill his obligations.\n\n       Cruz acknowledged that, in one instance, he did not tell the\n\ntruth, admitting in a sentencing motion that he had \"failed to\n\nremember a 1996 check that became important at trial and crucial to\n\nthe position of the US Attorney.\"            He consequently stipulated to a\n\ntwo-level upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.\n\n       Cruz maintains that this single episode does not negate the\n\nextensive    cooperation   he    provided,       which    included   substantial\n\ntestimony before the Grand Jury and delivery of more than 150\n\nincriminating documents.        He notes that he would have testified at\n\ntrial as well had the proceedings not been cut short by the\n\ngovernment.\n\n       Although it appears that Cruz provided significant assistance\n\nin    the   prosecution   of    this   case,       his   cooperation   agreement\n\nexplicitly gave the government the authority not to request a\n\ndownward departure in the event Cruz failed to meet his obligation\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fto be truthful.        Cruz does not dispute his lack of veracity or the\n\nrelevance of his untruthfulness, seeking only to minimize its\n\nweight   in    light    of     his   otherwise          full    cooperation      with     the\n\ngovernment. Whether or not we agree with the government's judgment\n\nnot to recommend a downward departure is of no consequence.                          In the\n\nabsence of an unconstitutional motivation or arbitrariness, see\n\nUnited States v. Davis, 247 F.3d 322, 325-26 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited States v. Doe, 233             F.3d 642, 644 (lst Cir. 2000), and in\n\nthe    face    of     Cruz's    admitted          obstruction       of     justice,       the\n\ngovernment's decision was within its discretion. Cf. United States\n\nv. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"A defendant who has\n\nentered into a plea agreement with the government, and himself\n\nfulfills      that    agreement,      is    entitled       to    the   benefit      of    his\n\nbargain.\") (emphasis added); see also Davis, 247 F.3d at 326\n\n(government's        burden    in    defending      a     decision       not   to   file    a\n\nsubstantial assistance motion, \"at least where there is a plea\n\nagreement,\"      is     \"modest,        only      one     of    production,         not    of\n\npersuasion\").\n\n      To the extent Cruz separately challenges the district court's\n\ndenial of his motion for a downward departure under the general\n\ndeparture guideline, U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0, his claim is without merit.\n\nWe    repeatedly      have     stated      that    \"departures         for     substantial\n\nassistance must come within the confines of USSG § 5K1.1,\" United\n\nStates v. Sandoval, 204 F.3d 283, 285 (lst Cir. 2000), and that a\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fdistrict court consequently is not empowered to independently grant\n\na departure for that reason under § 5K2.0, see, e.g., Davis, 247\n\nF.3d at 328; Sandoval, 204 F.3d at 285; United States v. Alegría,\n\n192 F.3d 179, 189 (lst Cir. 1999).                 The court therefore did not err\n\nin denying his motion.\n\n      B.   Calculation         of    Loss.     Cruz    maintains    that      the   court\n\nimproperly utilized the total loss alleged in the indictment, $4.3\n\nmillion, in calculating his sentence, resulting in an erroneous\n\nseven-level increase in his base offense level.                      See U.S.S.G. §\n\n2S1.1(b)(2)(H).3        He contends that his sentence should have been\n\nbased     on   the    amount    of    loss    attributed     to    him   in   his    plea\n\nagreement, $600,000, which would have triggered only a three-level\n\nincrease.\n\n      It is undisputed that Cruz was not personally implicated in\n\nthe   full     $4.3    million       loss    charged    in   the   indictment.         At\n\nsentencing, however, the district court expressed its view that\n\nCruz and Fajardo were equally culpable \"partners in crime.\"                           The\n\ncourt also noted that the factual allegations indicated that \"the\n\nmoney involved in the conspiracy significantly exceeded the 4.3\n\nmillion dollars reflected in the indictment,\" which simply was the\n\namount the government felt it could prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. Because of the scope of the scheme and appellant's admitted\n\n\n\n      3\n       The district court utilized the November 1, 2000 edition of\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n                                             -9-\n\fobstruction of justice, the court found that it was not bound by\n\nthe plea agreement and that a sentence at the high end of the\n\napplicable range, based on the full $4.3 million, was appropriate.\n\nThe court noted that there were grounds for imposing an upward\n\ndeparture, but decided against doing so.\n\n      Appellate review of a district court's application of the\n\nGuidelines typically involves a two-part inquiry: \"[W]e scrutinize\n\nthe district court's legal determinations . . . de novo and check\n\nits factual determinations for clear error.\"     Mateo, 271 F.3d at\n\n13.   Here, Cruz challenges the court's factual finding that he is\n\naccountable for the full $4.3 million loss.   We see no clear error\n\nin that judgment.   Cruz pled guilty to Count One, which charged a\n\nconspiracy to interfere with commerce by extortion, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).   Although Cruz did not participate in each act\n\nallegedly a part of the conspiracy, it is well established that co-\n\nconspirators may be sentenced based on all reasonably foreseeable\n\nacts of others in furtherance of the conspiracy – i.e., all\n\n\"relevant conduct\" under U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3.     See United States v.\n\nLaboy, 351 F.3d 578, 582-83 (lst Cir. 2003); USSG § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).\n\nBased on Cruz's extensive involvement throughout the relevant six-\n\nyear period, as detailed in his plea and cooperation agreement, the\n\ncourt supportably found that he shared responsibility as a partner\n\nfor the full amount of the loss.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f     C. Judicial Bias.     Cruz claims that two comments by the\n\ndistrict judge, one at his sentencing hearing and the other at\n\nFajardo's bail revocation hearing, reflected bias sufficiently\n\nprejudicial to warrant his re-sentencing by another judge.        He\n\npoints to the judge's comment that Fajardo, Cruz and co-defendant\n\nRuperto Vazquez Lopez \"operated like mafiosos,\" particularly when\n\nthey allocated among themselves specific percentages of the illegal\n\nextortion and kickback proceeds they anticipated collecting.     Cruz\n\nalso challenges the judge's description of him as the \"enforcer\" in\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n     We need not dwell on this issue. First, Cruz neither objected\n\nto these comments nor sought recusal of the trial judge based on\n\npartiality, limiting our review to assessing only whether plain\n\nerror occurred.   See, e.g., United States v. Arache, 946 F.2d 129,\n\n140 (lst Cir. 1991).   Whatever one's view of the judge's rhetoric,\n\nwe think it beyond debate that it reflected a fact-based assessment\n\nof the type of conduct in which the defendants engaged and not a\n\nfundamentally unfair bias toward Cruz.\n\n     [J]udicial remarks during the course of a trial that are\n     critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel,\n     the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a\n     bias or partiality challenge. They may do so if they\n     reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial\n     source; and they will do so if they reveal such a high\n     degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair\n     judgment impossible.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fLiteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994) (emphasis in\n\noriginal).   The remarks here reveal neither, and Cruz's claim is\n\nthus unavailing.\n\n                   III. Appeal of Fajardo-Velez\n\n     Following an evidentiary hearing to explore the government's\n\nallegations that Fajardo had committed perjury and breached his\n\nplea agreement, the district court found that he was not entitled\n\nto enforcement of the agreement and subsequently concluded that his\n\nlack of truthfulness warranted an upward adjustment in his sentence\n\nfor obstruction of justice.    Fajardo claims that he must be re-\n\nsentenced because it was the government – not he – who breached the\n\nagreement, and because the court's imposition of a harsh sentence\n\nstemmed from violations of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.\n\n     The constitutional claims primarily arose from the district\n\ncourt's requirement that Fajardo answer a series of questions on\n\ncross-examination at his co-defendants' trial after he had invoked\n\nthe Fifth Amendment, without first allowing him to consult with his\n\nattorney.4   The questions concerned a company created by his wife\n\nand for which he served as board president, \"Community Services\n\nTraining Institute\" (\"Community\"), that was largely unconnected\n\n\n     4\n       Fajardo makes a general, undeveloped claim that he was\ndenied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel based on the district\ncourt's repeated admonition during his trial testimony that he not\nspeak to anyone, including counsel, about the case. The only time\nhe asked to speak with counsel, however, related to a matter not at\nissue on appeal, and we therefore do not further address this\ncontention.\n\n                               -12-\n\fwith the charged conspiracy but was the subject of a pending local\n\ninvestigation.    It was Fajardo's answers to those questions, which\n\nsought to link Community with Research & Management (the company\n\nformed to implement the extortion scheme), that prompted the\n\ngovernment's allegations of perjury and, in large part, triggered\n\ndismissal of the case.         The government acknowledges that the\n\ntestimony elicited after Fajardo invoked his Fifth Amendment rights\n\nwas   \"improperly    received,\"     but   it   correctly   points   out   that\n\nFajardo's statements about Community ultimately played no role in\n\nhis sentencing.      The district court relied on other factors to\n\nconclude   that     Fajardo   had   breached     the   plea   agreement    and\n\nobstructed justice, and we therefore need not address the substance\n\nof the constitutional claims.\n\n      Instead, we consider the three instances of untruthfulness on\n\nwhich the district court did rely – which we will detail shortly –\n\nand conclude that the court did not err in finding that Fajardo\n\nbreached the plea agreement.5       As we explain below, however, we are\n\ntroubled by the manner in which the government achieved this\n\nresult.    We begin our discussion with some additional procedural\n\nbackground.\n\n\n\n      5\n         We review a district court's factual findings concerning\na plea agreement only for clear error, but \"whether [undisputed]\nconduct constituted a breach of the plea agreement is a question of\nlaw subject to plenary review,\" United States v. Doe, 233 F.3d 642,\n643-44 (lst Cir. 2000); see also United States v. Frazier, 340 F.3d\n5, 9-10 (lst Cir. 2003).\n\n                                     -13-\n\f      Shortly after the co-defendants' trial was terminated and\n\nFajardo's bail was revoked, an evidentiary hearing – labeled a\n\n\"revocation hearing\" – was held to determine if he had been\n\nproperly returned to custody.             The parties addressed the alleged\n\nperjury concerning Community and, for the first time on the record,\n\nthe   government        identified      three     additional        instances    of\n\nuntruthfulness that it claimed justified withdrawal of the plea\n\nagreement, supported an enhancement for obstruction of justice, and\n\ncontributed to the decision to end the trial and dismiss the case\n\nagainst the remaining defendants.\n\n      At   the    end   of    the   hearing,    the   court   ordered   Fajardo's\n\ncontinued detention.           A month later, the court issued an order\n\nfinding that the government had met its burden of proving by a\n\npreponderance      of   the    evidence    that   Fajardo     had   substantially\n\nbreached his obligation under the plea agreement \"'to provide\n\ntruthful, complete and accurate testimony and information.'\" See\n\nUnited States v. Tilley, 964 F.2d 66, 71 (lst Cir. 1992).                       The\n\ncourt thus released the government from its obligations under the\n\nagreement.       The court based its decision on the three alternative\n\nincidents of alleged untruthfulness, declining to address whether\n\nFajardo's testimony on Community constituted perjury.\n\n      The court relied on the following discrepancies: (1) Fajardo's\n\nacknowledgment on cross-examination that he had committed criminal\n\nacts before 1994, the year he became Secretary of Education,\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fallegedly contradicted a prior statement to prosecutors that his\n\ncriminal activity began when he assumed that position; (2) his\n\ntestimony that a co-defendant contractor had financed a trip to\n\nChicago conflicted with subsequently obtained documentary evidence\n\nshowing that Cruz had reimbursed the contractor for the expenses;\n\nand (3) his testimony on cross-examination indicating that the co-\n\ndefendant contractors participated in the scheme under economic\n\nduress allegedly differed from earlier statements to prosecutors\n\nthat the contractors were collaborators in a mutual business\n\nundertaking.\n\n     Fajardo claims that, because the government was unable to\n\nsubstantiate the alleged perjury regarding Community, it contrived\n\nthese three inaccuracies as an alternative way to make him the\n\nscapegoat    for   its    flawed     investigation   and   prosecution.      He\n\ncomplains that these \"vague and unannounced\" allegations \"blind-\n\nsided\" his     counsel    at   the    revocation    hearing.     Moreover,   he\n\nmaintains that none of the three claims has merit.\n\n     On the alleged contradiction regarding the use of economic\n\nduress against the contractors, Fajardo asserts that he testified\n\ntruthfully    in   response    to     technically    framed    questions   that\n\nmirrored the language of the indictment, his plea agreement and the\n\ncharging statute.6       Any problem, he insists, is attributable to the\n\n\n     6\n       Count One of the indictment alleged a \"conspiracy to\ninterfere with commerce by extortion induced by economic fear\nand/or color of official right,\" in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18\n\n                                       -15-\n\fgovernment's ill-conceived case; at the revocation hearing, his\n\nattorney observed that bribery might have been a more appropriate\n\ncharge than one requiring fear of economic harm.              Moreover,\n\nFajardo points out, he was denied any opportunity to explain his\n\nanswers   –   and,   indeed,   the    government   acknowledged   at   the\n\nrevocation hearing that it initially anticipated being able to\n\nrehabilitate Fajardo on the issue of duress on redirect. See infra\n\nat 17.7   As for payment of the Chicago expenses, Fajardo discounts\n\nthe importance of any error in his recollection of that one\n\nparticular trip in light of the contractor's payments on his behalf\n\non other occasions.     And on the pre-1994 crimes, Fajardo asserts\n\nthat he again was not given an opportunity to explain his answer\n\nand notes that such crimes may have been only \"irrelevant juvenile\n\nor petty offenses.\"\n\n     At the revocation hearing, the government denied any attempt\n\nto ambush Fajardo's counsel.         The prosecutor stated that counsel\n\n\nU.S.C. § 1951. Under the statute, \"extortion\" is defined as \"the\nobtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by\nwrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or\nunder color of official right.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). In cross-\nexamination, when asked if the requests for funds from the\ncontractors were made \"with the threats that if they didn't make\nthem, it would be economic death,\" Fajardo replied, \"Yes, sir.\"\nThis reply was one of several acknowledging that consent from the\ncontractors was \"wrongfully induced by fear of economic harm.\"\n     7\n       Presumably, the government would have pursued its theory\nthat the contractors initially were the victims of economic duress,\nbut later became willing participants, and thus aiders and\nabettors, in the scheme. Whether or not this is a viable theory is\nnot before us.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fpreviously had been told of the government's other untruthfulness\n\nconcerns,    and   he   explained   that   those   issues   had   not   been\n\nhighlighted in advance of the hearing because the government had\n\nbeen asked specifically to identify and substantiate only its\n\nperjury allegations – not instances of untruthfulness outside the\n\ncourtroom.    Because the government assumed that Fajardo's trial\n\ntestimony on the three additional matters was true, and that his\n\nearlier statements, during debriefing sessions, had been false, the\n\ngovernment viewed the incidents as involving untruthfulness, but\n\nnot perjury.8\n\n     The prosecutor also explained in some detail how these three\n\nmatters affected the government's view of the viability of its\n\ncase.    Initially, he reported, the government had been taken aback\n\nby Fajardo's answers on cross-examination indicating that the\n\ncontractors were threatened with \"economic death\" if they did not\n\ncooperate.    The prosecutor reported that he phoned his supervisors\n\nduring the next recess to alert them to the problem and was\n\ninstructed to try to rehabilitate Fajardo on redirect.\n\n     According to the prosecutor, however, that plan fell apart in\n\nthe face of several developments affecting Fajardo's credibility.\n\n\n     8\n       We note that, unlike the cross-examination testimony on\neconomic duress and prior crimes, which differed from what the\ngovernment claimed it was earlier told, Fajardo's testimony about\nthe Chicago trip apparently matched the government's expectations.\nIt differed, however, from the documentary evidence produced by co-\ndefendant's counsel and thus presumably should have been viewed as\nfalse testimony by the government.\n\n                                    -17-\n\fFirst, to the government's surprise, Fajardo invoked the Fifth\n\nAmendment to avoid answering questions about his activities with\n\nCommunity.9   The prosecutor noted that \"[h]e never told us he was\n\ngoing to have a problem with any questions concerning this matter.\"\n\nThen, Fajardo admitted that he had committed crimes before 1994;\n\nhis exchange with co-defendant's counsel, reproduced in relevant\n\npart below, suggests that such activity was not trivial:\n\n     COUNSEL: Now, you had done prior illegal activities,\n     didn't you, before the facts that are detailed in the\n     indictment, weren't you?\n     FAJARDO: Such as, sir?\n     COUNSEL: I'm asking you, were you or were you not\n     involved in any illegal activities prior to 1994, 1995?\n     FAJARDO: If I were to answer yes or no, that would\n     require an explanation.\n\n     Fajardo was then directed by the court to answer yes or\n     no.\n\n     FAJARDO: My answer is yes, sir.\n     COUNSEL: In other words, you're telling this jury that\n     prior to 1994, you were involved in other illegal\n     activities; is that correct?\n     FAJARDO: Yes, sir.\n     . . .\n     COUNSEL: It involved illegal activities between you and\n     Omar Cruz; is that correct? Yes or no.\n     FAJARDO: Specifically Jose Omar Cruz?\n     COUNSEL: Yes.\n     FAJARDO: Right now, I don't know.\n     COUNSEL: You don't recall?\n     FAJARDO: I don't recall.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Although the court initially allowed Fajardo to deflect the\nquestions about Community, the court later required him to answer,\nand his responses triggered the government's allegations of\nperjury.   As noted earlier, however, that testimony was not a\nfactor in the court's disposition.\n\n                               -18-\n\f     Counsel then continued by asking Fajardo if his wife was\n\ninvolved in those activities, and Fajardo replied, \"In order to say\n\nyes, I need to acknowledge what it is that we're talking about.\"\n\nThen, when asked what he did illegally before 1994, he replied,\n\n\"[I]t depends on what you consider to be illegal, I may not\n\nconsider it to be illegal.\"     Counsel then asked if the activities\n\ninvolved   Community,   and   Fajardo      said,   \"I    cannot     answer   that\n\nquestion   categorically.\"      The     exchange        continued    with    more\n\nquestions about Community, to which Fajardo at times replied by\n\ninvoking his Fifth Amendment right not to answer.\n\n     Fajardo's   admission     of     earlier      criminal       activity    was\n\nparticularly troublesome for the government because the exchange\n\nwith counsel allowed an inference of involvement by Cruz, the\n\ngovernment's other key witness. And the final inconsistency – the\n\nmatter of who paid for the Chicago trip – similarly impacted the\n\ncredibility of both Fajardo and Cruz.         Both had attributed payment\n\nfor most of the trip's expenses to the contractor, but Cruz's\n\nreimbursement check to the contractor's business proved otherwise.\n\n     The government asserted at the revocation hearing that the\n\ncumulative effect of the three discrepancies, together with the\n\nalleged perjury concerning Community, prompted its decision to end\n\nthe trial and dismiss the case against the remaining defendants,\n\nand also provided ample support for the decision to renounce\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fFajardo's plea agreement based on a breach of his obligation to\n\nprovide truthful information.\n\n       When it enters into a plea agreement, the government must\n\ncarry out the obligations it undertakes at least with the diligence\n\nit would bring to any contract.       United States v. Frazier, 340 F.3d\n\n5, 11 (lst Cir. 2003).       Technical compliance is not enough; \"[o]ur\n\ncase    law   prohibits     'not   only     explicit    repudiation      of     the\n\ngovernment's assurances, but must in the interests of fairness be\n\nread to forbid end-runs around them.'\"          Id. at 10 (quoting Saxena,\n\n229 F.3d at 6).      As we noted with respect to Cruz, however, a\n\ndefendant is not entitled to the benefit of his bargain if he does\n\nnot himself comply with the terms of the agreement.                 See Saxena,\n\n229 F.3d at 6.\n\n       Before we begin our analysis, we think it important to place\n\nin perspective the proper characterization of the breach issue.\n\nFajardo suggests     that    any   transgression       on   his   part   must   be\n\nimportant enough to justify nearly a doubling of his expected\n\nsentence from roughly six or seven years to about twelve-and-one-\n\nhalf years.    What he overlooks is that the sentence he received was\n\nwhat the guidelines normally would prescribe for the crimes he\n\ncommitted, albeit with a two-level increase for obstruction of\n\njustice.10    Only fidelity to his cooperation agreement, fulfilling\n\n\n       10\n        Fajardo was assigned base offense level 32, with Criminal\nHistory Category I, which resulted in a guideline sentencing range\nof 121 to 151 months. Without the obstruction of justice increase,\n\n                                     -20-\n\fall that the government reasonably could expect, entitled him to\n\nthe government's recommendation that the court halve the prison\n\nterm that otherwise could be imposed.               It is with this perspective\n\nthat we examine the record.\n\n       We are satisfied that the government had a sufficient basis,\n\nwithout relying on the alleged perjury concerning Community, for\n\nfinding      a    breach   by     Fajardo.     While    at    least    one   of   the\n\ngovernment's examples of untruthfulness – the Chicago expenses –\n\nseems a minor dereliction and, thus, an inadequate basis for\n\nrenouncing the plea agreement, and the seeming inconsistency on the\n\nrole    of   the     contractors     may     have   been    more    semantics     than\n\ncontradiction,11 we are still left with the unexplained admission\n\nthat Fajardo committed crimes – perhaps with Cruz – prior to 1994.\n\nAt the revocation hearing, the prosecutor termed the failure to\n\ndisclose         prior   crimes    \"crucial\"    and    \"a    breach   of   the    Plea\n\nAgreement, per se.\"\n\n       The record on that issue is far from ideal.                 At the revocation\n\nhearing, the government supported its claim that Fajardo previously\n\nhad lied about his pre-1994 activities by pointing to the list of\n\nprior bad acts it had provided to co-defendants pursuant to a July\n\n\nhis sentencing range would have been 97 to 121 months.                            See\nU.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table).\n       11\n       We so describe this issue because, as noted earlier, see\nsupra note 7, the government might have been able to proceed with\nits theory of the case by clarifying that the economic duress\noccurred at the outset of the scheme.\n\n                                        -21-\n\f2002 court order.    The government stated that, based on Fajardo's\n\nrepresentations, the list did not include any pre-1994 activity.\n\nThe list itself, and any evidence of communication from Fajardo\n\nunderlying it, should have been a part of the record on appeal in\n\nthis case.\n\n     Other factors, however, persuade us that this gap is not fatal\n\nto the government's effort to use the inconsistency on pre-1994\n\noffenses as a basis for breach of the plea agreement.           Although\n\nFajardo points to the lack of information on the nature of his\n\nearlier conduct, and speculates that it may have been minor, the\n\nexchange with counsel quoted above permits the inference that, like\n\nthe scheme at issue in this case, it involved illicit business\n\ndealings.     These other offenses were, quite clearly, not minor\n\npeccadillos.    In addition, Fajardo neither denies the conflict in\n\nhis statements nor offers clarification about the actual nature of\n\nsuch crimes. Moreover, his counsel neither sought a continuance of\n\nthe revocation hearing to develop information about the crimes nor,\n\nso far as the appellate record indicates, moved for reconsideration\n\non that basis following the court's order.             Every indicator,\n\ntherefore, points toward a conclusion that Fajardo misrepresented\n\nsignificant past criminal activity.\n\n     The substance and manner of Fajardo's testimony regarding his\n\nearlier,     previously   undisclosed    criminal   activity   cannot   be\n\ndismissed as trivial.      In the first place, the list of prior bad\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\facts supplied by Fajardo had been given to co-defendants, who would\n\nthus now have concrete proof for the jury of misrepresentation by\n\nthe government's key witness.    In the second place, this stain on\n\nhis credibility was worsened by his effort on multiple occasions\n\nduring cross-examination to avoid direct answers to questions.12\n\nIn the third place, the earlier quoted colloquy regarding his past\n\ncrimes indicates that Fajardo's less-than-forthcoming conduct was\n\nnot simple lapse of memory.     And, finally, the bland and evasive\n\nresponse regarding possible illegal activities with Cruz allowed\n\nthe inference that Cruz participated in the earlier criminal\n\nconduct as well, devaluing Cruz's still-to-come testimony.\n\n\n     12\n        Another example of Fajardo's sidestepping the specific\nquestion asked occurred during the exchange with counsel about\nwhether the contractors were under duress:\n\n     COUNSEL: And you knew, sir, that when you threatened\n     contractors with no contracts, those contractors whose\n     sole business was to provide educational services and\n     products, you were threatening them with death, weren't\n     you, sir?\n     FAJARDO: That's an opinion, sir.\n           COUNSEL to COURT: May I have an answer to that\n     question, Your Honor?\n           COURT: You mean economic death?\n     COUNSEL: Economic death, sir.\n     FAJARDO: Yes, sir.\n     . . .\n     COUNSEL: And you knew by the threats that you were\n     communicating to those contractors, you were, in essence,\n     threatening them with harming their employees and their\n     employment, didn't you, sir?\n     FAJARDO: Nobody complained when they were asked for the\n     money. Therefore, they would be the ones to give you the\n     answer.\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f      For these reasons, we conclude that the government reasonably\n\ncould treat Fajardo's dissembling on his past criminal activities\n\nas a matter of considerable consequence in the jury's assessment of\n\nhis credibility – and a substantial breach of the plea agreement.\n\nWe thus see no basis for disturbing the district court's sentencing\n\njudgment as to Fajardo.\n\n      At the same time, however, the government must be chastised\n\nfor the manner in which it achieved this result.                    The trial\n\ntranscript makes clear that Fajardo's testimony on Community –\n\nwhich the government viewed as perjury – was the primary basis for\n\nthe   decision    to    terminate   the   trial    and   seek   revocation   of\n\nFajardo's bail.        It is equally apparent from the transcript of the\n\nrevocation    hearing     that   Fajardo's   counsel     reasonably   had    the\n\nimpression that the government would be relying at the hearing only\n\non that alleged perjury to support the actions it had taken,\n\nincluding its announced renunciation of the plea agreement.                   By\n\nfailing to provide explicit and complete notice of its intentions\n\nfor the hearing, the government was considerably less forthcoming\n\nthan the circumstances warranted.            In short, providing advance\n\ninformation      only    about   matters     the    government    technically\n\nconsidered perjury, omitting its other untruthfulness concerns, was\n\nunnecessarily misleading.\n\n      We do not doubt the government's representation that the\n\nadditional untruthfulness issues, though unmentioned at the time,\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fplayed a role in its decision to dismiss the case.           Nor do we think\n\nthe lack of notice materially affected Fajardo's ability to defend\n\nagainst the government's claims (especially given the absence of\n\nany motion by Fajardo for a continuance). Nonetheless, in light of\n\nthe implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing that guides\n\nthe relationship of the parties in a plea agreement, see Frazier,\n\n340    F.3d at 11, the government should have informed Fajardo's\n\ncounsel    that   it   intended   to     broaden   the   justification      for\n\nrenouncing the agreement beyond what had been articulated at trial\n\nand in pre-hearing filings.       Its failure to do so did not deprive\n\nFajardo of any promised benefit – his own untruthfulness did that13\n\n– but it triggered unnecessary confusion and raised legitimate\n\nconcerns about the government's conduct.              The government in the\n\nfuture must make every effort to be more responsible in its\n\ncommunications.\n\n      Affirmed    in   part,   vacated   in   part,   and   remanded   to   the\n\ndistrict court for an order dismissing Count Five as to both\n\nappellants.\n\n\n\n\n      13\n       In fact, Fajardo's sentence may well have been unaffected\nby his breach of the agreement; the district court stated at\nFajardo's sentencing hearing that \"regardless of the untruthfulness\n. . . I would not have accepted this Plea Agreement.\"\n\n                                    -25-\n\f",

The government agrees that omission of an allegation that\nthe program received more than $10,000 in federal funds in a single\nyear renders the count insufficient, see 18 U.S.C. § 666(b), and\nconcedes that it therefore should be dismissed. Although Cruz did\nnot raise this issue, the government states that he is entitled to\nthe same action. Consequently, we direct the district court to\ndismiss Count Five as to both appellants.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fCruz   to     collaborate     in   a    scheme      to    extort      money    from   PRDE\n\ncontractors initially for the purpose of financing their political\n\nparty obligations and later for personal purposes.                            Among other\n\nactivities, the two administrators orchestrated the creation of a\n\ncorporation to act as a front for their illegal activities.                            The\n\ncorporation, Research & Management Group, Inc., submitted three\n\ncontract proposals totaling more than $4 million to the PRDE and\n\nalso generated false invoices seeking payments from other PRDE\n\ncontractors.        Fajardo approved the Research & Management contracts\n\nand    also    awarded    contracts       to    a    number      of   companies       whose\n\nprincipals – charged as co-defendants in the indictment – had made\n\npayments to         appellants.        Fajardo      and   Cruz     also   ordered      that\n\ninvoices for their political party activities be distributed to\n\nvarious PRDE contractors for payment.                     In addition to the cash\n\npayments extorted from the contractors between 1994 and 2001,\n\nappellants         received   \"items    for     personal      use.\"       Hundreds       of\n\nthousands of dollars in cash were kept in a safe in Fajardo's\n\noffice, and appellants dipped into it for various political and\n\npersonal purposes.\n\n       Appellants were charged in January 2002 with fifteen co-\n\ndefendants in an eight-count indictment.                    In February 2002, both\n\nmen pled guilty to three counts (Counts One, Five and Eight)\n\npursuant      to    non-binding    plea    and      cooperation       agreements       that\n\nspecified the sentencing calculations that the government would\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\frecommend and provided that the government would file motions for\n\ndownward departure if appellants provided substantial assistance in\n\nthe   investigation   or   prosecution   of   others.    For   Cruz,   the\n\nanticipated recommended sentence was set at 46-57 months; for\n\nFajardo, the recommendation was to be for 70-87 months.          Fajardo\n\npaid $1,352,000 in restitution before tendering his guilty plea;\n\nCruz agreed to forfeit $600,000, of which approximately $14,700 was\n\npaid before his cooperation agreement was signed.        Both testified\n\nbefore the Grand Jury and provided considerable information to\n\nauthorities about their own activities and the activities of\n\nothers.\n\n      In September 2002, Fajardo was called by the government as the\n\nfirst witness at the trial of three co-defendants.         On the fifth\n\nday of his testimony, during cross-examination, the trial was\n\naborted when the government accused Fajardo of committing perjury\n\nand moved to revoke his bond, requesting in addition that the case\n\nbe dismissed with prejudice as to all remaining defendants (the\n\nthree on trial as well as ten others).        The district court granted\n\nthe motions.   Maintaining that he had been truthful, Fajardo moved\n\nfor release on bail and also sought enforcement of the government's\n\nobligations under the plea agreement. Following a hearing in which\n\nthe court explored the government's allegations of untruthfulness,\n\nsee infra at 14-19, the court denied Fajardo's motions.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f       Sentencing for both appellants took place on December 11,\n\n2002.       Without any benefit from their plea agreements, their terms\n\npursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines were roughly twice as long as\n\nthey had hoped to receive.2         Fajardo was sentenced to a term of 151\n\nmonths on Counts One and Eight and 120 months to be served\n\nconcurrently on Count Five.             The court ordered restitution in the\n\namount of $4.3 million.        Cruz was sentenced to a term of 132 months\n\non the three counts, with the previously agreed upon forfeiture\n\namount of $600,000.         These appeals followed.\n\n                        II. Appeal of Cruz-Mercado\n\n       Cruz asserts generally that, in light of his substantial\n\nassistance to the government, he is entitled to be sentenced in\n\naccordance with his plea agreement.                Presumably recognizing that\n\nthe     district    court    was        not    bound   by    the   agreement,   he\n\nparticularizes that contention by identifying three specific flaws\n\nin    his    sentencing:    (1)    he    was    improperly    denied   a   downward\n\ndeparture for substantial assistance; (2) his sentence should not\n\nhave been calculated based on the total loss alleged in the\n\nindictment, $4.3 million; and (3) the court made several statements\n\nduring sentencing that reflected bias toward him.                  We address each\n\nin turn.\n\n\n\n       2\n       The government did not renounce Cruz's agreement, but\nsimply declined to move for a downward departure for substantial\nassistance. The court, however, refused to accept the agreement\nand instead imposed sentence without regard to it.\n\n                                          -6-\n\f       A. Downward Departure.          Under Cruz's plea agreement, the\n\ngovernment    was   obliged    to    move    for    downward    departure   under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 if prosecutors \"determine[d] that the defendant\n\nhas   provided   substantial        assistance      in   the   investigation    or\n\nprosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\"                   The\n\nagreement also provided that it was \"conditioned upon the defendant\n\nproviding full, complete, truthful and substantial cooperation,\"\n\nand that the government would be released from compliance if the\n\ndefendant failed \"in any way\" to fulfill his obligations.\n\n       Cruz acknowledged that, in one instance, he did not tell the\n\ntruth, admitting in a sentencing motion that he had \"failed to\n\nremember a 1996 check that became important at trial and crucial to\n\nthe position of the US Attorney.\"            He consequently stipulated to a\n\ntwo-level upward adjustment for obstruction of justice.\n\n       Cruz maintains that this single episode does not negate the\n\nextensive    cooperation   he    provided,       which    included   substantial\n\ntestimony before the Grand Jury and delivery of more than 150\n\nincriminating documents.        He notes that he would have testified at\n\ntrial as well had the proceedings not been cut short by the\n\ngovernment.\n\n       Although it appears that Cruz provided significant assistance\n\nin    the   prosecution   of    this   case,       his   cooperation   agreement\n\nexplicitly gave the government the authority not to request a\n\ndownward departure in the event Cruz failed to meet his obligation\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fto be truthful.        Cruz does not dispute his lack of veracity or the\n\nrelevance of his untruthfulness, seeking only to minimize its\n\nweight   in    light    of     his   otherwise          full    cooperation      with     the\n\ngovernment. Whether or not we agree with the government's judgment\n\nnot to recommend a downward departure is of no consequence.

The court therefore did not err\n\nin denying his motion.\n\n      B.   Calculation         of    Loss.     Cruz    maintains    that      the   court\n\nimproperly utilized the total loss alleged in the indictment, $4.3\n\nmillion, in calculating his sentence, resulting in an erroneous\n\nseven-level increase in his base offense level.                      See U.S.S.G. §\n\n2S1.1(b)(2)(H).3        He contends that his sentence should have been\n\nbased     on   the    amount    of    loss    attributed     to    him   in   his    plea\n\nagreement, $600,000, which would have triggered only a three-level\n\nincrease.\n\n      It is undisputed that Cruz was not personally implicated in\n\nthe   full     $4.3    million       loss    charged    in   the   indictment.         At\n\nsentencing, however, the district court expressed its view that\n\nCruz and Fajardo were equally culpable \"partners in crime.\"                           The\n\ncourt also noted that the factual allegations indicated that \"the\n\nmoney involved in the conspiracy significantly exceeded the 4.3\n\nmillion dollars reflected in the indictment,\" which simply was the\n\namount the government felt it could prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. Because of the scope of the scheme and appellant's admitted\n\n\n\n      3\n       The district court utilized the November 1, 2000 edition of\nthe Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n                                             -9-\n\fobstruction of justice, the court found that it was not bound by\n\nthe plea agreement and that a sentence at the high end of the\n\napplicable range, based on the full $4.3 million, was appropriate.\n\nThe court noted that there were grounds for imposing an upward\n\ndeparture, but decided against doing so.\n\n      Appellate review of a district court's application of the\n\nGuidelines typically involves a two-part inquiry: \"[W]e scrutinize\n\nthe district court's legal determinations . . . de novo and check\n\nits factual determinations for clear error.\"     Mateo, 271 F.3d at\n\n13.   Here, Cruz challenges the court's factual finding that he is\n\naccountable for the full $4.3 million loss.   We see no clear error\n\nin that judgment.   Cruz pled guilty to Count One, which charged a\n\nconspiracy to interfere with commerce by extortion, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).   Although Cruz did not participate in each act\n\nallegedly a part of the conspiracy, it is well established that co-\n\nconspirators may be sentenced based on all reasonably foreseeable\n\nacts of others in furtherance of the conspiracy – i.e., all\n\n\"relevant conduct\" under U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3.     See United States v.\n\nLaboy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200764\"><a href=\"/opinion/200764/united-states-v-laboy/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582-83 (lst Cir. 2003); USSG § 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).\n\nBased on Cruz's extensive involvement throughout the relevant six-\n\nyear period, as detailed in his plea and cooperation agreement, the\n\ncourt supportably found that he shared responsibility as a partner\n\nfor the full amount of the loss.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f     C. Judicial Bias.     Cruz claims that two comments by the\n\ndistrict judge, one at his sentencing hearing and the other at\n\nFajardo's bail revocation hearing, reflected bias sufficiently\n\nprejudicial to warrant his re-sentencing by another judge.        He\n\npoints to the judge's comment that Fajardo, Cruz and co-defendant\n\nRuperto Vazquez Lopez \"operated like mafiosos,\" particularly when\n\nthey allocated among themselves specific percentages of the illegal\n\nextortion and kickback proceeds they anticipated collecting.     Cruz\n\nalso challenges the judge's description of him as the \"enforcer\" in\n\nthe conspiracy.\n\n     We need not dwell on this issue. First, Cruz neither objected\n\nto these comments nor sought recusal of the trial judge based on\n\npartiality, limiting our review to assessing only whether plain\n\nerror occurred.   See, e.g., United States v. Arache, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569289\"><a href=\"/opinion/569289/united-states-v-frank-arache/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n140 (lst Cir. 1991).   Whatever one's view of the judge's rhetoric,\n\nwe think it beyond debate that it reflected a fact-based assessment\n\nof the type of conduct in which the defendants engaged and not a\n\nfundamentally unfair bias toward Cruz.\n\n     [J]udicial remarks during the course of a trial that are\n     critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel,\n     the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a\n     bias or partiality challenge. They may do so if they\n     reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial\n     source; and they will do so if they reveal such a high\n     degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair\n     judgment impossible.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fLiteky v.

The remarks here reveal neither, and Cruz's claim is\n\nthus unavailing.\n\n                   III. Appeal of Fajardo-Velez\n\n     Following an evidentiary hearing to explore the government's\n\nallegations that Fajardo had committed perjury and breached his\n\nplea agreement, the district court found that he was not entitled\n\nto enforcement of the agreement and subsequently concluded that his\n\nlack of truthfulness warranted an upward adjustment in his sentence\n\nfor obstruction of justice.    Fajardo claims that he must be re-\n\nsentenced because it was the government – not he – who breached the\n\nagreement, and because the court's imposition of a harsh sentence\n\nstemmed from violations of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.\n\n     The constitutional claims primarily arose from the district\n\ncourt's requirement that Fajardo answer a series of questions on\n\ncross-examination at his co-defendants' trial after he had invoked\n\nthe Fifth Amendment, without first allowing him to consult with his\n\nattorney.4   The questions concerned a company created by his wife\n\nand for which he served as board president, \"Community Services\n\nTraining Institute\" (\"Community\"), that was largely unconnected\n\n\n     4\n       Fajardo makes a general, undeveloped claim that he was\ndenied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel based on the district\ncourt's repeated admonition during his trial testimony that he not\nspeak to anyone, including counsel, about the case. The only time\nhe asked to speak with counsel, however, related to a matter not at\nissue on appeal, and we therefore do not further address this\ncontention.\n\n                               -12-\n\fwith the charged conspiracy but was the subject of a pending local\n\ninvestigation.    It was Fajardo's answers to those questions, which\n\nsought to link Community with Research & Management (the company\n\nformed to implement the extortion scheme), that prompted the\n\ngovernment's allegations of perjury and, in large part, triggered\n\ndismissal of the case.         The government acknowledges that the\n\ntestimony elicited after Fajardo invoked his Fifth Amendment rights\n\nwas   \"improperly    received,\"     but   it   correctly   points   out   that\n\nFajardo's statements about Community ultimately played no role in\n\nhis sentencing.      The district court relied on other factors to\n\nconclude   that     Fajardo   had   breached     the   plea   agreement    and\n\nobstructed justice, and we therefore need not address the substance\n\nof the constitutional claims.\n\n      Instead, we consider the three instances of untruthfulness on\n\nwhich the district court did rely – which we will detail shortly –\n\nand conclude that the court did not err in finding that Fajardo\n\nbreached the plea agreement.5       As we explain below, however, we are\n\ntroubled by the manner in which the government achieved this\n\nresult.    We begin our discussion with some additional procedural\n\nbackground.\n\n\n\n      5\n         We review a district court's factual findings concerning\na plea agreement only for clear error, but \"whether [undisputed]\nconduct constituted a breach of the plea agreement is a question of\nlaw subject to plenary review,\" United States v.

The parties addressed the alleged\n\nperjury concerning Community and, for the first time on the record,\n\nthe   government        identified      three     additional        instances    of\n\nuntruthfulness that it claimed justified withdrawal of the plea\n\nagreement, supported an enhancement for obstruction of justice, and\n\ncontributed to the decision to end the trial and dismiss the case\n\nagainst the remaining defendants.\n\n      At   the    end   of    the   hearing,    the   court   ordered   Fajardo's\n\ncontinued detention.           A month later, the court issued an order\n\nfinding that the government had met its burden of proving by a\n\npreponderance      of   the    evidence    that   Fajardo     had   substantially\n\nbreached his obligation under the plea agreement \"'to provide\n\ntruthful, complete and accurate testimony and information.'\" See\n\nUnited States v. Tilley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583578\"><a href=\"/opinion/583578/united-states-v-ronald-e-tilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (lst Cir. 1992).                       The\n\ncourt thus released the government from its obligations under the\n\nagreement.       The court based its decision on the three alternative\n\nincidents of alleged untruthfulness, declining to address whether\n\nFajardo's testimony on Community constituted perjury.\n\n      The court relied on the following discrepancies: (1) Fajardo's\n\nacknowledgment on cross-examination that he had committed criminal\n\nacts before 1994, the year he became Secretary of Education,\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fallegedly contradicted a prior statement to prosecutors that his\n\ncriminal activity began when he assumed that position; (2) his\n\ntestimony that a co-defendant contractor had financed a trip to\n\nChicago conflicted with subsequently obtained documentary evidence\n\nshowing that Cruz had reimbursed the contractor for the expenses;\n\nand (3) his testimony on cross-examination indicating that the co-\n\ndefendant contractors participated in the scheme under economic\n\nduress allegedly differed from earlier statements to prosecutors\n\nthat the contractors were collaborators in a mutual business\n\nundertaking.\n\n     Fajardo claims that, because the government was unable to\n\nsubstantiate the alleged perjury regarding Community, it contrived\n\nthese three inaccuracies as an alternative way to make him the\n\nscapegoat    for   its    flawed     investigation   and   prosecution.      He\n\ncomplains that these \"vague and unannounced\" allegations \"blind-\n\nsided\" his     counsel    at   the    revocation    hearing.     Moreover,   he\n\nmaintains that none of the three claims has merit.\n\n     On the alleged contradiction regarding the use of economic\n\nduress against the contractors, Fajardo asserts that he testified\n\ntruthfully    in   response    to     technically    framed    questions   that\n\nmirrored the language of the indictment, his plea agreement and the\n\ncharging statute.6       Any problem, he insists, is attributable to the\n\n\n     6\n       Count One of the indictment alleged a \"conspiracy to\ninterfere with commerce by extortion induced by economic fear\nand/or color of official right,\" in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18\n\n                                       -15-\n\fgovernment's ill-conceived case; at the revocation hearing, his\n\nattorney observed that bribery might have been a more appropriate\n\ncharge than one requiring fear of economic harm.              Moreover,\n\nFajardo points out, he was denied any opportunity to explain his\n\nanswers   –   and,   indeed,   the    government   acknowledged   at   the\n\nrevocation hearing that it initially anticipated being able to\n\nrehabilitate Fajardo on the issue of duress on redirect. See infra\n\nat 17.7   As for payment of the Chicago expenses, Fajardo discounts\n\nthe importance of any error in his recollection of that one\n\nparticular trip in light of the contractor's payments on his behalf\n\non other occasions.     And on the pre-1994 crimes, Fajardo asserts\n\nthat he again was not given an opportunity to explain his answer\n\nand notes that such crimes may have been only \"irrelevant juvenile\n\nor petty offenses.\"\n\n     At the revocation hearing, the government denied any attempt\n\nto ambush Fajardo's counsel.         The prosecutor stated that counsel\n\n\nU.S.C. § 1951. Under the statute, \"extortion\" is defined as \"the\nobtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by\nwrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or\nunder color of official right.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). In cross-\nexamination, when asked if the requests for funds from the\ncontractors were made \"with the threats that if they didn't make\nthem, it would be economic death,\" Fajardo replied, \"Yes, sir.\"\nThis reply was one of several acknowledging that consent from the\ncontractors was \"wrongfully induced by fear of economic harm.\"\n     7\n       Presumably, the government would have pursued its theory\nthat the contractors initially were the victims of economic duress,\nbut later became willing participants, and thus aiders and\nabettors, in the scheme. Whether or not this is a viable theory is\nnot before us.\n\n                                     -16-\n\fpreviously had been told of the government's other untruthfulness\n\nconcerns,    and   he   explained   that   those   issues   had   not   been\n\nhighlighted in advance of the hearing because the government had\n\nbeen asked specifically to identify and substantiate only its\n\nperjury allegations – not instances of untruthfulness outside the\n\ncourtroom.    Because the government assumed that Fajardo's trial\n\ntestimony on the three additional matters was true, and that his\n\nearlier statements, during debriefing sessions, had been false, the\n\ngovernment viewed the incidents as involving untruthfulness, but\n\nnot perjury.8\n\n     The prosecutor also explained in some detail how these three\n\nmatters affected the government's view of the viability of its\n\ncase.    Initially, he reported, the government had been taken aback\n\nby Fajardo's answers on cross-examination indicating that the\n\ncontractors were threatened with \"economic death\" if they did not\n\ncooperate.    The prosecutor reported that he phoned his supervisors\n\nduring the next recess to alert them to the problem and was\n\ninstructed to try to rehabilitate Fajardo on redirect.\n\n     According to the prosecutor, however, that plan fell apart in\n\nthe face of several developments affecting Fajardo's credibility.\n\n\n     8\n       We note that, unlike the cross-examination testimony on\neconomic duress and prior crimes, which differed from what the\ngovernment claimed it was earlier told, Fajardo's testimony about\nthe Chicago trip apparently matched the government's expectations.\nIt differed, however, from the documentary evidence produced by co-\ndefendant's counsel and thus presumably should have been viewed as\nfalse testimony by the government.\n\n                                    -17-\n\fFirst, to the government's surprise, Fajardo invoked the Fifth\n\nAmendment to avoid answering questions about his activities with\n\nCommunity.9   The prosecutor noted that \"[h]e never told us he was\n\ngoing to have a problem with any questions concerning this matter.\"\n\nThen, Fajardo admitted that he had committed crimes before 1994;\n\nhis exchange with co-defendant's counsel, reproduced in relevant\n\npart below, suggests that such activity was not trivial:\n\n     COUNSEL: Now, you had done prior illegal activities,\n     didn't you, before the facts that are detailed in the\n     indictment, weren't you?\n     FAJARDO: Such as, sir?\n     COUNSEL: I'm asking you, were you or were you not\n     involved in any illegal activities prior to 1994, 1995?\n     FAJARDO: If I were to answer yes or no, that would\n     require an explanation.\n\n     Fajardo was then directed by the court to answer yes or\n     no.\n\n     FAJARDO: My answer is yes, sir.\n     COUNSEL: In other words, you're telling this jury that\n     prior to 1994, you were involved in other illegal\n     activities; is that correct?\n     FAJARDO: Yes, sir.\n     . . .\n     COUNSEL: It involved illegal activities between you and\n     Omar Cruz; is that correct? Yes or no.\n     FAJARDO: Specifically Jose Omar Cruz?\n     COUNSEL: Yes.\n     FAJARDO: Right now, I don't know.\n     COUNSEL: You don't recall?\n     FAJARDO: I don't recall.\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       Although the court initially allowed Fajardo to deflect the\nquestions about Community, the court later required him to answer,\nand his responses triggered the government's allegations of\nperjury.   As noted earlier, however, that testimony was not a\nfactor in the court's disposition.\n\n                               -18-\n\f     Counsel then continued by asking Fajardo if his wife was\n\ninvolved in those activities, and Fajardo replied, \"In order to say\n\nyes, I need to acknowledge what it is that we're talking about.\"\n\nThen, when asked what he did illegally before 1994, he replied,\n\n\"[I]t depends on what you consider to be illegal, I may not\n\nconsider it to be illegal.\"     Counsel then asked if the activities\n\ninvolved   Community,   and   Fajardo      said,   \"I    cannot     answer   that\n\nquestion   categorically.\"      The     exchange        continued    with    more\n\nquestions about Community, to which Fajardo at times replied by\n\ninvoking his Fifth Amendment right not to answer.\n\n     Fajardo's   admission     of     earlier      criminal       activity    was\n\nparticularly troublesome for the government because the exchange\n\nwith counsel allowed an inference of involvement by Cruz, the\n\ngovernment's other key witness. And the final inconsistency – the\n\nmatter of who paid for the Chicago trip – similarly impacted the\n\ncredibility of both Fajardo and Cruz.         Both had attributed payment\n\nfor most of the trip's expenses to the contractor, but Cruz's\n\nreimbursement check to the contractor's business proved otherwise.\n\n     The government asserted at the revocation hearing that the\n\ncumulative effect of the three discrepancies, together with the\n\nalleged perjury concerning Community, prompted its decision to end\n\nthe trial and dismiss the case against the remaining defendants,\n\nand also provided ample support for the decision to renounce\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fFajardo's plea agreement based on a breach of his obligation to\n\nprovide truthful information.\n\n       When it enters into a plea agreement, the government must\n\ncarry out the obligations it undertakes at least with the diligence\n\nit would bring to any contract.       United States v. Frazier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200600\"><a href=\"/opinion/200600/united-states-v-frazier/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (lst Cir. 2003).       Technical compliance is not enough; \"[o]ur\n\ncase    law   prohibits     'not   only     explicit    repudiation      of     the\n\ngovernment's assurances, but must in the interests of fairness be\n\nread to forbid end-runs around them.'\"          Id. at 10 (quoting Saxena,\n\n229 F.3d at 6).      As we noted with respect to Cruz, however, a\n\ndefendant is not entitled to the benefit of his bargain if he does\n\nnot himself comply with the terms of the agreement.                 See Saxena,\n\n229 F.3d at 6.\n\n       Before we begin our analysis, we think it important to place\n\nin perspective the proper characterization of the breach issue.\n\nFajardo suggests     that    any   transgression       on   his   part   must   be\n\nimportant enough to justify nearly a doubling of his expected\n\nsentence from roughly six or seven years to about twelve-and-one-\n\nhalf years.    What he overlooks is that the sentence he received was\n\nwhat the guidelines normally would prescribe for the crimes he\n\ncommitted, albeit with a two-level increase for obstruction of\n\njustice.10    Only fidelity to his cooperation agreement, fulfilling\n\n\n       10\n        Fajardo was assigned base offense level 32, with Criminal\nHistory Category I, which resulted in a guideline sentencing range\nof 121 to 151 months. Without the obstruction of justice increase,\n\n                                     -20-\n\fall that the government reasonably could expect, entitled him to\n\nthe government's recommendation that the court halve the prison\n\nterm that otherwise could be imposed.               It is with this perspective\n\nthat we examine the record.\n\n       We are satisfied that the government had a sufficient basis,\n\nwithout relying on the alleged perjury concerning Community, for\n\nfinding      a    breach   by     Fajardo.     While    at    least    one   of   the\n\ngovernment's examples of untruthfulness – the Chicago expenses –\n\nseems a minor dereliction and, thus, an inadequate basis for\n\nrenouncing the plea agreement, and the seeming inconsistency on the\n\nrole    of   the     contractors     may     have   been    more    semantics     than\n\ncontradiction,11 we are still left with the unexplained admission\n\nthat Fajardo committed crimes – perhaps with Cruz – prior to 1994.\n\nAt the revocation hearing, the prosecutor termed the failure to\n\ndisclose         prior   crimes    \"crucial\"    and    \"a    breach   of   the    Plea\n\nAgreement, per se.\"\n\n       The record on that issue is far from ideal.                 At the revocation\n\nhearing, the government supported its claim that Fajardo previously\n\nhad lied about his pre-1994 activities by pointing to the list of\n\nprior bad acts it had provided to co-defendants pursuant to a July\n\n\nhis sentencing range would have been 97 to 121 months.                            See\nU.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table).\n       11\n       We so describe this issue because, as noted earlier, see\nsupra note 7, the government might have been able to proceed with\nits theory of the case by clarifying that the economic duress\noccurred at the outset of the scheme.\n\n                                        -21-\n\f2002 court order.    The government stated that, based on Fajardo's\n\nrepresentations, the list did not include any pre-1994 activity.\n\nThe list itself, and any evidence of communication from Fajardo\n\nunderlying it, should have been a part of the record on appeal in\n\nthis case.\n\n     Other factors, however, persuade us that this gap is not fatal\n\nto the government's effort to use the inconsistency on pre-1994\n\noffenses as a basis for breach of the plea agreement.           Although\n\nFajardo points to the lack of information on the nature of his\n\nearlier conduct, and speculates that it may have been minor, the\n\nexchange with counsel quoted above permits the inference that, like\n\nthe scheme at issue in this case, it involved illicit business\n\ndealings.     These other offenses were, quite clearly, not minor\n\npeccadillos.    In addition, Fajardo neither denies the conflict in\n\nhis statements nor offers clarification about the actual nature of\n\nsuch crimes. Moreover, his counsel neither sought a continuance of\n\nthe revocation hearing to develop information about the crimes nor,\n\nso far as the appellate record indicates, moved for reconsideration\n\non that basis following the court's order.             Every indicator,\n\ntherefore, points toward a conclusion that Fajardo misrepresented\n\nsignificant past criminal activity.\n\n     The substance and manner of Fajardo's testimony regarding his\n\nearlier,     previously   undisclosed    criminal   activity   cannot   be\n\ndismissed as trivial.      In the first place, the list of prior bad\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\facts supplied by Fajardo had been given to co-defendants, who would\n\nthus now have concrete proof for the jury of misrepresentation by\n\nthe government's key witness.    In the second place, this stain on\n\nhis credibility was worsened by his effort on multiple occasions\n\nduring cross-examination to avoid direct answers to questions.12\n\nIn the third place, the earlier quoted colloquy regarding his past\n\ncrimes indicates that Fajardo's less-than-forthcoming conduct was\n\nnot simple lapse of memory.     And, finally, the bland and evasive\n\nresponse regarding possible illegal activities with Cruz allowed\n\nthe inference that Cruz participated in the earlier criminal\n\nconduct as well, devaluing Cruz's still-to-come testimony.\n\n\n     12\n        Another example of Fajardo's sidestepping the specific\nquestion asked occurred during the exchange with counsel about\nwhether the contractors were under duress:\n\n     COUNSEL: And you knew, sir, that when you threatened\n     contractors with no contracts, those contractors whose\n     sole business was to provide educational services and\n     products, you were threatening them with death, weren't\n     you, sir?\n     FAJARDO: That's an opinion, sir.\n           COUNSEL to COURT: May I have an answer to that\n     question, Your Honor?\n           COURT: You mean economic death?\n     COUNSEL: Economic death, sir.\n     FAJARDO: Yes, sir.\n     . . .\n     COUNSEL: And you knew by the threats that you were\n     communicating to those contractors, you were, in essence,\n     threatening them with harming their employees and their\n     employment, didn't you, sir?\n     FAJARDO: Nobody complained when they were asked for the\n     money. Therefore, they would be the ones to give you the\n     answer.\n\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f      For these reasons, we conclude that the government reasonably\n\ncould treat Fajardo's dissembling on his past criminal activities\n\nas a matter of considerable consequence in the jury's assessment of\n\nhis credibility – and a substantial breach of the plea agreement.\n\nWe thus see no basis for disturbing the district court's sentencing\n\njudgment as to Fajardo.\n\n      At the same time, however, the government must be chastised\n\nfor the manner in which it achieved this result.                    The trial\n\ntranscript makes clear that Fajardo's testimony on Community –\n\nwhich the government viewed as perjury – was the primary basis for\n\nthe   decision    to    terminate   the   trial    and   seek   revocation   of\n\nFajardo's bail.        It is equally apparent from the transcript of the\n\nrevocation    hearing     that   Fajardo's   counsel     reasonably   had    the\n\nimpression that the government would be relying at the hearing only\n\non that alleged perjury to support the actions it had taken,\n\nincluding its announced renunciation of the plea agreement.                   By\n\nfailing to provide explicit and complete notice of its intentions\n\nfor the hearing, the government was considerably less forthcoming\n\nthan the circumstances warranted.            In short, providing advance\n\ninformation      only    about   matters     the    government    technically\n\nconsidered perjury, omitting its other untruthfulness concerns, was\n\nunnecessarily misleading.\n\n      We do not doubt the government's representation that the\n\nadditional untruthfulness issues, though unmentioned at the time,\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fplayed a role in its decision to dismiss the case.           Nor do we think\n\nthe lack of notice materially affected Fajardo's ability to defend\n\nagainst the government's claims (especially given the absence of\n\nany motion by Fajardo for a continuance). Nonetheless, in light of\n\nthe implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing that guides\n\nthe relationship of the parties in a plea agreement, see Frazier,\n\n340    F.3d at 11, the government should have informed Fajardo's\n\ncounsel    that   it   intended   to     broaden   the   justification      for\n\nrenouncing the agreement beyond what had been articulated at trial\n\nand in pre-hearing filings.       Its failure to do so did not deprive\n\nFajardo of any promised benefit – his own untruthfulness did that13\n\n– but it triggered unnecessary confusion and raised legitimate\n\nconcerns about the government's conduct.              The government in the\n\nfuture must make every effort to be more responsible in its\n\ncommunications.\n\n      Affirmed    in   part,   vacated   in   part,   and   remanded   to   the\n\ndistrict court for an order dismissing Count Five as to both\n\nappellants.\n\n\n\n\n      13\n       In fact, Fajardo's sentence may well have been unaffected\nby his breach of the agreement; the district court stated at\nFajardo's sentencing hearing that \"regardless of the untruthfulness\n. . . I would not have accepted this Plea Agreement.\"\n\n                                    -25-\n\f</pre>",
