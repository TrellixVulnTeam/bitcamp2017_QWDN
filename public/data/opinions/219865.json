Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                      Souter, Associate Justice,*\n                       and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Michael J. Sheehan for appellant.\n     Seth R. Aframe, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nJohn P. Kacavas, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                June 28, 2011\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          The Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f     SOUTER, Associate Justice. The appellant, Jayson Fulcher, was\n\nconvicted of attempted bank robbery and sentenced to a 144-month\n\nterm of imprisonment after being found to be a career offender as\n\ndefined by the Sentencing Guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, and thus\n\nsubject to an enhanced, advisory guideline range of 210-262 months.\n\nCareer offender status requires, among other things, two prior\n\nfelony convictions for crimes of violence or controlled substance\n\noffenses, and Fulcher excepts to the classification of a New\n\nHampshire witness tampering conviction as a crime of violence under\n\nthe three-part Guidelines definition: (1) a crime with an element\n\nof actual, attempted or threatened use of force; (2) burglary of a\n\ndwelling, arson, extortion or criminal use of explosives; or (3) a\n\ncrime that \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious\n\npotential     risk   of   physical      injury      to   another.\"        U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4B1.2(a).    He points out that under the relevant portion of the\n\nwitness tampering provision, guilt requires only that the defendant\n\n\"attempt[] to induce or otherwise cause\" a witness to deny or\n\nconceal the truth.        See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 641:5(I).              It is\n\nthus not defined to include a force element; it is not one of the\n\nenumerated    offenses;     and    it   is    not    \"otherwise\"     an   offense\n\npresenting the requisite risk of personal injury.                Fulcher pressed\n\nthese   arguments    in   the     district    court,     which   overruled    his\n\nobjection and treated the New Hampshire conviction as being for a\n\nviolent felony.       The government defends the district judge's\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fconclusion and argues that, in any case, the 12-year duration of\n\nhis sentence was determined independently of the career offender\n\nclassification and should be affirmed for that reason. Because the\n\nissues implicated in the arguments over application of the residual\n\n\"otherwise\" clause are not developed in the briefs, we affirm on\n\nthe    government's       alternate      ground     that    the    sentence      was   not\n\naffected by the district court's career offender determination.\n\n       At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge said that applying\n\nthe Guidelines \"formulaically . . . often distorts things in terms\n\nof the facts of an individual case,\" as he found to be true in this\n\none. He spoke of Fulcher's criminal history beginning with charges\n\nwhen   he    was     19   and    spanning     his   entire       adult   life,    with    a\n\nrepetitive sequence of conviction, incarceration, parole violation,\n\nand further offense.             The \"real problem . . . isn't the career\n\noffender [status].              It's the      . . . criminal history of this\n\nparticular individual . . . .\" After observing the ineffectiveness\n\nof the prior sentences to deter the defendant's drug use and noting\n\nthe seriousness of the current offense, and after colloquies with\n\ncounsel and the defendant, the court settled on a sentence 39\n\nmonths      higher    than      the   upper   end   of     the    advisory    range      as\n\ndetermined without a career offender finding, and 66 months beneath\n\nthe minimum for someone in the career offender column.                        The judge\n\npaid pointed attention to the object of resolving Fulcher's drug\n\nproblem, and after announcing the sentence the judge referred\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fexpressly to the sentencing considerations mandated by 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a).    He summed up by stating that the 144-month term was\n\n\"sufficient     but   not   more   than   necessary\"   to   take   those\n\nconsiderations \"into account.\"1\n\n     There is consequently no reason to believe that the sentence\n\nwas affected by the career offender classification, see United\n\nStates v. Gerhard, 615 F.3d 7, 35 (1st Cir. 2010), and the\n\njudgement is affirmed on the ground that if any error did occur it\n\nwas harmless.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n     Fulcher raised no question about the pertinence of the\ncourt's concerns under § 3553(a) and related statutes.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
