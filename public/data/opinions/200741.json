Petitioner Mohamed Jamal\n\nKrazoun appeals from a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision\n\nwhich rejected his motion to reopen his deportation proceedings in\n\norder to determine whether he is entitled to permanent resident\n\nstatus based upon his September 2001 marriage to a permanent United\n\nStates resident.     We affirm the BIA decision.\n\n                                      I\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\n           Krazoun, a native and citizen of Syria, initially entered\n\nthe United States on a student visa in 1979.          In 1983, he married\n\na United States citizen, Magnolia Arungo-Garcia, who petitioned the\n\nINS for a relative visa in Krazoun’s behalf.           However, after she\n\nhad been subjected to verbal abuse, harassment, and threats from\n\nKrazoun,   Arungo-Garcia    obtained       a   restraining    order   against\n\nKrazoun, and withdrew her pending INS petition.              One year later,\n\nthe couple divorced.\n\n           In late 1989, Krazoun met Georgia Balesteri, a United\n\nStates citizen; the two married in January 1990.              In July 1990,\n\nBalesteri likewise obtained a restraining order against Krazoun,\n\nand the couple ceased living together. Nonetheless, in March 1991,\n\nbased   upon   his   marriage   to   Balesteri,     Krazoun    adjusted   his\n\nimmigration status to that of conditional permanent resident.             See\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1186a(a), (g)(1).         Had the marriage endured for two\n\nyears (i.e., until March 1993), Krazoun and Balesteri would have\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fbecome entitled to petition the INS to adjust Krazoun's immigration\n\nstatus to that of permanent resident.            See id. at § 1186a(c),\n\n(d)(1).\n\n              In January 1993, Balesteri and Krazoun jointly submitted\n\na motion attesting that they were continuing to cohabit.             Although\n\nthe joint motion purportedly contained Balesteri's signature, the\n\nsignature did not appear to match other samples of her handwriting.\n\nIn addition, Balesteri failed to appear for three separate INS\n\ninterviews at which she was to provide support for the joint\n\nmotion.       Moreover, Krazoun himself misled INS interviewers to\n\nbelieve that (i) he continued to cohabit with Balesteri, and (ii)\n\nthat Balesteri would appear at subsequent INS interviews, see 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1186a(c)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 216.4(b).           Eventually, the INS\n\nterminated     the   conditional   resident   status    previously    granted\n\nKrazoun. After Balesteri finally filed for divorce from Krazoun in\n\nMay   1994,    the   INS   initiated    deportation    proceedings    against\n\nKrazoun.\n\n              In November 1994, an immigration judge (IJ) ruled Krazoun\n\ndeportable.       At the same time, Krazoun moved to continue the\n\ndeportation proceedings so he could obtain an INS waiver of the\n\nrequirement that he and Balesteri submit a joint petition to remove\n\nhis conditional resident status, on the basis that Krazoun had\n\nentered into the 1990 marriage with Balesteri in “good faith,” that\n\nit was not a sham marriage but instead had terminated for other\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\freasons.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4) (waiver requirements).           As no\n\ndivorce decree had yet been entered, however, the IJ denied the\n\nrequest, whereupon Krazoun appealed to the BIA.           Due to the fact\n\nthat Krazoun's divorce became final in July 1995, however, the BIA\n\nremanded to the IJ to direct the INS to rule upon Krazoun’s waiver\n\napplication.\n\n           The INS denied the waiver application, finding (i) that\n\nKrazoun had fraudulently concealed the fact that his 1990 marriage\n\nto a permanent resident was a sham; and (ii) on occasion Krazoun\n\nhad stated that he lived with Balesteri until April 1993, yet at\n\nother times he said until September 1993; whereas Balesteri’s May\n\n1994 divorce complaint represented that the two had ceased living\n\ntogether in July 1990, and Balesteri’s mother asserted that they\n\nhad never lived together at all following their marriage.\n\n           When the deportation proceedings resumed before the IJ in\n\nJanuary 1998, Krazoun testified that (i) Balesteri lived with him,\n\nfrom time to time, until March 1993; (ii) Balesteri lived with him\n\nfrom mid-to-late-1992; and (iii) even though Balesteri previously\n\nhad submitted an affidavit attesting that the two had met in “the\n\nlate winter of 1989,\" viz., shortly before their marriage, Krazoun\n\nfirst met Balesteri in October 1988.           Moreover, Krazoun's brother\n\ntestified that Krazoun and Balesteri had lived together for only\n\nsix or seven months after their marriage.\n\n           The   IJ   sustained   the   1994    termination   of   Krazoun’s\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fconditional residence status by the INS, as well as its denial of\n\nKrazoun's waiver petition, then ordered that Krazoun be deported.\n\nIn addition, the IJ specifically found that Krazoun had married\n\nboth Arungo-Garcia and Balesteri for the purpose of evading the\n\nUnited States immigration laws, based on the evidence that (i)\n\nKrazoun had misled the INS by stating that his wife would appear\n\nfor the August 1993 INS interview, given that he testified at the\n\nhearing that he had ceased living with her in April 1993; (ii)\n\nKrazoun’s prior statements to the INS – viz., that he had lived\n\nwith Balesteri until September 1993 – were contradicted by the\n\ndates set forth in Balesteri’s divorce action complaint (i.e.,\n\nuntil July 1990) and by Krazoun’s own brother (i.e., until June-\n\nJuly 1990); and (iii) both of Krazoun’s former spouses, Arungo-\n\nGarcia and Balesteri, had obtained restraining orders against him\n\nshortly after their respective marriages.         After hearing Krazoun\n\ntestify and observing his demeanor, the IJ found that Krazoun\n\nlacked credibility, and that he would “lie to get what he wants.”\n\nThe BIA summarily affirmed the IJ’s decision in May 2002.           Krazoun\n\ndid not petition for review.\n\n          Moreover,   Krazoun   had    married   another   United   States\n\ncitizen, Janice Gittino, in September 2001.       In June 2002, Krazoun\n\npetitioned the BIA to reopen his case, claiming that this third\n\nmarriage was bona fide and that he and Gittino were expecting a\n\nchild in October 2002.    The BIA rejected the Krazoun motion to\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\freopen on two grounds.      First, without regard to whether the\n\nputative third marriage might entitle Krazoun to relief from\n\ndeportation, the BIA decided to exercise its broad discretion not\n\nto reopen, due to Krazoun’s demonstrated history of having entered\n\ninto two previous marriages with the fraudulent intention to evade\n\nthe immigration laws. Second, the BIA noted that Krazoun had never\n\nproduced an approved visa petition – a condition precedent to the\n\nrequested relief – and had failed to adduce clear and convincing\n\nevidence that the third marriage he entered into was bona fide.\n\nKrazoun now petitions for review.\n\n                                 II\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n           Krazoun contends that the BIA erred in not granting the\n\nmotion to reopen, in that (i) Krazoun adduced clear and convincing\n\nevidence that his third marriage was bona fide, which included the\n\nrecent birth certificate of the couple’s first child; (ii) the\n\nfinding of fact made by the IJ in 1998 – that Krazoun’s first\n\nmarriage to Arungo-Garcia was fraudulent – was belied by the\n\nevidence that Arungo-Garcia needed a protective restraining order\n\nto curb the violence in their marriage relationship; and (iii) the\n\ndenial of discretionary relief by the BIA conflicts with the\n\nlegislative policy disfavoring deportations which divide families.\n\n           As we have observed previously, the strong public policy\n\nfavoring   expeditious   deportation   proceedings   plainly   bespeaks\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fdisfavor of motions to reopen.           See Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d\n\n13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).          Thus, the BIA's denial of the Krazoun\n\nmotion to reopen was proper, provided either that (i) Krazoun\n\nfailed to establish the bona fides of his third marriage, entered\n\ninto after the IJ’s 1998 decision, see In re Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I.\n\n& N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002) (requiring that alien “present[]\n\nclear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that\n\n[his] marriage [during pending deportation proceedings] is bona\n\nfide”); 8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a) (same); or (ii) regardless whether he\n\nproved that his third marriage was bona fide, the BIA, in its\n\ndiscretion, denied Krazoun an adjustment of status, and that\n\ndecision was neither arbitrary and capricious nor predicated upon\n\na misinterpretation of applicable law.               See Fesseha, 333 F.3d at\n\n20; see also INS v. Rios-Pineda, 471 U.S. 444, 449 (1985); 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 3.2(a) (\"The Board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even\n\nif the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\").1\n\n             As   our   statement       of    the    background      facts   amply\n\ndemonstrates, supra, the BIA decision denying the motion to open\n\nmust be affirmed.        Krazoun plainly failed to present clear and\n\nconvincing    evidence    that    his    third      marriage   was    bona   fide.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The BIA also denied Krazoun’s motion because his pending\nrelative visa petition had not been approved, a distinct\nprerequisite to a motion to reopen. See In re Velarde-Pacheco, 23\nI. & N. Dec. at 256. Because we find ample alternative substantive\ngrounds to uphold the BIA’s decision, see infra, we bypass this\nissue.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fAlthough he unquestionably documented the fact that he married\n\nGittino in June 2002, the pertinent issue before the BIA was not\n\nwhether Krazoun had married for the third time, but whether he did\n\nso once again with the intent to evade the immigration laws and to\n\ndelay and impede imminent deportation.         There can be no genuine\n\nquestion that the two earlier fraudulent marriages into which\n\nKrazoun entered, with intent to evade the immigration laws, gave\n\nrise to   a   common-sense   inference,   as   well   as   the   legitimate\n\nsuspicion, that Krazoun's third marriage – more likely than not –\n\nhad been entered into with the same illegitimate aim.2\n\n          Moreover, Krazoun’s contention – that the bona fides of\n\nthe first marriage was demonstrated by Arungo-Garcia’s need to\n\nobtain a restraining order to stem the violence in their marriage\n\nrelationship – may have been appropriate argumentation before the\n\nIJ in 1998, but nothing in the present record compelled the IJ to\n\ndraw so curious a conclusion.    See Oliva-Muralles v. Ashcroft, 328\n\nF.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that IJ’s findings of fact may\n\n\n\n     2\n      In addition to exposing himself to the risk of criminal\nprosecution, Krazoun’s perjury would disqualify him from other\ndiscretionary relief, such as suspension of deportation or\nvoluntary departure. See, e.g., Opere v. INS, 267 F.3d 10, 13-14\n(1st Cir. 2001) (noting that any alien who, within seven years\nbefore his application for suspension of deportation, has given\nfalse testimony for the purpose of obtaining any immigration\nbenefit is precluded from proving “good moral character,” and thus\nis ineligible for a suspension of deportation).        It is not\nsurprising, therefore, that the Krazoun motion to reopen did not\nseek reconsideration of the earlier denial of his applications for\nsuspension and voluntary departure.\n\n                                  -8-\n\fbe set aside only if \"the evidence is so compelling that no\n\nreasonable     fact-finder   could     fail   to   reach     the   contrary\n\nconclusion\").    Insofar as there was conflicting evidence, we would\n\naccord the IJ’s credibility determinations great deference.             See\n\nMendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir. 1999).                  Even these\n\nformidable standards of review are no longer applicable, however,\n\ninasmuch as Krazoun did not petition this court in 1998 for review\n\nof the IJ’s factual findings.         Accordingly, this matter neither\n\nconstitutes “new” material evidence, see INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S.\n\n314, 323 (1992), nor provides a basis for the instant motion to\n\nreopen.   See Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 20.\n\n          Finally, even assuming we were to conclude that Krazoun\n\nadduced clear and convincing evidence that the third marriage was\n\nother than a sham, it nonetheless remains that the BIA acted well\n\nwithin its discretion in bypassing such an inquiry and denying\n\nKrazoun a discretionary adjustment of status, based exclusively\n\nupon his history of recurrent immigration fraud.           See Doherty, 502\n\nU.S. at 322.    Krazoun's prior violations were not only flagrant,\n\nbut accompanied by abusive threats to his first two spouses.           See\n\nGuan v. INS, 49 F.3d 1259, 1262-63 (7th Cir. 1995) (affirming BIA’s\n\ndiscretionary denial of adjustment of status where petitioner\n\npreviously had engaged in a flagrantly fraudulent marriage, then\n\napplied for adjustment of status based on an allegedly bona fide\n\nsecond marriage).\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f           Moreover,     the     record    is    replete   with      evidence     that\n\nKrazoun repeatedly lied to conceal these violations. For instance,\n\nhe falsely testified that he had met Balesteri more than one year\n\nprior to their marriage, whereas in fact he met Balesteri in late\n\n1989 and married her in January 1990; he lied again when he\n\ninformed the INS that he cohabited with Balesteri until 1993,\n\nwhereas he had ceased living with her a mere six or seven months\n\nfollowing their marriage.          Given this egregious record, and the\n\ncogent statement    of     the    grounds       upon   which   the    BIA   rejected\n\nKrazoun’s motion to reopen, the exercise of its discretion was\n\nanything but arbitrary or capricious. See Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 20.\n\nInstead, the BIA properly concluded that Krazoun simply was up to\n\nhis old tricks.    See also INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 143\n\nn.5 (1981) (noting that discretionary bypass is necessary to enable\n\nINS to thwart repeated delays of actual deportation by “aliens\n\ncreative   and   fertile    enough    to     continuously      produce      new    and\n\nmaterial facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case [and a\n\nright to a hearing]”).\n\n           Accordingly, the BIA decision is hereby affirmed.                        SO\n\nORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f",

In July 1990, Balesteri likewise obtained a restraining order against Krazoun, and the couple ceased living together. Nonetheless, in March 1991, based upon his marriage to Balesteri, Krazoun adjusted his immigration status to that of conditional permanent resident. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(a), (g)(1). Had the marriage endured for two years (<i>i.e.,</i> until March 1993), Krazoun and Balesteri would have become entitled to petition the INS to adjust Krazoun's immigration status to that of permanent resident. <i>See id.</i> at &#167; 1186a(c), (d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1993, Balesteri and Krazoun jointly submitted a motion attesting that they were continuing to cohabit.

In addition, Balesteri failed to appear for three separate INS interviews at which she was to provide support for the joint motion. Moreover, Krazoun himself misled INS interviewers to believe that (i) he continued to cohabit with Balesteri, and (ii) that Balesteri would appear at subsequent INS interviews, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216.4(b).

Moreover, Krazoun's brother testified that Krazoun and Balesteri had lived together for only six or seven months after their marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ sustained the 1994 termination of Krazoun's conditional residence status by the INS, as well as its denial of Krazoun's waiver petition, then ordered that Krazoun be deported. In addition, the IJ specifically found that Krazoun had married both Arungo-Garcia and Balesteri for the purpose of evading the United States immigration laws, based on the evidence that (i) Krazoun had misled the INS by stating that his wife would appear for the August 1993 INS interview, given that he testified at the hearing that he had ceased living with her in April 1993; (ii) Krazoun's prior statements to the INS &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> that he had lived with Balesteri until September 1993 &#8212; were contradicted by the dates set forth in Balesteri's divorce action complaint (<i>i.e.,</i> until July 1990) and by Krazoun's own brother (<i>i.e.,</i> until June-July 1990); and (iii) both of Krazoun's former spouses, Arungo-Garcia and Balesteri, had obtained restraining orders against him shortly after their respective marriages. After hearing Krazoun testify and observing his demeanor, the IJ found that Krazoun lacked credibility, and that he would \"lie to get what he wants.\" The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ's decision in May 2002. Krazoun did not petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Krazoun had married another United States citizen, Janice Gittino, in September 2001. In June 2002, Krazoun petitioned the BIA to reopen his case, claiming that this third marriage was bona fide and that he and Gittino were expecting a child in October 2002. The BIA rejected the Krazoun motion to reopen on two grounds. First, without regard to whether the putative third marriage might entitle Krazoun to relief from deportation, the BIA decided to exercise its broad discretion not to reopen, due to Krazoun's demonstrated history of having entered into two previous marriages with the fraudulent intention to evade the immigration laws. Second, the BIA noted that Krazoun had never produced an approved visa petition &#8212; a condition precedent to the requested relief &#8212; and had failed to adduce clear and convincing evidence that the third marriage he entered into was bona fide. Krazoun now petitions for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Krazoun contends that the BIA erred in not granting the motion to reopen, in that (i) Krazoun adduced clear and convincing evidence that his third marriage was bona fide, which included the recent birth certificate of the couple's first child; (ii) the finding of fact made by the IJ in 1998 &#8212; that Krazoun's first marriage to Arungo-Garcia was fraudulent &#8212; was belied by the evidence that Arungo-Garcia needed a protective restraining order to curb the violence in their marriage relationship; and (iii) the denial of discretionary relief by the BIA conflicts with the legislative policy disfavoring deportations which divide families.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have observed previously, the strong public policy favoring expeditious deportation proceedings plainly bespeaks disfavor of motions to reopen. <i>See Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir.2003). Thus, the BIA's denial of the Krazoun motion to reopen was proper, provided <i>either</i> that (i) Krazoun failed to establish the bona fides of his third marriage, entered into after the IJ's 1998 decision, <i>see In re Velarde-Pacheco,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253, 256 (BIA 2002) (requiring that alien \"present[] clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that [his] marriage [during pending deportation proceedings] is bona fide\"); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 204.2(a) (same); <i>or</i> (ii) regardless whether he proved that his third marriage was bona fide, the BIA, in its discretion, denied Krazoun an adjustment of status, and that decision was neither arbitrary and capricious nor predicated upon a misinterpretation of applicable law. <i>See Fesseha,</i> 333 F.3d at 20; <i>see also INS v. Rios-Pineda,</i> 471 U.S. 444, 449, 105 S.Ct. 2098, 85 L.Ed.2d 452 (1985); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(a) (\"The Board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As our statement of the background facts amply demonstrates, <i>supra,</i> the BIA decision denying the motion to open must be affirmed. Krazoun plainly failed to present clear and convincing evidence that his third marriage was bona fide. Although he unquestionably documented the fact that he married Gittino in June 2002, the pertinent issue before the BIA was not whether Krazoun had married for the third time, but whether he did so once again with the intent to evade the immigration laws and to delay and impede imminent deportation. There can be no genuine question that the <i>two</i> earlier fraudulent marriages into which Krazoun entered, with intent to evade the immigration laws, gave rise to a common-sense inference, as well as the legitimate suspicion, that Krazoun's third marriage &#8212; more likely than not &#8212; had been entered into with the same illegitimate aim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Krazoun's contention &#8212; that the bona fides of the first marriage was demonstrated by Arungo-Garcia's need to obtain a restraining order to stem the violence in their marriage relationship &#8212; may have been appropriate argumentation before the IJ in 1998, but nothing in the present record compelled the IJ to draw so curious a conclusion. <i>See Oliva-Muralles v. Ashcroft,</i> 328 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2003) (noting that IJ's findings of fact may be set aside only if \"the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to reach the contrary conclusion\"). Insofar as there was conflicting evidence, we would accord the IJ's credibility determinations great deference. <i>See Mendes v. INS,</i> 197 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir.1999). Even these formidable standards of review are no longer applicable, however, inasmuch as Krazoun did not petition this court in 1998 for review of the IJ's factual findings. Accordingly, this matter neither constitutes \"new\" material evidence, <i>see INS v. Doherty,</i> 502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992), nor provides a basis for the instant motion to reopen. <i>See Fesseha,</i> 333 F.3d at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even assuming we were to conclude that Krazoun adduced clear and convincing evidence that the third marriage was other than a sham, it nonetheless remains that the BIA acted well within its discretion in bypassing such an inquiry and denying Krazoun a discretionary adjustment of status, based exclusively upon his history of recurrent immigration fraud. <i>See Doherty,</i> 502 U.S. at 322, 112 S.Ct. 719. Krazoun's prior violations were not only flagrant, but accompanied by abusive threats to his first two spouses. <i>See Guan v. INS,</i> 49 F.3d 1259, 1262-63 (7th Cir.1995) (affirming BIA's discretionary denial of adjustment of status where petitioner previously had engaged in a flagrantly fraudulent marriage, then applied for adjustment of status based on an allegedly bona fide second marriage).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the record is replete with evidence that Krazoun repeatedly lied to conceal these violations. For instance, he falsely testified that he had met Balesteri more than one year prior to their marriage, whereas in fact he met Balesteri in late 1989 and married her in January 1990; he lied again when he informed the INS that he cohabited with Balesteri until 1993, whereas he had ceased living with her a mere six or seven months following their marriage. Given this egregious record, and the cogent statement of the grounds upon which the BIA rejected Krazoun's motion to reopen, the exercise of its discretion was anything but arbitrary or capricious. <i>See Fesseha,</i> 333 F.3d at 20. Instead, the BIA properly concluded that Krazoun simply was up to his old tricks. <i>See also INS v. Jong Ha Wang,</i> 450 U.S. 139, 143 n. 5, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (noting that discretionary bypass is necessary to enable INS to thwart repeated delays of actual deportation by \"aliens creative and fertile enough to continuously produce new and material facts sufficient to establish a prima facie case [and a right to a hearing]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the BIA decision is hereby <i>affirmed.

It is not surprising, therefore, that the Krazoun motion to reopen did not seek reconsideration of the earlier denial of his applications for suspension and voluntary departure.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

We affirm the BIA decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Krazoun, a native and citizen of Syria, initially entered the United States on a student visa in 1979. In 1983, he married a United States citizen, Magnolia Arungo-Garcia, who petitioned the INS for a relative visa in Krazoun's behalf. However, after she had been subjected to verbal abuse, harassment, and threats from Krazoun, Arungo-Garcia obtained a restraining order against Krazoun, and withdrew her pending INS petition. One year later, the couple divorced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1989, Krazoun met Georgia Balesteri, a United States citizen; the two married in January 1990. In July 1990, Balesteri likewise obtained a restraining order against Krazoun, and the couple ceased living together. Nonetheless, in March 1991, based upon his marriage to Balesteri, Krazoun adjusted his immigration status to that of conditional permanent resident. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(a), (g)(1). Had the marriage endured for two years (<i>i.e.,</i> until March 1993), Krazoun and Balesteri would have become entitled to petition the INS to adjust Krazoun's immigration status to that of permanent resident. <i>See id.</i> at &#167; 1186a(c), (d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1993, Balesteri and Krazoun jointly submitted a motion attesting that they were continuing to cohabit. Although the joint motion purportedly contained Balesteri's signature, the signature did not appear to match other samples of her handwriting. In addition, Balesteri failed to appear for three separate INS interviews at which she was to provide support for the joint motion. Moreover, Krazoun himself misled INS interviewers to believe that (i) he continued to cohabit with Balesteri, and (ii) that Balesteri would appear at subsequent INS interviews, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 216.4(b). Eventually, the INS terminated the conditional resident status previously granted Krazoun. After Balesteri finally filed for divorce from Krazoun in May 1994, the INS initiated deportation proceedings against Krazoun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1994, an immigration judge (IJ) ruled Krazoun deportable. At the same time, Krazoun moved to continue the deportation proceedings so he could obtain an INS waiver of the requirement that he and Balesteri submit a joint petition to remove his conditional resident status, on the basis that Krazoun had entered into the 1990 marriage with Balesteri in \"good faith,\" that it was not a sham marriage but instead had terminated for other reasons. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4) (waiver requirements). As no divorce decree had yet been entered, however, the IJ denied the request, whereupon Krazoun appealed to the BIA. Due to the fact that Krazoun's divorce became final in July 1995, however, the BIA remanded to the IJ to direct the INS to rule upon Krazoun's waiver application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS denied the waiver application, finding (i) that Krazoun had fraudulently concealed the fact that his 1990 marriage to a permanent resident was a sham; and (ii) on occasion Krazoun had stated that he lived with Balesteri until April 1993, yet at other times he said until September 1993; whereas Balesteri's May 1994 divorce complaint represented that the two had ceased living together in July 1990, and Balesteri's mother asserted that they had never lived together at all following their marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the deportation proceedings resumed before the IJ in January 1998, Krazoun testified that (i) Balesteri lived with him, from time to time, until March 1993; (ii) Balesteri lived with him from mid-to-late-1992; and (iii) even though Balesteri previously had submitted an affidavit attesting that the two had met in \"the late winter of 1989,\" <i>viz.,</i> shortly before their marriage, Krazoun first met Balesteri in October 1988.

In addition, the IJ specifically found that Krazoun had married both Arungo-Garcia and Balesteri for the purpose of evading the United States immigration laws, based on the evidence that (i) Krazoun had misled the INS by stating that his wife would appear for the August 1993 INS interview, given that he testified at the hearing that he had ceased living with her in April 1993; (ii) Krazoun's prior statements to the INS &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> that he had lived with Balesteri until September 1993 &#8212; were contradicted by the dates set forth in Balesteri's divorce action complaint (<i>i.e.,</i> until July 1990) and by Krazoun's own brother (<i>i.e.,</i> until June-July 1990); and (iii) both of Krazoun's former spouses, Arungo-Garcia and Balesteri, had obtained restraining orders against him shortly after their respective marriages.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>. Krazoun's prior violations were not only flagrant, but accompanied by abusive threats to his first two spouses. <i>See Guan v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691355\"><a href=\"/opinion/691355/yong-hong-guan-aka-yong-hong-baccia-v-immigration-naturalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span>, 1262-63 (7th Cir.1995) (affirming BIA's discretionary denial of adjustment of status where petitioner previously had engaged in a flagrantly fraudulent marriage, then applied for adjustment of status based on an allegedly bona fide second marriage).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the record is replete with evidence that Krazoun repeatedly lied to conceal these violations. For instance, he falsely testified that he had met Balesteri more than one year prior to their marriage, whereas in fact he met Balesteri in late 1989 and married her in January 1990; he lied again when he informed the INS that he cohabited with Balesteri until 1993, whereas he had ceased living with her a mere six or seven months following their marriage. Given this egregious record, and the cogent statement of the grounds upon which the BIA rejected Krazoun's motion to reopen, the exercise of its discretion was anything but arbitrary or capricious. <i>See Fesseha,</i> 333 F.3d at 20. Instead, the BIA properly concluded that Krazoun simply was up to his old tricks. <i>See also INS v.

It is not surprising, therefore, that the Krazoun motion to reopen did not seek reconsideration of the earlier denial of his applications for suspension and voluntary departure.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
