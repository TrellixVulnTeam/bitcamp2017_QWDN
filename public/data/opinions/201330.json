George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n              Selya, Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Thomas J. Connolly on brief for appellant.\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, on brief for] appellee.\n\n\n\n                        November 10, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam.    After Gregory Fraser pleaded guilty to\n\npossessing stolen firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(j), he\n\nwas sentenced to 54 months' imprisonment. In this appeal from that\n\nsentence, Fraser argues that the district court erred in counting\n\na prior state-court continuance without a finding in calculating\n\nhis base offense level and his criminal history score under the\n\nfederal Sentencing Guidelines.     In addition, in a supplemental\n\nbrief, he argues that, under the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), he is entitled to\n\nhave his sentence recalculated without reliance on two factors–-the\n\nprior continuance without a finding and the involvement of 29 guns\n\nin the present offense--that were neither admitted by him nor\n\nproved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.       For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, we affirm the sentence.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n\nA. Use of State-Court Continuance Without a Finding in\nComputing Fraser's Sentence Under the Guidelines\n\n          In calculating Fraser's sentence under the Guidelines,\n\nthe district court used Fraser's state-court continuance without a\n\nfinding in three ways–-in setting his base offense level at 20\n\n(based on a \"prior conviction\") and in giving him one criminal\n\nhistory point for a \"prior sentence\" and two criminal history\n\npoints for being under a \"criminal justice sentence\" when he\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fcommitted   the    present   federal   offense.1    In   reviewing   those\n\ncalculations, this court accepts the district court's factual\n\nfindings unless they are clearly erroneous and gives due deference\n\nto the district court's application of the Guidelines to those\n\nfacts. 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e); United States v. DiPina, 230 F.3d 477,\n\n482 (1st Cir. 2000).     For the reasons discussed below, we conclude\n\nthat each of those uses of the continuance without a finding was\n\nconsistent with the Guidelines.\n\n            1.    Base Offense Level\n\n            Under section 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), the base offense level for\n\nviolating 18 U.S.C. § 922(j) is 20 where the defendant has a prior\n\nfelony conviction for a crime of violence.2        For that purpose, the\n\nGuidelines define \"conviction\" as an \"adult conviction,\" which, for\n\nan offense committed before the defendant was 18 years old, is a\n\nconviction \"classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the\n\njurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.\"         USSG § 2K2.1,\n\ncomment. (n. 5).     As Fraser concedes, under Massachusetts law (the\n\nlaw of the jurisdiction where Fraser was convicted), a 17-year-old\n\n\n\n     1\n      Fraser also claims, without explanation, that the base\noffense level of 20 further precluded the court from granting him\na two-level reduction for his allegedly minor role in the present\noffense. However, under the applicable Guideline, USSG § 3B1.2, a\ndefendant's prior criminal history is irrelevant to whether he is\nentitled to a reduction based on his minor role in the offense of\nconviction.\n     2\n      Fraser does not dispute that this state breaking-and-entering\noffense was a \"felony\" and a \"crime of violence.\"\n\n                                   -3-\n\foffender is considered an adult rather than a juvenile.            See Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 119, § 52.      Accordingly, as Fraser further concedes\n\nand as the district court found, Fraser's breaking-and-entering\n\nproceeding took place in adult rather than juvenile court.\n\n          The only remaining question is, therefore, whether the\n\ndisposition of that proceeding was a \"conviction\" within the\n\nmeaning of section 2K2.1(a)(4)(A).          The answer to that question\n\nturns on whether the disposition is countable for purposes of\n\nawarding a criminal history point under section 4A1.1.            See USSG §\n\n2K2.1 comment. (n. 15).      Because, as discussed immediately below,\n\nFraser's previous continuance without a finding is countable for\n\npurposes of calculating his criminal history category, it is also\n\nusable in calculating his base offense level.\n\n          2.     Criminal History Point for \"Prior Sentence\"\n\n          For purposes of awarding criminal history points under\n\nsection 4A1.1(c), a disposition is countable if it is a \"prior\n\nsentence,\" which is defined to mean \"any sentence previously\n\nimposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial,\n\nor plea of nolo contendere,\" USSG § 4A1.2(a)(1), even where \"the\n\nimposition . . . of sentence was totally suspended or stayed,\" USSG\n\n§ 4A1.2(a)(3).    Applying that definition, we previously have held\n\nthat \"a continuance without a finding, entered as a result of an\n\nadmission to facts sufficient to warrant a finding of guilt under\n\nMassachusetts    law,   is   counted   as   a   sentence   for   purposes   of\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcalculating criminal history points in sentencing.\"        United States\n\nv. Dubovsky, 279 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing United States v.\n\nMorillo, 178 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1999)); see also United States\n\nv. Reyes, 2004 WL 2348554, *2 (1st Cir. Oct. 20, 2004).\n\n          Under that definition, even if the defendant was under 18\n\nwhen he committed the offense in question, the sentence imposed for\n\nthat offense, by either a juvenile or an adult court, counts as a\n\n\"prior sentence\" as long as the sentence was imposed within five\n\nyears of the commission of the offense for which the defendant is\n\npresently being sentenced.      USSG § 4A1.2(d); id., comment. (n.7).\n\nHere, the state-court continuance without a finding was imposed\n\nonly a few months before Fraser committed the present firearms-\n\npossession offense and is therefore countable as a \"prior sentence\"\n\nunder section 4A1.1(c) regardless of his age.\n\n          Nor does it matter that the state-court disposition was\n\ndiversionary in nature.      Under section 4A1.2(f), \"[a] diversionary\n\ndisposition resulting from . . . an admission of guilt . . . in a\n\njudicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under § 4A1.1(c) even\n\nif a conviction was not formally entered.\"3              An admission to\n\nsufficient   facts   under   Massachusetts   procedure    is   deemed   \"an\n\nadmission of guilt\" for this purpose.        United States v. Nicholas,\n\n\n     3\n      As indicated in the commentary to this provision, counting\nsuch diversionary dispositions \"reflects a policy that defendants\nwho receive the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and continue\nto commit crimes should not be treated with further leniency.\"\nUSSG § 4A1.2, comment. (n. 9).\n\n                                   -5-\n\f133 F.3d 133, 135 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing United States v. Roberts,\n\n39 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1994)).    The exception to this rule for \"a\n\ndiversion   from   juvenile   court,\"    which   is   not   counted,   USSG\n\n§ 4A1.2(f), is inapplicable here, since the disposition was from\n\nadult, not juvenile, court.\n\n            Fraser's final argument–-that the procedures followed by\n\nthe state court in accepting his admission to sufficient facts were\n\ndeficient in various respects and that the resulting disposition\n\nshould therefore not be counted for sentencing purposes–-is also\n\nunavailing.    Where, as here, \"the district court determined that\n\n[Fraser] had admitted guilt in open court and that there was a\n\njudicial determination by the state court judge of facts sufficient\n\nto support a finding of guilt[,] [t]hat is sufficient under the\n\nGuidelines.\"   Nicholas, 133 F.3d at 137; see also DiPina, 230 F.3d\n\nat 485.   While the government has the burden of establishing those\n\nbasic facts, once that is done, the burden shifts to the defendant\n\nto offer evidence that what actually happened did not constitute an\n\nadmission of guilt.     Nicholas, 133 F.3d at 136.           Here, Fraser\n\ndeclined to produce any such evidence.\n\n            Moreover, even if the procedures used by the state court\n\nwere somehow deficient, that would not warrant discounting the\n\ndisposition for purposes of sentencing.          In this context, such a\n\ncollateral attack is foreclosed, absent a claim, not made here,\n\nthat the defendant was entirely without counsel.        Custis v. United\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fStates, 511 U.S. 485, 496 (1994); United States, v. Burke, 67 F.3d\n\n1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995).          As we previously explained, allowing such\n\nchallenges    \"would     hopelessly     complicate       sentencing      under    the\n\nfederal Guidelines\" and compromise the finality of state-court\n\njudgments.     Burke, 67 F.3d at 3.\n\n             Accordingly, the district court was correct in counting\n\nFraser's continuance without a finding as a \"prior sentence\"\n\nwarranting one criminal history point under section 4A1.1(c).\n\n             3. Criminal History Points for Being \"Under a\n             Criminal Justice Sentence\"\n\n             The    district    court   also       correctly    gave    Fraser    two\n\nadditional criminal history points for \"committ[ing] the instant\n\noffense   while      under   [a]   criminal        justice   sentence,   including\n\nprobation.\"        USSG § 4A1.1(d).     For purposes of this provision, \"a\n\n'criminal justice sentence' means a sentence countable under §\n\n4A1.2 . . . having a custodial or supervisory component, although\n\nactive supervision is not required for this item to apply.\" Id. §\n\n4A1.1, comment. (n. 4).            As discussed above, the state-court\n\ncontinuance without a finding was countable as a \"prior sentence\"\n\nunder section 4A1.2.           It also had a \"custodial or supervisory\n\ncomponent.\"\n\n             Although we have not heretofore had occasion to make this\n\ninterpretation, other circuits have found criminal dispositions to\n\nhave a \"custodial or supervisory component\" where the sentencing\n\ncourt   imposes      conditions    that,      if    violated,   could    result    in\n\n                                        -7-\n\frevocation of the more lenient disposition and imposition of a\n\nharsher one.    See, e.g., United States v. Gorman, 312 F.3d 1159,\n\n1165-67 (10th Cir. 2002) (collecting cases).            Here, as conditions\n\nfor   continuing   Fraser's    breaking-and-entering         case    without   a\n\nfinding until February 2004, the state court required that Fraser\n\nmake restitution, do community service, go to school or work full\n\ntime, report periodically to the probation department, and incur no\n\nnew arrests.    If those conditions were violated, the state court\n\ncould revoke the continuance without a finding, enter a finding of\n\nguilty, and    impose    a   sentence   as   provided   by    the    applicable\n\nstatute.    See Mass. R. Dist. Ct. Prob. Viol. P. 9.            Indeed, upon\n\nFraser's arrest for the instant federal offense in April 2003, the\n\nstate court did find a violation of his probation and issued a\n\nwarrant for his arrest.      Accordingly, the district court correctly\n\ngave Fraser two criminal history points for being under a criminal\n\njustice sentence when he committed the instant offense.\n\nB.    Blakely Issues\n\n           Because Fraser raised his Blakely-related claims for the\n\nfirst time on appeal, they are reviewable, if at all, under a plain\n\nerror standard.        Fraser makes two such claims:                that, under\n\nBlakely, he was entitled to have a jury decide, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, (i) what happened at the state-court proceedings that\n\nresulted in a continuance without a finding, and (ii) how many\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\ffirearms were involved in the instant offense.4    Neither of those\n\nclaims survives plain error review.\n\n          \"In determining whether an error is plain, the court\n\nconsiders four factors:\n\n          [B]efore an appellate court can correct an\n          error not raised [below], there must be\n          (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that\n          affects substantial rights.     If all three\n          conditions are met, an appellate court may\n          then exercise its discretion to notice a\n          forfeited error, but only if (4) the error\n          seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or\n          public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n\nUnited States v. Savarese, 2004 WL 2106341, *6 (1st Cir. Sept. 22,\n\n2004) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).        Under\n\nthese standards, the errors alleged here were not \"plain.\"\n\n          First, in the absence of a Supreme Court pronouncement\n\nthat Blakely applies to the federal sentencing guidelines, see\n\nBlakely, 124 S. Ct. at 2538 n.9 (stating that \"[t]he Federal\n\nGuidelines are not before [the Court] and . . . express[ing] no\n\nopinion on them\"), federal sentencing decisions following pre-\n\nBlakely precedents are not plainly erroneous, United States v.\n\nCordoza-Estrada, 2004 WL 2179594, *4 (1st Cir. Sept. 29, 2004);\n\nUnited States v. Morgan, 384 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004).   Under those\n\nprecedents, only a \"fact that increases the penalty for a crime\n\n\n\n     4\n      Based on the presentence report's finding, which the district\ncourt adopted, that 29 firearms were involved in the offense,\nFraser's offense level was increased by 6 levels under section\n2K2.1(b)(1)(C) of the Guidelines.\n\n                                -9-\n\fbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\n\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"                  Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000) (emphasis added); see also, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Collazo-Aponte, 281 F.3d 320, 324 (1st Cir.)\n\n(finding no right to jury trial on sentencing factors where, even\n\nwith enhancements, defendant's sentence was less than applicable\n\nstatutory maximum), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 869 (2002).                    Here, the\n\n54-month sentence imposed falls far short of the statutory maximum\n\npenalty of ten years' imprisonment for possessing stolen firearms\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(j).             See 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2).\n\nAccordingly,      under   pre-Blakely        precedent     \"(not    yet     clearly\n\nestablished to be erroneous), . . . [no] plain error occurred.\"\n\nMorgan, 384 F.3d at 8.\n\n            A second ground for finding no plain error, at least with\n\nrespect to the district court's finding that the continuance\n\nwithout a finding was a \"conviction,\" is that, under Apprendi, and\n\neven under Blakely, the fact of a conviction need not be proved to\n\na jury beyond a reasonable doubt.        See Blakely, 124 S. Ct. at 2536;\n\nApprendi,   530    U.S.   at   476.     To     the   extent   that    Fraser     is\n\nchallenging    the   district   court's       legal,     rather    than    factual,\n\nconclusions about the continuance without a finding, Blakely has no\n\nbearing on any such legal challenges.\n\n            A third ground for finding no plain error, at least with\n\nrespect to the number of firearms involved, is that Fraser did not\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fcontest in the district court the facts that he now argues should\n\nhave been submitted to a jury and that, therefore, \"there is no\n\nbasis for concluding that the [failure to submit those facts to a\n\njury]   seriously   affect[ed]   the   fairness,   integrity   or   public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\" Savarese, 2004 WL 2106341, at\n\n*7 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).            Although\n\nFraser initially objected to the probation officer's finding that\n\nhe was accountable for 29 guns, at the presentencing conference he\n\nexpressly waived his firearms objections and did not raise them\n\nagain in the district court or in his opening brief on appeal.\n\n           We need go no further.        To sum up, we find no error in\n\nthe district court's calculations incident to Fraser's sentence\n\nunder the Guidelines and no plain error in failing, sua sponte, to\n\nhave the two challenged sentencing factors determined by a jury\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.   Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f",

Here, as conditions for continuing Fraser's breaking-and-entering case without a finding until February 2004, the state court required that Fraser make restitution, do community service, go to school or work full time, report periodically to the probation department, and incur no new arrests. If those conditions were violated, the state court could revoke the continuance without a finding, enter a finding of guilty, and impose a sentence as provided by the applicable statute. <i>See</i> Mass. R. Dist. Ct. Prob. Viol. P. 9. Indeed, upon Fraser's arrest for the instant federal offense in April 2003, the state court did find a violation of his probation and issued a warrant for his arrest.

Here, the 54-month sentence imposed falls far short of the statutory maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment for possessing stolen firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(j). <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2).

Here, Fraser declined to produce any such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if the procedures used by the state court were somehow deficient, that would not warrant discounting the disposition for purposes of sentencing. In this context, such a collateral attack is foreclosed, absent a claim, not made here, that the defendant was entirely without counsel. <i>Custis v.

As we previously explained, allowing such challenges \"would hopelessly complicate sentencing under the federal Guidelines\" and compromise the finality of state-court judgments. <i>Burke,</i> 67 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court was correct in counting Fraser's continuance without a finding as a \"prior sentence\" warranting one criminal history point under section 4A1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Criminal History Points for Being \"Under a Criminal Justice Sentence\"</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also correctly gave Fraser two additional criminal history points for \"committ[ing] the instant offense while under [a] criminal justice sentence, including probation.\" USSG &#167; 4A1.1(d). For purposes of this provision, \"a `criminal justice sentence' means a sentence countable under &#167; 4A1.2 ... having a custodial or supervisory component, although active supervision is not required for this item to apply.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4A1.1, comment. (n. 4). As discussed above, the state-court continuance without a finding was countable as a \"prior sentence\" under section 4A1.2.

Here, as conditions for continuing Fraser's breaking-and-entering case without a finding until February 2004, the state court required that Fraser make restitution, do community service, go to school or work full time, report periodically to the probation department, and incur no new arrests. If those conditions were violated, the state court could revoke the continuance without a finding, enter a finding of guilty, and impose a sentence as provided by the applicable statute. <i>See</i> Mass. R. Dist. Ct. Prob. Viol. P. 9. Indeed, upon Fraser's arrest for the instant federal offense in April 2003, the state court did find a violation of his probation and issued a warrant for his arrest. Accordingly, the district court correctly gave Fraser two criminal history points for being under a criminal justice sentence when he committed the instant offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Blakely Issues</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Fraser raised his <i>Blakely</i>-related claims for the first time on appeal, they are reviewable, if at all, under a plain error standard. Fraser makes two such claims: that, under <i>Blakely,</i> he was entitled to have a jury decide, beyond a reasonable doubt, (i) what happened at the state-court proceedings that resulted in a continuance without a finding, and (ii) how many firearms were involved in the instant offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Neither of those claims survives plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In determining whether an error is plain, the court considers four factors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[B]efore an appellate court can correct an error not raised [below], there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.
