Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                   Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                and DiClerico,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Lydia Lizarríbar-Masini, for appellant Rivera-García, and\nRafael Anglada-Lopez, for appellant Rodríguez-Lozada.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                           February 24, 2009\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f          DICLERICO, District Judge.       Nelson Rivera-Garcia and\n\nElias Rodriguez-Lozada were tried together and convicted of drug\n\nand weapons crimes charged in two consolidated cases.    Rodriguez-\n\nLozada (“Rodriguez”) appeals his convictions and sentence.       He\n\ncontends that the district court erred in denying his motions to\n\nsuppress and to sever, that the jury did not represent a fair cross\n\nsection of the community, and that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsustain his convictions. He also challenges his sentence. Rivera-\n\nGarcia (“Rivera”) raises three issues, all pertaining to his\n\nsentence. Rodriguez’s convictions and sentences on the gun charges\n\nare vacated; his convictions and sentences are otherwise affirmed.\n\nRivera’s sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                 I.\n\n          Members of the Rivera-Garcia family, including Nelson\n\nRivera-Garcia, were involved in a drug trafficking organization,\n\nknown as “Callejón de los Conejos,” that operated in Ponce, Puerto\n\nRico. A federal grand jury returned an indictment, dated September\n\n27, 2002, charging Rivera and nine others, including his three\n\nbrothers and his mother, with a drug conspiracy that operated from\n\n1995 until the date of the indictment (Criminal Case No. 02-391).\n\nAn arrest warrant was issued for Rivera.\n\n          The United States Marshals Service learned that Rivera\n\nwas living at an apartment in Cataño, Puerto Rico.     On September\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f29, 2003,    Deputy United States Marshals and Puerto Rico Special\n\nResponse Team (“S.R.T”) officers went to that apartment to arrest\n\nRivera.     The S.R.T. officers knocked on the apartment door and\n\nannounced their presence.   One of the officers saw a man, whom he\n\nrecognized, look out of a window near the door.1        When no one\n\nresponded to their knocking, the S.R.T. officers knocked down the\n\ndoor and entered the apartment behind an officer carrying a bullet-\n\nproof shield.\n\n            As the S.R.T. officers entered, they saw Rodriguez,\n\nwearing a leg brace but not using a crutch, walking toward them.\n\nThey also saw Rivera looking out of the slightly-open bedroom door,\n\nholding a gun.   The officers secured Rodriguez.   Rivera closed and\n\nlocked the bedroom door, but after an officer kicked the door\n\ntwice, Rivera opened the door and came out without the gun.     The\n\nofficers secured Rivera.\n\n            The S.R.T. officers and federal marshals entered the\n\nbedroom.    A crutch was on the bed.    They found heroin, cocaine,\n\npackaging for the drugs, and money.    Clothing and cell phones were\n\nalso found in the room.     They discovered a loaded Taurus 9 mm\n\npistol under a pillow on the bed and a loaded Glock .45 caliber\n\n\n     1\n      The S.R.T. officer recognized the man from an event the week\nbefore when S.R.T. officers and marshals went to an apartment\ncomplex in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, where they believed Rivera was\nstaying. The S.R.T. officer saw the same man, who was wearing a\nleg brace, get out of the marshals’ vehicle. That man was later\ndetermined to be Rodriguez.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fpistol in a box under the bed.     They found additional equipment for\n\nprocessing   and   packaging   drugs     in   the   kitchen.      Rivera    and\n\nRodriguez were arrested.\n\n            A grand jury indicted Rivera and Rodriguez on October 10,\n\n2003, for crimes arising from the circumstances of their arrest in\n\nCataño   (Criminal   Case   No.   03-284).      They   were     charged    with\n\npossessing heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana with the\n\nintent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); with\n\npossession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1) and (2); and with aiding and\n\nabetting each other in those crimes.           Rivera and Rodriguez were\n\neach charged, separately, with being a felon in possession of\n\nfirearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).                In December of\n\n2003, a grand jury returned a superseding indictment in Criminal\n\nCase No. 02-391, charging Rivera and Rodriguez with conspiring with\n\nten other co-conspirators, including Rivera’s brothers and mother,\n\nto possess with the intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine\n\nbase, and marijuana in violation of § 841(a)(1). The court granted\n\nthe government’s motion to consolidate the two cases.\n\n            Rivera and Rodriguez moved to suppress the evidence found\n\nin the Cataño apartment, and a hearing was held on the motions on\n\nAugust 23, 2004.     At the hearing, the court realized that an issue\n\nexisted as to whether the defendants had standing to challenge the\n\nevidence.    The court denied Rodriguez’s motion, due to his lack of\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fstanding, and gave Rivera an opportunity to brief the issue.                  A\n\nfurther hearing on Rivera’s motion to suppress was held on November\n\n5, 10, and 12, 2004.       The court denied Rivera’s motion on December\n\n23, 2004.\n\n            Jury selection was held on April 27, 2005.               On May 2,\n\n2005, counsel gave their opening statements, and the government\n\ncalled its first witness.            Evidence continued each day through\n\nThursday, May 5.     On May 6, Rodriguez filed a motion to sever his\n\ntrial   from    Rivera’s   trial,     arguing    that   if   they   were   tried\n\nseparately,      Rivera    would     provide    exculpatory    testimony    for\n\nRodriguez, based on Rivera’s testimony at the suppression hearing.\n\nThe court held a hearing on Rodriguez’s motion on Monday, May 9.\n\nThe government objected to severance.\n\n            Despite noting that the motion to sever was untimely, the\n\ncourt decided to sever the trial of Criminal Case. No. 02-391              from\n\nCriminal Case No. 03-284.          Under the new schedule, both defendants\n\nwould be tried on the charges in Criminal Case No. 02-391 first,\n\nand a separate trial for Criminal Case No. 03-284 would be held at\n\na later time.     Following the lunch break the same day, however, the\n\ncourt reconsidered the severance issue and denied the motion as\n\nuntimely.      Trial proceeded, as originally planned, on the charges\n\nagainst both defendants in both cases.\n\n            After the conclusion of the government’s case, both\n\ndefendants moved for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fCriminal Procedure 29.    The motions were denied.   On   May 18, 2005,\n\nthe jury returned its verdict finding Rivera and Rodriguez guilty\n\non all charges.2\n\n          Presentence reports were prepared and submitted.      Rivera\n\nobjected to the drug quantities and other parts of his presentence\n\nreport.   Rodriguez requested that new counsel be appointed to\n\nrepresent him for sentencing, and the court appointed new counsel\n\non November 17, 2005.\n\n          Rodriguez’s sentencing hearing was held on May 17, 2006.\n\nThe court found a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history\n\ncategory of II resulting in an advisory guideline range of 168 to\n\n210 months.   After reciting the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a) and discussing the extent of Rodriguez’s drug transactions,\n\nthe nature of his offenses and his role in them, his injuries, and\n\nhis possession of weapons, as noted in the presentence report, the\n\ncourt concluded that a sentence at the high end of the range was\n\nappropriate. Rodriguez was sentenced to 210 months on Count One in\n\nCriminal Case No. 02-391; 210 months on Counts One, Two, and Three\n\nin Criminal Case No. 03-284; 60 months on Count Four; and 120\n\nmonths on Count Seven of Criminal Case No. 03-284, all such terms\n\nto run concurrently.    In addition, he was sentenced to 60 months on\n\n\n\n     2\n      The judgment entered for Rodriguez on May 26, 2006, docketed\nin Criminal Case No. 02-391 at docket no. 498, indicates that\nRodriguez pled guilty in that case. That entry appears to be in\nerror.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fCount Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, said sentence to be served\n\nconsecutively to the other sentences imposed resulting in a total\n\nsentence of 270 months.     Terms of supervised release were also\n\nimposed.\n\n           Rivera’s sentencing hearing began on March 17, 2006, and\n\nwas continued to August 16, 2006.     The court found a base offense\n\nlevel of 38 and applied a four-level increase based on Rivera’s\n\nleadership role, which yielded an adjusted offense level of 42.\n\nThe court found a criminal history category of VI based on his\n\nstatus as a career criminal.    A criminal history category of VI,\n\ncombined with a total offense level of 42, resulted in an advisory\n\nguideline range of 360 months to life.\n\n           Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Count One of\n\nCriminal Case No. 02-391.   In Criminal Case No. 03-284, Rivera was\n\nsentenced to life in prison on Counts One and Three and to terms of\n\n40 years on Count Two, 60 months on Count Four, and 120 months on\n\nCount Six, all such terms to run concurrently.   In addition, he was\n\nsentenced to a term of 60 months for his conviction on Count Five\n\nin Criminal Case No. 03-284, which was to be served consecutively\n\nto his other sentences in Criminal Case No. 03-284.        Terms of\n\nsupervised release were also imposed.\n\n           Rivera and Rodriguez filed timely notices of appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f                                        II.\n\n            On appeal, Rodriguez challenges the district court’s\n\ndenial of his motions, the make-up of the jury, the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence, and his sentence. Rivera raises issues pertaining to\n\nhis sentence.         We consider the issues raised by the parties in\n\nturn.\n\nA.    Rodriguez’s Appeal\n\n            Rodriguez contends that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to sever his trial from Rivera’s trial and in\n\ndenying him a hearing on his motion to suppress evidence found at\n\nthe apartment in Cataño, where he was arrested with Rivera.                     He\n\nalso argues that the jury did not represent a fair cross-section of\n\nthe community, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his\n\nconviction, and that his sentence was unreasonable. The government\n\nresponds that some of the issues Rodriguez raises were waived and\n\nthat the issues lack merit.\n\n            1.   Motion to Suppress\n\n            Both Rodriguez and Rivera moved to suppress the evidence\n\nfound at the Cataño apartment. At the beginning of the suppression\n\nhearing, Rodriguez’s counsel sought additional evidence, including\n\nthe   address    of    a   witness   who      had   some   involvement   in   the\n\ncircumstances    of     the   arrest,   for    the   purpose   of   obtaining    a\n\nsubpoena. After a sidebar conference, the district court stated on\n\nthe record:\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f            I was under the misapprehension that the\n            subpoena that was requested by [Rodriguez]\n            concerned the person who had the possession or\n            the custody or the use of the place where the\n            defendants were arrested. It turns out that\n            she is not the owner nor did she have that\n            apartment under any type of rent or under her\n            control.   Also during this conference, it\n            appeared that [Rodriguez] was there visiting\n            and in those circumstances then he would have\n            no standing to challenge any search that was\n            done at that time and there[fore] his motion\n            to suppress is hereby denied on the basis of\n            standing to file the motion to suppress.\n\nSupp. Hr. T., 8/23/04, at 8-9.           The court then ordered Rivera to\n\nbrief the issue of whether he had standing to move to suppress the\n\nevidence.   Another hearing on Rivera’s suppression motion was held\n\nin November, and the motion was denied on December 23, 2004.\n\n            On appeal, Rodriguez argues that he had standing to move\n\nto suppress the evidence found in the Cataño apartment, despite his\n\nstatus as a guest in the apartment, and that the district court\n\nshould   have   heard    his   motion.     The   government   contends   that\n\nRodriguez waived the standing issue by not raising it in the\n\ndistrict court.3        Alternatively, the government argues that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez a\n\nhearing on his motion.\n\n            Before a court may reach the merits of a motion to\n\nsuppress, “the defendant carries the burden of establishing that he\n\n\n\n     3\n      The government does not distinguish between waiver and\nforfeiture. See, e.g., United States v. Walker, 538 F.3d 21, 23\n(1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                     -9-\n\fhad a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the area\n\nsearched or, as in this case, the items seized.”   United States v.\n\nLipscomb, 539 F.3d 32, 35-36 (1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, ___ S.\n\nCt. ___, 2009 WL 56596 (U.S. Jan. 12, 2009).          Although the\n\nthreshold requirement is referred to as standing, it is more\n\nproperly considered under a Fourth Amendment analysis.   Id. at 36.\n\n“[F]ailure to present evidence with respect to such an expectation\n\nprevents a defendant from making a claim for suppression under the\n\nFourth Amendment.” United States v. Samboy, 433 F.3d 154, 162 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n          In the district court, Rodriguez failed to address the\n\nquestion of whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy with\n\nrespect to the Cataño apartment or the items seized there.       On\n\nappeal, Rodriguez asserts, based on his status as a casual visitor\n\nfor a brief period at Rivera’s apartment, that he had a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy in the area searched.   He is mistaken.   See\n\nUnited States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1998).         The\n\ndistrict court properly denied his motion, due to his lack of\n\nstanding, without further consideration.\n\n          2.   Motion to Sever\n\n          On May 6, 2005, Rodriguez filed a motion to sever trial\n\nof the charges against him from Rivera’s trial.     He argued that\n\nRivera’s testimony at the suppression hearing in November of 2004,\n\nabout the drugs, guns, and money found in the apartment in Cataño,\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fwas exculpatory evidence which he wanted to present in his defense.\n\nHe further argued that Rivera would testify on his behalf if the\n\ncharges against them were tried separately.\n\n            The district court addressed the motion on the morning of\n\nMay 9, 2005.    Rodriguez’s counsel explained the exculpatory nature\n\nof the testimony he expected from Rivera.               The court asked whether\n\nRivera would testify on Rodriguez’s behalf, and Rivera’s counsel\n\nsaid that he would testify only if the charges against him were\n\nsevered from Rodriguez’s trial and if Rivera were tried first. The\n\ngovernment objected to the motion on the ground that it was\n\nuntimely, because the trial had already progressed into the second\n\nweek, and argued that the totality of Rivera’s testimony was not\n\nexculpatory.          After    initially      deciding    to    sever    the     two\n\nindictments,    the    district      court    denied    Rodriguez’s     motion    as\n\nuntimely.\n\n            A district court’s decision to deny a motion to sever is\n\nreviewed for manifest abuse of discretion.                     United States v.\n\nDeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 52 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct.\n\n513 & 129 S. Ct. 515 (2008).                  A motion to sever charges or\n\ndefendants     must    be     made   before    trial.      Fed.   R.    Crim.     P.\n\n12(b)(3)(D). Failure to move for severance before the deadline for\n\nfiling pretrial motions constitutes waiver, which may be excused\n\nonly on a showing of good cause.              Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(e); United\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fStates v. Pena-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 33 (1st Cir. 2000); United States\n\nv. Palmer, 122 F.3d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1997).\n\n          On appeal, Rodriguez argues the merits of his severance\n\nmotion. The government points out that the motion was denied as\n\nuntimely and that Rodriguez failed to show good cause for the\n\nuntimely filing.   At oral argument before this court, Rodriguez’s\n\ncounsel represented that the motion to sever was timely, having\n\nbeen filed on the first day of trial following jury selection.   In\n\nsupport of his position, counsel filed a letter, pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), in which counsel stated:\n\n“Said motion was filed on May 6, 2005, after jury selection but\n\nbefore the start of jury trial, day one, on May 9, 2005.”4\n\n          Counsel’s representation is contrary to the record and to\n\nthe statement of the case presented in Rodriguez’s own brief.5\n\nJury selection was held on April 27, 2005.       The first day of\n\nevidence was May 2 and trial continued through May 5.   Therefore,\n\nthe motion to sever, filed on May 6, 2005, was untimely.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Rule 28(j) provides a mechanism for a party to advise the\ncourt of “pertinent and significant authorities” that come to light\nafter the brief is filed or after oral argument. Counsel in this\ncase made improper use of Rule 28(j) to raise additional argument\nand evidence.\n     5\n      In his brief, Rodriguez states that voir dire and jury\nselection were held on April 27, 2005, that “[o]n May 2, 2005,\nfirst day of trial was held,” and that the testimony of government\nwitnesses continued on May 3, May 4, and May 5. Rodriguez’s Brief\nat 9-10.\n\n                               -12-\n\f           In the district court, Rodriguez’s counsel explained that\n\nthe motion was filed on May 6 because he had only received the full\n\ntranscript of the suppression hearing earlier that week.     Counsel\n\nfurther stated that after reading the transcript, he realized that\n\nRivera’s testimony was exculpatory.       The district court found,\n\nhowever, that because counsel attended the suppression hearing in\n\nNovember of 2004 and heard the testimony at that time, he did not\n\nneed the transcript before filing the motion.\n\n           Based on the circumstances presented here, the motion for\n\nseverance was untimely, and Rodriguez failed to show good cause for\n\nan untimely filing.      The district court correctly denied the\n\nmotion.   No abuse of discretion occurred.\n\n           3.   Jury Selection\n\n           Rodriguez argues, for the first time on appeal, that the\n\nrequirement that jurors serving in the District of Puerto Rico be\n\nproficient in English violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury\n\nmade up of a fair cross section of the community.         Issues not\n\nraised before the district court are forfeited and subject to\n\nreview only for plain error.     See United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,\n\n541 F.3d 19, 35 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 77 U.S.L.W. 3429 (U.S.\n\nJan. 21, 2009); Walker, 538 F.3d at 23.    “The plain error standard\n\nrequires this court to ‘find [1] that there is error [2] that is\n\nplain and [3] that affects substantial rights.’”     United States v.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fRodriguez, 525 F.3d 85, 95 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting United States\n\nv. Epstein, 426 F.3d 431, 437 (1st Cir. 2005)).\n\n            We have previously considered the English proficiency\n\nrequirement and held that it was “justified by the overwhelming\n\nnational interest served by the use of English in a United States\n\ncourt.” United States v. Gonzalez-Velez, 466 F.3d 27, 40 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); United States v. Dubon-\n\nOtero, 292 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2002).     Rodriguez provides no basis\n\nto reconsider our previous holding in the circumstances of this\n\ncase.    No error occurred.\n\n            4.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Rodriguez   contends   that   the   evidence   at   trial   was\n\ninsufficient to convict him of the conspiracy charged in Criminal\n\nCase No. 02-391 and the weapons charges in Criminal Case No. 03-\n\n284.    We review the district court’s denial of a Rule 29 motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal under the de novo standard. United States v.\n\nGiambro, 544 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 2008).       In doing so, however, we\n\nview “the evidence in the light most flattering to the jury’s\n\nguilty verdict [and] assess whether a reasonable factfinder could\n\nhave concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.”    Lipscomb, 539 F.3d at 40.\n\n            With respect to the conspiracy conviction, Rodriguez\n\nargues that relatively little evidence was presented at trial that\n\nlinked him to the Conejos drug operations in Ponce and that the\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fevidence presented showed that he played only a minor role.6     To\n\nprove that Rodriguez was part of a drug conspiracy, the government\n\nwas required to prove “that a conspiracy existed, that [Rodriguez]\n\nhad knowledge of it, and that [Rodriguez] participated voluntarily\n\nin it.”   United States v. Famania-Roche, 537 F.3d 71, 78 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).    A “conspiratorial agreement may be ‘express or tacit and\n\nmay be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.’”         Cruz-\n\nRodriguez, 541 F.3d at 26 (quoting United States v. Gomez, 255 F.3d\n\n31, 35 (1st Cir. 2001)).   The underlying criminal activity of the\n\nconspiracy charged was a violation of § 841(a)(1), which involves\n\nmanufacturing, distributing, or dispensing drugs, or possession\n\nwith the intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense drugs.\n\n           Rodriguez’s co-defendant, Sigilfredo Rivera-Rubero, who\n\nbecame a government witness, testified that he first met Rodriguez\n\nduring a drug transaction in 1996 or 1997 when he bought marijuana\n\nfrom Rodriguez.    Rivera-Rubero testified that initially, in 1996\n\nand 1997, Rodriguez sold him marijuana in the amount of thirty\n\npounds every two weeks.    Rivera-Rubero described the Conejos drug\n\norganization and identified its members, which included himself,\n\nRivera, and others.   He further testified that beginning in 1999,\n\nhe had a business relationship with Rodriguez, selling drugs, and\n\n\n     6\n      A relatively minor role in a conspiracy, however, does not\npreclude a conviction on that charge. See United States v. Flores-\nRivera, 56 F.3d 319, 325 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing potential\nprejudicial effect of evidence in a joint trial of co-\nconspirators).\n\n                                -15-\n\fa social relationship with him.        At that time, Rodriguez supplied\n\ncocaine, marijuana, and heroin to Rivera-Rubero, although Rivera-\n\nRubero also had other suppliers.             In addition, Rivera-Rubero\n\ntestified that Rodriguez sold drugs to other members of the Conejos\n\norganization.        Rodriguez’s    wife    testified    about   Rodriguez’s\n\ncontacts with Rivera and that Rodriguez called Rivera “Boss.”\n\n            “It is not the role of the reviewing court to weigh the\n\nevidence; our role is merely to ensure that some evidence exists to\n\nsupport sufficiently the jury’s determination.”           United States v.\n\nLiranzo, 385 F.3d 66, 70 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The evidence is more than sufficient for a rational jury\n\nto find that Rodriguez was part of the Conejos drug trafficking\n\nconspiracy.     Rodriguez’s   long    drug-related      relationships    with\n\nRivera-Rubero and Rivera, along with supplying drugs to other\n\nmembers of the Conejos organization, support a finding that he\n\nknowingly     and   voluntarily    participated    in    the   Conejos   drug\n\norganization.       Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain\n\nhis conspiracy conviction in Criminal Case No. 02-391.\n\n            Rodriguez also argues that evidence is lacking to support\n\nhis conviction on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, that he\n\npossessed a weapon in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme in\n\nviolation of § 924(c)(1), and aided and abetted Rivera in doing so,\n\nand on Count Seven, that he was a felon in possession of a firearm,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fin violation of § 922(g)(1).7   He argues that he was only a visitor\n\nat Rivera’s apartment in Cataño where the guns were found.       The\n\ngovernment contends that the evidence proved that Rodriguez aided\n\nand abetted Rivera in possessing guns and also that Rodriguez was\n\nin constructive possession of the guns found in the apartment.\n\n          Section 922(g)(1), charged in Count Five, requires that\n\nRodriguez have had knowing possession of the guns.8        “Knowing\n\npossession under § 922(g)(1) can be established by proving that\n\n[Rodriguez] had constructive possession of [the guns]; that is,\n\nthat he knowingly had the power and the intention at a given time\n\nof exercising dominion and control over a firearm, directly or\n\nthrough others.”   DeCologero, 530 F.3d at 67 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n          In Count Seven, Rodriguez was charged with violation of\n\n§ 924(c)(1) by possessing, in furtherance of drug trafficking, and\n\naiding and abetting Rivera in possessing the two guns found at the\n\nCataño apartment when they were arrested.       To convict under §\n\n924(c)(1), the government must prove possession of the guns and a\n\nsignificant nexus between the guns and the drug crime, meaning that\n\n“the firearm facilitates or has the potential to facilitate the\n\n\n     7\n      The weapons charged in those counts were the guns found at\nthe Cataño apartment: “a Glock semi automatic pistol, 45 caliber\nserial number BZC308, and a Taurus semi-automatic pistol, model\nPT92, 9mm. caliber, serial number TLD4401-8D.”\n     8\n      Rodriguez does not contest his status as a felon or the\ninterstate commerce requirement of § 922(g)(1).\n\n                                -17-\n\fdrug trafficking offense.”9        United States v. Roberson, 459 F.3d\n\n39, 48 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1261 (2007). 18\n\nU.S.C.   §   2   provides   that   one   who   aids   or   abets   another   in\n\ncommission of a crime “is punishable as a principal.”\n\n             Constructive possession is shown if Rodriguez knowingly\n\nhad the power and intention to exercise “dominion and control over\n\na firearm directly or through others.”          United States v. Sanchez-\n\nBadillo, 540 F.3d 24, 31 (1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, --- S. Ct.\n\n---, 2009 WL 56548 (Jan. 12, 2009) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    “Constructive possession can be joint, does not require\n\nactual ownership of the firearm, and can be established through\n\ncircumstantial evidence . . . .”         DeCologero, 530 F.3d at 67.\n\n             On the other hand, mere presence with or proximity to\n\nweapons or association with another who possesses a weapon are not\n\nenough to prove constructive possession.          United States v. Duval,\n\n496 F.3d 64, 78 (1st Cir. 2007), cert.           denied, 128 S. Ct. 952 &\n\n128 S. Ct. 2499 (2008); United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 501\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).      Instead, the government must show “some action,\n\nsome word, or some conduct that links the individual to the\n\ncontraband and indicates that he had some stake in it, some power\n\nover it.”        McLean, 409 F.3d at 501 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n\n     9\n      To the extent that Rodriguez argues that the government\nfailed to prove that he used a firearm, he misstates the crime with\nwhich he was charged.\n\n                                    -18-\n\f           As the S.R.T. officers entered the Cantaño apartment,\n\nthey saw Rodriguez walking from the area of the bedroom and saw\n\nRivera standing in the bedroom doorway, holding a gun.        Rivera\n\nclosed and locked the bedroom door before the officers could enter.\n\nThe officer in charge arranged his personnel around the closed and\n\nlocked bedroom door and then kicked the door.         Rivera did not\n\nrespond immediately, but after several kicks, Rivera opened the\n\ndoor and was no longer holding the gun.      The officers arrested\n\nRivera and then entered the bedroom where they saw Rodriguez’s\n\ncrutch on the bed and found drugs, drug paraphernalia, money, and\n\ntwo loaded guns - one under a pillow and the other in a box under\n\nthe bed.   They also found clothes and cell phones.\n\n           Based on that evidence, which is taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to the guilty verdict, the jury could have found beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that Rodriguez had been in the bedroom with\n\nRivera and that Rivera was holding one of the loaded guns when the\n\nofficers entered the apartment.    Rodriguez, however, was only a\n\ntemporary visitor at the apartment, where Rivera was living.      He\n\ndid not own the apartment or its contents, including the guns.   The\n\ngovernment does not contend that any of the clothes, cell phones,\n\nor other property found in the bedroom, other than the crutch,\n\nbelonged to Rodriguez.     The record includes no evidence that\n\nRodriguez owned or actually possessed either gun.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f              It is not necessary, however, for Rodriguez to have owned\n\nor   physically       possessed   the    guns   to    satisfy   the     possession\n\nrequirements of § 922(g)(1) and § 924(c)(1) because possession may\n\nbe constructive. While the evidence shows that Rodriguez was\n\npresent in the bedroom with the guns and was near Rivera, who was\n\nseen holding a gun, evidence is lacking to link Rodriguez to the\n\nguns.     In    the    absence    of    evidence     that   Rodriguez   knowingly\n\npossessed the guns found in Rivera’s bedroom, either actually or\n\nconstructively, a reasonable jury could not have found him guilty\n\nof being a felon in possession of a firearm as charged in Count\n\nSeven    of    Criminal   Case    No.    03-284.       Therefore,     Rodriguez’s\n\nconviction and sentence on Count Seven are vacated.\n\n              With respect to Count Five, Rodriguez was also charged\n\nwith aiding and abetting Rivera to violate § 924(c)(1), possessing\n\nguns in furtherance of a drug crime.                 A defendant is guilty of\n\naiding and abetting in a crime if the principal committed a crime,\n\nand “the defendant consciously shared the principal’s knowledge of\n\nthe underlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal.”\n\nUnited States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo, 483 F.3d 124, 130 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).   “Again, mere association with the principal or presence at\n\nthe scene of the crime is insufficient, even with knowledge that\n\nthe crime is to be committed.”            Id.   Instead, to be guilty as an\n\naider and abettor in violation of § 924(c)(1), the accomplice must\n\nboth know, to a practical certainty, that the principal would\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fpossess a gun in furtherance of the drug crime and must also\n\nfacilitate that possession.         United States v. Medina-Roman, 376\n\nF.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            Because Rivera was convicted of violating § 924(c)(1),\n\nwhich was not appealed, it is established that the principal\n\ncommitted the crime of possessing guns in furtherance of a drug\n\ncrime.    The evidence at trial supports an inference that Rodriguez\n\nknew Rivera was engaged in criminal activity related to drug\n\ntrafficking; indeed, they had a long-standing relationship in the\n\ndrug trafficking business.\n\n            Evidence was introduced that Rodriguez knew that Rivera\n\nhad guns at the Cataño apartment, which were involved in the drug\n\nbusiness. Rodriguez was seen walking from the area of the bedroom,\n\nwhere Rivera was looking out of the door and holding a gun.\n\nRodriguez’s crutch was found on the bed in the bedroom.            Officers\n\nfound the guns hidden in the bedroom, along with drugs, money, and\n\ndrug paraphernalia.        The proximity of the guns and the drugs\n\nindicates a link between them.             Witnesses also testified that\n\nRivera was always armed. That evidence, taken in the proper light,\n\ncould    support   a   jury’s   conclusion   that   Rodriguez   knew,   to   a\n\npractical certainty, that Rivera had a gun or guns and would use a\n\ngun to protect and defend his drug business.          Cf. United States v.\n\nSpinney, 65 F.3d 231, 239 (1st Cir. 1995) (finding insufficient\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fevidence of knowledge to sustain aiding and abetting conviction\n\nunder § 924(c)).\n\n            The record offers no evidence, however, that Rodriguez\n\nfacilitated Rivera in possessing or using the guns.                         For example,\n\nthe record lacks evidence that Rodriguez bought or supplied the\n\nguns, arranged for their delivery, or assisted in any other respect\n\nin making the guns available for Rivera.                       See United States v.\n\nLuciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1150-52 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing\n\nevidence    of    knowledge       and    facilitation       sufficient       to    sustain\n\nconviction of aiding and abetting violation of § 924(c)(1)).\n\n            To     sustain    a    conviction         for   aiding    and    abetting     a\n\nviolation of § 924(c)(1), the evidence must be sufficient to show\n\nboth that the defendant knew, to a practical certainty, that the\n\nprincipal would possess a gun in furtherance of the drug crime and\n\nthat the defendant facilitated that possession.                      Medina-Roman, 376\n\nF.3d at 6.       Because evidence of facilitation is lacking in this\n\ncase,   Rodriguez’s       conviction           and    sentence       for    violating     §\n\n924(c)(1),       Count   Five,     are    also       vacated   due    to    insufficient\n\nevidence.\n\n            5.     Sentencing\n\n            Rodriguez challenges the drug quantities the district\n\ncourt   used     in   determining        his    sentence       and   argues       that   his\n\nsentences were unreasonable.                   We review a sentencing court’s\n\nfactual findings, including drug quantity calculations, for clear\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\ferror.         United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 40-41 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 228 (2008).             We review the substantive\n\nreasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion.                      United\n\nStates v. Morales-Machuca, 546 F.3d 13, 25 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                At the sentencing hearing, Rodriguez’s counsel argued\n\nthat     evidence      was   lacking   to   calculate   an   amount   of    drugs\n\nattributable to Rodriguez and that, based on testimony at the\n\nsuppression hearing, the drugs found at the Cataño apartment\n\nbelonged to Rivera and not Rodriguez.             The district court ruled\n\nthat for purposes of Rodriguez’s sentencing, Rivera’s suppression\n\nhearing testimony was irrelevant and would not be considered.10 The\n\ncourt         relied   on    the   presentence    report’s     drug   quantity\n\ncalculations.\n\n                The court explained that based on Rivera-Rubero’s trial\n\ntestimony, Rodriguez supplied him with approximately thirty pounds\n\nof marijuana on a bi-weekly basis, between 1996 and 1998, for a\n\ntotal of 978 kilograms.            After 1999, Rodriguez supplied Rivera-\n\nRubero with heroin on many occasions, although Rivera-Rubero also\n\nhad other heroin suppliers.            The court calculated that Rodriguez\n\nsupplied one kilogram per year of heroin from 1999 until January of\n\n2002.         When converted to the marijuana equivalent, that amount\n\ntotaled 1000 kilograms of marijuana.              The court found that the\n\ntotal amount of drugs found at the Cataño apartment equaled 1930.4\n\n\n        10\n             Rodriguez does not dispute that ruling on appeal.\n\n                                       -23-\n\fkilograms of marijuana.   Adding all of the amounts together, the\n\ncourt found that Rodriguez’s drug activities involved 5,908.8\n\nkilograms of marijuana.\n\n          Rodriguez contends that the drugs found at the Cataño\n\napartment are not attributable to him and argues that those drugs\n\nshould not have been considered in determining his sentence.\n\nBecause he was convicted of drug trafficking crimes based on the\n\ndrugs found at the Cataño apartment, however, his argument is\n\nwithout merit.   Rodriguez does not otherwise contest the court’s\n\ncalculations of the drug quantities, and the record supports the\n\ncourt’s quantity findings.\n\n          Under the Guidelines, a crime involving at least 3,000\n\nkilograms but less than 10,000 kilograms of marijuana yields a base\n\noffense level of 34.   Because there were no other adjustments, the\n\ntotal offense level was also 34.   Based on a total offense level of\n\n34 and a criminal history category of II, the advisory guideline\n\nsentencing range was 168 to 210 months.      After considering the\n\nfactors set forth in § 3553(a), which were addressed in the\n\npresentence report, the court decided that a sentence at the top of\n\nthe range was appropriate for Rodriguez.   The district court noted\n\nthat Rodriguez had physical impairments due to his injuries from a\n\nserious accident, but found that despite his impairments, Rodriguez\n\ncontinued to be involved in criminal activity.\n\n\n\n\n                                -24-\n\f           The district court followed the sentencing protocol that\n\nwe have prescribed.    See United States v. Smith, 531 F.3d 109, 111\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).   “If the court has calculated the GSR correctly\n\nand has supplied a plausible explanation for the sentence imposed,\n\nwe generally defer to the district court’s judgment.”    Id.   That is\n\nthe case here.\n\nB.   Rivera’s Appeal\n\n           Based on the presentence report calculations and evidence\n\nheard at the sentencing hearing, the district court found that\n\nRivera’s drug offenses involved more than 30 kilograms of heroin,\n\nwhich converted to 30,000 kilograms of marijuana. As a result, the\n\napplicable base offense level was determined to be 38.         A four-\n\nlevel enhancement was added because of Rivera’s leadership role in\n\nthe offenses, resulting in a total offense level of 42.     The court\n\nalso found a criminal history category of VI.\n\n           Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Count One of\n\nCriminal Case No. 02-391.   In Criminal Case No. 03-284, Rivera was\n\nsentenced to life in prison on Counts One and Three and to terms of\n\n40 years on Count Two, 60 months on Count Four, and 120 months on\n\nCount Six, all such terms to run concurrently.   In addition, he was\n\nsentenced to a term of 60 months for his conviction on Count Five\n\nin Criminal Case No. 03-284, which was to be served consecutively\n\nto his other sentences in Criminal Case No. 03-284.     Rivera argues\n\nthat his sentences were not reasonable, that the drug quantity\n\n\n                                -25-\n\fdetermination was erroneous, and that the court erred in imposing\n\na four-point adjustment based on his role in the drug operations.\n\nWe begin by considering Rivera’s claims of procedural irregularity\n\nbefore addressing the reasonableness of his sentence.\n\n          1.   Drug Quantity\n\n          At the sentencing hearing, the district court explained\n\nthat a government witness, Rivera-Rubero, testified at trial that\n\nhe supplied Rivera, for his drug point in Ponce, with two or three\n\neighths of a kilogram of heroin weekly for the time after Rivera\n\nleft prison in September of 1999 until Rivera-Rubero went to jail\n\nin January of 2002.    The district court determined that period\n\nincluded 29 months or 116 weeks.      Taking the lesser amount, two\n\neighths of a kilogram of heroin per week, the district court\n\ncalculated that Rivera’s drug transactions as part of the Conejos\n\nconspiracy involved 29 kilograms of heroin.     The court added the\n\n1.260 kilograms of heroin found in the Cataño apartment, which\n\nbrought the total over 30 kilograms of heroin. Based on Sentencing\n\nGuideline § 2D1.1(a)(3), which refers to the Drug Quantity Table at\n\nsubsection (c), 30 kilograms or more of heroin results in a base\n\noffense level of 38.\n\n          Rivera argued at the sentencing hearing and argues on\n\nappeal that Rivera-Rubero did not supply heroin to him as regularly\n\nas the court found because Rivera had other suppliers.      As the\n\ndistrict court stated at the sentencing hearing, Rivera-Rubero’s\n\n\n                               -26-\n\ftestimony established that Rivera was buying two to three eighths\n\nof a kilogram of heroin every week during the period between the\n\nend of September of 1999 to January of 2002, although his suppliers\n\nwere not always the same.             Therefore, Rivera’s argument that\n\nRivera-Rubero, himself, did not always supply heroin to Rivera does\n\nnot change the drug quantity calculation.\n\n              The district court’s factual findings as to drug quantity\n\nare reviewed for clear error.          Sanchez-Badillo, 540 F.3d at 34.\n\nThe district court did not add drug quantities pertaining to the\n\ntime Rivera was in prison, as Rivera mistakenly asserts.              Instead,\n\nthe court explicitly considered only the period of the conspiracy\n\nfrom the end of September of 1999 until January of 2002.              Further,\n\nthe drug quantity was calculated using the lesser amount indicated\n\nby the testimony and without considering the other drugs Rivera\n\nsold or possessed.       The district court’s drug quantity calculation\n\nwas conservative and well-supported by the evidence at trial.\n\nTherefore the drug quantity finding is not clearly erroneous.\n\n              2.    Leadership Role\n\n              Under Sentencing Guidelines § 3B1.1(a), a defendant’s\n\nbase offense level is raised by four levels if he “was an organizer\n\nor   leader    of    criminal   activity     that   involved   five   or   more\n\nparticipants or was otherwise extensive.”           “The Guidelines provide\n\na nonexclusive list of factors to guide the determination of\n\nwhether a defendant held a leadership or organizational role.”\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fUnited States v. Ziskind, 491 F.3d 10, 17 (1st Cir. 2007), cert.\n\ndenied, 128 S. Ct. 1305 (2008). We review a district court’s\n\ndecision to impose an enhancement for clear error.         Id.\n\n          Rivera argues that he was not the main organizer or\n\nleader of the Conejos conspiracy, particularly because he was in\n\nprison from 1995 to 1999.        Instead, he contends, his brother,\n\nRichard, was in charge of their drug points.     Rivera also contends\n\nthat he did not have five or more subordinates whom he directed or\n\nsupervised.\n\n          In   determining   a   defendant’s   role   in   the   criminal\n\nactivity, the court considers, among other things,\n\n          the exercise of decision making authority, the\n          nature of participation in the commission of\n          the offense, the recruitment of accomplices,\n          the claimed right to a larger share of the\n          fruits   of   the   crime,   the   degree   of\n          participation in planning or organizing the\n          offense, the nature and scope of the illegal\n          activity, and the degree of control and\n          authority exercised over others.\n\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, cmt. 4; see also United States v. Yelaun, 541\n\nF.3d 415, 421 (1st Cir. 2008). Witnesses testified that Rivera and\n\nhis brother, Piolo, owned and operated a drug point selling cocaine\n\nand heroin in the Conejos organization after Rivera was released\n\nfrom prison in 1999.11   As the district court found, testimony at\n\n\n     11\n      Although Rivera’s brother, Richard, testified that he owned\nthe drug point and that Rivera was not involved in the drug\nbusiness, the jury believed other witnesses about Rivera’s\ninvolvement in criminal activity.\n\n                                  -28-\n\ftrial established that more than five co-conspirators were involved\n\nwith Rivera at the Conejos drug point.                 The witnesses’ testimony\n\nestablished      that    Rivera    made    the    decisions    as    to   which     drug\n\nsuppliers he would use for the drug point.                    Evidence shows that\n\nRivera   ran       the     drug     point        and   sold    drugs      from       it.\n\n            Even    if    Rivera    were    subordinate       to    Richard    in    the\n\nhierarchy   of     the    conspiracy,      that    would   not      negate    Rivera’s\n\nleadership role.        See United States v. Arango, 508 F.3d 34, 49 (1st\n\nCir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 1101 & 128 S. Ct. 1904 (2008);\n\nUnited States v. Ventura, 353 F.3d 84, 89 (1st Cir. 2003).                          The\n\nevidence supports the district court’s finding that Rivera had a\n\nleadership role in a criminal activity that involved five or more\n\nparticipants.\n\n            3.    Reasonableness\n\n            Rivera contends that the presentence report and the\n\ndistrict court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as if they were\n\nmandatory and ignored the factors provided by § 3553(a), resulting\n\nin an unreasonable sentence. In particular, Rivera argues that his\n\nlife sentence was greater than necessary, that the court failed to\n\nconsider his particular characteristics and history, and that the\n\nfour-level enhancement he received for his role in the conspiracy\n\nis   unreasonable        because   other    co-conspirators,         including      his\n\nbrother Richard, received only a three-level enhancement.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -29-\n\f          We review a sentence for procedural error, including the\n\ndistrict court’s application of § 3553(a), and then consider a\n\nchallenge to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, both of\n\nwhich are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Rodriguez, 527 F.3d\n\nat 224.   “In considering objections to a sentence’s substantive\n\nreasonableness, we examine the district court’s contemporaneous\n\noral explanation of the sentence, its near-contemporaneous written\n\nstatement of reasons, and what fairly can be gleaned by comparing\n\nwhat was argued by the parties or proffered in the PSI Report with\n\nwhat the sentencing court ultimately did.”               United States v.\n\nMartin, 520 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n          Section 3553(a)(6) directs a sentencing court to consider\n\n“the   need    to   avoid   unwarranted   sentence    disparities      among\n\ndefendants with similar records who have been found guilty of\n\nsimilar conduct.”      A consideration of sentencing disparities under\n\nthat section, however, “aims primarily at the minimization of\n\ndisparities among defendants nationally.”         Martin, 520 F.3d at 94.\n\nIn addition, as the district court noted, Richard and the other co-\n\nconspirators    pled    guilty,   pursuant   to   plea    agreements   that\n\naddressed their roles under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1.         Given the material\n\ndifference between the defendants who pled guilty pursuant to plea\n\nagreements and Rivera who did not, no disparity in sentencing\n\noccurred in this case that would amount to an abuse of discretion.\n\nSee United States v. Brandao, 539 F.3d 44, 65 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\f              Rivera’s counsel argued at the sentencing hearing that\n\nbecause of Rivera’s young age and a corrupt system that encouraged\n\nillegal drug activity in Ponce, the court should not sentence\n\nRivera to life in prison.          Counsel also argued that Rivera was a\n\nfugitive before he was arrested in September of 2003 based on the\n\nadvice of his former counsel.         Counsel acknowledged that Rivera’s\n\n“life had been one of crime for many years” and that he had “been\n\nin jail most of his adult life,” but she blamed corruption in the\n\nsystem for making him a criminal and perpetuating his life of\n\ncrime.\n\n              After explaining the total offense level, the criminal\n\nhistory category, and the applicable guideline range of 360 months\n\nto life in prison, the district court stated that the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines     were   advisory.       The    court      recited   the   sentencing\n\nconsiderations provided by § 3553(a).                   With reference to the\n\npresentence report, which had been addressed extensively during the\n\nsentencing hearing, the court discussed Rivera’s activities in\n\nlight of the § 3553(a) considerations.                    The court found that\n\nalthough   Rivera     was    young,   he    had    an    extensive      history   of\n\nrecidivism, involving both violent crimes and drug crimes.                    As a\n\nresult, the court concluded that a life sentence, the high end of\n\nthe advisory guideline range, was appropriate.\n\n              The record shows that the district court considered the\n\n§   3553(a)    factors      and   imposed    a    reasonable      sentence   after\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fconsidering Rivera’s particular circumstances.      The court did not\n\nabuse is discretion.\n\n\n\n                                   III.\n\n           For   the   foregoing    reasons,   Rivera’s   sentence   is\n\naffirmed. Rodriguez’s convictions and sentences are affirmed as to\n\nCriminal Case No. 02-391 and Counts One, Two, Three, and Four of\n\nCriminal Case No. 03-284. Rodriguez’s convictions and sentences on\n\nCounts Five and Seven in Criminal Case No. 03-284, however, are\n\nvacated.   The case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent\n\nwith this opinion.12\n\n           Affirmed in part, and Vacated and Remanded in part.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      We note that the judgment entered as to Rodriguez in Criminal\nCase No. 02-391 suggested that the sentence entered in that case\nwas to be served consecutively to the sentence entered on Count\nFive in Criminal Case No. 03-284. Entry of amended judgments will\ncorrect that potentially ambiguous statement.\n\n                                   -32-\n\f",

Rodriguez-Lozada (\"Rodriguez\") appeals his convictions and sentence. He contends that the district court erred in denying his motions to suppress and to sever, that the jury did not represent a fair cross section of the community, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. He also challenges his sentence. Rivera-Garcia (\"Rivera\") raises three issues, all <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> pertaining to his sentence. Rodriguez's convictions and sentences on the gun charges are vacated; his convictions and sentences are otherwise affirmed. Rivera's sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Members of the Rivera-Garcia family, including Nelson Rivera-Garcia, were involved in a drug trafficking organization, known as \"Callejón de los Conejos,\" that operated in Ponce, Puerto Rico. A federal grand jury returned an indictment, dated September 27, 2002, charging Rivera and nine others, including his three brothers and his mother, with a drug conspiracy that operated from 1995 until the date of the indictment (Criminal Case No. 02-391). An arrest warrant was issued for Rivera.</p>\n<p>The United States Marshals Service learned that Rivera was living at an apartment in Cataño, Puerto Rico. On September 29, 2003, Deputy United States Marshals and Puerto Rico Special Response Team (\"S.R.T\") officers went to that apartment to arrest Rivera. The S.R.T. officers knocked on the apartment door and announced their presence. One of the officers saw a man, whom he recognized, look out of a window near the door.<sup>[1]</sup> When no one responded to their knocking, the S.R.T. officers knocked down the door and entered the apartment behind an officer carrying a bullet-proof shield.</p>\n<p>As the S.R.T. officers entered, they saw Rodriguez, wearing a leg brace but not using a crutch, walking toward them. They also saw Rivera looking out of the slightly-open bedroom door, holding a gun. The officers secured Rodriguez. Rivera closed and locked the bedroom door, but after an officer kicked the door twice, Rivera opened the door and came out without the gun. The officers secured Rivera.</p>\n<p>The S.R.T. officers and federal marshals entered the bedroom. A crutch was on the bed. They found heroin, cocaine, packaging for the drugs, and money. Clothing and cell phones were also found in the room. They discovered a loaded Taurus 9 mm pistol under a pillow on the bed and a loaded Glock .45 caliber pistol in a box under the bed. They found additional equipment for processing and packaging drugs in the kitchen. Rivera and Rodriguez were arrested.</p>\n<p>A grand jury indicted Rivera and Rodriguez on October 10, 2003, for crimes arising from the circumstances of their arrest in Cataño (Criminal Case No. 03-284). They were charged with possessing heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); with possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1) and (2); and with aiding and abetting each other in those crimes. Rivera and Rodriguez were each charged, separately, with being a felon in possession of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). In December of 2003, a grand jury returned a superseding indictment in Criminal Case No. 02-391, charging Rivera and Rodriguez with conspiring with ten other co-conspirators, including Rivera's brothers and mother, to possess with the intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana in violation of § 841(a)(1). The court granted the government's motion to consolidate the two cases.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> Rivera and Rodriguez moved to suppress the evidence found in the Cataño apartment, and a hearing was held on the motions on August 23, 2004. At the hearing, the court realized that an issue existed as to whether the defendants had standing to challenge the evidence. The court denied Rodriguez's motion, due to his lack of standing, and gave Rivera an opportunity to brief the issue. A further hearing on Rivera's motion to suppress was held on November 5, 10, and 12, 2004. The court denied Rivera's motion on December 23, 2004.</p>\n<p>Jury selection was held on April 27, 2005. On May 2, 2005, counsel gave their opening statements, and the government called its first witness. Evidence continued each day through Thursday, May 5. On May 6, Rodriguez filed a motion to sever his trial from Rivera's trial, arguing that if they were tried separately, Rivera would provide exculpatory testimony for Rodriguez, based on Rivera's testimony at the suppression hearing. The court held a hearing on Rodriguez's motion on Monday, May 9. The government objected to severance.</p>\n<p>Despite noting that the motion to sever was untimely, the court decided to sever the trial of Criminal Case. No. 02-391 from Criminal Case No. 03-284. Under the new schedule, both defendants would be tried on the charges in Criminal Case No. 02-391 first, and a separate trial for Criminal Case No. 03-284 would be held at a later time. Following the lunch break the same day, however, the court reconsidered the severance issue and denied the motion as untimely. Trial proceeded, as originally planned, on the charges against both defendants in both cases.</p>\n<p>After the conclusion of the government's case, both defendants moved for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. The motions were denied. On May 18, 2005, the jury returned its verdict finding Rivera and Rodriguez guilty on all charges.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Presentence reports were prepared and submitted. Rivera objected to the drug quantities and other parts of his presentence report. Rodriguez requested that new counsel be appointed to represent him for sentencing, and the court appointed new counsel on November 17, 2005.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez's sentencing hearing was held on May 17, 2006. The court found a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of II resulting in an advisory guideline range of 168 to 210 months. After reciting the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and discussing the extent of Rodriguez's drug transactions, the nature of his offenses and his role in them, his injuries, and his possession of weapons, as noted in the presentence report, the court concluded that a sentence at the high end of the range was appropriate. Rodriguez was sentenced to 210 months on Count One in Criminal Case No. 02-391; 210 months on Counts One, Two, and Three in Criminal Case No. 03-284; 60 months on Count Four; and 120 months on Count Seven of Criminal Case No. 03-284, all such terms to run concurrently. In addition, he was sentenced to 60 months on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, said sentence to be served consecutively to the other sentences imposed resulting in a total sentence of 270 months. Terms of supervised release were also imposed.</p>\n<p>Rivera's sentencing hearing began on March 17, 2006, and was continued to August <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> 16, 2006. The court found a base offense level of 38 and applied a four-level increase based on Rivera's leadership role, which yielded an adjusted offense level of 42. The court found a criminal history category of VI based on his status as a career criminal. A criminal history category of VI, combined with a total offense level of 42, resulted in an advisory guideline range of 360 months to life.</p>\n<p>Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Count One of Criminal Case No. 02-391. In Criminal Case No. 03-284, Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Counts One and Three and to terms of 40 years on Count Two, 60 months on Count Four, and 120 months on Count Six, all such terms to run concurrently. In addition, he was sentenced to a term of 60 months for his conviction on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, which was to be served consecutively to his other sentences in Criminal Case No. 03-284. Terms of supervised release were also imposed.</p>\n<p>Rivera and Rodriguez filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Rodriguez challenges the district court's denial of his motions, the make-up of the jury, the sufficiency of the evidence, and his sentence. Rivera raises issues pertaining to his sentence. We consider the issues raised by the parties in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Rodriguez's Appeal</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rodriguez contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to sever his trial from Rivera's trial and in denying him a hearing on his motion to suppress evidence found at the apartment in Cataño, where he was arrested with Rivera. He also argues that the jury did not represent a fair cross-section of the community, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction, and that his sentence was unreasonable. The government responds that some of the issues Rodriguez raises were waived and that the issues lack merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Motion to Suppress</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Both Rodriguez and Rivera moved to suppress the evidence found at the Cataño apartment. At the beginning of the suppression hearing, Rodriguez's counsel sought additional evidence, including the address of a witness who had some involvement in the circumstances of the arrest, for the purpose of obtaining a subpoena. After a sidebar conference, the district court stated on the record:</p>\n<blockquote>I was under the misapprehension that the subpoena that was requested by [Rodriguez] concerned the person who had the possession or the custody or the use of the place where the defendants were arrested. It turns out that she is not the owner nor did she have that apartment under any type of rent or under her control. Also during this conference, it appeared that [Rodriguez] was there visiting and in those circumstances then he would have no standing to challenge any search that was done at that time and there[fore] his motion to suppress is hereby denied on the basis of standing to file the motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<p>Supp. Hr. T., 8/23/04, at 8-9. The court then ordered Rivera to brief the issue of whether he had standing to move to suppress the evidence. Another hearing on Rivera's suppression motion was held in November, and the motion was denied on December 23, 2004.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Rodriguez argues that he had standing to move to suppress the evidence found in the Cataño apartment, despite his status as a guest in the apartment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> and that the district court should have heard his motion. The government contends that Rodriguez waived the standing issue by not raising it in the district court.<sup>[3]</sup> Alternatively, the government argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez a hearing on his motion.</p>\n<p>Before a court may reach the merits of a motion to suppress, \"the defendant carries the burden of establishing that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the area searched or, as in this case, the items seized.\" <i>United States v. Lipscomb,</i> 539 F.3d 32, 35-36 (1st Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 963, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2009). Although the threshold requirement is referred to as standing, it is more properly considered under a Fourth Amendment analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 36. \"[F]ailure to present evidence with respect to such an expectation prevents a defendant from making a claim for suppression under the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>United States v. Samboy,</i> 433 F.3d 154, 162 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>In the district court, Rodriguez failed to address the question of whether he had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the Cataño apartment or the items seized there. On appeal, Rodriguez asserts, based on his status as a casual visitor for a brief period at Rivera's apartment, that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. He is mistaken. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Torres,</i> 162 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1998). The district court properly denied his motion, due to his lack of standing, without further consideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Motion to Sever</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On May 6, 2005, Rodriguez filed a motion to sever trial of the charges against him from Rivera's trial. He argued that Rivera's testimony at the suppression hearing in November of 2004, about the drugs, guns, and money found in the apartment in Cataño, was exculpatory evidence which he wanted to present in his defense. He further argued that Rivera would testify on his behalf if the charges against them were tried separately.</p>\n<p>The district court addressed the motion on the morning of May 9, 2005. Rodriguez's counsel explained the exculpatory nature of the testimony he expected from Rivera. The court asked whether Rivera would testify on Rodriguez's behalf, and Rivera's counsel said that he would testify only if the charges against him were severed from Rodriguez's trial and if Rivera were tried first. The government objected to the motion on the ground that it was untimely, because the trial had already progressed into the second week, and argued that the totality of Rivera's testimony was not exculpatory. After initially deciding to sever the two indictments, the district court denied Rodriguez's motion as untimely.</p>\n<p>A district court's decision to deny a motion to sever is reviewed for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 52 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 129 S.Ct. 513, 172 L.Ed.2d 376 &amp; ___ U.S. ____, 129 S.Ct. 615, 172 L.Ed.2d 469 (2008). A motion to sever charges or defendants must be made before trial. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(D). Failure to move for severance before the deadline for filing pretrial motions constitutes waiver, which may be excused only on a showing of good cause. Fed. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> R.Crim.P. 12(e); <i>United States v. Pena-Lora,</i> 225 F.3d 17, 33 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Palmer,</i> 122 F.3d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p>On appeal, Rodriguez argues the merits of his severance motion. The government points out that the motion was denied as untimely and that Rodriguez failed to show good cause for the untimely filing. At oral argument before this court, Rodriguez's counsel represented that the motion to sever was timely, having been filed on the first day of trial following jury selection. In support of his position, counsel filed a letter, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), in which counsel stated: \"Said motion was filed on May 6, 2005, after jury selection but before the start of jury trial, day one, on May 9, 2005.\"<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Counsel's representation is contrary to the record and to the statement of the case presented in Rodriguez's own brief.<sup>[5]</sup> Jury selection was held on April 27, 2005. The first day of evidence was May 2 and trial continued through May 5. Therefore, the motion to sever, filed on May 6, 2005, was untimely.</p>\n<p>In the district court, Rodriguez's counsel explained that the motion was filed on May 6 because he had only received the full transcript of the suppression hearing earlier that week. Counsel further stated that after reading the transcript, he realized that Rivera's testimony was exculpatory. The district court found, however, that because counsel attended the suppression hearing in November of 2004 and heard the testimony at that time, he did not need the transcript before filing the motion.</p>\n<p>Based on the circumstances presented here, the motion for severance was untimely, and Rodriguez failed to show good cause for an untimely filing. The district court correctly denied the motion. No abuse of discretion occurred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Jury Selection</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rodriguez argues, for the first time on appeal, that the requirement that jurors serving in the District of Puerto Rico be proficient in English violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury made up of a fair cross section of the community. Issues not raised before the district court are forfeited and subject to review only for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Rodriguez provides no basis to reconsider our previous holding in the circumstances of this case. No error occurred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> 4. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rodriguez contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to convict him of the conspiracy charged in Criminal Case No. 02-391 and the weapons charges in Criminal Case No. 03-284. We review the district court's denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal under the de novo standard. <i>United States v. Giambro,</i> 544 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir.2008). In doing so, however, we view \"the evidence in the light most flattering to the jury's guilty verdict [and] assess whether a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Lipscomb,</i> 539 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p>With respect to the conspiracy conviction, Rodriguez argues that relatively little evidence was presented at trial that linked him to the Conejos drug operations in Ponce and that the evidence presented showed that he played only a minor role.<sup>[6]</sup> To prove that Rodriguez was part of a drug conspiracy, the government was required to prove \"that a conspiracy existed, that [Rodriguez] had knowledge of it, and that [Rodriguez] participated voluntarily in it.\" <i>United States v. Famania-Roche,</i> 537 F.3d 71, 78 (1st Cir.2008). A \"conspiratorial agreement may be `express or tacit and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.'\" <i>Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d at 26 (quoting <i>United States v. Gomez,</i> 255 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2001)). The underlying criminal activity of the conspiracy charged was a violation of § 841(a)(1), which involves manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing drugs, or possession with the intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense drugs.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez's co-defendant, Sigilfredo Rivera-Rubero, who became a government witness, testified that he first met Rodriguez during a drug transaction in 1996 or 1997 when he bought marijuana from Rodriguez. Rivera-Rubero testified that initially, in 1996 and 1997, Rodriguez sold him marijuana in the amount of thirty pounds every two weeks. Rivera-Rubero described the Conejos drug organization and identified its members, which included himself, Rivera, and others. He further testified that beginning in 1999, he had a business relationship with Rodriguez, selling drugs, and a social relationship with him. At that time, Rodriguez supplied cocaine, marijuana, and heroin to Rivera-Rubero, although Rivera-Rubero also had other suppliers. In addition, Rivera-Rubero testified that Rodriguez sold drugs to other members of the Conejos organization. Rodriguez's wife testified about Rodriguez's contacts with Rivera and that Rodriguez called Rivera \"Boss.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is not the role of the reviewing court to weigh the evidence; our role is merely to ensure that some evidence exists to support sufficiently the jury's determination.\" <i>United States v. Liranzo,</i> 385 F.3d 66, 70 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The evidence is more than sufficient for a rational jury to find that Rodriguez was part of the Conejos drug trafficking conspiracy. Rodriguez's long drug-related relationships with Rivera-Rubero and Rivera, along with supplying drugs to other members of the Conejos organization, support a finding that he knowingly and voluntarily participated in the Conejos drug organization. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conspiracy conviction in Criminal Case No. 02-391.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> Rodriguez also argues that evidence is lacking to support his conviction on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, that he possessed a weapon in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme in violation of § 924(c)(1), and aided and abetted Rivera in doing so, and on Count Seven, that he was a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of § 922(g)(1).<sup>[7]</sup> He argues that he was only a visitor at Rivera's apartment in Cataño where the guns were found. The government contends that the evidence proved that Rodriguez aided and abetted Rivera in possessing guns and also that Rodriguez was in constructive possession of the guns found in the apartment.</p>\n<p>Section 922(g)(1), charged in Count Five, requires that Rodriguez have had knowing possession of the guns.<sup>[8]</sup> \"Knowing possession under § 922(g)(1) can be established by proving that [Rodriguez] had constructive possession of [the guns]; that is, that he knowingly had the <i>power</i> and the <i>intention</i> at a given time of exercising dominion and control over a firearm, directly or through others.\" <i>DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>In Count Seven, Rodriguez was charged with violation of § 924(c)(1) by possessing, in furtherance of drug trafficking, and aiding and abetting Rivera in possessing the two guns found at the Cataño apartment when they were arrested. To convict under § 924(c)(1), the government must prove possession of the guns and a significant nexus between the guns and the drug crime, meaning that \"the firearm facilitates or has the potential to facilitate the drug trafficking offense.\"<sup>[9]</sup><i>United States v. Roberson,</i> 459 F.3d 39, 48 (1st Cir.2006), <i>cert. denied,</i> 549 U.S. 1214, 127 S.Ct. 1261, 167 L.Ed.2d 90 (2007). 18 U.S.C. § 2 provides that one who aids or abets another in commission of a crime \"is punishable as a principal.\"</p>\n<p>Constructive possession is shown if Rodriguez knowingly had the power and intention to exercise \"dominion and control over a firearm directly or through others.\" <i>United States v. Sanchez-Badillo,</i> 540 F.3d 24, 31 (1st Cir. 2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 129 S.Ct. 953, ___ L.Ed.2d ____ (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Constructive possession can be joint, does not require actual ownership of the firearm, and can be established through circumstantial evidence. . . .\" <i>DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d at 67.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, mere presence with or proximity to weapons or association with another who possesses a weapon are not enough to prove constructive possession. <i>United States v. Duval,</i> 496 F.3d 64, 78 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 128 S.Ct. 952, 169 L.Ed.2d 783 &amp; ___ U.S. ____, 128 S.Ct. 2499, 171 L.Ed.2d 790 (2008); <i>United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 501 (1st Cir.2005). Instead, the government must show \"some action, some word, or some conduct that links the individual to the contraband and indicates that he had some stake in it, some power over it.\" <i>McLean,</i> 409 F.3d at 501 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> As the S.R.T. officers entered the Cantaño apartment, they saw Rodriguez walking from the area of the bedroom and saw Rivera standing in the bedroom doorway, holding a gun. Rivera closed and locked the bedroom door before the officers could enter. The officer in charge arranged his personnel around the closed and locked bedroom door and then kicked the door. Rivera did not respond immediately, but after several kicks, Rivera opened the door and was no longer holding the gun. The officers arrested Rivera and then entered the bedroom where they saw Rodriguez's crutch on the bed and found drugs, drug paraphernalia, money, and two loaded gunsone under a pillow and the other in a box under the bed. They also found clothes and cell phones.</p>\n<p>Based on that evidence, which is taken in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Rodriguez had been in the bedroom with Rivera and that Rivera was holding one of the loaded guns when the officers entered the apartment. Rodriguez, however, was only a temporary visitor at the apartment, where Rivera was living. He did not own the apartment or its contents, including the guns. The government does not contend that any of the clothes, cell phones, or other property found in the bedroom, other than the crutch, belonged to Rodriguez. The record includes no evidence that Rodriguez owned or actually possessed either gun.</p>\n<p>It is not necessary, however, for Rodriguez to have owned or physically possessed the guns to satisfy the possession requirements of § 922(g)(1) and § 924(c)(1) because possession may be constructive. While the evidence shows that Rodriguez was present in the bedroom with the guns and was near Rivera, who was seen holding a gun, evidence is lacking to link Rodriguez to the guns. In the absence of evidence that Rodriguez knowingly possessed the guns found in Rivera's bedroom, either actually or constructively, a reasonable jury could not have found him guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm as charged in Count Seven of Criminal Case No. 03-284. Therefore, Rodriguez's conviction and sentence on Count Seven are vacated.</p>\n<p>With respect to Count Five, Rodriguez was also charged with aiding and abetting Rivera to violate § 924(c)(1), possessing guns in furtherance of a drug crime. A defendant is guilty of aiding and abetting in a crime if the principal committed a crime, and \"the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal.\" <i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d 124, 130 (1st Cir.2007). \"Again, mere association with the principal or presence at the scene of the crime is insufficient, even with knowledge that the crime is to be committed.\" <i>Id.</i> Instead, to be guilty as an aider and abettor in violation of § 924(c)(1), the accomplice must both know, to a practical certainty, that the principal would possess a gun in furtherance of the drug crime and must also facilitate that possession. <i>United States v. Medina-Roman,</i> 376 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Because Rivera was convicted of violating § 924(c)(1), which was not appealed, it is established that the principal committed the crime of possessing guns in furtherance of a drug crime. The evidence at trial supports an inference that Rodriguez knew Rivera was engaged in criminal activity related to drug trafficking; indeed, they had a long-standing relationship in the drug trafficking business.</p>\n<p>Evidence was introduced that Rodriguez knew that Rivera had guns at the Cataño apartment, which were involved in the drug business. Rodriguez was seen walking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> from the area of the bedroom, where Rivera was looking out of the door and holding a gun. Rodriguez's crutch was found on the bed in the bedroom. Officers found the guns hidden in the bedroom, along with drugs, money, and drug paraphernalia. The proximity of the guns and the drugs indicates a link between them. Witnesses also testified that Rivera was always armed. That evidence, taken in the proper light, could support a jury's conclusion that Rodriguez knew, to a practical certainty, that Rivera had a gun or guns and would use a gun to protect and defend his drug business. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Spinney,</i> 65 F.3d 231, 239 (1st Cir.1995) (finding insufficient evidence of knowledge to sustain aiding and abetting conviction under § 924(c)).</p>\n<p>The record offers no evidence, however, that Rodriguez facilitated Rivera in possessing or using the guns. For example, the record lacks evidence that Rodriguez bought or supplied the guns, arranged for their delivery, or assisted in any other respect in making the guns available for Rivera. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Luciano-Mosquera,</i> 63 F.3d 1142, 1150-52 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing evidence of knowledge and facilitation sufficient to sustain conviction of aiding and abetting violation of § 924(c)(1)).</p>\n<p>To sustain a conviction for aiding and abetting a violation of § 924(c)(1), the evidence must be sufficient to show both that the defendant knew, to a practical certainty, that the principal would possess a gun in furtherance of the drug crime and that the defendant facilitated that possession. <i>Medina-Roman,</i> 376 F.3d at 6. Because evidence of facilitation is lacking in this case, Rodriguez's conviction and sentence for violating § 924(c)(1), Count Five, are also vacated due to insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Sentencing</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rodriguez challenges the drug quantities the district court used in determining his sentence and argues that his sentences were unreasonable. We review a sentencing court's factual findings, including drug quantity calculations, for clear error. <i>United States v. Jones,</i> 523 F.3d 31, 40-41 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 228, 172 L.Ed.2d 174 (2008). We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Morales-Machuca,</i> 546 F.3d 13, 25 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, Rodriguez's counsel argued that evidence was lacking to calculate an amount of drugs attributable to Rodriguez and that, based on testimony at the suppression hearing, the drugs found at the Cataño apartment belonged to Rivera and not Rodriguez. The district court ruled that for purposes of Rodriguez's sentencing, Rivera's suppression hearing testimony was irrelevant and would not be considered.<sup>[10]</sup> The court relied on the presentence report's drug quantity calculations.</p>\n<p>The court explained that based on Rivera-Rubero's trial testimony, Rodriguez supplied him with approximately thirty pounds of marijuana on a bi-weekly basis, between 1996 and 1998, for a total of 978 kilograms. After 1999, Rodriguez supplied Rivera-Rubero with heroin on many occasions, although Rivera-Rubero also had other heroin suppliers. The court calculated that Rodriguez supplied one kilogram per year of heroin from 1999 until January of 2002. When converted to the marijuana equivalent, that amount totaled 1000 kilograms of marijuana. The court found that the total amount of drugs found at the Cataño apartment equaled 1930.4 kilograms <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> of marijuana. Adding all of the amounts together, the court found that Rodriguez's drug activities involved 5,908.8 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez contends that the drugs found at the Cataño apartment are not attributable to him and argues that those drugs should not have been considered in determining his sentence. Because he was convicted of drug trafficking crimes based on the drugs found at the Cataño apartment, however, his argument is without merit. Rodriguez does not otherwise contest the court's calculations of the drug quantities, and the record supports the court's quantity findings.</p>\n<p>Under the Guidelines, a crime involving at least 3,000 kilograms but less than 10,000 kilograms of marijuana yields a base offense level of 34. Because there were no other adjustments, the total offense level was also 34. Based on a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of II, the advisory guideline sentencing range was 168 to 210 months. After considering the factors set forth in § 3553(a), which were addressed in the presentence report, the court decided that a sentence at the top of the range was appropriate for Rodriguez. The district court noted that Rodriguez had physical impairments due to his injuries from a serious accident, but found that despite his impairments, Rodriguez continued to be involved in criminal activity.</p>\n<p>The district court followed the sentencing protocol that we have prescribed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> 531 F.3d 109, 111 (1st Cir.2008). \"If the court has calculated the GSR correctly and has supplied a plausible explanation for the sentence imposed, we generally defer to the district court's judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> That is the case here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Rivera's Appeal</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Based on the presentence report calculations and evidence heard at the sentencing hearing, the district court found that Rivera's drug offenses involved more than 30 kilograms of heroin, which converted to 30,000 kilograms of marijuana. As a result, the applicable base offense level was determined to be 38. A four-level enhancement was added because of Rivera's leadership role in the offenses, resulting in a total offense level of 42. The court also found a criminal history category of VI.</p>\n<p>Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Count One of Criminal Case No. 02-391. In Criminal Case No. 03-284, Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Counts One and Three and to terms of 40 years on Count Two, 60 months on Count Four, and 120 months on Count Six, all such terms to run concurrently. In addition, he was sentenced to a term of 60 months for his conviction on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, which was to be served consecutively to his other sentences in Criminal Case No. 03-284. Rivera argues that his sentences were not reasonable, that the drug quantity determination was erroneous, and that the court erred in imposing a four-point adjustment based on his role in the drug operations. We begin by considering Rivera's claims of procedural irregularity before addressing the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Drug Quantity</i>\n</h2>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the district court explained that a government witness, Rivera-Rubero, testified at trial that he supplied Rivera, for his drug point in Ponce, with two or three eighths of a kilogram of heroin weekly for the time after Rivera left prison in September of 1999 until Rivera-Rubero went to jail in January of 2002. The district court determined that period included 29 months or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> 116 weeks. Taking the lesser amount, two eighths of a kilogram of heroin per week, the district court calculated that Rivera's drug transactions as part of the Conejos conspiracy involved 29 kilograms of heroin. The court added the 1.260 kilograms of heroin found in the Cataño apartment, which brought the total over 30 kilograms of heroin. Based on Sentencing Guideline § 2D1.1(a)(3), which refers to the Drug Quantity Table at subsection (c), 30 kilograms or more of heroin results in a base offense level of 38.</p>\n<p>Rivera argued at the sentencing hearing and argues on appeal that Rivera-Rubero did not supply heroin to him as regularly as the court found because Rivera had other suppliers. As the district court stated at the sentencing hearing, Rivera-Rubero's testimony established that Rivera was buying two to three eighths of a kilogram of heroin every week during the period between the end of September of 1999 to January of 2002, although his suppliers were not always the same. Therefore, Rivera's argument that Rivera-Rubero, himself, did not always supply heroin to Rivera does not change the drug quantity calculation.</p>\n<p>The district court's factual findings as to drug quantity are reviewed for clear error. <i>Sanchez-Badillo,</i> 540 F.3d at 34. The district court did not add drug quantities pertaining to the time Rivera was in prison, as Rivera mistakenly asserts. Instead, the court explicitly considered only the period of the conspiracy from the end of September of 1999 until January of 2002. Further, the drug quantity was calculated using the lesser amount indicated by the testimony and without considering the other drugs Rivera sold or possessed. The district court's drug quantity calculation was conservative and well-supported by the evidence at trial. Therefore the drug quantity finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Leadership Role</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under Sentencing Guidelines § 3B1.1(a), a defendant's base offense level is raised by four levels if he \"was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\" \"The Guidelines provide a nonexclusive list of factors to guide the determination of whether a defendant held a leadership or organizational role.\" <i>United States v. Ziskind,</i> 491 F.3d 10, 17 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1305, 170 L.Ed.2d 124 (2008). We review a district court's decision to impose an enhancement for clear error. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Rivera argues that he was not the main organizer or leader of the Conejos conspiracy, particularly because he was in prison from 1995 to 1999. Instead, he contends, his brother, Richard, was in charge of their drug points. Rivera also contends that he did not have five or more subordinates whom he directed or supervised.</p>\n<p>In determining a defendant's role in the criminal activity, the court considers, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote>the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, cmt. 4; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Yelaun,</i> 541 F.3d 415, 421 (1st Cir.2008). Witnesses testified that Rivera and his brother, Piolo, owned and operated a drug point selling cocaine and heroin in the Conejos organization after Rivera was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> released from prison in 1999.<sup>[11]</sup> As the district court found, testimony at trial established that more than five co-conspirators were involved with Rivera at the Conejos drug point. The witnesses' testimony established that Rivera made the decisions as to which drug suppliers he would use for the drug point. Evidence shows that Rivera ran the drug point and sold drugs from it.</p>\n<p>Even if Rivera were subordinate to Richard in the hierarchy of the conspiracy, that would not negate Rivera's leadership role. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Arango,</i> 508 F.3d 34, 49 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1101, 169 L.Ed.2d 834 &amp; ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1904, 170 L.Ed.2d 769 (2008); <i>United States v. Ventura,</i> 353 F.3d 84, 89 (1st Cir.2003). The evidence supports the district court's finding that Rivera had a leadership role in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Reasonableness</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rivera contends that the presentence report and the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as if they were mandatory and ignored the factors provided by § 3553(a), resulting in an unreasonable sentence. In particular, Rivera argues that his life sentence was greater than necessary, that the court failed to consider his particular characteristics and history, and that the four-level enhancement he received for his role in the conspiracy is unreasonable because other co-conspirators, including his brother Richard, received only a three-level enhancement.</p>\n<p>We review a sentence for procedural error, including the district court's application of § 3553(a), and then consider a challenge to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, both of which are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <i>Rodriguez,</i> 527 F.3d at 224. \"In considering objections to a sentence's substantive reasonableness, we examine the district court's contemporaneous oral explanation of the sentence, its near-contemporaneous written statement of reasons, and what fairly can be gleaned by comparing what was argued by the parties or proffered in the PSI Report with what the sentencing court ultimately did.\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Section 3553(a)(6) directs a sentencing court to consider \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" A consideration of sentencing disparities under that section, however, \"aims primarily at the minimization of disparities among defendants nationally.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 94. In addition, as the district court noted, Richard and the other co-conspirators pled guilty, pursuant to plea agreements that addressed their roles under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1. Given the material difference between the defendants who pled guilty pursuant to plea agreements and Rivera who did not, no disparity in sentencing occurred in this case that would amount to an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> 539 F.3d 44, 65 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Rivera's counsel argued at the sentencing hearing that because of Rivera's young age and a corrupt system that encouraged illegal drug activity in Ponce, the court should not sentence Rivera to life in prison. Counsel also argued that Rivera <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> was a fugitive before he was arrested in September of 2003 based on the advice of his former counsel. Counsel acknowledged that Rivera's \"life had been one of crime for many years\" and that he had \"been in jail most of his adult life,\" but she blamed corruption in the system for making him a criminal and perpetuating his life of crime.</p>\n<p>After explaining the total offense level, the criminal history category, and the applicable guideline range of 360 months to life in prison, the district court stated that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. The court recited the sentencing considerations provided by § 3553(a). With reference to the presentence report, which had been addressed extensively during the sentencing hearing, the court discussed Rivera's activities in light of the § 3553(a) considerations. The court found that although Rivera was young, he had an extensive history of recidivism, involving both violent crimes and drug crimes. As a result, the court concluded that a life sentence, the high end of the advisory guideline range, was appropriate.</p>\n<p>The record shows that the district court considered the § 3553(a) factors and imposed a reasonable sentence after considering Rivera's particular circumstances. The court did not abuse is discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, Rivera's sentence is affirmed. Rodriguez's convictions and sentences are affirmed as to Criminal Case No. 02-391 and Counts One, Two, Three, and Four of Criminal Case No. 03-284. Rodriguez's convictions and sentences on Counts Five and Seven in Criminal Case No. 03-284, however, are vacated. The case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, and Vacated and Remanded in part.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The S.R.T. officer recognized the man from an event the week before when S.R.T. officers and marshals went to an apartment complex in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, where they believed Rivera was staying. The S.R.T. officer saw the same man, who was wearing a leg brace, get out of the marshals' vehicle. That man was later determined to be Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>[2]  The judgment entered for Rodriguez on May 26, 2006, docketed in Criminal Case No. 02-391 at docket no. 498, indicates that Rodriguez pled guilty in that case. That entry appears to be in error.</p>\n<p>[3]  The government does not distinguish between waiver and forfeiture. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Walker,</i> 538 F.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>[4]  Rule 28(j) provides a mechanism for a party to advise the court of \"pertinent and significant authorities\" that come to light after the brief is filed or after oral argument. Counsel in this case made improper use of Rule 28(j) to raise additional argument and evidence.</p>\n<p>[5]  In his brief, Rodriguez states that voir dire and jury selection were held on April 27, 2005, that \"[o]n May 2, 2005, first day of trial was held,\" and that the testimony of government witnesses continued on May 3, May 4, and May 5. Rodriguez's Brief at 9-10.</p>\n<p>[6]  A relatively minor role in a conspiracy, however, does not preclude a conviction on that charge. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Rodriguez-Lozada (\"Rodriguez\") appeals his convictions and sentence. He contends that the district court erred in denying his motions to suppress and to sever, that the jury did not represent a fair cross section of the community, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. He also challenges his sentence. Rivera-Garcia (\"Rivera\") raises three issues, all <span class=\"star-pagination\">*34</span> pertaining to his sentence. Rodriguez's convictions and sentences on the gun charges are vacated; his convictions and sentences are otherwise affirmed. Rivera's sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Members of the Rivera-Garcia family, including Nelson Rivera-Garcia, were involved in a drug trafficking organization, known as \"Callejón de los Conejos,\" that operated in Ponce, Puerto Rico. A federal grand jury returned an indictment, dated September 27, 2002, charging Rivera and nine others, including his three brothers and his mother, with a drug conspiracy that operated from 1995 until the date of the indictment (Criminal Case No. 02-391). An arrest warrant was issued for Rivera.</p>\n<p>The United States Marshals Service learned that Rivera was living at an apartment in Cataño, Puerto Rico. On September 29, 2003, Deputy United States Marshals and Puerto Rico Special Response Team (\"S.R.T\") officers went to that apartment to arrest Rivera. The S.R.T. officers knocked on the apartment door and announced their presence. One of the officers saw a man, whom he recognized, look out of a window near the door.<sup>[1]</sup> When no one responded to their knocking, the S.R.T. officers knocked down the door and entered the apartment behind an officer carrying a bullet-proof shield.</p>\n<p>As the S.R.T. officers entered, they saw Rodriguez, wearing a leg brace but not using a crutch, walking toward them. They also saw Rivera looking out of the slightly-open bedroom door, holding a gun. The officers secured Rodriguez. Rivera closed and locked the bedroom door, but after an officer kicked the door twice, Rivera opened the door and came out without the gun. The officers secured Rivera.</p>\n<p>The S.R.T. officers and federal marshals entered the bedroom. A crutch was on the bed. They found heroin, cocaine, packaging for the drugs, and money. Clothing and cell phones were also found in the room. They discovered a loaded Taurus 9 mm pistol under a pillow on the bed and a loaded Glock .45 caliber pistol in a box under the bed. They found additional equipment for processing and packaging drugs in the kitchen. Rivera and Rodriguez were arrested.</p>\n<p>A grand jury indicted Rivera and Rodriguez on October 10, 2003, for crimes arising from the circumstances of their arrest in Cataño (Criminal Case No. 03-284). They were charged with possessing heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); with possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1) and (2); and with aiding and abetting each other in those crimes. Rivera and Rodriguez were each charged, separately, with being a felon in possession of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). In December of 2003, a grand jury returned a superseding indictment in Criminal Case No. 02-391, charging Rivera and Rodriguez with conspiring with ten other co-conspirators, including Rivera's brothers and mother, to possess with the intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana in violation of § 841(a)(1). The court granted the government's motion to consolidate the two cases.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*35</span> Rivera and Rodriguez moved to suppress the evidence found in the Cataño apartment, and a hearing was held on the motions on August 23, 2004. At the hearing, the court realized that an issue existed as to whether the defendants had standing to challenge the evidence. The court denied Rodriguez's motion, due to his lack of standing, and gave Rivera an opportunity to brief the issue. A further hearing on Rivera's motion to suppress was held on November 5, 10, and 12, 2004. The court denied Rivera's motion on December 23, 2004.</p>\n<p>Jury selection was held on April 27, 2005. On May 2, 2005, counsel gave their opening statements, and the government called its first witness. Evidence continued each day through Thursday, May 5. On May 6, Rodriguez filed a motion to sever his trial from Rivera's trial, arguing that if they were tried separately, Rivera would provide exculpatory testimony for Rodriguez, based on Rivera's testimony at the suppression hearing. The court held a hearing on Rodriguez's motion on Monday, May 9. The government objected to severance.</p>\n<p>Despite noting that the motion to sever was untimely, the court decided to sever the trial of Criminal Case. No. 02-391 from Criminal Case No. 03-284. Under the new schedule, both defendants would be tried on the charges in Criminal Case No. 02-391 first, and a separate trial for Criminal Case No. 03-284 would be held at a later time. Following the lunch break the same day, however, the court reconsidered the severance issue and denied the motion as untimely. Trial proceeded, as originally planned, on the charges against both defendants in both cases.</p>\n<p>After the conclusion of the government's case, both defendants moved for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. The motions were denied. On May 18, 2005, the jury returned its verdict finding Rivera and Rodriguez guilty on all charges.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Presentence reports were prepared and submitted. Rivera objected to the drug quantities and other parts of his presentence report. Rodriguez requested that new counsel be appointed to represent him for sentencing, and the court appointed new counsel on November 17, 2005.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez's sentencing hearing was held on May 17, 2006. The court found a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of II resulting in an advisory guideline range of 168 to 210 months. After reciting the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and discussing the extent of Rodriguez's drug transactions, the nature of his offenses and his role in them, his injuries, and his possession of weapons, as noted in the presentence report, the court concluded that a sentence at the high end of the range was appropriate. Rodriguez was sentenced to 210 months on Count One in Criminal Case No. 02-391; 210 months on Counts One, Two, and Three in Criminal Case No. 03-284; 60 months on Count Four; and 120 months on Count Seven of Criminal Case No. 03-284, all such terms to run concurrently. In addition, he was sentenced to 60 months on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, said sentence to be served consecutively to the other sentences imposed resulting in a total sentence of 270 months. Terms of supervised release were also imposed.</p>\n<p>Rivera's sentencing hearing began on March 17, 2006, and was continued to August <span class=\"star-pagination\">*36</span> 16, 2006. The court found a base offense level of 38 and applied a four-level increase based on Rivera's leadership role, which yielded an adjusted offense level of 42. The court found a criminal history category of VI based on his status as a career criminal. A criminal history category of VI, combined with a total offense level of 42, resulted in an advisory guideline range of 360 months to life.</p>\n<p>Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Count One of Criminal Case No. 02-391. In Criminal Case No. 03-284, Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Counts One and Three and to terms of 40 years on Count Two, 60 months on Count Four, and 120 months on Count Six, all such terms to run concurrently. In addition, he was sentenced to a term of 60 months for his conviction on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, which was to be served consecutively to his other sentences in Criminal Case No. 03-284. Terms of supervised release were also imposed.</p>\n<p>Rivera and Rodriguez filed timely notices of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Rodriguez challenges the district court's denial of his motions, the make-up of the jury, the sufficiency of the evidence, and his sentence. Rivera raises issues pertaining to his sentence. We consider the issues raised by the parties in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Rodriguez's Appeal</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rodriguez contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to sever his trial from Rivera's trial and in denying him a hearing on his motion to suppress evidence found at the apartment in Cataño, where he was arrested with Rivera. He also argues that the jury did not represent a fair cross-section of the community, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction, and that his sentence was unreasonable. The government responds that some of the issues Rodriguez raises were waived and that the issues lack merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Motion to Suppress</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Both Rodriguez and Rivera moved to suppress the evidence found at the Cataño apartment. At the beginning of the suppression hearing, Rodriguez's counsel sought additional evidence, including the address of a witness who had some involvement in the circumstances of the arrest, for the purpose of obtaining a subpoena. After a sidebar conference, the district court stated on the record:</p>\n<blockquote>I was under the misapprehension that the subpoena that was requested by [Rodriguez] concerned the person who had the possession or the custody or the use of the place where the defendants were arrested. It turns out that she is not the owner nor did she have that apartment under any type of rent or under her control. Also during this conference, it appeared that [Rodriguez] was there visiting and in those circumstances then he would have no standing to challenge any search that was done at that time and there[fore] his motion to suppress is hereby denied on the basis of standing to file the motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<p>Supp. Hr. T., 8/23/04, at 8-9. The court then ordered Rivera to brief the issue of whether he had standing to move to suppress the evidence. Another hearing on Rivera's suppression motion was held in November, and the motion was denied on December 23, 2004.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Rodriguez argues that he had standing to move to suppress the evidence found in the Cataño apartment, despite his status as a guest in the apartment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*37</span> and that the district court should have heard his motion. The government contends that Rodriguez waived the standing issue by not raising it in the district court.<sup>[3]</sup> Alternatively, the government argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez a hearing on his motion.</p>\n<p>Before a court may reach the merits of a motion to suppress, \"the defendant carries the burden of establishing that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the area searched or, as in this case, the items seized.\" <i>United States v. Lipscomb,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203508\"><a href=\"/opinion/203508/united-states-v-lipscomb/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 35-36 (1st Cir.2008), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></span>, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2009). Although the threshold requirement is referred to as standing, it is more properly considered under a Fourth Amendment analysis. <i>Id.</i> at 36. \"[F]ailure to present evidence with respect to such an expectation prevents a defendant from making a claim for suppression under the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>United States v.

On appeal, Rodriguez asserts, based on his status as a casual visitor for a brief period at Rivera's apartment, that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. He is mistaken. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198221\"><a href=\"/opinion/198221/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1998). The district court properly denied his motion, due to his lack of standing, without further consideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Motion to Sever</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On May 6, 2005, Rodriguez filed a motion to sever trial of the charges against him from Rivera's trial. He argued that Rivera's testimony at the suppression hearing in November of 2004, about the drugs, guns, and money found in the apartment in Cataño, was exculpatory evidence which he wanted to present in his defense. He further argued that Rivera would testify on his behalf if the charges against them were tried separately.</p>\n<p>The district court addressed the motion on the morning of May 9, 2005. Rodriguez's counsel explained the exculpatory nature of the testimony he expected from Rivera. The court asked whether Rivera would testify on Rodriguez's behalf, and Rivera's counsel said that he would testify only if the charges against him were severed from Rodriguez's trial and if Rivera were tried first. The government objected to the motion on the ground that it was untimely, because the trial had already progressed into the second week, and argued that the totality of Rivera's testimony was not exculpatory. After initially deciding to sever the two indictments, the district court denied Rodriguez's motion as untimely.</p>\n<p>A district court's decision to deny a motion to sever is reviewed for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203344\"><a href=\"/opinion/203344/united-states-v-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ____, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The government points out that the motion was denied as untimely and that Rodriguez failed to show good cause for the untimely filing. At oral argument before this court, Rodriguez's counsel represented that the motion to sever was timely, having been filed on the first day of trial following jury selection. In support of his position, counsel filed a letter, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j), in which counsel stated: \"Said motion was filed on May 6, 2005, after jury selection but before the start of jury trial, day one, on May 9, 2005.\"<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Counsel's representation is contrary to the record and to the statement of the case presented in Rodriguez's own brief.<sup>[5]</sup> Jury selection was held on April 27, 2005. The first day of evidence was May 2 and trial continued through May 5. Therefore, the motion to sever, filed on May 6, 2005, was untimely.</p>\n<p>In the district court, Rodriguez's counsel explained that the motion was filed on May 6 because he had only received the full transcript of the suppression hearing earlier that week. Counsel further stated that after reading the transcript, he realized that Rivera's testimony was exculpatory. The district court found, however, that because counsel attended the suppression hearing in November of 2004 and heard the testimony at that time, he did not need the transcript before filing the motion.</p>\n<p>Based on the circumstances presented here, the motion for severance was untimely, and Rodriguez failed to show good cause for an untimely filing. The district court correctly denied the motion. No abuse of discretion occurred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Jury Selection</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rodriguez argues, for the first time on appeal, that the requirement that jurors serving in the District of Puerto Rico be proficient in English violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury made up of a fair cross section of the community. Issues not raised before the district court are forfeited and subject to review only for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Rodriguez provides no basis to reconsider our previous holding in the circumstances of this case. No error occurred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> 4. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rodriguez contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to convict him of the conspiracy charged in Criminal Case No. 02-391 and the weapons charges in Criminal Case No. 03-284. We review the district court's denial of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal under the de novo standard. <i>United States v. Giambro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203507\"><a href=\"/opinion/203507/united-states-v-giambro/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2008). In doing so, however, we view \"the evidence in the light most flattering to the jury's guilty verdict [and] assess whether a reasonable factfinder could have concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Lipscomb,</i> 539 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p>With respect to the conspiracy conviction, Rodriguez argues that relatively little evidence was presented at trial that linked him to the Conejos drug operations in Ponce and that the evidence presented showed that he played only a minor role.<sup>[6]</sup> To prove that Rodriguez was part of a drug conspiracy, the government was required to prove \"that a conspiracy existed, that [Rodriguez] had knowledge of it, and that [Rodriguez] participated voluntarily in it.\" <i>United States v. Famania-Roche,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203433\"><a href=\"/opinion/203433/united-states-v-famania-roche/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir.2008). A \"conspiratorial agreement may be `express or tacit and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.'\" <i>Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d at 26 (quoting <i>United States v. Gomez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199484\"><a href=\"/opinion/199484/united-states-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir. 2001)). The underlying criminal activity of the conspiracy charged was a violation of § 841(a)(1), which involves manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing drugs, or possession with the intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense drugs.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez's co-defendant, Sigilfredo Rivera-Rubero, who became a government witness, testified that he first met Rodriguez during a drug transaction in 1996 or 1997 when he bought marijuana from Rodriguez. Rivera-Rubero testified that initially, in 1996 and 1997, Rodriguez sold him marijuana in the amount of thirty pounds every two weeks. Rivera-Rubero described the Conejos drug organization and identified its members, which included himself, Rivera, and others. He further testified that beginning in 1999, he had a business relationship with Rodriguez, selling drugs, and a social relationship with him. At that time, Rodriguez supplied cocaine, marijuana, and heroin to Rivera-Rubero, although Rivera-Rubero also had other suppliers. In addition, Rivera-Rubero testified that Rodriguez sold drugs to other members of the Conejos organization. Rodriguez's wife testified about Rodriguez's contacts with Rivera and that Rodriguez called Rivera \"Boss.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is not the role of the reviewing court to weigh the evidence; our role is merely to ensure that some evidence exists to support sufficiently the jury's determination.\" <i>United States v. Liranzo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201265\"><a href=\"/opinion/201265/united-states-v-liranzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The evidence is more than sufficient for a rational jury to find that Rodriguez was part of the Conejos drug trafficking conspiracy. Rodriguez's long drug-related relationships with Rivera-Rubero and Rivera, along with supplying drugs to other members of the Conejos organization, support a finding that he knowingly and voluntarily participated in the Conejos drug organization. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conspiracy conviction in Criminal Case No. 02-391.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> Rodriguez also argues that evidence is lacking to support his conviction on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, that he possessed a weapon in furtherance of a drug trafficking scheme in violation of § 924(c)(1), and aided and abetted Rivera in doing so, and on Count Seven, that he was a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of § 922(g)(1).<sup>[7]</sup> He argues that he was only a visitor at Rivera's apartment in Cataño where the guns were found. The government contends that the evidence proved that Rodriguez aided and abetted Rivera in possessing guns and also that Rodriguez was in constructive possession of the guns found in the apartment.</p>\n<p>Section 922(g)(1), charged in Count Five, requires that Rodriguez have had knowing possession of the guns.<sup>[8]</sup> \"Knowing possession under § 922(g)(1) can be established by proving that [Rodriguez] had constructive possession of [the guns]; that is, that he knowingly had the <i>power</i> and the <i>intention</i> at a given time of exercising dominion and control over a firearm, directly or through others.\" <i>DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>In Count Seven, Rodriguez was charged with violation of § 924(c)(1) by possessing, in furtherance of drug trafficking, and aiding and abetting Rivera in possessing the two guns found at the Cataño apartment when they were arrested.

Rivera closed and locked the bedroom door before the officers could enter. The officer in charge arranged his personnel around the closed and locked bedroom door and then kicked the door. Rivera did not respond immediately, but after several kicks, Rivera opened the door and was no longer holding the gun. The officers arrested Rivera and then entered the bedroom where they saw Rodriguez's crutch on the bed and found drugs, drug paraphernalia, money, and two loaded gunsone under a pillow and the other in a box under the bed. They also found clothes and cell phones.</p>\n<p>Based on that evidence, which is taken in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Rodriguez had been in the bedroom with Rivera and that Rivera was holding one of the loaded guns when the officers entered the apartment. Rodriguez, however, was only a temporary visitor at the apartment, where Rivera was living. He did not own the apartment or its contents, including the guns. The government does not contend that any of the clothes, cell phones, or other property found in the bedroom, other than the crutch, belonged to Rodriguez. The record includes no evidence that Rodriguez owned or actually possessed either gun.</p>\n<p>It is not necessary, however, for Rodriguez to have owned or physically possessed the guns to satisfy the possession requirements of § 922(g)(1) and § 924(c)(1) because possession may be constructive. While the evidence shows that Rodriguez was present in the bedroom with the guns and was near Rivera, who was seen holding a gun, evidence is lacking to link Rodriguez to the guns. In the absence of evidence that Rodriguez knowingly possessed the guns found in Rivera's bedroom, either actually or constructively, a reasonable jury could not have found him guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm as charged in Count Seven of Criminal Case No. 03-284. Therefore, Rodriguez's conviction and sentence on Count Seven are vacated.</p>\n<p>With respect to Count Five, Rodriguez was also charged with aiding and abetting Rivera to violate § 924(c)(1), possessing guns in furtherance of a drug crime. A defendant is guilty of aiding and abetting in a crime if the principal committed a crime, and \"the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended to help the principal.\" <i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202688\"><a href=\"/opinion/202688/united-states-v-garcia-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.2007). \"Again, mere association with the principal or presence at the scene of the crime is insufficient, even with knowledge that the crime is to be committed.\" <i>Id.</i> Instead, to be guilty as an aider and abettor in violation of § 924(c)(1), the accomplice must both know, to a practical certainty, that the principal would possess a gun in furtherance of the drug crime and must also facilitate that possession. <i>United States v. Medina-Roman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201115\"><a href=\"/opinion/201115/united-states-v-medina-roman/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-5 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Because Rivera was convicted of violating § 924(c)(1), which was not appealed, it is established that the principal committed the crime of possessing guns in furtherance of a drug crime. The evidence at trial supports an inference that Rodriguez knew Rivera was engaged in criminal activity related to drug trafficking; indeed, they had a long-standing relationship in the drug trafficking business.</p>\n<p>Evidence was introduced that Rodriguez knew that Rivera had guns at the Cataño apartment, which were involved in the drug business. Rodriguez was seen walking <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> from the area of the bedroom, where Rivera was looking out of the door and holding a gun. Rodriguez's crutch was found on the bed in the bedroom. Officers found the guns hidden in the bedroom, along with drugs, money, and drug paraphernalia. The proximity of the guns and the drugs indicates a link between them. Witnesses also testified that Rivera was always armed. That evidence, taken in the proper light, could support a jury's conclusion that Rodriguez knew, to a practical certainty, that Rivera had a gun or guns and would use a gun to protect and defend his drug business. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Spinney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 239 (1st Cir.1995) (finding insufficient evidence of knowledge to sustain aiding and abetting conviction under § 924(c)).</p>\n<p>The record offers no evidence, however, that Rodriguez facilitated Rivera in possessing or using the guns. For example, the record lacks evidence that Rodriguez bought or supplied the guns, arranged for their delivery, or assisted in any other respect in making the guns available for Rivera. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Luciano-Mosquera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196263\"><a href=\"/opinion/196263/united-states-v-luciano-mosquera/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></a></span>, 1150-52 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing evidence of knowledge and facilitation sufficient to sustain conviction of aiding and abetting violation of § 924(c)(1)).</p>\n<p>To sustain a conviction for aiding and abetting a violation of § 924(c)(1), the evidence must be sufficient to show both that the defendant knew, to a practical certainty, that the principal would possess a gun in furtherance of the drug crime and that the defendant facilitated that possession. <i>Medina-Roman,</i> 376 F.3d at 6. Because evidence of facilitation is lacking in this case, Rodriguez's conviction and sentence for violating § 924(c)(1), Count Five, are also vacated due to insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5. <i>Sentencing</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rodriguez challenges the drug quantities the district court used in determining his sentence and argues that his sentences were unreasonable. We review a sentencing court's factual findings, including drug quantity calculations, for clear error. <i>United States v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></span>, 40-41 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Morales-Machuca,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, Rodriguez's counsel argued that evidence was lacking to calculate an amount of drugs attributable to Rodriguez and that, based on testimony at the suppression hearing, the drugs found at the Cataño apartment belonged to Rivera and not Rodriguez. The district court ruled that for purposes of Rodriguez's sentencing, Rivera's suppression hearing testimony was irrelevant and would not be considered.<sup>[10]</sup> The court relied on the presentence report's drug quantity calculations.</p>\n<p>The court explained that based on Rivera-Rubero's trial testimony, Rodriguez supplied him with approximately thirty pounds of marijuana on a bi-weekly basis, between 1996 and 1998, for a total of 978 kilograms. After 1999, Rodriguez supplied Rivera-Rubero with heroin on many occasions, although Rivera-Rubero also had other heroin suppliers. The court calculated that Rodriguez supplied one kilogram per year of heroin from 1999 until January of 2002. When converted to the marijuana equivalent, that amount totaled 1000 kilograms of marijuana. The court found that the total amount of drugs found at the Cataño apartment equaled 1930.4 kilograms <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> of marijuana. Adding all of the amounts together, the court found that Rodriguez's drug activities involved 5,908.8 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p>Rodriguez contends that the drugs found at the Cataño apartment are not attributable to him and argues that those drugs should not have been considered in determining his sentence. Because he was convicted of drug trafficking crimes based on the drugs found at the Cataño apartment, however, his argument is without merit. Rodriguez does not otherwise contest the court's calculations of the drug quantities, and the record supports the court's quantity findings.</p>\n<p>Under the Guidelines, a crime involving at least 3,000 kilograms but less than 10,000 kilograms of marijuana yields a base offense level of 34. Because there were no other adjustments, the total offense level was also 34. Based on a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of II, the advisory guideline sentencing range was 168 to 210 months. After considering the factors set forth in § 3553(a), which were addressed in the presentence report, the court decided that a sentence at the top of the range was appropriate for Rodriguez. The district court noted that Rodriguez had physical impairments due to his injuries from a serious accident, but found that despite his impairments, Rodriguez continued to be involved in criminal activity.</p>\n<p>The district court followed the sentencing protocol that we have prescribed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203365\"><a href=\"/opinion/203365/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.2008). \"If the court has calculated the GSR correctly and has supplied a plausible explanation for the sentence imposed, we generally defer to the district court's judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> That is the case here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Rivera's Appeal</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Based on the presentence report calculations and evidence heard at the sentencing hearing, the district court found that Rivera's drug offenses involved more than 30 kilograms of heroin, which converted to 30,000 kilograms of marijuana. As a result, the applicable base offense level was determined to be 38. A four-level enhancement was added because of Rivera's leadership role in the offenses, resulting in a total offense level of 42. The court also found a criminal history category of VI.</p>\n<p>Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Count One of Criminal Case No. 02-391. In Criminal Case No. 03-284, Rivera was sentenced to life in prison on Counts One and Three and to terms of 40 years on Count Two, 60 months on Count Four, and 120 months on Count Six, all such terms to run concurrently. In addition, he was sentenced to a term of 60 months for his conviction on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284, which was to be served consecutively to his other sentences in Criminal Case No. 03-284. Rivera argues that his sentences were not reasonable, that the drug quantity determination was erroneous, and that the court erred in imposing a four-point adjustment based on his role in the drug operations. We begin by considering Rivera's claims of procedural irregularity before addressing the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Drug Quantity</i>\n</h2>\n<p>At the sentencing hearing, the district court explained that a government witness, Rivera-Rubero, testified at trial that he supplied Rivera, for his drug point in Ponce, with two or three eighths of a kilogram of heroin weekly for the time after Rivera left prison in September of 1999 until Rivera-Rubero went to jail in January of 2002. The district court determined that period included 29 months or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> 116 weeks. Taking the lesser amount, two eighths of a kilogram of heroin per week, the district court calculated that Rivera's drug transactions as part of the Conejos conspiracy involved 29 kilograms of heroin. The court added the 1.260 kilograms of heroin found in the Cataño apartment, which brought the total over 30 kilograms of heroin. Based on Sentencing Guideline § 2D1.1(a)(3), which refers to the Drug Quantity Table at subsection (c), 30 kilograms or more of heroin results in a base offense level of 38.</p>\n<p>Rivera argued at the sentencing hearing and argues on appeal that Rivera-Rubero did not supply heroin to him as regularly as the court found because Rivera had other suppliers. As the district court stated at the sentencing hearing, Rivera-Rubero's testimony established that Rivera was buying two to three eighths of a kilogram of heroin every week during the period between the end of September of 1999 to January of 2002, although his suppliers were not always the same. Therefore, Rivera's argument that Rivera-Rubero, himself, did not always supply heroin to Rivera does not change the drug quantity calculation.</p>\n<p>The district court's factual findings as to drug quantity are reviewed for clear error. <i>Sanchez-Badillo,</i> 540 F.3d at 34. The district court did not add drug quantities pertaining to the time Rivera was in prison, as Rivera mistakenly asserts. Instead, the court explicitly considered only the period of the conspiracy from the end of September of 1999 until January of 2002. Further, the drug quantity was calculated using the lesser amount indicated by the testimony and without considering the other drugs Rivera sold or possessed. The district court's drug quantity calculation was conservative and well-supported by the evidence at trial. Therefore the drug quantity finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Leadership Role</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Under Sentencing Guidelines § 3B1.1(a), a defendant's base offense level is raised by four levels if he \"was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\" \"The Guidelines provide a nonexclusive list of factors to guide the determination of whether a defendant held a leadership or organizational role.\" <i>United States v. Ziskind,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202806\"><a href=\"/opinion/202806/united-states-v-ziskind/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span> (2008). We review a district court's decision to impose an enhancement for clear error. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Rivera argues that he was not the main organizer or leader of the Conejos conspiracy, particularly because he was in prison from 1995 to 1999. Instead, he contends, his brother, Richard, was in charge of their drug points. Rivera also contends that he did not have five or more subordinates whom he directed or supervised.</p>\n<p>In determining a defendant's role in the criminal activity, the court considers, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote>the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p>U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1, cmt. 4; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Yelaun,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span>, 421 (1st Cir.2008). Witnesses testified that Rivera and his brother, Piolo, owned and operated a drug point selling cocaine and heroin in the Conejos organization after Rivera was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> released from prison in 1999.<sup>[11]</sup> As the district court found, testimony at trial established that more than five co-conspirators were involved with Rivera at the Conejos drug point. The witnesses' testimony established that Rivera made the decisions as to which drug suppliers he would use for the drug point. Evidence shows that Rivera ran the drug point and sold drugs from it.</p>\n<p>Even if Rivera were subordinate to Richard in the hierarchy of the conspiracy, that would not negate Rivera's leadership role. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Arango,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203021\"><a href=\"/opinion/203021/united-states-v-arango/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The evidence supports the district court's finding that Rivera had a leadership role in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Reasonableness</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rivera contends that the presentence report and the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as if they were mandatory and ignored the factors provided by § 3553(a), resulting in an unreasonable sentence. In particular, Rivera argues that his life sentence was greater than necessary, that the court failed to consider his particular characteristics and history, and that the four-level enhancement he received for his role in the conspiracy is unreasonable because other co-conspirators, including his brother Richard, received only a three-level enhancement.</p>\n<p>We review a sentence for procedural error, including the district court's application of § 3553(a), and then consider a challenge to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, both of which are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <i>Rodriguez,</i> 527 F.3d at 224. \"In considering objections to a sentence's substantive reasonableness, we examine the district court's contemporaneous oral explanation of the sentence, its near-contemporaneous written statement of reasons, and what fairly can be gleaned by comparing what was argued by the parties or proffered in the PSI Report with what the sentencing court ultimately did.\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203196\"><a href=\"/opinion/203196/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Section 3553(a)(6) directs a sentencing court to consider \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\" A consideration of sentencing disparities under that section, however, \"aims primarily at the minimization of disparities among defendants nationally.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 94. In addition, as the district court noted, Richard and the other co-conspirators pled guilty, pursuant to plea agreements that addressed their roles under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1. Given the material difference between the defendants who pled guilty pursuant to plea agreements and Rivera who did not, no disparity in sentencing occurred in this case that would amount to an abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427539\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427539/united-states-v-brandao/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Rivera's counsel argued at the sentencing hearing that because of Rivera's young age and a corrupt system that encouraged illegal drug activity in Ponce, the court should not sentence Rivera to life in prison. Counsel also argued that Rivera <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> was a fugitive before he was arrested in September of 2003 based on the advice of his former counsel. Counsel acknowledged that Rivera's \"life had been one of crime for many years\" and that he had \"been in jail most of his adult life,\" but she blamed corruption in the system for making him a criminal and perpetuating his life of crime.</p>\n<p>After explaining the total offense level, the criminal history category, and the applicable guideline range of 360 months to life in prison, the district court stated that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. The court recited the sentencing considerations provided by § 3553(a). With reference to the presentence report, which had been addressed extensively during the sentencing hearing, the court discussed Rivera's activities in light of the § 3553(a) considerations. The court found that although Rivera was young, he had an extensive history of recidivism, involving both violent crimes and drug crimes. As a result, the court concluded that a life sentence, the high end of the advisory guideline range, was appropriate.</p>\n<p>The record shows that the district court considered the § 3553(a) factors and imposed a reasonable sentence after considering Rivera's particular circumstances. The court did not abuse is discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, Rivera's sentence is affirmed. Rodriguez's convictions and sentences are affirmed as to Criminal Case No. 02-391 and Counts One, Two, Three, and Four of Criminal Case No. 03-284. Rodriguez's convictions and sentences on Counts Five and Seven in Criminal Case No. 03-284, however, are vacated. The case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, and Vacated and Remanded in part.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The S.R.T. officer recognized the man from an event the week before when S.R.T. officers and marshals went to an apartment complex in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, where they believed Rivera was staying.

That man was later determined to be Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>[2]  The judgment entered for Rodriguez on May 26, 2006, docketed in Criminal Case No. 02-391 at docket no. 498, indicates that Rodriguez pled guilty in that case.

Flores-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196112\"><a href=\"/opinion/196112/united-states-v-flores-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 325 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing potential prejudicial effect of evidence in a joint trial of co-conspirators).</p>\n<p>[7]  The weapons charged in those counts were the guns found at the Cataño apartment: \"a Glock semi automatic pistol, 45 caliber serial number BZC308, and a Taurus semi-automatic pistol, model PT92, 9mm. caliber, serial number TLD4401-8D.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  Rodriguez does not contest his status as a felon or the interstate commerce requirement of § 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p>[9]  To the extent that Rodriguez argues that the government failed to prove that he <i>used</i> a firearm, he misstates the crime with which he was charged.</p>\n<p>[10]  Rodriguez does not dispute that ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p>[11]  Although Rivera's brother, Richard, testified that he owned the drug point and that Rivera was not involved in the drug business, the jury believed other witnesses about Rivera's involvement in criminal activity.</p>\n<p>[12]  We note that the judgment entered as to Rodriguez in Criminal Case No. 02-391 suggested that the sentence entered in that case was to be served consecutively to the sentence entered on Count Five in Criminal Case No. 03-284. Entry of amended judgments will correct that potentially ambiguous statement.</p>\n\n</div>",
