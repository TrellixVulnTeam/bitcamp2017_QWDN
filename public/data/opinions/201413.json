Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n          Torruella, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Robert J. Roughsedge, with whom Michael Williams, Chester\nDarling, and CPCR: Citizens for the Preservation of Constitutional\nRights, Inc. were on brief, for appellants.\n     Frances S. Cohen, with whom Erica L. Hovani and Dechert LLP\nwere on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        January 18, 2005\n\f           LIPEZ,   Circuit      Judge.     Plaintiffs,    a    non-profit\n\norganization1 and ten white children living in Boston, challenged\n\nthe City's former and current school assignment systems in a case\n\nthat the district court noted \"may possibly be the concluding\n\nchapter   in   thirty    years   of   litigation   over   the   effort   to\n\ndesegregate the Boston public schools.\" Boston's Children First v.\n\nBoston Sch. Comm., 260 F. Supp. 2d 318, 319 (D. Mass. 2003).             In\n\nrulings that we recently affirmed, the district court rejected the\n\nmajority of the plaintiffs' claims but awarded nominal damages to\n\ntwo children who were denied seats at their preferred schools\n\nbecause of their race.     See Anderson v. City of Boston, 375 F.3d 71\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).        Plaintiffs2 then sought attorney's fees as a\n\n\"prevailing party\" under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.           The district court\n\ndenied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs' de minimis success\n\non the nominal damages claim did not entitle them to a fee award.\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The non-profit organization, Boston's Children First (\"BCF\"),\nwas a party to the original suit but the court subsequently\nconcluded that it lacked organizational standing.          Boston's\nChildren First v. Boston Sch. Comm., 183 F. Supp. 2d 382, 402 (D.\nMass. 2002).\n     2\n      We recognize that the reference to \"plaintiffs\" in this\ndecision could be a source of confusion.         When we refer to\n\"plaintiffs\" in describing the background of this case, we are\nreferring to all the plaintiffs who initiated the underlying suit.\nHowever, when we discuss the plaintiffs who were prevailing parties\nin this litigation, we refer only to the two plaintiffs who were\nawarded nominal damages.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                    I.\n\n            Plaintiffs initiated the underlying suit on June 21,\n\n1999, challenging the Boston Public Schools (\"BPS\") Controlled\n\nChoice Student Assignment Plan (\"Old Plan\") on the grounds that it\n\nimproperly considered students' race when assigning them to schools\n\nin   an   effort   to   achieve   \"ideal   racial    percentages.\"3     The\n\nplaintiffs sought a declaration that the Old Plan violated their\n\nfederal and state equal protection rights, as well as injunctive\n\nrelief and damages.\n\n            On July 14, 1999, the Boston School Committee voluntarily\n\namended the Old Plan to eliminate race as a factor in the school\n\nadmissions process (\"New Plan\").           The plaintiffs responded by\n\nadding a plethora of claims to their suit.          They ultimately sought\n\n(1) a declaratory judgment that both Plans violated the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment's Equal Protection Clause, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983,4\n\n\n\n      3\n      As noted, the litigation for which plaintiffs now seek\nattorney's fees is part of a long saga involving the desegregation\nof Boston's public school system. See, e.g., Wessmann v. Gittens,\n160 F.3d 790 (1st Cir. 1998). For a more complete history of the\nsuit brought by the plaintiff children and BCF, see Boston's\nChildren First v. City of Boston, 62 F. Supp. 2d 247 (D. Mass.\n1999) (\"BCF I\"); Boston's Children First v. City of Boston, 98 F.\nSupp. 2d 111 (D. Mass. 2000) (\"BCF II\"); Boston's Children First v.\nBoston Sch. Comm., 183 F. Supp. 2d 382 (D. Mass. 2002) (\"BCF III\");\nBoston's Children First v. Boston Sch. Comm., 260 F. Supp. 2d 318\n(D. Mass. 2003) (\"BCF IV\"); Boston's Children First v. Boston Sch.\nComm., No. 99-11330-RGS (D. Mass. May 27, 2003) (unpublished) (\"BCF\nV\"); Anderson v. City of Boston, 375 F.3d 71 (1st Cir. 2004).\n      4\n      42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 prohibit                deprivations   of\nconstitutional rights under color of state law.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,5 and Article 111 of the\n\nMassachusetts Declaration of Rights;6 (2) a permanent injunction\n\nordering BPS to admit plaintiffs to the schools of their choice,\n\nprohibiting BPS from considering race in school assignments and\n\ngovernance, ordering BPS to redraw attendance zones, and granting\n\nBCF access to school records to monitor BPS's compliance with these\n\norders; and (3) nominal and compensatory damages for plaintiffs who\n\nwere not admitted to their preferred schools under the Old Plan.\n\n          In February 2002, the district court ruled that it would\n\nconsider the plaintiffs' damages claim separately from their claims\n\nfor prospective relief.    The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment on the damages claim on November 1, 2002, seeking nominal\n\ndamages for all ten student-plaintiffs. That motion noted that the\n\ndefendants   had   admitted     earlier   in   the    litigation   that   two\n\nstudents, John Feeney, Jr. and Kathleen McCoy, were denied seats\n\nbased on their race under the Old Plan.7          It also emphasized that\n\nthe   defendants   had    not    conceded      that   the   Old    Plan   was\n\n\n\n      5\n      Title VI prohibits institutions receiving federal funds from\nengaging in racial discrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.\n      6\n      Article 111 states that \"[n]o student shall be assigned to or\ndenied admittance to a public school on the basis of race, color,\nnational origin or creed.\"\n      7\n      The defendants initially conceded in November 2000 that three\nstudents' placements were affected by race. In August 2001, they\nretracted the admission regarding one student, Kayleigh Barry-\nMeltzer, explaining that it had been based on a mistaken assumption\nregarding the seating capacity at her preferred school.\n\n                                    -4-\n\funconstitutional.     The parties then entered into unsuccessful\n\nsettlement     discussions,   with   the   defendants   expressing   a\n\nwillingness to pay \"nominal damages\" to Feeney and McCoy but an\n\nunwillingness to address the plaintiffs' additional request that\n\nthey admit the Old Plan had been unconstitutional.          The court\n\nultimately granted the defendants an extension for responding to\n\nthe summary judgment motion, allowing them to file their opposition\n\nafter a bench trial on the plaintiffs' claims for prospective\n\nrelief.\n\n             Over the course of four rulings between 1999 and 2003,\n\nthe district court rejected all of the plaintiffs' claims for\n\nprospective relief.     BCF I, 62 F. Supp. 2d at 262; BCF II, 98 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 117; BCF III, 183 F. Supp. 2d at 395-401; BCF IV, 260\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 334.     In the last of these rulings, following the\n\nbench trial, the court upheld the New Plan against the plaintiffs'\n\nequal protection challenge and declined to retain jurisdiction to\n\nensure that BPS did not return to using race in its seat assignment\n\npolicy.   BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 330-34.   The court concluded by\n\nnoting that\n\n     [P]laintiffs should not underestimate what they have\n     accomplished.    By bringing this lawsuit, they have\n     persuaded   the    School   Committee   to   abandon    a\n     constitutionally dubious school admissions policy.\n     Plaintiffs have not obtained all of the relief they\n     sought, principally because the court believes that their\n     ultimate goal, mandatory neighborhood school assignments\n     . . . is not constitutionally compelled.\n\nId. at 334.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          With the plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief thus\n\nresolved, the parties returned to the issue of nominal damages. In\n\ntheir May 21, 2003 response to the plaintiffs' motion for summary\n\njudgment, the defendants again conceded that Feeney and McCoy had\n\nbeen denied seats based on their race and indicated that they were\n\n\"willing to have this Court enter judgment awarding nominal damages\n\nto these plaintiffs.\"   However, asserting that no damages may be\n\nawarded absent the deprivation of a constitutional right, the\n\ndefendants opposed a nominal damages award for the eight plaintiffs\n\nwho had not shown that they were deprived of a seat based on their\n\nrace.   The defendants also urged the court not to address the\n\nconstitutionality of the Old Plan.\n\n          The court's May 27, 2003 ruling on the motion for summary\n\njudgment awarded nominal damages to Feeney and McCoy on the grounds\n\nthat they \"were denied seat assignments at their preferred schools\n\nbecause of their race\" but without expressly stating whether the\n\nOld Plan was unconstitutional.       BCF V, at 1.   Stressing that\n\nnominal damages may not be awarded \"absent the deprivation of a\n\nconstitutional right,\" the court denied damages to the remaining\n\nplaintiffs, who could \"make no showing of a deprivation under Texas\n\nv. Lesage, 528 U.S. 18, 21 (1999) (per curiam).\"     BCF V, at 1.\n\nAlthough the plaintiffs who were denied damages appealed that\n\ndenial, the defendants did not cross-appeal from the nominal\n\ndamages award.\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f          The plaintiffs then moved for attorney's fees under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1988(b), which provides that in a federal civil rights\n\nsuit, \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party\n\n. . . a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\"             The\n\ndistrict court acknowledged that \"a plaintiff who wins an award of\n\nnominal   damages   is   properly     deemed   a   'prevailing   party.'\"\n\nNevertheless, it denied any attorney's fees, concluding that:\n\n     While \"hollow\" may be too harsh a word, a one dollar\n     nominal award to two of ten original plaintiffs, the\n     entitlement to which was conceded by the defendants from\n     the virtual outset in an otherwise unsuccessful lawsuit,\n     will simply not bear the weight of the policy that\n     Congress intended to promote by enacting section 1988.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                    II.\n\n          Because a trial judge familiar with the intricacies of a\n\ncase is in the best position to evaluate a motion for attorney's\n\nfees, we review the denial of such a motion for manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Díaz-Rivera v. Rivera-Rodríguez, 377 F.3d 119, 124\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).    Accordingly, we \"confine our review to whether\n\nthe district court has made a mistake of law or incorrectly weighed\n\n(or failed to weigh) a factor in its decision.\"           Richardson v.\n\nMiller, 279 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2002); see also Gay Officers Action\n\nLeague v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288, 292-93 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Apart\n\nfrom mistakes of law . . . we will set aside a fee award only if it\n\nclearly appears that the trial court ignored a factor deserving\n\nsignificant weight, relied upon an improper factor, or evaluated\n\n                                    -7-\n\fall the proper factors (and no improper ones), but made a serious\n\nmistake in weighing them.\").\n\nA.        Fee-shifting pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988\n\n          \"In    the   United   States,   the   prevailing    litigant   is\n\nordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys' fee from\n\nthe loser.\"     Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421\n\nU.S. 240, 247 (1975). Congress, however, has created exceptions to\n\nthis \"American Rule,\" permitting fee-shifting in some contexts to\n\nencourage meritorious litigation that benefits the plaintiff and\n\nthe public interest.     See Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 96\n\n(1989).   42 U.S.C. § 1988 is one such exception.            As previously\n\nnoted, § 1988(b) provides that in federal civil rights actions,\n\nincluding those brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \"the court, in its\n\ndiscretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United\n\nStates, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\"\n\n          Section 1988 requires a two-part inquiry: (1) whether the\n\nplaintiff is a prevailing party, and (2) if the plaintiff is a\n\nprevailing party, what constitutes a reasonable fee award.            See,\n\ne.g., Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 114 (1992).       The first inquiry\n\nhas   substantial      implications      because,   despite     §   1988's\n\ndiscretionary language, we have interpreted the statute to mean\n\nthat \"'awards in favor of prevailing civil rights plaintiffs are\n\nvirtually obligatory.'\"    Díaz-Rivera, 377 F.3d at 124 (quoting Gay\n\nOfficers Action League, 247 F.3d at 293); see also Casa Marie Hogar\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fGeriatrico, Inc. v. Rivera-Santos, 38 F.3d 615, 618 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(\"prevailing plaintiff is presumptively entitled to fee-shifting\"\n\nin a civil rights case).     Still, a court may properly deny a\n\nprevailing party's motion for attorney's fees if circumstances of\n\nthe case would make a fee award unjust.    Farrar, 506 U.S. at 118\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring); Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429\n\n(1983).\n\nB.        Prevailing party status\n\n          To prevail, a party must \"'succeed on any significant\n\nissue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit [it] sought\n\nin bringing suit.'\"   Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433 (quoting Nadeau v.\n\nHelgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir. 1978)).       A voluntary\n\nchange in conduct due to the filing of the suit itself is not\n\nsufficient to confer prevailing party status.     Buckhannon Bd. &\n\nCare Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S.\n\n598, 600-10 (2001) (rejecting the \"catalyst theory\" as a basis for\n\nprevailing party status); New Eng. Reg'l Council of Carpenters v.\n\nKinton, 284 F.3d 9, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2002).     Rather, the benefit\n\nachieved must be a \"judicially sanctioned change in the legal\n\nrelationship between the parties.\"   Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 605.\n\n          The district court correctly concluded that prevailing\n\nparty status cannot be based on the School Committee's decision to\n\namend the Old Plan, and plaintiffs do not argue to the contrary.\n\nAlthough eliminating race in the seat assignment plan was one of\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fthe plaintiffs' central goals in bringing the suit, a fee award\n\nbased on the School Committee's voluntary actions would rest on the\n\n\"catalyst theory\" that the Supreme Court explicitly rejected in\n\nBuckhannon.       See 532 U.S. at 610.         The plaintiffs claim instead\n\nthat the nominal damages award makes them a prevailing party.                    We\n\nagree.\n\n            The Supreme Court has held that \"a plaintiff who wins\n\nnominal damages is a prevailing party under § 1988.\"                 Farrar, 506\n\nU.S. at 112.       This holding recognizes that nominal damages are a\n\n\"material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties\"\n\nbecause    \"[a]    judgment    for     damages      in   any    amount,    whether\n\ncompensatory or nominal, modifies the defendant's behavior for the\n\nplaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to pay an amount of\n\nmoney he otherwise would not pay.\"            Id. at 113.      Here, the district\n\ncourt    ordered    the   defendants    to    pay   nominal      damages   to   two\n\nplaintiffs, Feeney and McCoy.           As Farrar recognized, that order\n\n\"materially alter[ed] the legal relationship between the parties,\"\n\nand thus conferred prevailing party status on the plaintiffs.                   Id.\n\nat 112.\n\n            In support of their argument that our case law dictates\n\na contrary result on the prevailing party issue, the defendants\n\ncite Maine School Administrative District No. 35 v. Mr. R., 321\n\nF.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2003).         There, we explained that \"the change\n\neffected [by the plaintiff's success] must be material; a purely\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\ftechnical or de minimis victory cannot confer prevailing party\n\nstatus.\"     Id. at 15; see also Farrar, 506 U.S. at 111-12 (\"[A]\n\nplaintiff 'prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his claim\n\nmaterially alters the legal relationship between the parties by\n\nmodifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits\n\nthe plaintiff.\").          It is true that many of our cases, including\n\nMaine     School    Administrative     District   No.     35,   consider    the\n\n\"technical\" or \"de minimis\" nature of a victory as part of the\n\nprevailing     party    inquiry,     rather   than   in    determining     what\n\nconstitutes a reasonable award.          231 F.3d at 15.        However, the\n\nSupreme Court's holding in Farrar precludes any argument that an\n\naward of nominal damages is \"a purely technical or de minimis\n\nvictory\" that bars prevailing party status.             Id.\n\n            In Farrar, the Court specifically considered \"whether a\n\nnominal damages award is the sort of 'technical,' 'insignificant'\n\nvictory that cannot confer prevailing party status.\"                 506 U.S. at\n\n113-14.     As we have already discussed, the Court answered this\n\nquestion in the negative, concluding that nominal damages effect a\n\nmaterial change and therefore confer prevailing party status.                The\n\n\"'technical' nature of a nominal damages award\" bears instead on\n\nthe reasonableness of the fees awarded rather than on prevailing\n\nparty     status,    and    the   district    court's     analysis     proceeded\n\naccordingly.       Id. at 114.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fC.         Reasonable attorney's fee\n\n           The    plaintiffs          emphasize       that   we       are    \"virtually\n\nobligat[ed]\" to grant a fee award to a prevailing party.                             Gay\n\nOfficers Action League, 247 F.3d at 293. However, as Farrar itself\n\nacknowledges,     \"[i]n     some      circumstances,     even     a    plaintiff     who\n\nformally 'prevails' under § 1988 should receive no attorney's fees\n\nat all.\"   506 U.S. at 115.\n\n           Farrar    was     a    §    1983   civil    rights     suit      in   which   a\n\nplaintiff sought $17 million in damages against six defendants who\n\nhad allegedly conspired to violate his due process rights.                        A jury\n\nfound that one of the defendants had \"committed an act or acts\n\nunder color of state law that deprived [Farrar] of a civil right,\"\n\nbut that this conduct was not a proximate cause of his damages.\n\n506 U.S. at 106.     The district court awarded Farrar $1 in nominal\n\ndamages and      $280,000    in       attorney's   fees.        The    Fifth     Circuit\n\nreversed the fee award, finding that Farrar's victory was too\n\ninsignificant to confer prevailing party status under § 1988.\n\n           The Supreme Court disagreed with the Fifth Circuit's\n\nreasoning but affirmed the fee award reversal. It held that Farrar\n\nwas not entitled to fees, despite the fact that the nominal damages\n\naward conferred prevailing party status.                The Court explained that\n\n\"the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a\n\nfee award is the degree of success obtained.\"                Id. at 114 (citation\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).                  Where Farrar sought $17\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fmillion in compensatory damages but received only $1 in nominal\n\ndamages, he obtained such a small degree of success as to make \"the\n\nonly reasonable fee . . . no fee at all.\"                Id. at 115.\n\n              Justice      O'Connor    wrote      separately   to    explain    the\n\nrelationship between nominal damages and a fee award.                          While\n\n\"[n]ominal      relief      does     not    necessarily    a   nominal      victory\n\nmake[,] .      .   .   a   substantial      difference    between    the    judgment\n\nrecovered and the recovery sought suggests that the victory is in\n\nfact purely technical.\"              Id. at 121.        Other relevant factors\n\ninclude \"the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff\n\nclaims to have prevailed\" and whether the success furthered a\n\npublic purpose.         Id. at 121-22; see also O'Connor v. Huard, 117\n\nF.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1997) (recognizing similar considerations).\n\nWhere   the    district      court    has    properly    weighed    the    foregoing\n\nfactors, there is no abuse of discretion to merit a reversal.                    See\n\nid.\n\n              Here, the court explained its denial of fees in an eight-\n\npage ruling that reviewed the course of the litigation and set\n\nforth the relevant law.              It concluded that the nominal damages\n\naward, \"the entitlement to which was conceded by the defendants\n\nfrom the virtual outset,\" was too de minimis a victory in relation\n\nto the plaintiffs' other claims to merit a fee award.                  See Farrar,\n\n506 U.S. at 114; Me. Admin. Sch. Dist. No. 35, 321 F.3d at 14-15\n\n(fee award cannot be based on a \"hollow victory\").                  The plaintiffs\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fclaim that this ruling was an abuse of discretion because it failed\n\nto recognize the significance of the nominal damages award --\n\nnamely, that the award included an implicit finding that the Old\n\nPlan was unconstitutional and would thus have a preclusive effect\n\nif the defendants attempted to revive the Plan.                The defendants\n\ncontend that the award did not include such a finding.\n\n          We   acknowledge    that     the   language     of    the   decision\n\nexplaining   the   nominal   damages    award    is   susceptible     to   both\n\nparties' readings.    The court said the following:\n\n     John Feeney[, Jr.] and Kathleen McCoy were denied seat\n     assignments at their preferred schools because of their\n     race. For that reason they are entitled to an award of\n     nominal damages, and defendants do not contend otherwise.\n     Defendants are correct, however, that absent the\n     deprivation of a constitutional right, nominal damages\n     may not be awarded. See Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247,\n     266-67 (1978). As the remaining plaintiffs can make no\n     showing of a deprivation under Texas v. Lesage, 528 U.S.\n     18, 21 (1999) (per curiam), no damages, nominal or\n     otherwise, may be awarded.\n\n\nBCF V, at 1.       Although the nominal damages judgment does not\n\nspecify that the Old Plan was unconstitutional, the plaintiffs\n\nassert that such a finding was necessarily implicit in light of the\n\ncourt's own statement that nominal damages must be premised on a\n\nconstitutional injury. Losing a seat assignment because of race is\n\nnot, per se, a constitutional deprivation. Race-conscious policies\n\nare permissible if they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\n\ngovernmental   interest,      which    may      include    remedying       past\n\ndiscrimination, City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469,\n\n                                  -14-\n\f507 (1989) (considering whether Richmond's race-conscious plan for\n\ncity construction contracts was \"narrowly tailored to remedy prior\n\ndiscrimination\"), or achieving educational diversity, Grutter v.\n\nBollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 343 (2003) (\"[T]he Equal Protection Clause\n\ndoes   not    prohibit   the     [University    of    Michigan]   Law   School's\n\nnarrowly tailored use of race in admissions to further a compelling\n\ninterest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a\n\ndiverse      student   body.\").      Thus,     the   plaintiffs   reason,    the\n\ndefendants' concession about the role of race in the plaintiffs'\n\nseat assignments does not, standing alone, admit the constitutional\n\nviolation required to support an award of nominal damages.                   The\n\ndeprivation was unconstitutional only if the assignment plan was\n\nnot narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest, or, in other\n\nwords, if the Old Plan was unconstitutional.\n\n               Yet, the nominal damages decision does not address the\n\nissues of compelling interest and narrow tailoring that would be\n\nintegral      to   a     fully     developed     legal     analysis     of   the\n\nconstitutionality of the Old Plan.             Nor did the court explicitly\n\nstate that Feeney and McCoy had suffered a constitutional injury.\n\nIts comment that nominal damages require such an injury was not an\n\nexplanation for Feeney and McCoy's award, but rather for the denial\n\nof damages to the remaining plaintiffs.              See BCF V, at 1.    Indeed,\n\nthe only basis that the court cited for Feeney and McCoy's award\n\nwas their loss of seats because of their race -- the point conceded\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fby the defendants.         This language suggests that the award did not\n\ninclude a finding that the Old Plan was unconstitutional.\n\n              We recognized this ambiguity in the nominal damages\n\ndecision when we considered the merits of this case on appeal,\n\nnoting   that    \"[a]lthough     the   district   court   never   explicitly\n\ndescribed the Old Plan as unconstitutional, . . . nominal damages\n\nin this context require a constitutional violation.\" Anderson, 375\n\nF.3d at 80 n.12.       Based on this logic, we accepted \"the colorable\n\npremise that the Old Plan was unconstitutional\" for the purposes of\n\nour analysis.8       Id.    However, the court's ruling, if any, on the\n\nconstitutionality of the Old Plan was not directly before us in\n\nthat appeal.        Now that we must decide in the context of this\n\nattorney's fees appeal whether the court, in fact, ruled on the\n\nconstitutionality of the Old Plan, we conclude that there was no\n\nsuch ruling.        Instead, the court awarded nominal damages on the\n\nbasis    of   the   defendants'    concession,    which   acknowledged   the\n\ndispositive effect of race in the school assignments of Feeney and\n\nMcCoy, but which rejected any conclusion that the Old Plan was\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n\n\n     8\n      In the appeal on the merits, the plaintiffs argued that the\nunconstitutionality of the Old Plan required a presumption that the\nNew Plan was also motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose.\nWe declined to adopt such a presumption, noting that even if the\nOld Plan had been unconstitutional, \"BPS voluntarily discontinued\nthe use of the Old Plan once it concluded that the Plan was\nconstitutionally suspect . . . and replaced it with a racially\nneutral assignment system . . . .\" Anderson, 375 F.3d at 84-85.\n\n                                       -16-\n\f           This      conclusion     is     compelled        by      the       following\n\nconsiderations:\n\n           (1)    The    constitutionality       of   the     Old      Plan    was    not\n\nactively litigated; the court refused to consider injunctive or\n\ndeclaratory relief regarding the Old Plan once the New Plan was in\n\nplace.     Indeed,      the   court's    description     of      the    Old    Plan    as\n\n\"constitutionally dubious\" in a ruling denying prospective relief\n\none month before the nominal damages award, BCF IV, 260 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 334, signals that it did not consider the constitutionality of\n\nthe Old Plan a resolved question.\n\n           (2) The defendants' motion opposing summary judgment,\n\nfiled    soon    after    the   decision       denying   prospective            relief,\n\nrecognized that a finding on the constitutionality of the Old Plan\n\nwould require the court to try issues that it had not previously\n\nconsidered and therefore urged the court to award damages without\n\nreaching the constitutional issue.               In essence, the defendants\n\nexpressed a willingness to pay nominal damages to Feeney and McCOy\n\nwithout admitting any constitutional injury. As we have discussed,\n\nthe language of the ensuing award is consistent with this position.\n\n           (3) Any remaining ambiguity on this point is resolved by\n\nthe district court's decision denying attorney's fees.                    There, the\n\ncourt described the basis for the plaintiffs' prevailing party\n\nstatus as \"a one dollar nominal award to two of ten original\n\nplaintiffs, the entitlement to which was conceded by the defendants\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\ffrom the virtual outset . . . .\" (emphasis added).      Again, the\n\ndefendants had conceded only that they were willing to pay damages\n\nbecause Feeney and McCoy were denied seats based on their race, not\n\nbecause the Old Plan was unconstitutional.     The district court's\n\ndescription of its own judgment thus forecloses the plaintiffs'\n\nargument that it found the Old Plan unconstitutional.\n\n          Viewed in this light, the nominal damages award does not\n\nrepresent a victory on a significant legal issue. To the contrary,\n\nit represents such a minimal success in the context of this\n\nlitigation that the district court supportably concluded that \"the\n\nonly reasonable fee is . . . no fee at all.\"    Farrar, 506 U.S. at\n\n115. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nattorney's fees.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f",

Boston Sch. Comm.,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d 318, 319 (D.Mass.2003). In rulings that we recently affirmed, the district court rejected the majority of the plaintiffs' claims but awarded nominal damages to two children who were denied seats at their preferred schools because of their race. <i>See Anderson v. City of Boston,</i> 375 F.3d 71 (1st Cir.2004). Plaintiffs<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> then sought attorney's fees as a \"prevailing party\" under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988. The district court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs' <i>de minimis</i> success on the nominal damages claim did not entitle them to a fee award. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs initiated the underlying suit on June 21, 1999, challenging the Boston Public Schools (\"BPS\") Controlled Choice Student Assignment Plan (\"Old Plan\") on the grounds that it improperly considered students' race when assigning them to schools in an effort to achieve \"ideal racial percentages.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Old Plan violated their federal and state equal protection rights, as well as injunctive relief and damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 14, 1999, the Boston School Committee voluntarily amended the Old Plan to eliminate race as a factor in the school admissions process (\"New Plan\"). The plaintiffs responded by adding a plethora of claims to their suit. They ultimately sought (1) a declaratory judgment that both Plans violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and Article 111 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> (2) a permanent injunction ordering BPS to admit plaintiffs to the schools of their choice, prohibiting BPS from considering race in school assignments and governance, ordering BPS to redraw attendance zones, and granting BCF access to school records to monitor BPS's compliance with these orders; and (3) nominal and compensatory damages for plaintiffs who were not admitted to their preferred schools under the Old Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2002, the district court ruled that it would consider the plaintiffs' damages claim separately from their claims for prospective relief. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on the damages claim on November 1, 2002, seeking nominal damages for all ten student-plaintiffs. That motion noted that the defendants had admitted earlier in the litigation that two students, John Feeney, Jr. and Kathleen McCoy, were denied seats based on their race under the Old Plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> It also emphasized that the defendants had not conceded that the Old Plan was unconstitutional. The parties then entered into unsuccessful settlement discussions, with the defendants expressing a willingness to pay \"nominal damages\" to Feeney and McCoy but an unwillingness to address the plaintiffs' additional request that they admit the Old Plan had been unconstitutional. The court ultimately granted the defendants an extension for responding to the summary judgment motion, allowing them to file their opposition after a bench trial on the plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the course of four rulings between 1999 and 2003, the district court rejected all of the plaintiffs' claims for prospective relief. <i>BCF I,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d at 262; <i>BCF II,</i> 98 F.Supp.2d at 117; <i>BCF III,</i> 183 F.Supp.2d at 395-401; <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 334. In the last of these rulings, following the bench trial, the court upheld the New Plan against the plaintiffs' equal protection challenge and declined to retain jurisdiction to ensure that BPS did not return to using race in its seat assignment policy. <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 330-34. The court concluded by noting that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[P]laintiffs should not underestimate what they have accomplished.

In their May 21, 2003 response to the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, the defendants again conceded that Feeney and McCoy had been denied seats based on their race and indicated that they were \"willing to have this Court enter judgment awarding nominal damages to these plaintiffs.\" However, asserting that no damages may be awarded absent the deprivation of a constitutional right, the defendants opposed a nominal damages award for the eight plaintiffs who had not shown that they were deprived of a seat based on their race. The defendants also urged the court not to address the constitutionality of the Old Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's May 27, 2003 ruling on the motion for summary judgment awarded nominal damages to Feeney and McCoy on the grounds that they \"were denied seat assignments at their preferred schools because of their race\" but without expressly stating whether the Old Plan was unconstitutional. <i>BCF V,</i> at 1. Stressing that nominal damages may not be awarded \"absent the deprivation of a constitutional right,\" the court denied damages to the remaining plaintiffs, who could \"make no showing of a deprivation under <i>Texas v.

Rather, the benefit achieved must be a \"judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship between the parties.\" <i>Buckhannon,</i> 532 U.S. at 605, 121 S.Ct. 1835.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly concluded that prevailing party status cannot be based on the School Committee's decision to amend the Old Plan, and plaintiffs do not argue to the contrary. Although eliminating race in the seat assignment plan was one of the plaintiffs' central goals in bringing the suit, a fee award based on the School Committee's voluntary actions would rest on the \"catalyst theory\" that the Supreme Court explicitly rejected in <i>Buckhannon. See</i> 532 U.S. at 610, 121 S.Ct. 1835. The plaintiffs claim instead that the nominal damages award makes them a prevailing party. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that \"a plaintiff who wins nominal damages is a prevailing party under &#167; 1988.\" <i>Farrar,</i> 506 U.S. at 112, 113 S.Ct. 566. This holding recognizes that nominal damages are a \"material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties\" because \"[a] judgment for damages in any amount, whether compensatory or nominal, modifies the defendant's behavior for the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to pay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\" <i>Id.</i> at 113, 113 S.Ct. 566. Here, the district court ordered the defendants to pay nominal damages to two plaintiffs, Feeney and McCoy. As <i>Farrar</i> recognized, that order \"materially alter[ed] the legal relationship between the parties,\" and thus conferred prevailing party status on the plaintiffs. <i>Id.</i> at 112, 113 S.Ct. 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of their argument that our case law dictates a contrary result on the prevailing party issue, the defendants cite <i>Maine School Administrative District No. 35 v. Mr. R.,</i> 321 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.2003). There, we explained that \"the change effected [by the plaintiff's success] must be material; a purely technical or <i>de minimis</i> victory cannot confer prevailing party status.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15; <i>see also Farrar,</i> 506 U.S. at 111-12, 113 S.Ct. 566 (\"[A] plaintiff `prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\"). It is true that many of our cases, including <i>Maine School Administrative District No. 35,</i> consider the \"technical\" or \"<i>de minimis</i>\" nature of a victory as part of the prevailing party inquiry, rather than in determining what constitutes a reasonable award. 321 F.3d at 15. However, the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Farrar</i> precludes any argument that an award of nominal damages is \"a purely technical or <i>de minimis</i> victory\" that bars prevailing party status. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Farrar,</i> the Court specifically considered \"whether a nominal damages award is the sort of `technical,' `insignificant' victory that cannot confer prevailing party status.\" 506 U.S. at 113-14, 113 S.Ct. 566. As we have already discussed, the Court answered this question in the negative, concluding that nominal damages effect a material change and therefore confer prevailing party status. The \"`technical' nature of a nominal damages award\" bears instead on the reasonableness of the fees awarded rather than on prevailing party status, and the district court's analysis proceeded accordingly. <i>Id.</i> at 114, 113 S.Ct. 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

However, as <i>Farrar</i> itself acknowledges, \"[i]n some circumstances, even a plaintiff who formally `prevails' under &#167; 1988 should receive no attorney's fees at all.\" 506 U.S. at 115, 113 S.Ct. 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Farrar</i> was a &#167; 1983 civil rights suit in which a plaintiff sought $17 million in damages against six defendants who had allegedly conspired to violate his due process rights. A jury found that one of the defendants had \"committed an act or acts under color of state law that deprived [Farrar] of a civil right,\" but that this conduct was not a proximate cause of his damages. 506 U.S. at 106, 113 S.Ct. 566. The district court awarded Farrar $1 in nominal damages and $280,000 in attorney's fees. The Fifth Circuit reversed the fee award, finding that Farrar's victory was too insignificant to confer prevailing party status under &#167; 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court disagreed with the Fifth Circuit's reasoning but affirmed the fee award reversal. It held that Farrar was not entitled to fees, despite the fact that the nominal damages award conferred prevailing party status. The Court explained that \"the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award is the degree of success obtained.\" <i>Id.</i> at 114, 113 S.Ct. 566 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Where Farrar sought $17 million in compensatory damages but received only $1 in nominal damages, he obtained such a small degree of success as to make \"the only reasonable fee ... no fee at all.\" <i>Id.</i> at 115, 113 S.Ct. 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice O'Connor wrote separately to explain the relationship between nominal damages and a fee award. While \"[n]ominal relief does not necessarily a nominal victory make[,] ... a substantial difference between the judgment recovered and the recovery sought suggests that the victory is in fact purely technical.\" <i>Id.</i> at 121, 113 S.Ct. 566. Other relevant factors include \"the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff claims to have prevailed\" and whether the success furthered a public purpose. <i>Id.</i> at 121-22, 113 S.Ct. 566; <i>see also O'Connor v. Huard,</i> 117 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir.1997) (recognizing similar considerations). Where the district court has properly weighed the foregoing factors, there is no abuse of discretion to merit a reversal. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the court explained its denial of fees in an eight-page ruling that reviewed the course of the litigation and set forth the relevant law. It concluded that the nominal damages award, \"the entitlement to which was conceded by the defendants from the virtual outset,\" was too <i>de minimis</i> a victory in relation to the plaintiffs' other claims to merit a fee award. <i>See Farrar,</i> 506 U.S. at 114, 113 S.Ct. 566; <i>Me. Admin. Sch. Dist. No. 35,</i> 321 F.3d at 14-15 (fee award cannot be based on a \"hollow victory\"). The plaintiffs claim that this ruling was an abuse of discretion because it failed to recognize the significance of the nominal damages award &#8212; namely, that the award included an implicit finding that the Old Plan was unconstitutional and would thus have a preclusive effect if the defendants attempted to revive the Plan. The defendants contend that the award did not include such a finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the language of the decision explaining the nominal damages award is susceptible to both parties' readings. The court said the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Feeney[, Jr.] and Kathleen McCoy were denied seat assignments at their preferred schools because of their race. For that reason they are entitled to an award of nominal damages, and defendants do not contend otherwise. Defendants are correct, however, that absent the deprivation of a constitutional right, nominal damages may not be awarded. <i>See Carey v. Piphus,</i> 435 U.S. 247, 266-67, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). As the remaining plaintiffs can make no showing of a deprivation under <i>Texas v. Lesage,</i> 528 U.S. 18, 21, 120 S.Ct. 467, 145 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999) (per curiam), no damages, nominal or otherwise, may be awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>BCF V,</i> at 1. Although the nominal damages judgment does not specify that the Old Plan was unconstitutional, the plaintiffs assert that such a finding was necessarily implicit in light of the court's own statement that nominal damages must be premised on a constitutional injury. Losing a seat assignment because of race is not, <i>per se,</i> a constitutional deprivation. Race-conscious policies are permissible if they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest, which may include remedying past discrimination, <i>City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U.S. 469, 507, 109 S.Ct. 706, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (considering whether Richmond's race-conscious plan for city construction contracts was \"narrowly tailored to remedy prior discrimination\"), or achieving educational diversity, <i>Grutter v. Bollinger,</i> 539 U.S. 306, 343, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003) (\"[T]he Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the [University of Michigan] Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.\"). Thus, the plaintiffs reason, the defendants' concession about the role of race in the plaintiffs' seat assignments does not, standing alone, admit the constitutional violation required to support an award of nominal damages. The deprivation was unconstitutional only if the assignment plan was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest, or, in other words, if the Old Plan was unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, the nominal damages decision does not address the issues of compelling interest and narrow tailoring that would be integral to a fully developed legal analysis of the constitutionality of the Old Plan. Nor did the court explicitly state that Feeney and McCoy had suffered a constitutional injury. Its comment that nominal damages require such an injury was not an explanation for Feeney and McCoy's award, but rather for the denial of damages to the remaining plaintiffs. <i>See BCF V,</i> at 1. Indeed, the only basis that the court cited for Feeney and McCoy's award was their loss of seats because of their race &#8212; the point conceded by the defendants. This language suggests that the award did not include a finding that the Old Plan was unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognized this ambiguity in the nominal damages decision when we considered the merits of this case on appeal, noting that \"[a]lthough the district court never explicitly described the Old Plan as unconstitutional, ... nominal damages in this context require a constitutional violation.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 375 F.3d at 80 n. 12. Based on this logic, we accepted \"the colorable premise that the Old Plan was unconstitutional\" for the purposes of our analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> However, the court's ruling, if any, on the constitutionality of the Old Plan was not directly before us in that appeal. Now that we must decide in the context of this attorney's fees appeal whether the court, in fact, ruled on the constitutionality of the Old Plan, we conclude that there was no such ruling. Instead, the court awarded nominal damages on the basis of the defendants' concession, which acknowledged the dispositive effect of race in the school assignments of Feeney and McCoy, but which rejected any conclusion that the Old Plan was unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is compelled by the following considerations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The constitutionality of the Old Plan was not actively litigated; the court refused to consider injunctive or declaratory relief regarding the Old Plan once the New Plan was in place. Indeed, the court's description of the Old Plan as \"constitutionally dubious\" in a ruling denying prospective relief one month before the nominal damages award, <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 334, signals that it did not consider the constitutionality of the Old Plan a resolved question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The defendants' motion opposing summary judgment, filed soon after the decision denying prospective relief, recognized that a finding on the constitutionality of the Old Plan would require the court to try issues that it had not previously considered and therefore urged the court to award damages without reaching the constitutional issue. In essence, the defendants expressed a willingness to pay nominal damages to Feeney and McCoy without admitting any constitutional injury. As we have discussed, the language of the ensuing award is consistent with this position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Any remaining ambiguity on this point is resolved by the district court's decision denying attorney's fees. There, the court described the basis for the plaintiffs' prevailing party status as \"a one dollar nominal award to two of ten original plaintiffs, the entitlement to which was <i>conceded by the defendants</i> from the virtual outset....\" (emphasis added). Again, the defendants had conceded only that they were willing to pay damages because Feeney and McCoy were denied seats based on their race, not because the Old Plan was unconstitutional. The district court's description of its own judgment thus forecloses the plaintiffs' argument that it found the Old Plan unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, the nominal damages award does not represent a victory on a significant legal issue. To the contrary, it represents such a minimal success in the context of this litigation that the district court supportably concluded that \"the only reasonable fee is ... no fee at all.\" <i>Farrar,</i> 506 U.S. at 115, 113 S.Ct. 566.

The plaintiffs responded by adding a plethora of claims to their suit. They ultimately sought (1) a declaratory judgment that both Plans violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and Article 111 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> (2) a permanent injunction ordering BPS to admit plaintiffs to the schools of their choice, prohibiting BPS from considering race in school assignments and governance, ordering BPS to redraw attendance zones, and granting BCF access to school records to monitor BPS's compliance with these orders; and (3) nominal and compensatory damages for plaintiffs who were not admitted to their preferred schools under the Old Plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 2002, the district court ruled that it would consider the plaintiffs' damages claim separately from their claims for prospective relief. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on the damages claim on November 1, 2002, seeking nominal damages for all ten student-plaintiffs. That motion noted that the defendants had admitted earlier in the litigation that two students, John Feeney, Jr. and Kathleen McCoy, were denied seats based on their race under the Old Plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> It also emphasized that the defendants had not conceded that the Old Plan was unconstitutional. The parties then entered into unsuccessful settlement discussions, with the defendants expressing a willingness to pay \"nominal damages\" to Feeney and McCoy but an unwillingness to address the plaintiffs' additional request that they admit the Old Plan had been unconstitutional.

For that reason they are entitled to an award of nominal damages, and defendants do not contend otherwise. Defendants are correct, however, that absent the deprivation of a constitutional right, nominal damages may not be awarded. <i>See Carey v.

Although the nominal damages judgment does not specify that the Old Plan was unconstitutional, the plaintiffs assert that such a finding was necessarily implicit in light of the court's own statement that nominal damages must be premised on a constitutional injury. Losing a seat assignment because of race is not, <i>per se,</i> a constitutional deprivation. Race-conscious policies are permissible if they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest, which may include remedying past discrimination, <i>City of Richmond v. J.A.

Thus, the plaintiffs reason, the defendants' concession about the role of race in the plaintiffs' seat assignments does not, standing alone, admit the constitutional violation required to support an award of nominal damages. The deprivation was unconstitutional only if the assignment plan was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest, or, in other words, if the Old Plan was unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet, the nominal damages decision does not address the issues of compelling interest and narrow tailoring that would be integral to a fully developed legal analysis of the constitutionality of the Old Plan. Nor did the court explicitly state that Feeney and McCoy had suffered a constitutional injury. Its comment that nominal damages require such an injury was not an explanation for Feeney and McCoy's award, but rather for the denial of damages to the remaining plaintiffs. <i>See BCF V,</i> at 1. Indeed, the only basis that the court cited for Feeney and McCoy's award was their loss of seats because of their race &#8212; the point conceded by the defendants. This language suggests that the award did not include a finding that the Old Plan was unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognized this ambiguity in the nominal damages decision when we considered the merits of this case on appeal, noting that \"[a]lthough the district court never explicitly described the Old Plan as unconstitutional, ... nominal damages in this context require a constitutional violation.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 375 F.3d at 80 n. 12. Based on this logic, we accepted \"the colorable premise that the Old Plan was unconstitutional\" for the purposes of our analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>Id.</i> However, the court's ruling, if any, on the constitutionality of the Old Plan was not directly before us in that appeal. Now that we must decide in the context of this attorney's fees appeal whether the court, in fact, ruled on the constitutionality of the Old Plan, we conclude that there was no such ruling. Instead, the court awarded nominal damages on the basis of the defendants' concession, which acknowledged the dispositive effect of race in the school assignments of Feeney and McCoy, but which rejected any conclusion that the Old Plan was unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion is compelled by the following considerations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The constitutionality of the Old Plan was not actively litigated; the court refused to consider injunctive or declaratory relief regarding the Old Plan once the New Plan was in place. Indeed, the court's description of the Old Plan as \"constitutionally dubious\" in a ruling denying prospective relief one month before the nominal damages award, <i>BCF IV,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 334, signals that it did not consider the constitutionality of the Old Plan a resolved question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) The defendants' motion opposing summary judgment, filed soon after the decision denying prospective relief, recognized that a finding on the constitutionality of the Old Plan would require the court to try issues that it had not previously considered and therefore urged the court to award damages without reaching the constitutional issue. In essence, the defendants expressed a willingness to pay nominal damages to Feeney and McCoy without admitting any constitutional injury. As we have discussed, the language of the ensuing award is consistent with this position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Any remaining ambiguity on this point is resolved by the district court's decision denying attorney's fees. There, the court described the basis for the plaintiffs' prevailing party status as \"a one dollar nominal award to two of ten original plaintiffs, the entitlement to which was <i>conceded by the defendants</i> from the virtual outset....\" (emphasis added). Again, the defendants had conceded only that they were willing to pay damages because Feeney and McCoy were denied seats based on their race, not because the Old Plan was unconstitutional. The district court's description of its own judgment thus forecloses the plaintiffs' argument that it found the Old Plan unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, the nominal damages award does not represent a victory on a significant legal issue. To the contrary, it represents such a minimal success in the context of this litigation that the district court supportably concluded that \"the only reasonable fee is ... no fee at all.\" <i>Farrar,</i> 506 U.S. at 115, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
