Like the legendary Phoenix, this\n\nclass action litigation involving prison conditions in Puerto Rico\n\nis seemingly incapable of eternal rest.             The iteration now before\n\nus focuses on prospective injunctive relief ordered by the district\n\ncourt       in    1998   (the   centerpiece    of   which   is   the   proposed\n\nprivatization of medical and mental health care throughout the\n\ncorrectional        system).     Despite   his   predecessor's    enthusiastic\n\nassent to that arrangement, the Commonwealth's Secretary of Health\n\n(the Secretary), acting in his official capacity, sought five years\n\nlater to vacate or terminate the consent decree embodying that\n\nrelief.1         Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court\n\nrejected that initiative. Morales Feliciano v. Calderón Serra, 300\n\nF. Supp. 2d 321 (D.P.R. 2004) (Morales IV).                 The Secretary now\n\nattacks this decision on several fronts.             He asserts, inter alia,\n\nthat the court acted ultra vires; that the court's 1998 order was\n\nvoid ab initio for failure to meet the requirements of section 802\n\nof the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), Pub. L. No. 104-134,\n\n110 Stat. 1321-66, § 802 (1996), codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3626; and\n\nthat in all events, the order should be terminated because the\n\ndistrict court's supportive factfinding was clearly erroneous and\n\ninfected by errors of law.            As a fallback, he argues that the\n\ndistrict court bungled the evidentiary hearing and that, at a bare\n\n\n        1\n      We note that a new administration, representing a different\npolitical party, took office following the general election held in\nNovember of 2000.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fminimum,   the      matter   should     be    remanded   for     reconsideration.\n\nFinding these importunings unpersuasive, we affirm the decision\n\nbelow.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           Given the long and tortuous history of this litigation —\n\ntwo years ago, we acknowledged that \"the lore of this case is\n\nByzantine,\" Morales Feliciano v.

Supp. 967\n\n(D.P.R. 1985); Morales Feliciano v. Romero Barcelo, 497 F. Supp. 14\n\n(D.P.R. 1979) (Morales I).\n\n             In the 1970s, a group of prison inmates initiated a class\n\naction alleging \"dire shortcomings in virtually every aspect of\n\nprisoner confinement\" in the Puerto Rican correctional system.\n\nMorales   III,   303   F.3d   at    3.         The   district   court   found     the\n\nplaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits and issued preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief.         Morales I, 497 F. Supp. at 39-41.                      The\n\ndefendants made little progress and the district court, in March of\n\n1986, appointed a monitor.         See Morales III, 303 F.3d at 3; Morales\n\nFeliciano v. Romero Barcelo, 672 F. Supp. at 621.                       The court\n\ncharged   the    monitor   with     studying         various    elements    of    the\n\ncorrectional system and recommending remedial action.                      With the\n\nmonitor's assistance, the court became more proactive and issued a\n\ntorrent of orders, including temporary restrainers and contempt\n\ncitations.    The court thereafter imposed multimillion dollar fines\n\nfor the most egregious failures to comply with its directives.\n\n           In 1990, the court ordered the implementation of medical\n\nand mental health care plans recommended by the monitor.                         These\n\nplans transferred the primary responsibility for medical and mental\n\nhealth care in the correctional system from the Administrator of\n\nCorrections (the AOC) to the Secretary.                The plans also required\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fthat the Secretary employ for a minimum of three years a chief\n\nhealth care coordinator (the CHCC) who would bear responsibility\n\nfor easing the transition and coordinating compliance.\n\n            Over time, prison conditions improved.   In 1996, the\n\ndistrict court entered a partial final judgment that settled\n\nseveral disputed issues and urged attempts at consensus-based\n\ncompliance efforts as to other issues.    Despite improvements in\n\nmany areas, the delivery of medical and mental health care lagged\n\nbehind.\n\n            In April of 1997, a court-appointed expert found the\n\nexisting health care programs incapable of meeting constitutional\n\nstandards and suggested, as an alternative, the appointment of a\n\nreceiver.    The parties (who, over a quarter of a century, have\n\nagreed on little else) unanimously opposed this recommendation.\n\nThey suggested instead the formation of a private non-profit\n\ncorporation to provide medical and mental health services to the\n\ninmate population.    On September 26, 1997, the parties drafted,\n\nexecuted, and filed a stipulation embodying this consensus.   Under\n\nthe terms of the stipulation, a non-profit corporation was to be\n\nformed. The corporation would be structured to provide health care\n\nservices, consistent with the 1990 plan, to all individuals held in\n\ninstitutions operated by the AOC.     The stipulation pledged the\n\nparties' full cooperation, required the Secretary and the AOC to\n\nlay the groundwork for a transition, and offered to subject the\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fprocess of privatization to the supervision of the district court.\n\nFinally, the stipulation memorialized the parties' agreement to\n\nengage in further discussions concerning the role and authority of\n\nthe CHCC.\n\n            The district court endorsed the stipulation and, thus,\n\nassumed ownership of the privatization plan that had been conceived\n\nby the parties.   See Morales III, 303 F.3d at 3-4; see also Morales\n\nII, 13 F. Supp. 2d at 212-14 (justifying the adoption of the\n\nprivatization remedy by elaborating on the grave constitutional\n\ndeficiencies that continued to haunt the existing programs).     The\n\norder, as it pertains to this appeal, has retained its original\n\nsubstance. The non-profit entity, known as the Correctional Health\n\nServices Corporation (the CHSC), has been formed.\n\n            The parties and the district court envisioned the CHSC as\n\na key piece of the privatization machinery.      Withal, the CHSC was\n\nintended as a transitional device rather than as the exclusive\n\nprovider of inmate health care services in perpetuity. The parties\n\nexpected that within a few years of its full implementation, the\n\nCHSC would compete with private health care providers for contracts\n\nto furnish health care services to those persons held in the AOC's\n\ncustody.    This expectation remains in force.\n\n            The CHSC has a checkered history.        Originally, the\n\nparties hoped that it would begin to function as early as July 1,\n\n1998, and become fully operational as a provider of health care to\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthe inmate population by the end of that year.                          That prediction\n\nproved wildly optimistic.               Although the district court, using\n\naccrued fines, has made substantial funding available to the CHSC\n\n—   as   of   the   date    of    the   district         court's    decision,       roughly\n\n$55,000,000 had been spent on the privatization solution — this\n\nmonetary infusion has not yet brought the project to fruition.\n\nWhile the CHSC has made substantial progress toward reaching its\n\nstated goals, the pace has been much slower than anticipated.                                To\n\nthis     point,      the     CHSC       has        developed       an       administrative\n\ninfrastructure,          fashioned      an     impressive       set     of    substantive\n\nprograms, and constructed needed facilities.                       As a result, it has\n\nbegun contributing to the management of payroll, staff assignments,\n\ninventory,     purchasing,        billing,         and    financing.          The     CHSC's\n\nachievements        in   formulating         substantive       programs       include    the\n\ncreation of an electronic database for health records, patient\n\ntracking,     and    the    keeping     of     appointments;          the    design     of    a\n\ntelemedicine program to enable remote diagnosis and treatment of\n\npsychiatric illnesses; and the training of personnel to maximize\n\nthe efficacy of these (and other) programs.                         The CHSC also has\n\nimproved the quality of the facilities and equipment dedicated to\n\nthe provision of inmate health care.                      In the same vein, it has\n\npurchased and installed computers at most of the institutions\n\noperated by the AOC.             Last — but far from least — it is in the\n\nprocess of developing a new acute care hospital.\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\f            Without in any way minimizing either the value or extent\n\nof these accomplishments, it is evident that the CHSC has lagged\n\nfar behind the timetable that its proponents originally envisioned.\n\nPart of the reason is that court supervision has made the process\n\ncumbersome (for example, lengthy periods of time have been consumed\n\nin   the   submission    and   approval    of    budget   proposals).       Other\n\nfactors,     such   as     snail's-pace         negotiations     with   outside\n\ncontractors,    false     starts,    and    resistance      to   change,     have\n\ncontributed to the delay.           Though this lag time may have been\n\nunavoidable, the fact remains that, to this date, not a single\n\npatient has been treated by the CHSC.\n\n            On October 1, 2003, the Secretary, emphasizing this\n\nprotracted period of delay and the mounting costs of completing the\n\nnecessary infrastructure, filed a motion under the PLRA to vacate\n\nor terminate the privatization component of the extant consent\n\ndecree.     The plaintiffs cross-moved to modify the medical and\n\nmental health plans by terminating sections of the decree that\n\nassigned the primary responsibility for inmate health care to the\n\nSecretary.    See Morales IV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 342-43.            The cross-\n\nmotion went unopposed and the district court granted it.                   Id. at\n\n343.\n\n            Following an evidentiary hearing on the main motion, the\n\ncourt found that pervasive and persistent constitutional violations\n\ncontinued to shackle the delivery of health care in Puerto Rico's\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcorrectional system.                Id. at 323-31.     The court also found that the\n\ncontemplated relief — privatization — satisfied the requirements of\n\nthe PLRA.               Id. at 331-38.         Accordingly, the court upheld the\n\nchallenged portion of the consent decree and directed the AOC to\n\nmeet with the plaintiff class and submit a further plan for\n\nachieving constitutional compliance. Id. at 344-45. The Secretary\n\nnow appeals.2\n\nII.    APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n                   We start by clarifying the extent of our jurisdiction.\n\nIt is beyond serious question that we have jurisdiction over the\n\nmain       elements          of   this   appeal.      See     28   U.S.C.   §   1292(a)(1)\n\n(conferring jurisdiction over interlocutory orders refusing to\n\nterminate injunctions). The Secretary, however, has also attempted\n\nto raise a tangential issue.                   With regard to that issue, appellate\n\njurisdiction is more problematic.\n\n                   The circumstances are as follows.               As part of its ruling\n\nbelow, the district court ordered the AOC to \"meet [with the\n\nplaintiff class] and file with the Court within forty-five (45)\n\ndays       .   .    .    a   plan   on   how    the   [AOC]    will   assume    his   legal\n\nresponsibility to provide health care to inmates.\" Morales IV, 300\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 345.                  The Secretary asserts that this order, ex\n\nproprio vigore, violates the PLRA and contravenes Supreme Court\n\n\n       2\n      The AOC has not appealed, and the district court's ukase has\nnot been stayed. We are advised that meetings between the AOC and\nthe plaintiffs are proceeding apace.\n\n                                                -9-\n\fprecedent regarding limitations on the power of federal courts to\n\nenforce state law against state officers.   Pennhurst State Sch. &\n\nHosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 117 (1984) (\"[A] federal suit\n\nagainst state officials on the basis of state law contravenes the\n\nEleventh Amendment when . . . the relief sought and ordered has an\n\nimpact directly on the State itself.\"). We cannot reach the merits\n\nof these claims for we have no jurisdiction over them.\n\n          This result is largely dictated by the rationale of our\n\ndecision in a prior phase of this seemingly endless litigation. In\n\nMorales III, we ruled that an order that \"was within the lower\n\ncourt's reserved power to establish procedures for compliance with\n\nthe court's earlier decrees\" was not immediately appealable.   303\n\nF.3d at 10.     That reasoning is apposite here.       A necessary\n\ncorrelate of the lower court's duty to supervise the ongoing\n\nprocess of privatization is the power to issue subsidiary orders in\n\naid of that objective.   We thus have no jurisdiction to entertain\n\nan interlocutory appeal from this portion of the court's decision\n\n(or even to consider the plaintiffs' contention that the Secretary\n\nlacks standing to register such a protest).3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      With only isthmian exceptions, the courts of appeals are\nprohibited from exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction.     See\nSwint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.S. 35, 49-51 (1995); Limone\nv. Condon, 372 F.3d 39, 51-52 (1st Cir. 2004).       The Secretary\noffers no developed argumentation on this point and, as matters\nstand, we believe that this case is not a credible candidate for\nthe exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction.\n\n                               -10-\n\fIII.       THE MERITS\n\n               We proceed to examine the remainder of the Secretary's\n\nasseverational array.          He has loosed a scattershot attack.             Only\n\nfour of his claims are worthy of extended discussion, namely, (i)\n\nthat the lower court lacked general equitable power to grant a\n\nprivatization remedy; (ii) that the PLRA mandates vacation of the\n\n1998 order as void ab initio; (iii) that, after almost five years\n\nof   wheel-spinning,         the   PLRA   now    mandates   termination   of   the\n\nprospective relief; and (iv) that the court repeatedly erred in the\n\ncourse of the evidentiary hearing.4              We address these issues (some\n\nof which have subparts) sequentially.\n\n                        A.    General Equitable Powers.\n\n              The Secretary's first broadside need not detain us.               He\n\nposits that the relief ordered here is an invalid exercise of\n\n\n       4\n      The Secretary makes a fifth argument:       that the relief\nordered by the district court requires Puerto Rican officials to\nact in contravention of local law. The district court refused to\naddress this argument on the ground that the Secretary did not\nsufficiently specify the nature of the alleged violations. That\nruling is supportable, and it precludes reliance on the argument\nhere. See Teamsters Union v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17,\n21 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that arguments not squarely raised in\nthe trial court cannot be advanced on appeal). In all events, the\nSecretary's appellate presentation suffers from the same lack of\nspecificity; he alleges the violations in the most general terms\nand does not inform us of where in the record we might find any\nevidence of them. This lack of developed appellate argumentation\nconstitutes an independently sufficient basis for deeming the\nargument abandoned. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n(1st Cir. 1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention a possible\nargument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do\ncounsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh\non its bones.\").\n\n                                          -11-\n\ffederal equitable power.        Because this argument presents a purely\n\nlegal issue, it engenders de novo review.            See Sunshine Dev., Inc.\n\nv. FDIC, 33 F.3d 106, 111 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           At the outset, we note that this argument quite likely is\n\nby the boards. The Secretary's predecessor in office stipulated to\n\nthe privatization remedy, and there is no claim that he lacked\n\nauthority to do so.       Normally, that would constitute a waiver,\n\nwhich   would   prevent   the    Secretary   from     making    this   argument\n\naltogether.\n\n           Even if the Secretary is not bound by his predecessor's\n\nacquiescence — a matter on which we take no view — the Secretary\n\ndid not present this argument to the district court and attempts to\n\nraise it for the first time on appeal.         \"It is a bedrock rule that\n\nwhen a party has not presented an argument to the district court,\n\n[he] may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\"             United States v.\n\nSlade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992).          At the least, then, the\n\nargument is forfeited.\n\n           We   nonetheless     inquire    briefly    into     the   merits,   as\n\nforfeited arguments (unlike waived arguments) ordinarily warrant\n\nreview for plain error.       Gómez v. Rivera Rodríguez, 344 F.3d 103,\n\n118 (1st Cir. 2003).      That type of review       \"entails four showings:\n\n(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which\n\nnot only (3) affected the [appellant's] substantial rights, but\n\nalso (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\freputation of judicial proceedings.\"        United States v. Duarte, 246\n\nF.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            The Secretary concedes that injunctions — like this one\n\n— that have been issued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 are limited\n\nonly by the court's inherent equitable powers. See, e.g., Giles v.\n\nHarris, 189 U.S. 475, 486 (1903) (Holmes, J.).               He insists,\n\nhowever, that a federal court's equitable powers are restricted to\n\nthe remedies that were available in equity in 1789 (at the time of\n\nthe passage of the First Judiciary Act).          This proposition is a\n\ncorrect statement of the law, see Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo v.\n\nAlliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318-19 (1999), but the\n\nSecretary's application of it fails plain error review.\n\n            Specifically, the Secretary characterizes privatization\n\nas \"a fairly recent endeavor\" and claims, therefore, that there is\n\nno reasonable basis for holding that court-imposed privatization of\n\nduties ordinarily ascribed to the government is within the district\n\ncourt's armamentarium.      Appellant's Br. at 29.        If this crabbed\n\nview reflected the state of the law, equitable remedies would be\n\nfrozen in    time   and   new   remedial   applications   could   never   be\n\ndeveloped to meet contemporary needs.            The view, however, is\n\nfundamentally at odds with the core principle that equity must\n\nevolve over time \"in order to meet the requirements of every case,\n\nand to satisfy the needs of a progressive social condition in which\n\nnew primary rights and duties are constantly arising and new kinds\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fof wrongs are constantly committed.\"                Union Pac. Ry. Co. v.\n\nChicago, Rock Island & Pac. Ry. Co., 163 U.S. 564, 601 (1896).\n\n            Consistent with this principle, the Supreme Court has\n\nmade clear that the inquiry into the availability of equitable\n\nrelief in a particular case focuses upon whether the general manner\n\nof relief sought was available at equity in 1789.                     See Grupo\n\nMexicano,   527   U.S.   at    322.      This    inquiry    is   informed    by   a\n\nrecognition that equity is flexible and that the boundaries of\n\npermissible relief are broad.          Id.    Thus, the relevant question is\n\nnot whether a specific application of relief was available in 1789,\n\nbut, rather, whether that general type of relief was available.\n\n            In this case, the answer to that question is affirmative.\n\nAt bottom, the endorsed anodyne — privatization — calls for relief\n\nin the nature of a mandatory injunction, and injunctive relief is\n\na classic equitable remedy.          Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v.\n\nKnudson, 534 U.S. 204, 211 n.1 (2002); Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs.,\n\n508 U.S. 248, 256 (1993); Griggs v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours & Co.,\n\n237 F.3d 371, 384 (4th Cir. 2001).                A survey of contemporary\n\napplications   of   this      rule    supports   this   conclusion.         Courts\n\nconsistently have upheld relief in equity notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat the particular remedial application was not available in 1789.\n\nSchool busing orders exemplify this point.                 See, e.g., Swann v.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 30 (1971); Morgan\n\nv. Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401, 414-15 (1st Cir. 1976).                      If the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fSecretary's argument were sound, all such orders would be beyond\n\nthe equitable power of a federal court.\n\n          The short of it is that a federal district court, faced\n\nwith pervasive and persistent constitutional violations, has not\n\nonly the power but also the duty to render a decree that will,\n\ninsofar as is possible, return matters to a constitutionally\n\nacceptable level.        While the privatization remedy constitutes\n\nextraordinary   relief    and   can    be    justified    in   only    the    most\n\nexceptional circumstances, the nature of the remedy is no different\n\nthan that of a garden-variety mandatory injunction.              Seen in this\n\nlight, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain\n\nerror in determining that it had the authority to approve and\n\nimplement a privatization remedy jointly proposed by the parties.\n\n                    B.    Compliance with the PLRA.\n\n          In 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA, partially in an\n\neffort to curb the involvement of the federal judiciary in day-to-\n\nday prison management. See 141 Cong. Rec. 13,319 (1995) (statement\n\nof Sen. Abraham); id. at 14,418 (statement of Sen. Hatch).                    This\n\nambient intent must guide our interpretation of the statutory text.\n\nSee Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 655 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n          The   PLRA     establishes     standards       for   the    entry    and\n\ntermination of all prospective relief in civil actions challenging\n\nprison conditions. See Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 333 (2000).\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fThe term \"prospective relief\" encompasses \"all relief other than\n\ncompensatory monetary damages.\"       18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(7).      The\n\nstatute requires that prospective relief \"shall extend no further\n\nthan necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a\n\nparticular plaintiff or plaintiffs.\" Id. § 3626(a)(1). It further\n\nprovides that a federal court \"shall not grant or approve any\n\nprospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is\n\nnarrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the\n\nviolation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means\n\nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\"    Id.    A\n\nparty is entitled to immediate termination of any relief that has\n\nbeen granted in the absence of findings as to these criteria.     Id.\n\n§ 3626(b)(2).   Conversely, however, prospective relief \"shall not\n\nterminate if the court makes written findings based on the record\n\nthat prospective relief [meets the above requirements].\"        Id. §\n\n3626(b)(3).\n\n          This statutory backdrop provides the setting for the\n\nSecretary's next challenge to the propriety of the privatization\n\norder.   This challenge has three foci, each spawned by the PLRA.\n\nWe deal with them in order.\n\n          1.    Validity of the 1998 Order.     The Secretary first\n\nargues that, when originally entered in 1998, the order approving\n\nprivatization did not meet the PLRA's requirements and, thus, \"must\n\nbe set aside without further consideration.\"     Appellant's Br. at\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f31.       Because   the    district    court   did   not    make   the   findings\n\nspecifically required by the PLRA coincident with the entry of its\n\n1998 order, the Secretary's thesis runs, the order was void ab\n\ninitio.5\n\n             The Secretary's thesis hinges on the premise that when\n\nprospective relief does not meet the PLRA's requirements at the\n\nmoment of issuance, the decree is void without reference to the\n\nstatutory termination procedure.          On this premise, the termination\n\nprocedure applies only to (i) prospective relief entered before the\n\neffective date of the PLRA and (ii) prospective relief entered\n\nafter that date which is accompanied by the requisite narrowness-\n\nneed-intrusiveness findings.           Prospective relief entered after the\n\nPLRA's     effective      date   but   unaccompanied       by   narrowness-need-\n\nintrusiveness findings is simply void.\n\n             There is no textual support for the Secretary's position.\n\nHe relies on the mandatory language of 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a), which\n\nstates that \"[t]he court shall not grant or approve any prospective\n\n\n\n      5\n      Although we assume arguendo the correctness of the\nSecretary's assessment of what transpired in 1998, we note that the\ndistrict court made a series of contemporaneous written findings,\nwhich may well have satisfied the narrowness-need-intrusiveness\nrequirements. See Morales II, 13 F. Supp. 2d at 212 (holding that\nprivatization \"is necessary to protect the members of the plaintiff\nclass from cruel and unusual punishment through constitutionally\nunacceptable health care services,\" that the remedy \"extends no\nfurther than is necessary to correct the violation of the Federal\nrights of members of the plaintiff class,\" that \"such relief is\nnarrowly drawn,\" and that there \"is no less intrusive means to\ncorrect the violation of plaintiffs' Federal rights\").\n\n                                       -17-\n\frelief\" in the absence of specific findings.         But this subsection\n\nsets   forth   the   standard   district    courts   must   follow   when\n\ndetermining whether prospective relief not yet ordered is permitted\n\nby the PLRA.    Gilmore v. California, 220 F.3d 987, 999 (9th Cir.\n\n2000) (\"If prospective relief has already been granted by a court,\n\n§ 3626(b) controls.\").     Here, however, privatization constitutes\n\nthe status quo (and the Secretary advanced no PLRA-based argument\n\nat the time that privatization was originally approved).\n\n          The only authority cited by the Secretary — Rouse — does\n\nnot support his point of view.           He asserts that Rouse drew a\n\ndistinction between orders issued prior to the enactment of the\n\nPLRA and those issued subsequent thereto.            That is incorrect.\n\nRouse drew a distinction between \"existing federal court orders\"\n\nand those \"not yet obtained.\"     129 F.3d at 654.     That distinction\n\ncontradicts the position that the Secretary advocates in this\n\nappeal.\n\n          Accordingly, we hold that the procedure limned in 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3626(b) applies to any existing prospective relief,\n\nregardless of when that relief was first ordered.        See Miller, 530\n\nU.S. at 333 (stating that section 3626(b) applies to \"existing\n\ninjunctions\"); Harvey v. Schoen, 245 F.3d 718, 720 (9th Cir. 2001)\n\n(holding that prospective relief made \"in the absence of the\n\nrequired findings\" is immediately terminable \"regardless of when\n\nordered\"); see also Rouse, 129 F.3d at 654 (suggesting that the\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\ftermination procedures set forth in section 3626(b) apply to all\n\nexisting federal court orders).\n\n             Since privatization is required by a preexisting court\n\norder,      the    situation      is     controlled       by    subsection        (b),   not\n\nsubsection (a).            See Rouse, 129 F.3d at 654.                   That makes a\n\nsignificant difference.                Nothing in subsection (b) or in its\n\nlegislative history speaks of vacating consent decrees but only of\n\nterminating        them.          That       linguistic        shift    has       practical\n\nconsequences.        \"While terminating a consent decree strips it of\n\nfuture potency, the decree's past puissance is preserved . . . .\"\n\nId. at 662.\n\n             That gets the grease from the goose.                  Although 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3626(b)       entitles    a     defendant       to    termination        of   existing\n\nprospective        relief    ordered         in   the    absence   of   the       requisite\n\nfindings, that proviso excepts cases in which the court supportably\n\nfinds that the particular form of prospective relief remains at the\n\ntime of the challenge narrowly tailored, necessary, and relatively\n\nunintrusive.        See id.; see also Guajardo v. Tex. Dep't of Crim.\n\nJustice, 363 F.3d 392, 394 (5th Cir. 2004) (per curiam).                           There is\n\nno time limitation present in section 3626(b)(2), nor does its\n\nlanguage suggest that it reaches only those orders issued prior to\n\nthe PLRA's effective date.\n\n             To cinch matters, section 3626(b) provides that any order\n\nmade   in    the    absence    of      the    required     findings     is    subject    to\n\n\n                                             -19-\n\f\"immediate termination.\"         This word choice is significant.              See\n\nRouse, 129 F.3d at 662.        The verb \"terminate\" means \"to put an end\n\nto\" or \"to end.\"       Black's Law Dictionary 1482 (7th ed., 1999).            If\n\nCongress had intended that orders issued in the absence of the\n\nrequired findings be void ab initio, it would almost certainly have\n\nchosen a phrase such as \"void.\"\n\n             To sum up, the PLRA grants the Secretary a right to move\n\nfor the termination of prospective relief.                 The PLRA does not,\n\nhowever, confer any right to argue, five years after the fact, that\n\nan   order    should     be    deemed     void   ab   initio    for     lack    of\n\ncontemporaneous      findings.          Therefore,    this     aspect    of    the\n\nSecretary's challenge founders.\n\n             2.   The Constitutional Violations.             Upon a motion to\n\nterminate prospective injunctive relief under the PLRA, a court may\n\ncontinue the relief only if it supportably finds that there are\n\nongoing constitutional violations.               18 U.S.C. § 3626(b).          The\n\ndistrict court purposed to make such findings in this instance.\n\nSee Morales IV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 323-31, 342.                  The Secretary\n\ncounters that the record does not show infirmities sufficient to\n\njustify ongoing relief and that the district court's contrary\n\nfindings are clearly erroneous.\n\n             An   inquiry     into   whether     current   prison     conditions\n\nconstitute an ongoing violation of a federal right \"comprises a\n\nmixed question of fact and law, the answer to which we review along\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fa degree-of-deference continuum, ranging from plenary review for\n\nlaw-dominated questions to clear-error review for fact-dominated\n\nquestions.\"    Rouse, 129 F.3d at 661.     Here, the question is fact-\n\nintensive — the Secretary frontally challenges the lower court's\n\nfactfinding — so our standard of review is deferential.           See id.;\n\nsee also Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d\n\n453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992) (admonishing that appellate courts should\n\nrespect the trial court's findings of fact unless convinced, after\n\na careful review of the record, that a mistake has been made).            If\n\nthere are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's\n\nchoice between them must be respected.           See Fed. Refin. Co. v.\n\nKlock, 352 F.3d 16, 29 (1st Cir. 2003).      The lower court's factual\n\nfindings easily pass muster under this deferential standard.\n\n          We have painstakingly reviewed the record and examined\n\nthe numerous findings of fact, mindful that a trial court generally\n\nis considered the most informed interpreter of its own prior\n\nrulings and findings.        See Rouse, 129 F.3d at 661.           In this\n\ninstance, the court was very careful to update the record and to\n\nconsider the    ways   in   which   conditions   had   changed   since   its\n\noriginal endorsement of the privatization concept. See Morales IV,\n\n300 F. Supp. 2d at 323-31.     The court painted a compelling, record-\n\nrooted picture of how and in what respects health care for inmates\n\nin Puerto Rican prisons remains constitutionally deficient.              See\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fid.    On this grim record, it is simply implausible to suggest that\n\nthese findings are clearly erroneous.\n\n              The district court characterized the denial of medical\n\nand mental health services as \"massive and systematic.\"                            Id. at\n\n324.    That characterization seems apt.                No useful purpose would be\n\nserved by rehearsing the court's findings in minute detail.                            We\n\noffer instead a few of the more glaring examples.                   As of 2003, one-\n\nfourth of all inmates who requested sick call did not get it; only\n\n55% of all ambulatory care appointments actually took place; only\n\n49%    of    specialist   consultations          deemed    necessary       for    serious\n\nconditions were arranged; as a rule, medically prescribed diets for\n\ninmates were habitually ignored; only 31.3% of inmates who had been\n\ndiagnosed      HIV-positive      were      receiving      treatment;        and    inmate\n\nmortality rates were rising.            See id. at 323-31.         These are but the\n\ntip of a particularly unattractive iceberg.                    Despite the CHSC's\n\nefforts,      physical    facilities       for     inmate    health        care    remain\n\ninadequate and there is an acute shortage of psychiatric expertise.\n\nSee    id.    at   326-27,   331.       Basic     health    care     is    critical    to\n\nmaintaining        a   decent   quality      of     life,     and        Puerto    Rico's\n\ncorrectional system is not delivering a constitutionally acceptable\n\nlevel of health care to its captive population.\n\n              We   acknowledge      that    in    the    course     of    making    these\n\nfindings, the district court largely disregarded the testimony of\n\nthe Secretary's expert witness as lacking in credibility. Although\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fthe Secretary complains bitterly about this rejection, it is\n\nhornbook law that matters of credibility are ordinarily for the\n\ncourt of first instance, not for the appellate court.              Laurent v.\n\nAshcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).              Unless the record\n\nmandates a contrary finding — and this record most assuredly does\n\nnot — the court of appeals ought not disturb a trial court's\n\ncredibility determination.       See Anthony v. Sundlun, 952 F.2d 603,\n\n606 (1st Cir. 1991); see also 9A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R.\n\nMiller,    Federal   Practice    &   Procedure   §    2586   (2d   ed.   1994)\n\n(collecting cases).     Here, moreover, there is much to commend the\n\ndistrict court's assessment of the witness's dubious credibility\n\n(for example, the witness provided haphazard and inconsistent\n\ntestimony and, on cross-examination, withdrew or corrected a myriad\n\nof statements).\n\n            The Secretary accurately observes that some noteworthy\n\nadvances have been made in the delivery of health care to inmates.\n\nHe overlooks, however, that notwithstanding these improvements, the\n\ndistrict    court    found   substantial     deficiencies     attendant    to\n\nvirtually every aspect of the inmate health care system.             Morales\n\nIV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 324.      However laudable the advances may be,\n\nthe   district   court's     supportable    finding   that   constitutional\n\nviolations persist suffices to satisfy the requirements of the PLRA\n\nand to justify a comprehensive injunctive decree.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f           To say more on this subject would be supererogatory.              We\n\nhold, without serious question, that the district court's findings\n\nand conclusions about the incidence of continuing constitutional\n\nviolations are adequately anchored in the record.\n\n           3. The Narrowness-Need-Intrusiveness Findings. The PLRA\n\nmandates \"the termination of extant consent decrees altogether\n\nunless the district court makes the specific findings that are\n\nnecessary to keep a particular decree alive.\"          Rouse, 129 F.3d at\n\n655.   In addition to ongoing constitutional violations, this\n\ncompendium includes a finding that the ordered relief satisfies the\n\nstatutory narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria.            See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3626(b).   The district court made such findings here.            See Morales\n\nIV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 342.    The Secretary argues that the facts of\n\nthis case, as found, require termination of the decree because the\n\nchosen remedy — privatization — does not meet the narrowness, need,\n\nand intrusiveness requirements delineated in the PLRA.\n\n           Congress plainly intended the PLRA to operate as a\n\nmechanism that would decrease federal judicial involvement in\n\nprison administration.    See Rouse, 129 F.3d at 655.         Congress left\n\nroom, however, for needed injunctive relief.             The Secretary's\n\ninsistence that Congress did not want courts involved in prison\n\nadministration   begs   the   real    question   —   which   is    whether    a\n\nparticular set of facts, measured under the statutorily specified\n\ncriteria, warrants continued judicial involvement.            We think that\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fthis is a close call in the case at hand, but for the time being,\n\nwe find supportable the district court's conclusions regarding\n\nnarrowness, need, and lack of intrusiveness.\n\n            The narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria are, to some\n\nextent, self-explicating. The devil is in the details attendant to\n\ntheir application.    The application of those criteria is case-\n\nspecific and must be undertaken in light of both the magnitude of\n\nexisting constitutional    violations     and   the    available   remedial\n\nalternatives.6   See, e.g., Clement v. Cal. Dep't of Corrections,\n\n364 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir. 2004). The constitutional violations\n\nhere are substantial in both scope and degree.           They have defied\n\ncorrection for more than two decades. The district court has tried\n\nmore conventional    measures,   but    found   them   wanting.     It   has\n\nafforded the Commonwealth ample opportunity to bring preexisting\n\nmechanisms up to speed or otherwise to correct the phalanx of\n\nproblems.   It has witnessed the Commonwealth's continued inability\n\nto cure the constitutional infirmities plaguing the delivery of\n\nhealth care in the correctional system.          This record of abject\n\nfailure matters in the narrowness-need-intrusiveness inquiry.            See\n\n\n\n     6\n      We reject out of hand the Secretary's argument that an order\nto privatize is a per se violation of the narrowness requirement of\nthe PLRA. The narrowness of a remedy necessarily involves a close\nexamination of a particular set of facts and a determination\nconcerning what steps are reasonable to cure the ongoing\nconstitutional violations.     Because this will necessarily be\ninfluenced by a variety of factors, we are wary of adopting\nironclad rules.\n\n                                 -25-\n\fBenjamin v. Fraser, 343 F.3d 35, 49 (2d Cir. 2003) (upholding\n\nnarrowness-need-intrusiveness findings \"in light of the district\n\ncourt's finding that the [defendant's] compliance with its remedial\n\nresponsibilities has been consistently incomplete and inadequate\").\n\n           The need for continued prospective injunctive relief is\n\npatent.   The lower court has been dealing with the deficiencies of\n\nPuerto Rico's correctional system since 1979, and we acknowledge\n\nthat the sheer passage of so much time counsels restraint in\n\nordering further extensions of prospective injunctive relief. See,\n\ne.g., Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Educ., 611 F.2d 1239, 1241\n\n(9th Cir. 1979).   However, the correctional system is sprawling,\n\nthe problems with which the court has had to grapple are massive,\n\nthe Commonwealth's acceptance of the need for reforms has ranged\n\nfrom inconsistent to grudging (witness the current state of affairs\n\nin which the AOC embraces privatization as the Secretary seeks to\n\ndismantle it), and progress has been correspondingly slow. Insofar\n\nas health care is concerned, the level of improvement still falls\n\nwell short of bringing serious violations into constitutional\n\ncompliance.    Morales IV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 323-31.       In some\n\nrespects, backsliding has occurred.   See id. at 324.   In light of\n\nthese facts, we have no difficulty affirming the district court's\n\nfinding that a need for ongoing injunctive relief exists.\n\n           We next consider the district court's findings regarding\n\nnarrow tailoring and lack of intrusiveness.   In 2003, the district\n\n\n                               -26-\n\fcourt was keenly aware of its duty to ensure that prospective\n\nremediation complies with the PLRA's requirements. See Morales IV,\n\n300   F.   Supp.    2d   at   331.   It     was,   however,   faced   with   a\n\nconstitutional crisis and only three proposed solutions:              turning\n\nback the health care clock to reinstate the system that had failed\n\nmiserably for two decades, placing the system into receivership, or\n\npersisting with the plan for privatization (which the parties had\n\nconceived and to which they originally had agreed). The status quo\n\nante alternative had proven to be ineffective, and, thus, was\n\nundesirable.       No one favored the receivership alternative.          That\n\nleft privatization. Against this mise-ên-scéne, we cannot say that\n\nthe lower court's choice of that alternative was unreasonable.\n\n            The Secretary nonetheless argues that privatization is\n\nmuch broader than necessary to forfend against cruel and unusual\n\ntreatment of inmates.         If this were the district court's first\n\nattempt at remediation, we quite likely would agree.                  But the\n\ndistrict court has attempted narrower, less intrusive alternatives\n\n— and those alternatives have failed to restore the constitutional\n\nbalance. For this reason, a more innovative remedy is justifiable.\n\nThe increased intrusiveness and broader scope of the privatization\n\nremedy is a direct response to the unique need created by the\n\nCommonwealth's own failure — for more than twenty years — to\n\ncorrect serious constitutional inadequacies.            Drastic times call\n\nfor drastic measures.\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\f            The Secretary has one final shot in his sling.                             He\n\nlaments    that       privatization    is    far     behind     schedule      and     has\n\naccomplished very little to date.                 Nevertheless, a great deal of\n\ntime, effort, and money has been spent in constructing facilities,\n\nprocuring    equipment,        creating     programs,     and    building       a   more\n\nresponsive infrastructure.            Perhaps more important, the CHSC has\n\ndeveloped a functional information technology system. Knowledge is\n\npower, and that platform seems reasonably likely to contribute\n\nmeasurably to the long-term success of the prison health care\n\nsystem.     It provides a means of maintaining accurate records and\n\nthus creating accountability. See, e.g., Carol Gentry, Health-Care\n\nFirms Face Costly Change, Wall St. J., Jan. 3, 2000, at A3 (\"By\n\nspeeding    up       the   transmission     and    improving     the       accuracy    of\n\ninformation, health plans should be able to do a better job of\n\nmonitoring the quality of care.\"); Laura Landro, Health Care Goes\n\nDigital:     Doctors and Hospitals Find They Can't Stay Offline Any\n\nLonger, Wall St. J., June 10, 2002, at R6 (\"There is a clear\n\nlinkage now between technology and better patient outcomes.\"). The\n\ndistrict court has cultivated this tree patiently and at great\n\nexpense, and it would be rash for us to insist that it be uprooted\n\njust when it shows promise of bearing fruit.\n\n            The        Secretary's     related       complaint         —     that     the\n\nineffectiveness of privatization to date defeats the finding of\n\nnarrowness       —    is   unpersuasive     for     two   reasons.           First,     a\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fdetermination of narrowness requires a court to decide whether\n\nordered relief is tailored to rectify existing constitutional\n\nviolations.      See Cason v. Seckinger, 231 F.3d 777, 784 (11th Cir.\n\n2000) (\"The court must make new findings about whether the relief\n\ncurrently       complies        with    the     need-narrowness-intrusiveness\n\nrequirements, given the nature of the current violations.\"); see\n\nalso Castillo v. Cameron County, 238 F.3d 339, 354 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\nWhether     a   remedy     is     capable     of   successfully      ameliorating\n\nconstitutional violations has no necessary correlation with whether\n\nit is narrowly drawn. Narrow relief can be completely ineffectual.\n\nSee Morales II, 13 F. Supp. 2d at 157-58 (noting the failure of\n\nlimited injunctive orders to bring the Puerto Rican correctional\n\nsystem into constitutional compliance).                 That the privatization\n\nconcept has been slow to come to fruition does nothing to prove\n\nthat the order is overly broad (or overly intrusive, for that\n\nmatter).\n\n            Second, we think that the PLRA is too blunt an instrument\n\nfor addressing this concern.            As said, the PLRA limits courts to\n\nterminating prospective relief.             Not every unforseen difficulty in\n\nimplementing injunctive decrees necessitates the total abandonment\n\nof a remedy.      It is true that the CHSC has lagged far behind the\n\noriginal schedule and that the corporation has, to date, not\n\naccomplished     its     ultimate      goals.      It   is   also   true   that   an\n\nineffective remedy is a cause for concern.                     In light of the\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\fsubstantial progress that has been made, however, the mere fact\n\nthat privatization is behind schedule does not convince us that it\n\nfails the narrowness-need-intrusiveness test.7\n\n          We are well aware that federal oversight of Puerto Rico's\n\ncorrectional system cannot — and should not — last forever.          We\n\nstrongly urge both the district court and the litigants to move the\n\nprivatization process forward with all practicable speed. For now,\n\nhowever, we conclude, based on the record evidence and the factual\n\nfindings of the district court, that the privatization order meets\n\nthe PLRA's requirements.   The privatization solution has not yet\n\nbeen put into practice and common sense dictates that it be given\n\na fair chance to work.     The order appealed from provides that\n\nchance.\n\n                   C.   The Evidentiary Hearing.\n\n          The Secretary's fallback position is that the district\n\ncourt committed reversible error in its manner of conducting the\n\nevidentiary hearing on the motion to terminate prospective relief.\n\nThis contention has four branches.       All of them are acarpous.\n\n          1.   Burden of Proof.    The Secretary first suggests that\n\nthe district court impermissibly shifted the burden of proof. This\n\nsuggestion derives primarily from the court's decision to order the\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      It may well be that modification, or some other more limited\nadjustment, is appropriate to address such concerns, see Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 60(b)(5) — but that issue is not before us.\n\n                                  -30-\n\fproof by directing the Secretary (rather than the inmate class) to\n\ncome forward, at the start of the hearing, with his evidence.\n\n            It is axiomatic that district courts enjoy wide latitude\n\nin matters concerning the ordering of proof and the presentation of\n\nevidence.   See, e.g., United States v. Holmquist, 36 F.3d 154, 163\n\n(1st Cir. 1994); Elgabri v. Lekas, 964 F.2d 1255, 1260 (1st Cir.\n\n1992); see also Fed. R. Evid. 611(a).            We review a trial court's\n\ndeterminations concerning the mode and order of proof for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Nat'l R.R. Pass. Corp. v. Certain Temporary Easements,\n\n357 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 2004).            We will reverse only if a\n\ndetermination has unfairly prejudiced the complaining party.               Id.\n\n            The decision to require the Secretary to present his\n\nproof first was not an abuse of discretion.             In arriving at its\n\ndecision on the motion to terminate, the court was free to rely on\n\nany aspect of the record that tended to shed light on whether\n\nconstitutional violations persisted.         See Laaman v. Warden, N.H.\n\nState Prison, 238 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting that the\n\ncourt's familiarity with the record and its receipt of periodic\n\nreports may afford it \"comprehensive knowledge of whether a prison\n\nis, or is not, continuing to violate the consent decree\").            At the\n\nbeginning   of   the   hearing,   the    court    had   before   it   a   full\n\nevidentiary record, developed over many years, together with a\n\ncache of periodic reports as to progress under the consent decree.\n\nThis plethoric evidence was sufficient, if unrebutted, to support\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\fa finding that constitutional violations endured.     With this in\n\nmind, it was sensible for the court to invite the Secretary to\n\noffer evidence to the contrary.\n\n          To be sure, a trial court's authority to regulate the\n\norder of proof does not include the power to shift the burden of\n\nproof.   Brown Daltas & Assocs., Inc. v. Gen. Accid. Ins. Co., 48\n\nF.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 1995) (reversing a judgment because the trial\n\ncourt erroneously shifted the burden of proof); see also 9 J.\n\nWigmore, Evidence § 2489 (J. Chadbourn ed. 1981).   But that is not\n\nwhat happened here:   the court's election to hear the Secretary's\n\nevidence first in no way betokened reallocation of the burden of\n\nproof.   In its subsequent review of the evidence, the court said\n\nnothing that indicated any misunderstanding as to where the burden\n\nof proof rested.   Rather, it supportably determined that the facts\n\npresented by the Secretary lacked sufficient probative force to\n\nblunt the thrust of the accumulated evidence of record.    Morales\n\nIV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 339-40 (relying on the Secretary's own\n\nevidence to find continuing constitutional violations).   In short,\n\nthe contention that the lower court impermissibly shifted the\n\nburden of proof has no footing in the record.\n\n          2.   The Agreement Between the Parties.    The Secretary\n\nnext maintains that the district court erred by relying on the\n\nexistence of a \"private agreement\" (by private agreement, he means\n\nthe stipulation that was signed in 1997 by, inter alios, his\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fpredecessor in office).   Specifically, the Secretary asserts that\n\nthe fact that there was an agreement between the parties should\n\nhave had no bearing on the continuing viability of the subsequent\n\norder approving privatization (entered in 1998).    This assertion\n\noverlooks that the so-called private agreement was embodied in a\n\nstipulation presented to and adopted by the district court.    Upon\n\nits adoption, the private agreement became a judicially enforceable\n\nconsent decree.   Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins, 124 S. Ct. 899, 903\n\n(2004) (\"A consent decree embodies an agreement of the parties and\n\nis also an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be\n\nreflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is\n\nsubject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and\n\ndecrees.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); In re Pearson, 990\n\nF.2d 653, 658 (1st Cir. 1993) (similar).\n\n          This is significant because the Secretary's argument\n\nblurs the crucial distinction, for PLRA purposes, between private\n\nside agreements and consent decrees.    The latter may serve as a\n\nvehicle for prospective relief under the PLRA; the former may not.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a); see also id. § 3626(c)(1).\n\n          In all events, the lower court did not rely impermissibly\n\non the parties' original agreement.    Although the court noted the\n\nexistence of that agreement and scolded the Secretary for trying to\n\nrenege on it, the holding in Morales IV was in no way premised\n\neither on an estoppel or on the fact that the parties previously\n\n\n                               -33-\n\fhad agreed to explore a privatization alternative.             For these\n\nreasons, the Secretary's argument fails.\n\n            3.    The Exclusion of Evidence.        The Secretary also\n\ncontends that the district court erred in refusing to allow him to\n\nintroduce     evidence   as   to   the    narrowness-need-intrusiveness\n\ncriteria.     On this point, as is so often true in litigation,\n\ncontext is decisive.\n\n            After the Secretary had presented his evidence as to the\n\nexistence vel non of continuing constitutional violations, the\n\ndistrict court asked him to summarize the evidence that he planned\n\nto adduce on the narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria.               The\n\nSecretary proceeded to make an offer of proof.         Having heard the\n\nproffer, the court determined that nothing in it bore directly upon\n\nthe narrowness of, need for, or potential intrusiveness of the\n\nprivatization     remedy.     Consequently,   the   court   rejected   the\n\nSecretary's offer of proof on relevancy grounds.\n\n            We descry no error.    In many instances, relevancy boils\n\ndown to a judgment call.      See generally Fed. R. Evid. 401 (deeming\n\nevidence relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of\n\nany fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\n\nmore probable or less probable than it would be without the\n\nevidence\").      Accordingly, district courts enjoy wide latitude in\n\ndetermining the relevancy vel non of evidence. Laaman, 238 F.3d at\n\n18-19; United States v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 387 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fIn this instance, the district court concluded that the offer of\n\nproof had no bearing on the appropriateness of the remedy under the\n\nPLRA's narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria.       Morales IV, 300 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 337-38.     Having reviewed the offer of proof, we find\n\nthat this ruling was within the realm of the district court's\n\ndiscretion.      We explain briefly.\n\n          By way of his offer of proof, the Secretary proposed to\n\nintroduce evidence designed to show the ineffectiveness of the\n\nremedy.   He began the proffer by alleging generally that the non-\n\nprofit corporation was not a viable remedy because it had not yet\n\ntreated   a   single   patient.     The   district   court   asked   for\n\nelaboration, and the Secretary expressed a desire to take discovery\n\non the matter.    Morales IV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 337.   When the court\n\nrefused that untimely request, the only details proffered by the\n\nSecretary tended to show that the CHSC was not complying with\n\neither the district court orders or Puerto Rico laws, and that it\n\nwas not ready to begin treating patients.      Id. at 338.    This is a\n\ndistinct line of inquiry. See Hadix v. Johnson, 228 F.3d 662, 673\n\n(6th Cir. 2000) (explaining that inquiries into compliance and\n\ninquiries into necessity under the PLRA are separate and distinct).\n\nAs the district court sagely noted, compliance was not at issue in\n\nthe evidentiary hearing.     Morales IV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 338.\n\n          We — like the district court — do not see how the\n\nSecretary's offer of proof informs a determination of whether the\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\fprivatization remedy is a narrowly tailored, relatively unintrusive\n\nresponse to the serious constitutional violations that the district\n\ncourt found still existed.          We note, moreover, that the Secretary\n\nhas not explained the connection.               We thus cannot fault the\n\ndistrict court either for the rejection of the offer of proof or\n\nfor its consequent exclusion of the proffered evidence.\n\n             4.    Rule 52(c).   Finally, the Secretary assigns error to\n\nthe     district    court's   use   of   Fed.   R.    Civ.   P.   52(c)   as    an\n\nadjudicative tool.       See Morales IV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 344.           Rule\n\n52(c) provides a court conducting a bench trial with a means for\n\nissuing a judgment on partial findings.              The rule is designed for\n\nuse when \"a party has been fully heard on an issue and the court\n\nfinds against the party on that issue.\"              Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c).\n\n             The district court invoked that procedure here.                   The\n\nSecretary asseverates that this was not permissible on the facts of\n\nthis case.     We reject this asseveration.\n\n             To be frank, we find the Secretary's argument difficult\n\nto fathom.        The text of the rule is clear.             When a party has\n\nfinished presenting evidence and that evidence is deemed by the\n\ntrier    insufficient to sustain the party's position, the court need\n\nnot waste time, but, rather, may call a halt to the proceedings and\n\nenter judgment accordingly.           See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52 advisory\n\ncommittee note (\"Subdivision (c) . . . authorizes the court to enter\n\njudgment at any time that it can appropriately make a dispositive\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\ffinding of fact on the evidence.\"); see also Atl. Track & Turnout\n\nCo. v. Perini Corp., 989 F.2d 541 (1st Cir. 1993).          The fact that\n\nthe inmate class had the burden of proof did not place Rule 52(c)\n\noff limits.       A judgment under Rule 52(c) can be entered for or\n\nagainst either a plaintiff or a defendant, regardless of the\n\nallocation of the burden of proof.        See Bursztajn v. United States,\n\n367 F.3d 485, 488 (5th Cir. 2004); Fed. Refin. Co., 352 F.3d at 26;\n\nsee also 9A Wright & Miller, supra § 2573.1.\n\n           Here, the Secretary had advanced his proof and the\n\ndistrict court supportably concluded that the Secretary's evidence\n\ncould not withstand the probative force of the historical record.\n\nIn other words, even after taking the Secretary's case into account,\n\nthe court determined that the plaintiffs had sustained their burden\n\nof showing pervasive and persistent constitutional violations.\n\nMorales IV, 300 F. Supp. 2d at 340-42.        The court also supportably\n\ndetermined that the privatization remedy satisfied the narrowness-\n\nneed-intrusiveness criteria, and that the Secretary's offer of proof\n\ndid not include any relevant evidence to the contrary.              Based on\n\nthese findings, the district court appropriately entered judgment\n\npursuant to Rule 52(c). That the court made a series of credibility\n\ncalls in reaching these conclusions in no way detracts from the\n\nlegitimacy of its approach.      See Wright & Miller, supra § 2573.1,\n\nat 497-99 (noting that the court's task under Rule 52(c) is to weigh\n\nthe   evidence,    without   drawing   any   special   inferences    in   the\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\fnonmovant's favor, resolve any conflicts in the evidence, and\n\n\"decide for itself where the preponderance lies\").\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We are sensitive both to Congress's manifest desire to\n\nlimit federal judicial oversight of state correctional systems and\n\nto the length of time that Puerto Rico's prisons have been under\n\nfederal hegemony.   These concerns impel us to counsel the parties\n\nand the district court to move forward as swiftly as possible to\n\ncross the threshold of constitutional adequacy so that federal\n\njudicial involvement may cease.   For now, however, we accept the\n\nwell-documented judgment of the district court — a court intimately\n\nacquainted with the details of this litigation and the intricacies\n\nof the Puerto Rican correctional system — that inmate health care\n\nremains constitutionally unacceptable and that the privatization\n\nremedy holds promise for bringing inmate health care into compliance\n\nwith constitutionally mandated standards.8   Consequently, we reject\n\nthe Secretary's current effort to vacate or terminate the existing\n\nconsent decree.\n\n           We add a few words of caution. There are now significant\n\nfinancial reserves (in the form of accumulated fines) available for\n\nimprovements in health care delivery, and the AOC seems willing to\n\n\n\n      8\n      Should the circumstances change, or a substantial interval\npass without significant progress, the Secretary is, of course,\nfree to ask the lower court to reexamine these findings and\nreconsider the advisability of the ordered relief.\n\n                               -38-\n\fwork for change.       We urge the district court to move toward\n\nextricating itself from the toils of this litigation as soon as it\n\ncan do so without defaulting on its responsibilities under the\n\nConstitution.\n\n           We need go no further.        For the foregoing reasons, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of the Secretary's motion to\n\nvacate or terminate the pertinent portions of the existing consent\n\ndecree.   We take no view of the district court's procedural order,\n\nsee supra Part II, as we lack jurisdiction to review that order on\n\nthis interlocutory appeal.\n\n\n\n           Affirmed.     Costs   shall    be   taxed   in   favor   of   the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\f",

The iteration now before us focuses on prospective injunctive relief ordered by the district court in 1998 (the centerpiece of which is the proposed privatization of medical and mental health care throughout the correctional system). Despite his predecessor's enthusiastic assent to that arrangement, the Commonwealth's Secretary of Health (the Secretary), acting in his official capacity, sought five years later to vacate or terminate the consent decree embodying that relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court rejected that initiative. <i>Morales Feliciano v. Calderon Serra,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d 321 (D.P.R.2004) (<i>Morales IV</i>). The Secretary now attacks this decision on several fronts. He asserts, inter alia, that the court acted ultra vires; that the court's 1998 order was void ab initio for failure to meet the requirements of section 802 of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-66, &#167; 802 (1996), <i>codified at</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626; and that in all events, the order should be terminated because the district court's supportive factfinding was clearly erroneous and infected by errors of law. As a fallback, he argues that the district court bungled the evidentiary hearing and that, at a bare minimum, the matter should be remanded for reconsideration. Finding these importunings unpersuasive, we affirm the decision below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the long and tortuous history of this litigation &#8212; two years ago, we acknowledged that \"the lore of this case is Byzantine,\" <i>Morales Feliciano v. Rullan,</i> 303 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2002) (<i>Morales III</i>) &#8212; we confine our introductory comments to those events that are most directly germane to this appeal. The shelves of any well-stocked law library will satisfy the appetites of readers who hunger for more exegetic detail. <i>See, e.g., Morales III,</i> 303 F.3d 1; <i>Morales-Feliciano v. Parole Bd.,</i> 887 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1989); <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d 321; <i>Morales Feliciano v. Rossello Gonzalez,</i> 124 F.Supp.2d 774 (D.P.R.2000); <i>Morales Feliciano v.

Romero Barcelo,</i> 497 F.Supp. 14 (D.P.R.1979) (<i>Morales I</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 1970s, a group of prison inmates initiated a class action alleging \"dire shortcomings in virtually every aspect of prisoner confinement\" in the Puerto Rican correctional system. <i>Morales III,</i> 303 F.3d at 3. The district court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits and issued preliminary injunctive relief. <i>Morales I,</i> 497 F.Supp. at 39-41. The defendants made little progress and the district court, in March of 1986, appointed a monitor. <i>See Morales III,</i> 303 F.3d at 3; <i>Morales Feliciano v. Romero Barcelo,</i> 672 F.Supp. at 621. The court charged the monitor with studying various elements of the correctional system and recommending remedial action. With the monitor's assistance, the court became more proactive and issued a torrent of orders, including temporary restrainers and contempt citations. The court thereafter imposed multimillion dollar fines for the most egregious failures to comply with its directives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, the court ordered the implementation of medical and mental health care plans recommended by the monitor. These plans transferred the primary responsibility for medical and mental health care in the correctional system from the Administrator of Corrections (the AOC) to the Secretary. The plans also required that the Secretary employ for a minimum of three years a chief health care coordinator (the CHCC) who would bear responsibility for easing the transition and coordinating compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over time, prison conditions improved. In 1996, the district court entered a partial final judgment that settled several disputed issues and urged attempts at consensus-based compliance efforts as to other issues. Despite improvements in many areas, the delivery of medical and mental health care lagged behind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 1997, a court-appointed expert found the existing health care programs incapable of meeting constitutional standards and suggested, as an alternative, the appointment of a receiver. The parties (who, over a quarter of a century, have agreed on little else) unanimously opposed this recommendation. They suggested instead the formation of a private non-profit corporation to provide medical and mental health services to the inmate population. On September 26, 1997, the parties drafted, executed, and filed a stipulation embodying this consensus. Under the terms of the stipulation, a non-profit corporation was to be formed. The corporation would be structured to provide health care services, consistent with the 1990 plan, to all individuals held in institutions operated by the AOC. The stipulation pledged the parties' full cooperation, required the Secretary and the AOC to lay the groundwork for a transition, and offered to subject the process of privatization to the supervision of the district court. Finally, the stipulation memorialized the parties' agreement to engage in further discussions concerning the role and authority of the CHCC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court endorsed the stipulation and, thus, assumed ownership of the privatization plan that had been conceived by the parties. <i>See Morales III,</i> 303 F.3d at 3-4; <i>see also Morales II,</i> 13 F.Supp.2d at 212-14 (justifying the adoption of the privatization remedy by elaborating on the grave constitutional deficiencies that continued to haunt the existing programs). The order, as it pertains to this appeal, has retained its original substance. The non-profit entity, known as the Correctional Health Services Corporation (the CHSC), has been formed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties and the district court envisioned the CHSC as a key piece of the privatization machinery. Withal, the CHSC was intended as a transitional device rather than as the exclusive provider of inmate health care services in perpetuity. The parties expected that within a few years of its full implementation, the CHSC would compete with private health care providers for contracts to furnish health care services to those persons held in the AOC's custody. This expectation remains in force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CHSC has a checkered history. Originally, the parties hoped that it would begin to function as early as July 1, 1998, and become fully operational as a provider of health care to the inmate population by the end of that year. That prediction proved wildly optimistic. Although the district court, using accrued fines, has made substantial funding available to the CHSC &#8212; as of the date of the district court's decision, roughly $55,000,000 had been spent on the privatization solution &#8212; this monetary infusion has not yet brought the project to fruition. While the CHSC has made substantial progress toward reaching its stated goals, the pace has been much slower than anticipated. To this point, the CHSC has developed an administrative infrastructure, fashioned an impressive set of substantive programs, and constructed needed facilities. As a result, it has begun contributing to the management of payroll, staff assignments, inventory, purchasing, billing, and financing. The CHSC's achievements in formulating substantive programs include the creation of an electronic database for health records, patient tracking, and the keeping of appointments; the design of a telemedicine program to enable remote diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illnesses; and the training of personnel to maximize the efficacy of these (and other) programs. The CHSC also has improved the quality of the facilities and equipment dedicated to the provision of inmate health care. In the same vein, it has purchased and installed computers at most of the institutions operated by the AOC. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; it is in the process of developing a new acute care hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without in any way minimizing either the value or extent of these accomplishments, it is evident that the CHSC has lagged far behind the timetable that its proponents originally envisioned. Part of the reason is that court supervision has made the process cumbersome (for example, lengthy periods of time have been consumed in the submission and approval of budget proposals). Other factors, such as snail's-pace negotiations with outside contractors, false starts, and resistance to change, have contributed to the delay. Though this lag time may have been unavoidable, the fact remains that, to this date, not a single patient has been treated by the CHSC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 1, 2003, the Secretary, emphasizing this protracted period of delay and the mounting costs of completing the necessary infrastructure, filed a motion under the PLRA to vacate or terminate the privatization component of the extant consent decree. The plaintiffs cross-moved to modify the medical and mental health plans by terminating sections of the decree that assigned the primary responsibility for inmate health care to the Secretary. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 342-43. The cross-motion went unopposed and the district court granted it. <i>Id.</i> at 343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an evidentiary hearing on the main motion, the court found that pervasive and persistent constitutional violations continued to shackle the delivery of health care in Puerto Rico's correctional system. <i>Id.</i> at 323-31. The court also found that the contemplated relief &#8212; privatization &#8212; satisfied the requirements of the PLRA. <i>Id.</i> at 331-38. Accordingly, the court upheld the challenged portion of the consent decree and directed the AOC to meet with the plaintiff class and submit a further plan for achieving constitutional compliance. <i>Id.</i> at 344-45. The Secretary now appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by clarifying the extent of our jurisdiction. It is beyond serious question that we have jurisdiction over the main elements of this appeal. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1) (conferring jurisdiction over interlocutory orders refusing to terminate injunctions). The Secretary, however, has also attempted to raise a tangential issue. With regard to that issue, appellate jurisdiction is more problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances are as follows. As part of its ruling below, the district court ordered the AOC to \"meet [with the plaintiff class] and file with the Court within forty-five (45) days... a plan on how the [AOC] will assume his legal responsibility to provide health care to inmates.\" <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 345. The Secretary asserts that this order, ex proprio vigore, violates the PLRA and contravenes Supreme Court precedent regarding limitations on the power of federal courts to enforce state law against state officers. <i>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman,</i> 465 U.S. 89, 117, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (\"[A] federal suit against state officials on the basis of state law contravenes the Eleventh Amendment when ... the relief sought and ordered has an impact directly on the State itself.\"). We cannot reach the merits of these claims for we have no jurisdiction over them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result is largely dictated by the rationale of our decision in a prior phase of this seemingly endless litigation. In <i>Morales III,</i> we ruled that an order that \"was within the lower court's reserved power to establish procedures for compliance with the court's earlier decrees\" was not immediately appealable. 303 F.3d at 10. That reasoning is apposite here. A necessary correlate of the lower court's duty to supervise the ongoing process of privatization is the power to issue subsidiary orders in aid of that objective. We thus have no jurisdiction to entertain an interlocutory appeal from this portion of the court's decision (or even to consider the plaintiffs' contention that the Secretary lacks standing to register such a protest).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We proceed to examine the remainder of the Secretary's asseverational array. He has loosed a scattershot attack. Only four of his claims are worthy of extended discussion, namely, (i) that the lower court lacked general equitable power to grant a privatization remedy; (ii) that the PLRA mandates vacation of the 1998 order as void ab initio; (iii) that, after almost five years of wheel-spinning, the PLRA now mandates termination of the prospective relief; and (iv) that the court repeatedly erred in the course of the evidentiary hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We address these issues (some of which have subparts) sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>General Equitable Powers.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's first broadside need not detain us. He posits that the relief ordered here is an invalid exercise of federal equitable power. Because this argument presents a purely legal issue, it engenders de novo review. <i>See Sunshine Dev., Inc. v. FDIC,</i> 33 F.3d 106, 111 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that this argument quite likely is by the boards. The Secretary's predecessor in office stipulated to the privatization remedy, and there is no claim that he lacked authority to do so. Normally, that would constitute a waiver, which would prevent the Secretary from making this argument altogether.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Secretary is not bound by his predecessor's acquiescence &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; the Secretary did not present this argument to the district court and attempts to raise it for the first time on appeal. \"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, [he] may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\" <i>United States v. Slade,</i> 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1992). At the least, then, the argument is forfeited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nonetheless inquire briefly into the merits, as forfeited arguments (unlike waived arguments) ordinarily warrant review for plain error. <i>Gomez v. Rivera Rodriguez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 118 (1st Cir.2003). That type of review \"entails four showings: (1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the [appellant's] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary concedes that injunctions &#8212; like this one &#8212; that have been issued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 are limited only by the court's inherent equitable powers. <i>See, e.g., Giles v. Harris,</i> 189 U.S. 475, 486, 23 S.Ct. 639, 47 L.Ed. 909 (1903) (Holmes, J.). He insists, however, that a federal court's equitable powers are restricted to the remedies that were available in equity in 1789 (at the time of the passage of the First Judiciary Act). This proposition is a correct statement of the law, <i>see Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc.,</i> 527 U.S. 308, 318-19, 119 S.Ct. 1961, 144 L.Ed.2d 319 (1999), but the Secretary's application of it fails plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the Secretary characterizes privatization as \"a fairly recent endeavor\" and claims, therefore, that there is no reasonable basis for holding that court-imposed privatization of duties ordinarily ascribed to the government is within the district court's armamentarium. Appellant's Br. at 29. If this crabbed view reflected the state of the law, equitable remedies would be frozen in time and new remedial applications could never be developed to meet contemporary needs. The view, however, is fundamentally at odds with the core principle that equity must evolve over time \"in order to meet the requirements of every case, and to satisfy the needs of a progressive social condition in which new primary rights and duties are constantly arising and new kinds of wrongs are constantly committed.\" <i>Union Pac. Ry. Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac. Ry. Co.,</i> 163 U.S. 564, 601, 16 S.Ct. 1173, 41 L.Ed. 265 (1896).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with this principle, the Supreme Court has made clear that the inquiry into the availability of equitable relief in a particular case focuses upon whether the <i>general manner</i> of relief sought was available at equity in 1789. <i>See Grupo Mexicano,</i> 527 U.S. at 322, 119 S.Ct. 1961. This inquiry is informed by a recognition that equity is flexible and that the boundaries of permissible relief are broad. <i>Id.</i> Thus, the relevant question is not whether a specific application of relief was available in 1789, but, rather, whether that general type of relief was available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the answer to that question is affirmative. At bottom, the endorsed anodyne &#8212; privatization &#8212; calls for relief in the nature of a mandatory injunction, and injunctive relief is a classic equitable remedy. <i>Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson,</i> 534 U.S. 204, 211 n. 1, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635 (2002); <i>Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs.,</i> 508 U.S. 248, 256, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993); <i>Griggs v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 237 F.3d 371, 384 (4th Cir.2001). A survey of contemporary applications of this rule supports this conclusion. Courts consistently have upheld relief in equity notwithstanding the fact that the particular remedial application was not available in 1789. School busing orders exemplify this point. <i>See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,</i> 402 U.S. 1, 30, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); <i>Morgan v. Kerrigan,</i> 530 F.2d 401, 414-15 (1st Cir.1976). If the Secretary's argument were sound, all such orders would be beyond the equitable power of a federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that a federal district court, faced with pervasive and persistent constitutional violations, has not only the power but also the duty to render a decree that will, insofar as is possible, return matters to a constitutionally acceptable level. While the privatization remedy constitutes extraordinary relief and can be justified in only the most exceptional circumstances, the <i>nature</i> of the remedy is no different than that of a garden-variety mandatory injunction. Seen in this light, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error in determining that it had the authority to approve and implement a privatization remedy jointly proposed by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Compliance with the PLRA.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA, partially in an effort to curb the involvement of the federal judiciary in day-to-day prison management. <i>See</i> 141 Cong. Rec. 13,319 (1995) (statement of Sen. Abraham); <i>id.</i> at 14,418 (statement of Sen. Hatch). This ambient intent must guide our interpretation of the statutory text. <i>See Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d 649, 655 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PLRA establishes standards for the entry and termination of all prospective relief in civil actions challenging prison conditions. <i>See Miller v. French,</i> 530 U.S. 327, 333, 120 S.Ct. 2246, 147 L.Ed.2d 326 (2000). The term \"prospective relief\" encompasses \"all relief other than compensatory monetary damages.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(g)(7). The statute requires that prospective relief \"shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3626(a)(1). It further provides that a federal court \"shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\" <i>Id.</i> A party is entitled to immediate termination of any relief that has been granted in the absence of findings as to these criteria. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3626(b)(2). Conversely, however, prospective relief \"shall not terminate if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief [meets the above requirements].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3626(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statutory backdrop provides the setting for the Secretary's next challenge to the propriety of the privatization order. This challenge has three foci, each spawned by the PLRA. We deal with them in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Validity of the 1998 Order.</i> The Secretary first argues that, when originally entered in 1998, the order approving privatization did not meet the PLRA's requirements and, thus, \"must be set aside without further consideration.\" Appellant's Br. at 31. Because the district court did not make the findings specifically required by the PLRA coincident with the entry of its 1998 order, the Secretary's thesis runs, the order was void ab initio.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's thesis hinges on the premise that when prospective relief does not meet the PLRA's requirements at the moment of issuance, the decree is void without reference to the statutory termination procedure. On this premise, the termination procedure applies only to (i) prospective relief entered before the effective date of the PLRA and (ii) prospective relief entered after that date which is accompanied by the requisite narrowness-need-intrusiveness findings. Prospective relief entered after the PLRA's effective date but unaccompanied by narrowness-need-intrusiveness findings is simply void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no textual support for the Secretary's position. He relies on the mandatory language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(a), which states that \"[t]he court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief\" in the absence of specific findings. But this subsection sets forth the standard district courts must follow when determining whether prospective relief <i>not yet ordered</i> is permitted by the PLRA. <i>Gilmore v. California,</i> 220 F.3d 987, 999 (9th Cir.2000) (\"If prospective relief has already been granted by a court, &#167; 3626(b) controls.\"). Here, however, privatization constitutes the status quo (and the Secretary advanced no PLRA-based argument at the time that privatization was originally approved).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only authority cited by the Secretary &#8212; <i>Rouse</i> &#8212; does not support his point of view. He asserts that <i>Rouse</i> drew a distinction between orders issued prior to the enactment of the PLRA and those issued subsequent thereto. That is incorrect. <i>Rouse</i> drew a distinction between \"existing federal court orders\" and those \"not yet obtained.\" 129 F.3d at 654. That distinction contradicts the position that the Secretary advocates in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that the procedure limned in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(b) applies to any existing prospective relief, regardless of when that relief was first ordered. <i>See Miller,</i> 530 U.S. at 333, 120 S.Ct. 2246 (stating that section 3626(b) applies to \"existing injunctions\"); <i>Harvey v. Schoen,</i> 245 F.3d 718, 720 (8th Cir.2001) (holding that prospective relief made \"in the absence of the required findings\" is immediately terminable \"regardless of when ordered\"); <i>see also Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 654 (suggesting that the termination procedures set forth in section 3626(b) apply to all existing federal court orders).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since privatization is required by a preexisting court order, the situation is controlled by subsection (b), not subsection (a). <i>See Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 654. That makes a significant difference. Nothing in subsection (b) or in its legislative history speaks of <i>vacating</i> consent decrees but only of <i>terminating</i> them. That linguistic shift has practical consequences. \"While terminating a consent decree strips it of future potency, the decree's past puissance is preserved....\" <i>Id.</i> at 662.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That gets the grease from the goose. Although 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(b) entitles a defendant to termination of existing prospective relief ordered in the absence of the requisite findings, that proviso excepts cases in which the court supportably finds that the particular form of prospective relief remains at the time of the challenge narrowly tailored, necessary, and relatively unintrusive. <i>See id.; see also Guajardo v. Tex. Dep't of Crim. Justice,</i> 363 F.3d 392, 394 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam). There is no time limitation present in section 3626(b)(2), nor does its language suggest that it reaches only those orders issued prior to the PLRA's effective date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, section 3626(b) provides that any order made in the absence of the required findings is subject to \"immediate termination.\" This word choice is significant. <i>See Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 662. The verb \"terminate\" means \"to put an end to\" or \"to end.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1482 (7th ed., 1999). If Congress had intended that orders issued in the absence of the required findings be void ab initio, it would almost certainly have chosen a phrase such as \"void.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the PLRA grants the Secretary a right to move for the termination of prospective relief. The PLRA does not, however, confer any right to argue, five years after the fact, that an order should be deemed void ab initio for lack of contemporaneous findings. Therefore, this aspect of the Secretary's challenge founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Constitutional Violations.</i> Upon a motion to terminate prospective injunctive relief under the PLRA, a court may continue the relief only if it supportably finds that there are ongoing constitutional violations. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(b). The district court purposed to make such findings in this instance. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 323-31, 342. The Secretary counters that the record does not show infirmities sufficient to justify ongoing relief and that the district court's contrary findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An inquiry into whether current prison conditions constitute an ongoing violation of a federal right \"comprises a mixed question of fact and law, the answer to which we review along a degree-of-deference continuum, ranging from plenary review for law-dominated questions to clear-error review for fact-dominated questions.\" <i>Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 661. Here, the question is fact-intensive &#8212; the Secretary frontally challenges the lower court's factfinding &#8212; so our standard of review is deferential. <i>See id.; see also Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc.,</i> 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1992) (admonishing that appellate courts should respect the trial court's findings of fact unless convinced, after a careful review of the record, that a mistake has been made). If there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them must be respected. <i>See Fed. Refin. Co. v. Klock,</i> 352 F.3d 16, 29 (1st Cir.2003). The lower court's factual findings easily pass muster under this deferential standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have painstakingly reviewed the record and examined the numerous findings of fact, mindful that a trial court generally is considered the most informed interpreter of its own prior rulings and findings. <i>See Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 661. In this instance, the court was very careful to update the record and to consider the ways in which conditions had changed since its original endorsement of the privatization concept. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 323-31. The court painted a compelling, record-rooted picture of how and in what respects health care for inmates in Puerto Rican prisons remains constitutionally deficient. <i>See id.</i> On this grim record, it is simply implausible to suggest that these findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court characterized the denial of medical and mental health services as \"massive and systematic.\" <i>Id.</i> at 324. That characterization seems apt. No useful purpose would be served by rehearsing the court's findings in minute detail. We offer instead a few of the more glaring examples. As of 2003, one-fourth of all inmates who requested sick call did not get it; only 55% of all ambulatory care appointments actually took place; only 49% of specialist consultations deemed necessary for serious conditions were arranged; as a rule, medically prescribed diets for inmates were habitually ignored; only 31.3% of inmates who had been diagnosed HIV-positive were receiving treatment; and inmate mortality rates were rising. <i>See id.</i> at 323-31. These are but the tip of a particularly unattractive iceberg. Despite the CHSC's efforts, physical facilities for inmate health care remain inadequate and there is an acute shortage of psychiatric expertise. <i>See id.</i> at 326-27, 331. Basic health care is critical to maintaining a decent quality of life, and Puerto Rico's correctional system is not delivering a constitutionally acceptable level of health care to its captive population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that in the course of making these findings, the district court largely disregarded the testimony of the Secretary's expert witness as lacking in credibility. Although the Secretary complains bitterly about this rejection, it is hornbook law that matters of credibility are ordinarily for the court of first instance, not for the appellate court. <i>Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.2004). Unless the record mandates a contrary finding &#8212; and this record most assuredly does not &#8212; the court of appeals ought not disturb a trial court's credibility determination. <i>See Anthony v. Sundlun,</i> 952 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir.1991); <i>see also</i> 9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2586 (2d ed.1994) (collecting cases). Here, moreover, there is much to commend the district court's assessment of the witness's dubious credibility (for example, the witness provided haphazard and inconsistent testimony and, on cross-examination, withdrew or corrected a myriad of statements).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary accurately observes that some noteworthy advances have been made in the delivery of health care to inmates. He overlooks, however, that notwithstanding these improvements, the district court found substantial deficiencies attendant to virtually every aspect of the inmate health care system. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 324. However laudable the advances may be, the district court's supportable finding that constitutional violations persist suffices to satisfy the requirements of the PLRA and to justify a comprehensive injunctive decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this subject would be supererogatory. We hold, without serious question, that the district court's findings and conclusions about the incidence of continuing constitutional violations are adequately anchored in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Narrowness-Need-Intrusiveness Findings.</i> The PLRA mandates \"the termination of extant consent decrees altogether unless the district court makes the specific findings that are necessary to keep a particular decree alive.\" <i>Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 655. In addition to ongoing constitutional violations, this compendium includes a finding that the ordered relief satisfies the statutory narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(b). The district court made such findings here. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 342. The Secretary argues that the facts of this case, as found, require termination of the decree because the chosen remedy &#8212; privatization &#8212; does not meet the narrowness, need, and intrusiveness requirements delineated in the PLRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress plainly intended the PLRA to operate as a mechanism that would decrease federal judicial involvement in prison administration. <i>See Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 655. Congress left room, however, for needed injunctive relief. The Secretary's insistence that Congress did not want courts involved in prison administration begs the real question &#8212; which is whether a particular set of facts, measured under the statutorily specified criteria, warrants continued judicial involvement. We think that this is a close call in the case at hand, but for the time being, we find supportable the district court's conclusions regarding narrowness, need, and lack of intrusiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria are, to some extent, self-explicating. The devil is in the details attendant to their application. The application of those criteria is case-specific and must be undertaken in light of both the magnitude of existing constitutional violations and the available remedial alternatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See, e.g., Clement v. Cal. Dep't of Corrections,</i> 364 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.2004). The constitutional violations here are substantial in both scope and degree. They have defied correction for more than two decades. The district court has tried more conventional measures, but found them wanting. It has afforded the Commonwealth ample opportunity to bring preexisting mechanisms up to speed or otherwise to correct the phalanx of problems. It has witnessed the Commonwealth's continued inability to cure the constitutional infirmities plaguing the delivery of health care in the correctional system. This record of abject failure matters in the narrowness-need-intrusiveness inquiry. <i>See Benjamin v. Fraser,</i> 343 F.3d 35, 49 (2d Cir.2003) (upholding narrowness-need-intrusiveness findings \"in light of the district court's finding that the [defendant's] compliance with its remedial responsibilities has been consistently incomplete and inadequate\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for continued prospective injunctive relief is patent. The lower court has been dealing with the deficiencies of Puerto Rico's correctional system since 1979, and we acknowledge that the sheer passage of so much time counsels restraint in ordering further extensions of prospective injunctive relief. <i>See, e.g., Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Educ.,</i> 611 F.2d 1239, 1241 (9th Cir.1979). However, the correctional system is sprawling, the problems with which the court has had to grapple are massive, the Commonwealth's acceptance of the need for reforms has ranged from inconsistent to grudging (witness the current state of affairs in which the AOC embraces privatization as the Secretary seeks to dismantle it), and progress has been correspondingly slow. Insofar as health care is concerned, the level of improvement still falls well short of bringing serious violations into constitutional compliance. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 323-31. In some respects, backsliding has occurred. <i>See id.</i> at 324. In light of these facts, we have no difficulty affirming the district court's finding that a need for ongoing injunctive relief exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider the district court's findings regarding narrow tailoring and lack of intrusiveness. In 2003, the district court was keenly aware of its duty to ensure that prospective remediation complies with the PLRA's requirements. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 331. It was, however, faced with a constitutional crisis and only three proposed solutions: turning back the health care clock to reinstate the system that had failed miserably for two decades, placing the system into receivership, or persisting with the plan for privatization (which the parties had conceived and to which they originally had agreed). The status quo ante alternative had proven to be ineffective, and, thus, was undesirable. No one favored the receivership alternative. That left privatization. Against this mise-en-scene, we cannot say that the lower court's choice of that alternative was unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary nonetheless argues that privatization is much broader than necessary to forfend against cruel and unusual treatment of inmates. If this were the district court's first attempt at remediation, we quite likely would agree. But the district court has attempted narrower, less intrusive alternatives &#8212; and those alternatives have failed to restore the constitutional balance. For this reason, a more innovative remedy is justifiable. The increased intrusiveness and broader scope of the privatization remedy is a direct response to the unique need created by the Commonwealth's own failure &#8212; for more than twenty years &#8212; to correct serious constitutional inadequacies. Drastic times call for drastic measures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary has one final shot in his sling. He laments that privatization is far behind schedule and has accomplished very little to date. Nevertheless, a great deal of time, effort, and money has been spent in constructing facilities, procuring equipment, creating programs, and building a more responsive infrastructure. Perhaps more important, the CHSC has developed a functional information technology system. Knowledge is power, and that platform seems reasonably likely to contribute measurably to the long-term success of the prison health care system. It provides a means of maintaining accurate records and thus creating accountability. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Carol Gentry, <i>Health-Care Firms Face Costly Change,</i> Wall St. J., Jan. 3, 2000, at A3 (\"By speeding up the transmission and improving the accuracy of information, health plans should be able to do a better job of monitoring the quality of care.\"); Laura Landro, <i>Health Care Goes Digital: Doctors and Hospitals Find They Can't Stay Offline Any Longer,</i> Wall St. J., June 10, 2002, at R6 (\"There is a clear linkage now between technology and better patient outcomes.\"). The district court has cultivated this tree patiently and at great expense, and it would be rash for us to insist that it be uprooted just when it shows promise of bearing fruit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's related complaint &#8212; that the ineffectiveness of privatization to date defeats the finding of narrowness &#8212; is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, a determination of narrowness requires a court to decide whether ordered relief is tailored to rectify existing constitutional violations. <i>See Cason v. Seckinger,</i> 231 F.3d 777, 784 (11th Cir.2000) (\"The court must make new findings about whether the relief <i>currently</i> complies with the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirements, given the nature of the <i>current</i> violations.\"); <i>see also Castillo v. Cameron County,</i> 238 F.3d 339, 354 (5th Cir.2001). Whether a remedy is capable of successfully ameliorating constitutional violations has no necessary correlation with whether it is narrowly drawn. Narrow relief can be completely ineffectual. <i>See Morales II,</i> 13 F.Supp.2d at 157-58 (noting the failure of limited injunctive orders to bring the Puerto Rican correctional system into constitutional compliance). That the privatization concept has been slow to come to fruition does nothing to prove that the order is overly broad (or overly intrusive, for that matter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we think that the PLRA is too blunt an instrument for addressing this concern. As said, the PLRA limits courts to terminating prospective relief. Not every unforeseen difficulty in implementing injunctive decrees necessitates the total abandonment of a remedy. It is true that the CHSC has lagged far behind the original schedule and that the corporation has, to date, not accomplished its ultimate goals. It is also true that an ineffective remedy is a cause for concern. In light of the substantial progress that has been made, however, the mere fact that privatization is behind schedule does not convince us that it fails the narrowness-need-intrusiveness test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are well aware that federal oversight of Puerto Rico's correctional system cannot &#8212; and should not &#8212; last forever. We strongly urge both the district court and the litigants to move the privatization process forward with all practicable speed. For now, however, we conclude, based on the record evidence and the factual findings of the district court, that the privatization order meets the PLRA's requirements. The privatization solution has not yet been put into practice and common sense dictates that it be given a fair chance to work. The order appealed from provides that chance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Evidentiary Hearing.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's fallback position is that the district court committed reversible error in its manner of conducting the evidentiary hearing on the motion to terminate prospective relief. This contention has four branches. All of them are acarpous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Burden of Proof.</i> The Secretary first suggests that the district court impermissibly shifted the burden of proof. This suggestion derives primarily from the court's decision to order the proof by directing the Secretary (rather than the inmate class) to come forward, at the start of the hearing, with his evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is axiomatic that district courts enjoy wide latitude in matters concerning the ordering of proof and the presentation of evidence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Holmquist,</i> 36 F.3d 154, 163 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Elgabri v. Lekas,</i> 964 F.2d 1255, 1260 (1st Cir.1992); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 611(a). We review a trial court's determinations concerning the mode and order of proof for abuse of discretion. <i>Nat'l R.R. Pass. Corp. v. Certain Temporary Easements,</i> 357 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.2004). We will reverse only if a determination has unfairly prejudiced the complaining party. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to require the Secretary to present his proof first was not an abuse of discretion. In arriving at its decision on the motion to terminate, the court was free to rely on any aspect of the record that tended to shed light on whether constitutional violations persisted. <i>See Laaman v. Warden, N.H. State Prison,</i> 238 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that the court's familiarity with the record and its receipt of periodic reports may afford it \"comprehensive knowledge of whether a prison is, or is not, continuing to violate the consent decree\"). At the beginning of the hearing, the court had before it a full evidentiary record, developed over many years, together with a cache of periodic reports as to progress under the consent decree. This plethoric evidence was sufficient, if unrebutted, to support a finding that constitutional violations endured. With this in mind, it was sensible for the court to invite the Secretary to offer evidence to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, a trial court's authority to regulate the order of proof does not include the power to shift the burden of proof. <i>Brown Daltas &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Gen. Accid. Ins. Co.,</i> 48 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.1995) (reversing a judgment because the trial court erroneously shifted the burden of proof); <i>see also</i> 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2489 (J. Chadbourn ed.1981). But that is not what happened here: the court's election to hear the Secretary's evidence first in no way betokened reallocation of the burden of proof. In its subsequent review of the evidence, the court said nothing that indicated any misunderstanding as to where the burden of proof rested. Rather, it supportably determined that the facts presented by the Secretary lacked sufficient probative force to blunt the thrust of the accumulated evidence of record. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 339-40 (relying on the Secretary's own evidence to find continuing constitutional violations). In short, the contention that the lower court impermissibly shifted the burden of proof has no footing in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Agreement Between the Parties.</i> The Secretary next maintains that the district court erred by relying on the existence of a \"private agreement\" (by private agreement, he means the stipulation that was signed in 1997 by, inter alios, his predecessor in office). Specifically, the Secretary asserts that the fact that there was an agreement between the parties should have had no bearing on the continuing viability of the subsequent order approving privatization (entered in 1998). This assertion overlooks that the so-called private agreement was embodied in a stipulation presented to and adopted by the district court. Upon its adoption, the private agreement became a judicially enforceable consent decree. <i>Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins,</i> 540 U.S. 431, 124 S.Ct. 899, 903, 157 L.Ed.2d 855 (2004) (\"A consent decree embodies an agreement of the parties and is also an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>In re Pearson,</i> 990 F.2d 653, 658 (1st Cir.1993) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is significant because the Secretary's argument blurs the crucial distinction, for PLRA purposes, between private side agreements and consent decrees. The latter may serve as a vehicle for prospective relief under the PLRA; the former may not. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(a); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 3626(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the lower court did not rely impermissibly on the parties' original agreement. Although the court noted the existence of that agreement and scolded the Secretary for trying to renege on it, the holding in <i>Morales IV</i> was in no way premised either on an estoppel or on the fact that the parties previously had agreed to explore a privatization alternative. For these reasons, the Secretary's argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Exclusion of Evidence.</i> The Secretary also contends that the district court erred in refusing to allow him to introduce evidence as to the narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria. On this point, as is so often true in litigation, context is decisive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Secretary had presented his evidence as to the existence vel non of continuing constitutional violations, the district court asked him to summarize the evidence that he planned to adduce on the narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria. The Secretary proceeded to make an offer of proof. Having heard the proffer, the court determined that nothing in it bore directly upon the narrowness of, need for, or potential intrusiveness of the privatization remedy. Consequently, the court rejected the Secretary's offer of proof on relevancy grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We descry no error. In many instances, relevancy boils down to a judgment call. <i>See generally</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401 (deeming evidence relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\"). Accordingly, district courts enjoy wide latitude in determining the relevancy vel non of evidence. <i>Laaman,</i> 238 F.3d at 18-19; <i>United States v. Tierney,</i> 760 F.2d 382, 387 (1st Cir.1985). In this instance, the district court concluded that the offer of proof had no bearing on the appropriateness of the remedy under the PLRA's narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 337-38. Having reviewed the offer of proof, we find that this ruling was within the realm of the district court's discretion. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By way of his offer of proof, the Secretary proposed to introduce evidence designed to show the ineffectiveness of the remedy. He began the proffer by alleging generally that the non-profit corporation was not a viable remedy because it had not yet treated a single patient. The district court asked for elaboration, and the Secretary expressed a desire to take discovery on the matter. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 337. When the court refused that untimely request, the only details proffered by the Secretary tended to show that the CHSC was not complying with either the district court orders or Puerto Rico laws, and that it was not ready to begin treating patients. <i>Id.</i> at 338. This is a distinct line of inquiry. <i>See Hadix v. Johnson,</i> 228 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir.2000) (explaining that inquiries into compliance and inquiries into necessity under the PLRA are separate and distinct). As the district court sagely noted, compliance was not at issue in the evidentiary hearing. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 338.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We &#8212; like the district court &#8212; do not see how the Secretary's offer of proof informs a determination of whether the privatization remedy is a narrowly tailored, relatively unintrusive response to the serious constitutional violations that the district court found still existed. We note, moreover, that the Secretary has not explained the connection. We thus cannot fault the district court either for the rejection of the offer of proof or for its consequent exclusion of the proffered evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Rule 52(c).</i> Finally, the Secretary assigns error to the district court's use of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) as an adjudicative tool. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 344. Rule 52(c) provides a court conducting a bench trial with a means for issuing a judgment on partial findings. The rule is designed for use when \"a party has been fully heard on an issue and the court finds against the party on that issue.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court invoked that procedure here. The Secretary asseverates that this was not permissible on the facts of this case. We reject this asseveration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be frank, we find the Secretary's argument difficult to fathom. The text of the rule is clear. When a party has finished presenting evidence and that evidence is deemed by the trier insufficient to sustain the party's position, the court need not waste time, but, rather, may call a halt to the proceedings and enter judgment accordingly. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52 advisory committee note (\"Subdivision (c) ... authorizes the court to enter judgment at any time that it can appropriately make a dispositive finding of fact on the evidence.\"); <i>see also Atl. Track &amp; Turnout Co. v. Perini Corp.,</i> 989 F.2d 541 (1st Cir.1993). The fact that the inmate class had the burden of proof did not place Rule 52(c) off limits. A judgment under Rule 52(c) can be entered for or against either a plaintiff or a defendant, regardless of the allocation of the burden of proof. <i>See Bursztajn v. United States,</i> 367 F.3d 485, 488 (5th Cir.2004); <i>Fed. Refin. Co.,</i> 352 F.3d at 26; <i>see also</i> 9A Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2573.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Secretary had advanced his proof and the district court supportably concluded that the Secretary's evidence could not withstand the probative force of the historical record. In other words, even after taking the Secretary's case into account, the court determined that the plaintiffs had sustained their burden of showing pervasive and persistent constitutional violations. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 340-42. The court also supportably determined that the privatization remedy satisfied the narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria, and that the Secretary's offer of proof did not include any relevant evidence to the contrary. Based on these findings, the district court appropriately entered judgment pursuant to Rule 52(c). That the court made a series of credibility calls in reaching these conclusions in no way detracts from the legitimacy of its approach. <i>See</i> Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2573.1, at 497-99 (noting that the court's task under Rule 52(c) is to weigh the evidence, without drawing any special inferences in the nonmovant's favor, resolve any conflicts in the evidence, and \"decide for itself where the preponderance lies\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are sensitive both to Congress's manifest desire to limit federal judicial oversight of state correctional systems and to the length of time that Puerto Rico's prisons have been under federal hegemony. These concerns impel us to counsel the parties and the district court to move forward as swiftly as possible to cross the threshold of constitutional adequacy so that federal judicial involvement may cease. For now, however, we accept the well-documented judgment of the district court &#8212; a court intimately acquainted with the details of this litigation and the intricacies of the Puerto Rican correctional system &#8212; that inmate health care remains constitutionally unacceptable and that the privatization remedy holds promise for bringing inmate health care into compliance with constitutionally mandated standards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Consequently, we reject the Secretary's current effort to vacate or terminate the existing consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a few words of caution. There are now significant financial reserves (in the form of accumulated fines) available for improvements in health care delivery, and the AOC seems willing to work for change. We urge the district court to move toward extricating itself from the toils of this litigation as soon as it can do so without defaulting on its responsibilities under the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of the Secretary's motion to vacate or terminate the pertinent portions of the existing consent decree. We take no view of the district court's procedural order, <i>see supra</i> Part II, as we lack jurisdiction to review that order on this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.

The Secretary offers no developed argumentation on this point and, as matters stand, we believe that this case is not a credible candidate for the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Secretary makes a fifth argument: that the relief ordered by the district court requires Puerto Rican officials to act in contravention of local law. The district court refused to address this argument on the ground that the Secretary did not sufficiently specify the nature of the alleged violations. That ruling is supportable, and it precludes reliance on the argument here<i>See Teamsters Union v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that arguments not squarely raised in the trial court cannot be advanced on appeal). In all events, the Secretary's appellate presentation suffers from the same lack of specificity; he alleges the violations in the most general terms and does not inform us of where in the record we might find any evidence of them. This lack of developed appellate argumentation constitutes an independently sufficient basis for deeming the argument abandoned. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although we assume arguendo the correctness of the Secretary's assessment of what transpired in 1998, we note that the district court made a series of contemporaneous written findings, which may well have satisfied the narrowness-need-intrusiveness requirements<i>See Morales II,</i> 13 F.Supp.2d at 212 (holding that privatization \"is necessary to protect the members of the plaintiff class from cruel and unusual punishment through constitutionally unacceptable health care services,\" that the remedy \"extends no further than is necessary to correct the violation of the Federal rights of members of the plaintiff class,\" that \"such relief is narrowly drawn,\" and that there \"is no less intrusive means to correct the violation of plaintiffs' Federal rights\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We reject out of hand the Secretary's argument that an order to privatize is a per se violation of the narrowness requirement of the PLRA. The narrowness of a remedy necessarily involves a close examination of a particular set of facts and a determination concerning what steps are reasonable to cure the ongoing constitutional violations. Because this will necessarily be influenced by a variety of factors, we are wary of adopting ironclad rules</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> It may well be that modification, or some other more limited adjustment, is appropriate to address such concerns,<i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) &#8212; but that issue is not before us.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Should the circumstances change, or a substantial interval pass without significant progress, the Secretary is, of course, free to ask the lower court to reexamine these findings and reconsider the advisability of the ordered relief</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The iteration now before us focuses on prospective injunctive relief ordered by the district court in 1998 (the centerpiece of which is the proposed privatization of medical and mental health care throughout the correctional system). Despite his predecessor's enthusiastic assent to that arrangement, the Commonwealth's Secretary of Health (the Secretary), acting in his official capacity, sought five years later to vacate or terminate the consent decree embodying that relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court rejected that initiative. <i>Morales Feliciano v. Calderon Serra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2563057\"><a href=\"/opinion/2563057/morales-feliciano-v-calderon-serra/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2004) (<i>Morales IV</i>). The Secretary now attacks this decision on several fronts. He asserts, inter alia, that the court acted ultra vires; that the court's 1998 order was void ab initio for failure to meet the requirements of section 802 of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-66, &#167; 802 (1996), <i>codified at</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626; and that in all events, the order should be terminated because the district court's supportive factfinding was clearly erroneous and infected by errors of law. As a fallback, he argues that the district court bungled the evidentiary hearing and that, at a bare minimum, the matter should be remanded for reconsideration.

The district court found the plaintiffs likely to succeed on the merits and issued preliminary injunctive relief. <i>Morales I,</i> 497 F.Supp. at 39-41. The defendants made little progress and the district court, in March of 1986, appointed a monitor. <i>See Morales III,</i> 303 F.3d at 3; <i>Morales Feliciano v. Romero Barcelo,</i> 672 F.Supp. at 621. The court charged the monitor with studying various elements of the correctional system and recommending remedial action. With the monitor's assistance, the court became more proactive and issued a torrent of orders, including temporary restrainers and contempt citations. The court thereafter imposed multimillion dollar fines for the most egregious failures to comply with its directives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, the court ordered the implementation of medical and mental health care plans recommended by the monitor. These plans transferred the primary responsibility for medical and mental health care in the correctional system from the Administrator of Corrections (the AOC) to the Secretary. The plans also required that the Secretary employ for a minimum of three years a chief health care coordinator (the CHCC) who would bear responsibility for easing the transition and coordinating compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over time, prison conditions improved. In 1996, the district court entered a partial final judgment that settled several disputed issues and urged attempts at consensus-based compliance efforts as to other issues. Despite improvements in many areas, the delivery of medical and mental health care lagged behind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 1997, a court-appointed expert found the existing health care programs incapable of meeting constitutional standards and suggested, as an alternative, the appointment of a receiver. The parties (who, over a quarter of a century, have agreed on little else) unanimously opposed this recommendation. They suggested instead the formation of a private non-profit corporation to provide medical and mental health services to the inmate population. On September 26, 1997, the parties drafted, executed, and filed a stipulation embodying this consensus. Under the terms of the stipulation, a non-profit corporation was to be formed. The corporation would be structured to provide health care services, consistent with the 1990 plan, to all individuals held in institutions operated by the AOC. The stipulation pledged the parties' full cooperation, required the Secretary and the AOC to lay the groundwork for a transition, and offered to subject the process of privatization to the supervision of the district court. Finally, the stipulation memorialized the parties' agreement to engage in further discussions concerning the role and authority of the CHCC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court endorsed the stipulation and, thus, assumed ownership of the privatization plan that had been conceived by the parties. <i>See Morales III,</i> 303 F.3d at 3-4; <i>see also Morales II,</i> 13 F.Supp.2d at 212-14 (justifying the adoption of the privatization remedy by elaborating on the grave constitutional deficiencies that continued to haunt the existing programs). The order, as it pertains to this appeal, has retained its original substance. The non-profit entity, known as the Correctional Health Services Corporation (the CHSC), has been formed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties and the district court envisioned the CHSC as a key piece of the privatization machinery. Withal, the CHSC was intended as a transitional device rather than as the exclusive provider of inmate health care services in perpetuity. The parties expected that within a few years of its full implementation, the CHSC would compete with private health care providers for contracts to furnish health care services to those persons held in the AOC's custody. This expectation remains in force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CHSC has a checkered history. Originally, the parties hoped that it would begin to function as early as July 1, 1998, and become fully operational as a provider of health care to the inmate population by the end of that year. That prediction proved wildly optimistic. Although the district court, using accrued fines, has made substantial funding available to the CHSC &#8212; as of the date of the district court's decision, roughly $55,000,000 had been spent on the privatization solution &#8212; this monetary infusion has not yet brought the project to fruition. While the CHSC has made substantial progress toward reaching its stated goals, the pace has been much slower than anticipated. To this point, the CHSC has developed an administrative infrastructure, fashioned an impressive set of substantive programs, and constructed needed facilities. As a result, it has begun contributing to the management of payroll, staff assignments, inventory, purchasing, billing, and financing. The CHSC's achievements in formulating substantive programs include the creation of an electronic database for health records, patient tracking, and the keeping of appointments; the design of a telemedicine program to enable remote diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illnesses; and the training of personnel to maximize the efficacy of these (and other) programs. The CHSC also has improved the quality of the facilities and equipment dedicated to the provision of inmate health care. In the same vein, it has purchased and installed computers at most of the institutions operated by the AOC. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; it is in the process of developing a new acute care hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without in any way minimizing either the value or extent of these accomplishments, it is evident that the CHSC has lagged far behind the timetable that its proponents originally envisioned. Part of the reason is that court supervision has made the process cumbersome (for example, lengthy periods of time have been consumed in the submission and approval of budget proposals). Other factors, such as snail's-pace negotiations with outside contractors, false starts, and resistance to change, have contributed to the delay. Though this lag time may have been unavoidable, the fact remains that, to this date, not a single patient has been treated by the CHSC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 1, 2003, the Secretary, emphasizing this protracted period of delay and the mounting costs of completing the necessary infrastructure, filed a motion under the PLRA to vacate or terminate the privatization component of the extant consent decree. The plaintiffs cross-moved to modify the medical and mental health plans by terminating sections of the decree that assigned the primary responsibility for inmate health care to the Secretary. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 342-43. The cross-motion went unopposed and the district court granted it. <i>Id.</i> at 343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following an evidentiary hearing on the main motion, the court found that pervasive and persistent constitutional violations continued to shackle the delivery of health care in Puerto Rico's correctional system. <i>Id.</i> at 323-31. The court also found that the contemplated relief &#8212; privatization &#8212; satisfied the requirements of the PLRA. <i>Id.</i> at 331-38. Accordingly, the court upheld the challenged portion of the consent decree and directed the AOC to meet with the plaintiff class and submit a further plan for achieving constitutional compliance. <i>Id.</i> at 344-45. The Secretary now appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by clarifying the extent of our jurisdiction. It is beyond serious question that we have jurisdiction over the main elements of this appeal. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1) (conferring jurisdiction over interlocutory orders refusing to terminate injunctions). The Secretary, however, has also attempted to raise a tangential issue. With regard to that issue, appellate jurisdiction is more problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances are as follows. As part of its ruling below, the district court ordered the AOC to \"meet [with the plaintiff class] and file with the Court within forty-five (45) days... a plan on how the [AOC] will assume his legal responsibility to provide health care to inmates.\" <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 345. The Secretary asserts that this order, ex proprio vigore, violates the PLRA and contravenes Supreme Court precedent regarding limitations on the power of federal courts to enforce state law against state officers. <i>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 117, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span> (1984) (\"[A] federal suit against state officials on the basis of state law contravenes the Eleventh Amendment when ... the relief sought and ordered has an impact directly on the State itself.\"). We cannot reach the merits of these claims for we have no jurisdiction over them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result is largely dictated by the rationale of our decision in a prior phase of this seemingly endless litigation. In <i>Morales III,</i> we ruled that an order that \"was within the lower court's reserved power to establish procedures for compliance with the court's earlier decrees\" was not immediately appealable. 303 F.3d at 10. That reasoning is apposite here. A necessary correlate of the lower court's duty to supervise the ongoing process of privatization is the power to issue subsidiary orders in aid of that objective. We thus have no jurisdiction to entertain an interlocutory appeal from this portion of the court's decision (or even to consider the plaintiffs' contention that the Secretary lacks standing to register such a protest).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We proceed to examine the remainder of the Secretary's asseverational array. He has loosed a scattershot attack. Only four of his claims are worthy of extended discussion, namely, (i) that the lower court lacked general equitable power to grant a privatization remedy; (ii) that the PLRA mandates vacation of the 1998 order as void ab initio; (iii) that, after almost five years of wheel-spinning, the PLRA now mandates termination of the prospective relief; and (iv) that the court repeatedly erred in the course of the evidentiary hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We address these issues (some of which have subparts) sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>General Equitable Powers.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's first broadside need not detain us. He posits that the relief ordered here is an invalid exercise of federal equitable power. Because this argument presents a purely legal issue, it engenders de novo review. <i>See Sunshine Dev., Inc. v. FDIC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676988\"><a href=\"/opinion/676988/sunshine-development-inc-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that this argument quite likely is by the boards. The Secretary's predecessor in office stipulated to the privatization remedy, and there is no claim that he lacked authority to do so. Normally, that would constitute a waiver, which would prevent the Secretary from making this argument altogether.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Secretary is not bound by his predecessor's acquiescence &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; the Secretary did not present this argument to the district court and attempts to raise it for the first time on appeal. \"It is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, [he] may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\" <i>United States v.

He insists, however, that a federal court's equitable powers are restricted to the remedies that were available in equity in 1789 (at the time of the passage of the First Judiciary Act).

Appellant's Br. at 29. If this crabbed view reflected the state of the law, equitable remedies would be frozen in time and new remedial applications could never be developed to meet contemporary needs. The view, however, is fundamentally at odds with the core principle that equity must evolve over time \"in order to meet the requirements of every case, and to satisfy the needs of a progressive social condition in which new primary rights and duties are constantly arising and new kinds of wrongs are constantly committed.\" <i>Union Pac.

This inquiry is informed by a recognition that equity is flexible and that the boundaries of permissible relief are broad. <i>Id.</i> Thus, the relevant question is not whether a specific application of relief was available in 1789, but, rather, whether that general type of relief was available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the answer to that question is affirmative.

A survey of contemporary applications of this rule supports this conclusion. Courts consistently have upheld relief in equity notwithstanding the fact that the particular remedial application was not available in 1789. School busing orders exemplify this point. <i>See, e.g., Swann v.

While the privatization remedy constitutes extraordinary relief and can be justified in only the most exceptional circumstances, the <i>nature</i> of the remedy is no different than that of a garden-variety mandatory injunction. Seen in this light, we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error in determining that it had the authority to approve and implement a privatization remedy jointly proposed by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Compliance with the PLRA.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA, partially in an effort to curb the involvement of the federal judiciary in day-to-day prison management. <i>See</i> 141 Cong.

It further provides that a federal court \"shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\" <i>Id.</i> A party is entitled to immediate termination of any relief that has been granted in the absence of findings as to these criteria. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3626(b)(2).

Because the district court did not make the findings specifically required by the PLRA coincident with the entry of its 1998 order, the Secretary's thesis runs, the order was void ab initio.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's thesis hinges on the premise that when prospective relief does not meet the PLRA's requirements at the moment of issuance, the decree is void without reference to the statutory termination procedure. On this premise, the termination procedure applies only to (i) prospective relief entered before the effective date of the PLRA and (ii) prospective relief entered after that date which is accompanied by the requisite narrowness-need-intrusiveness findings. Prospective relief entered after the PLRA's effective date but unaccompanied by narrowness-need-intrusiveness findings is simply void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no textual support for the Secretary's position. He relies on the mandatory language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(a), which states that \"[t]he court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief\" in the absence of specific findings. But this subsection sets forth the standard district courts must follow when determining whether prospective relief <i>not yet ordered</i> is permitted by the PLRA. <i>Gilmore v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769703\"><a href=\"/opinion/769703/robert-o-gilmore-jr-and-inmates-of-san-quentin-state-prison-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 999 (9th Cir.2000) (\"If prospective relief has already been granted by a court, &#167; 3626(b) controls.\"). Here, however, privatization constitutes the status quo (and the Secretary advanced no PLRA-based argument at the time that privatization was originally approved).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only authority cited by the Secretary &#8212; <i>Rouse</i> &#8212; does not support his point of view. He asserts that <i>Rouse</i> drew a distinction between orders issued prior to the enactment of the PLRA and those issued subsequent thereto. That is incorrect. <i>Rouse</i> drew a distinction between \"existing federal court orders\" and those \"not yet obtained.\" 129 F.3d at 654. That distinction contradicts the position that the Secretary advocates in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that the procedure limned in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(b) applies to any existing prospective relief, regardless of when that relief was first ordered. <i>See Miller,</i> 530 U.S. at 333, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118378\"><a href=\"/opinion/118378/miller-v-french/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That makes a significant difference. Nothing in subsection (b) or in its legislative history speaks of <i>vacating</i> consent decrees but only of <i>terminating</i> them. That linguistic shift has practical consequences. \"While terminating a consent decree strips it of future potency, the decree's past puissance is preserved....\" <i>Id.</i> at 662.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That gets the grease from the goose. Although 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(b) entitles a defendant to termination of existing prospective relief ordered in the absence of the requisite findings, that proviso excepts cases in which the court supportably finds that the particular form of prospective relief remains at the time of the challenge narrowly tailored, necessary, and relatively unintrusive. <i>See id.; see also Guajardo v. Tex. Dep't of Crim. Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"34445\"><a href=\"/opinion/34445/guajardo-v-tx-dept-cr-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 394 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam). There is no time limitation present in section 3626(b)(2), nor does its language suggest that it reaches only those orders issued prior to the PLRA's effective date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, section 3626(b) provides that any order made in the absence of the required findings is subject to \"immediate termination.\" This word choice is significant. <i>See Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 662. The verb \"terminate\" means \"to put an end to\" or \"to end.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1482 (7th ed., 1999). If Congress had intended that orders issued in the absence of the required findings be void ab initio, it would almost certainly have chosen a phrase such as \"void.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the PLRA grants the Secretary a right to move for the termination of prospective relief. The PLRA does not, however, confer any right to argue, five years after the fact, that an order should be deemed void ab initio for lack of contemporaneous findings. Therefore, this aspect of the Secretary's challenge founders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Constitutional Violations.</i> Upon a motion to terminate prospective injunctive relief under the PLRA, a court may continue the relief only if it supportably finds that there are ongoing constitutional violations. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(b). The district court purposed to make such findings in this instance. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 323-31, 342. The Secretary counters that the record does not show infirmities sufficient to justify ongoing relief and that the district court's contrary findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An inquiry into whether current prison conditions constitute an ongoing violation of a federal right \"comprises a mixed question of fact and law, the answer to which we review along a degree-of-deference continuum, ranging from plenary review for law-dominated questions to clear-error review for fact-dominated questions.\" <i>Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 661. Here, the question is fact-intensive &#8212; the Secretary frontally challenges the lower court's factfinding &#8212; so our standard of review is deferential. <i>See id.; see also Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588805\"><a href=\"/opinion/588805/dedham-water-co-inc-v-cumberland-farms-dairy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 457 (1st Cir.1992) (admonishing that appellate courts should respect the trial court's findings of fact unless convinced, after a careful review of the record, that a mistake has been made). If there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them must be respected. <i>See Fed. Refin. Co. v. Klock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200761\"><a href=\"/opinion/200761/federal-refinance-v-romano/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2003). The lower court's factual findings easily pass muster under this deferential standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have painstakingly reviewed the record and examined the numerous findings of fact, mindful that a trial court generally is considered the most informed interpreter of its own prior rulings and findings. <i>See Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 661. In this instance, the court was very careful to update the record and to consider the ways in which conditions had changed since its original endorsement of the privatization concept. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 323-31. The court painted a compelling, record-rooted picture of how and in what respects health care for inmates in Puerto Rican prisons remains constitutionally deficient. <i>See id.</i> On this grim record, it is simply implausible to suggest that these findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court characterized the denial of medical and mental health services as \"massive and systematic.\" <i>Id.</i> at 324. That characterization seems apt. No useful purpose would be served by rehearsing the court's findings in minute detail. We offer instead a few of the more glaring examples. As of 2003, one-fourth of all inmates who requested sick call did not get it; only 55% of all ambulatory care appointments actually took place; only 49% of specialist consultations deemed necessary for serious conditions were arranged; as a rule, medically prescribed diets for inmates were habitually ignored; only 31.3% of inmates who had been diagnosed HIV-positive were receiving treatment; and inmate mortality rates were rising. <i>See id.</i> at 323-31. These are but the tip of a particularly unattractive iceberg. Despite the CHSC's efforts, physical facilities for inmate health care remain inadequate and there is an acute shortage of psychiatric expertise. <i>See id.</i> at 326-27, 331. Basic health care is critical to maintaining a decent quality of life, and Puerto Rico's correctional system is not delivering a constitutionally acceptable level of health care to its captive population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that in the course of making these findings, the district court largely disregarded the testimony of the Secretary's expert witness as lacking in credibility. Although the Secretary complains bitterly about this rejection, it is hornbook law that matters of credibility are ordinarily for the court of first instance, not for the appellate court. <i>Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2004). Unless the record mandates a contrary finding &#8212; and this record most assuredly does not &#8212; the court of appeals ought not disturb a trial court's credibility determination. <i>See Anthony v. Sundlun,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574884\"><a href=\"/opinion/574884/jane-anthony-v-bruce-g-sundlun/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir.1991); <i>see also</i> 9A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2586 (2d ed.1994) (collecting cases). Here, moreover, there is much to commend the district court's assessment of the witness's dubious credibility (for example, the witness provided haphazard and inconsistent testimony and, on cross-examination, withdrew or corrected a myriad of statements).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary accurately observes that some noteworthy advances have been made in the delivery of health care to inmates. He overlooks, however, that notwithstanding these improvements, the district court found substantial deficiencies attendant to virtually every aspect of the inmate health care system. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 324. However laudable the advances may be, the district court's supportable finding that constitutional violations persist suffices to satisfy the requirements of the PLRA and to justify a comprehensive injunctive decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this subject would be supererogatory. We hold, without serious question, that the district court's findings and conclusions about the incidence of continuing constitutional violations are adequately anchored in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Narrowness-Need-Intrusiveness Findings.</i> The PLRA mandates \"the termination of extant consent decrees altogether unless the district court makes the specific findings that are necessary to keep a particular decree alive.\" <i>Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 655. In addition to ongoing constitutional violations, this compendium includes a finding that the ordered relief satisfies the statutory narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(b). The district court made such findings here. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 342. The Secretary argues that the facts of this case, as found, require termination of the decree because the chosen remedy &#8212; privatization &#8212; does not meet the narrowness, need, and intrusiveness requirements delineated in the PLRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress plainly intended the PLRA to operate as a mechanism that would decrease federal judicial involvement in prison administration. <i>See Rouse,</i> 129 F.3d at 655. Congress left room, however, for needed injunctive relief. The Secretary's insistence that Congress did not want courts involved in prison administration begs the real question &#8212; which is whether a particular set of facts, measured under the statutorily specified criteria, warrants continued judicial involvement. We think that this is a close call in the case at hand, but for the time being, we find supportable the district court's conclusions regarding narrowness, need, and lack of intrusiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria are, to some extent, self-explicating. The devil is in the details attendant to their application. The application of those criteria is case-specific and must be undertaken in light of both the magnitude of existing constitutional violations and the available remedial alternatives.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See, e.g., Clement v. Cal. Dep't of Corrections,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785839\"><a href=\"/opinion/785839/clement-v-california-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1153 (9th Cir.2004). The constitutional violations here are substantial in both scope and degree. They have defied correction for more than two decades. The district court has tried more conventional measures, but found them wanting. It has afforded the Commonwealth ample opportunity to bring preexisting mechanisms up to speed or otherwise to correct the phalanx of problems. It has witnessed the Commonwealth's continued inability to cure the constitutional infirmities plaguing the delivery of health care in the correctional system. This record of abject failure matters in the narrowness-need-intrusiveness inquiry. <i>See Benjamin v. Fraser,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783505\"><a href=\"/opinion/783505/james-benjamin-plaintiffs-appellees-cross-appellants-v-william-j-fraser/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 49 (2d Cir.2003) (upholding narrowness-need-intrusiveness findings \"in light of the district court's finding that the [defendant's] compliance with its remedial responsibilities has been consistently incomplete and inadequate\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for continued prospective injunctive relief is patent. The lower court has been dealing with the deficiencies of Puerto Rico's correctional system since 1979, and we acknowledge that the sheer passage of so much time counsels restraint in ordering further extensions of prospective injunctive relief. <i>See, e.g., Spangler v. Pasadena City Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"372967\"><a href=\"/opinion/372967/nancy-anne-spangler-by-her-father-and-next-friend-james-e-spangler-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span>, 1241 (9th Cir.1979). However, the correctional system is sprawling, the problems with which the court has had to grapple are massive, the Commonwealth's acceptance of the need for reforms has ranged from inconsistent to grudging (witness the current state of affairs in which the AOC embraces privatization as the Secretary seeks to dismantle it), and progress has been correspondingly slow. Insofar as health care is concerned, the level of improvement still falls well short of bringing serious violations into constitutional compliance. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 323-31. In some respects, backsliding has occurred. <i>See id.</i> at 324. In light of these facts, we have no difficulty affirming the district court's finding that a need for ongoing injunctive relief exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider the district court's findings regarding narrow tailoring and lack of intrusiveness. In 2003, the district court was keenly aware of its duty to ensure that prospective remediation complies with the PLRA's requirements. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 331. It was, however, faced with a constitutional crisis and only three proposed solutions: turning back the health care clock to reinstate the system that had failed miserably for two decades, placing the system into receivership, or persisting with the plan for privatization (which the parties had conceived and to which they originally had agreed). The status quo ante alternative had proven to be ineffective, and, thus, was undesirable. No one favored the receivership alternative. That left privatization. Against this mise-en-scene, we cannot say that the lower court's choice of that alternative was unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary nonetheless argues that privatization is much broader than necessary to forfend against cruel and unusual treatment of inmates. If this were the district court's first attempt at remediation, we quite likely would agree. But the district court has attempted narrower, less intrusive alternatives &#8212; and those alternatives have failed to restore the constitutional balance. For this reason, a more innovative remedy is justifiable. The increased intrusiveness and broader scope of the privatization remedy is a direct response to the unique need created by the Commonwealth's own failure &#8212; for more than twenty years &#8212; to correct serious constitutional inadequacies. Drastic times call for drastic measures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary has one final shot in his sling. He laments that privatization is far behind schedule and has accomplished very little to date. Nevertheless, a great deal of time, effort, and money has been spent in constructing facilities, procuring equipment, creating programs, and building a more responsive infrastructure. Perhaps more important, the CHSC has developed a functional information technology system. Knowledge is power, and that platform seems reasonably likely to contribute measurably to the long-term success of the prison health care system. It provides a means of maintaining accurate records and thus creating accountability. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Carol Gentry, <i>Health-Care Firms Face Costly Change,</i> Wall St. J., Jan. 3, 2000, at A3 (\"By speeding up the transmission and improving the accuracy of information, health plans should be able to do a better job of monitoring the quality of care.\"); Laura Landro, <i>Health Care Goes Digital: Doctors and Hospitals Find They Can't Stay Offline Any Longer,</i> Wall St. J., June 10, 2002, at R6 (\"There is a clear linkage now between technology and better patient outcomes.\"). The district court has cultivated this tree patiently and at great expense, and it would be rash for us to insist that it be uprooted just when it shows promise of bearing fruit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's related complaint &#8212; that the ineffectiveness of privatization to date defeats the finding of narrowness &#8212; is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, a determination of narrowness requires a court to decide whether ordered relief is tailored to rectify existing constitutional violations. <i>See Cason v. Seckinger,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></span>, 784 (11th Cir.2000) (\"The court must make new findings about whether the relief <i>currently</i> complies with the need-narrowness-intrusiveness requirements, given the nature of the <i>current</i> violations.\"); <i>see also Castillo v. Cameron County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771841\"><a href=\"/opinion/771841/jose-raul-castillo-francisco-lopez-e-eloy-sanchez-jon-alan-ashcraft-gustavo/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>, 354 (5th Cir.2001). Whether a remedy is capable of successfully ameliorating constitutional violations has no necessary correlation with whether it is narrowly drawn. Narrow relief can be completely ineffectual. <i>See Morales II,</i> 13 F.Supp.2d at 157-58 (noting the failure of limited injunctive orders to bring the Puerto Rican correctional system into constitutional compliance). That the privatization concept has been slow to come to fruition does nothing to prove that the order is overly broad (or overly intrusive, for that matter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we think that the PLRA is too blunt an instrument for addressing this concern. As said, the PLRA limits courts to terminating prospective relief. Not every unforeseen difficulty in implementing injunctive decrees necessitates the total abandonment of a remedy. It is true that the CHSC has lagged far behind the original schedule and that the corporation has, to date, not accomplished its ultimate goals. It is also true that an ineffective remedy is a cause for concern. In light of the substantial progress that has been made, however, the mere fact that privatization is behind schedule does not convince us that it fails the narrowness-need-intrusiveness test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are well aware that federal oversight of Puerto Rico's correctional system cannot &#8212; and should not &#8212; last forever. We strongly urge both the district court and the litigants to move the privatization process forward with all practicable speed. For now, however, we conclude, based on the record evidence and the factual findings of the district court, that the privatization order meets the PLRA's requirements. The privatization solution has not yet been put into practice and common sense dictates that it be given a fair chance to work. The order appealed from provides that chance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Evidentiary Hearing.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's fallback position is that the district court committed reversible error in its manner of conducting the evidentiary hearing on the motion to terminate prospective relief. This contention has four branches. All of them are acarpous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Burden of Proof.</i> The Secretary first suggests that the district court impermissibly shifted the burden of proof. This suggestion derives primarily from the court's decision to order the proof by directing the Secretary (rather than the inmate class) to come forward, at the start of the hearing, with his evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is axiomatic that district courts enjoy wide latitude in matters concerning the ordering of proof and the presentation of evidence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Holmquist,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195622\"><a href=\"/opinion/195622/united-states-v-holmquist/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 163 (1st Cir.1994); <i>Elgabri v.

We review a trial court's determinations concerning the mode and order of proof for abuse of discretion. <i>Nat'l R.R. Pass. Corp. v.

In arriving at its decision on the motion to terminate, the court was free to rely on any aspect of the record that tended to shed light on whether constitutional violations persisted. <i>See Laaman v. Warden, N.H. State Prison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199234\"><a href=\"/opinion/199234/laaman-v-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17-18 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that the court's familiarity with the record and its receipt of periodic reports may afford it \"comprehensive knowledge of whether a prison is, or is not, continuing to violate the consent decree\"). At the beginning of the hearing, the court had before it a full evidentiary record, developed over many years, together with a cache of periodic reports as to progress under the consent decree. This plethoric evidence was sufficient, if unrebutted, to support a finding that constitutional violations endured. With this in mind, it was sensible for the court to invite the Secretary to offer evidence to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, a trial court's authority to regulate the order of proof does not include the power to shift the burden of proof. <i>Brown Daltas &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Gen. Accid. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195919\"><a href=\"/opinion/195919/brown-daltas-v-northbrook-excess/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1995) (reversing a judgment because the trial court erroneously shifted the burden of proof); <i>see also</i> 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence &#167; 2489 (J. Chadbourn ed.1981). But that is not what happened here: the court's election to hear the Secretary's evidence first in no way betokened reallocation of the burden of proof. In its subsequent review of the evidence, the court said nothing that indicated any misunderstanding as to where the burden of proof rested. Rather, it supportably determined that the facts presented by the Secretary lacked sufficient probative force to blunt the thrust of the accumulated evidence of record. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 339-40 (relying on the Secretary's own evidence to find continuing constitutional violations). In short, the contention that the lower court impermissibly shifted the burden of proof has no footing in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Agreement Between the Parties.</i> The Secretary next maintains that the district court erred by relying on the existence of a \"private agreement\" (by private agreement, he means the stipulation that was signed in 1997 by, inter alios, his predecessor in office). Specifically, the Secretary asserts that the fact that there was an agreement between the parties should have had no bearing on the continuing viability of the subsequent order approving privatization (entered in 1998). This assertion overlooks that the so-called private agreement was embodied in a stipulation presented to and adopted by the district court. Upon its adoption, the private agreement became a judicially enforceable consent decree. <i>Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131155\"><a href=\"/opinion/131155/frew-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131155\"><a href=\"/opinion/131155/frew-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span> (2004) (\"A consent decree embodies an agreement of the parties and is also an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>In re Pearson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604120\"><a href=\"/opinion/604120/in-re-donald-pearson/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span>, 658 (1st Cir.1993) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is significant because the Secretary's argument blurs the crucial distinction, for PLRA purposes, between private side agreements and consent decrees. The latter may serve as a vehicle for prospective relief under the PLRA; the former may not. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3626(a); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 3626(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the lower court did not rely impermissibly on the parties' original agreement. Although the court noted the existence of that agreement and scolded the Secretary for trying to renege on it, the holding in <i>Morales IV</i> was in no way premised either on an estoppel or on the fact that the parties previously had agreed to explore a privatization alternative. For these reasons, the Secretary's argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Exclusion of Evidence.</i> The Secretary also contends that the district court erred in refusing to allow him to introduce evidence as to the narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria. On this point, as is so often true in litigation, context is decisive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Secretary had presented his evidence as to the existence vel non of continuing constitutional violations, the district court asked him to summarize the evidence that he planned to adduce on the narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria. The Secretary proceeded to make an offer of proof. Having heard the proffer, the court determined that nothing in it bore directly upon the narrowness of, need for, or potential intrusiveness of the privatization remedy. Consequently, the court rejected the Secretary's offer of proof on relevancy grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We descry no error. In many instances, relevancy boils down to a judgment call. <i>See generally</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401 (deeming evidence relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\"). Accordingly, district courts enjoy wide latitude in determining the relevancy vel non of evidence. <i>Laaman,</i> 238 F.3d at 18-19; <i>United States v. Tierney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451517\"><a href=\"/opinion/451517/united-states-v-robert-f-tierney/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 387 (1st Cir.1985). In this instance, the district court concluded that the offer of proof had no bearing on the appropriateness of the remedy under the PLRA's narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 337-38. Having reviewed the offer of proof, we find that this ruling was within the realm of the district court's discretion. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By way of his offer of proof, the Secretary proposed to introduce evidence designed to show the ineffectiveness of the remedy. He began the proffer by alleging generally that the non-profit corporation was not a viable remedy because it had not yet treated a single patient. The district court asked for elaboration, and the Secretary expressed a desire to take discovery on the matter. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 337. When the court refused that untimely request, the only details proffered by the Secretary tended to show that the CHSC was not complying with either the district court orders or Puerto Rico laws, and that it was not ready to begin treating patients. <i>Id.</i> at 338. This is a distinct line of inquiry. <i>See Hadix v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770643\"><a href=\"/opinion/770643/everett-hadix-plaintiffs-appelleescross-appellants-v-perry-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span>, 673 (6th Cir.2000) (explaining that inquiries into compliance and inquiries into necessity under the PLRA are separate and distinct). As the district court sagely noted, compliance was not at issue in the evidentiary hearing. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 338.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We &#8212; like the district court &#8212; do not see how the Secretary's offer of proof informs a determination of whether the privatization remedy is a narrowly tailored, relatively unintrusive response to the serious constitutional violations that the district court found still existed. We note, moreover, that the Secretary has not explained the connection. We thus cannot fault the district court either for the rejection of the offer of proof or for its consequent exclusion of the proffered evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Rule 52(c).</i> Finally, the Secretary assigns error to the district court's use of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) as an adjudicative tool. <i>See Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 344. Rule 52(c) provides a court conducting a bench trial with a means for issuing a judgment on partial findings. The rule is designed for use when \"a party has been fully heard on an issue and the court finds against the party on that issue.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court invoked that procedure here. The Secretary asseverates that this was not permissible on the facts of this case. We reject this asseveration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be frank, we find the Secretary's argument difficult to fathom. The text of the rule is clear. When a party has finished presenting evidence and that evidence is deemed by the trier insufficient to sustain the party's position, the court need not waste time, but, rather, may call a halt to the proceedings and enter judgment accordingly. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52 advisory committee note (\"Subdivision (c) ... authorizes the court to enter judgment at any time that it can appropriately make a dispositive finding of fact on the evidence.\"); <i>see also Atl. Track &amp; Turnout Co. v. Perini Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603503\"><a href=\"/opinion/603503/atlantic-track-turnout-company-v-perini-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993). The fact that the inmate class had the burden of proof did not place Rule 52(c) off limits. A judgment under Rule 52(c) can be entered for or against either a plaintiff or a defendant, regardless of the allocation of the burden of proof. <i>See Bursztajn v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"35244\"><a href=\"/opinion/35244/bursztajn-v-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, 488 (5th Cir.2004); <i>Fed. Refin. Co.,</i> 352 F.3d at 26; <i>see also</i> 9A Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2573.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Secretary had advanced his proof and the district court supportably concluded that the Secretary's evidence could not withstand the probative force of the historical record. In other words, even after taking the Secretary's case into account, the court determined that the plaintiffs had sustained their burden of showing pervasive and persistent constitutional violations. <i>Morales IV,</i> 300 F.Supp.2d at 340-42. The court also supportably determined that the privatization remedy satisfied the narrowness-need-intrusiveness criteria, and that the Secretary's offer of proof did not include any relevant evidence to the contrary. Based on these findings, the district court appropriately entered judgment pursuant to Rule 52(c). That the court made a series of credibility calls in reaching these conclusions in no way detracts from the legitimacy of its approach. <i>See</i> Wright &amp; Miller, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2573.1, at 497-99 (noting that the court's task under Rule 52(c) is to weigh the evidence, without drawing any special inferences in the nonmovant's favor, resolve any conflicts in the evidence, and \"decide for itself where the preponderance lies\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are sensitive both to Congress's manifest desire to limit federal judicial oversight of state correctional systems and to the length of time that Puerto Rico's prisons have been under federal hegemony. These concerns impel us to counsel the parties and the district court to move forward as swiftly as possible to cross the threshold of constitutional adequacy so that federal judicial involvement may cease. For now, however, we accept the well-documented judgment of the district court &#8212; a court intimately acquainted with the details of this litigation and the intricacies of the Puerto Rican correctional system &#8212; that inmate health care remains constitutionally unacceptable and that the privatization remedy holds promise for bringing inmate health care into compliance with constitutionally mandated standards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Consequently, we reject the Secretary's current effort to vacate or terminate the existing consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a few words of caution. There are now significant financial reserves (in the form of accumulated fines) available for improvements in health care delivery, and the AOC seems willing to work for change. We urge the district court to move toward extricating itself from the toils of this litigation as soon as it can do so without defaulting on its responsibilities under the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of the Secretary's motion to vacate or terminate the pertinent portions of the existing consent decree. We take no view of the district court's procedural order, <i>see supra</i> Part II, as we lack jurisdiction to review that order on this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.

The Secretary offers no developed argumentation on this point and, as matters stand, we believe that this case is not a credible candidate for the exercise of pendent appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Secretary makes a fifth argument: that the relief ordered by the district court requires Puerto Rican officials to act in contravention of local law. The district court refused to address this argument on the ground that the Secretary did not sufficiently specify the nature of the alleged violations. That ruling is supportable, and it precludes reliance on the argument here<i>See Teamsters Union v. Superline Transp.

In all events, the Secretary's appellate presentation suffers from the same lack of specificity; he alleges the violations in the most general terms and does not inform us of where in the record we might find any evidence of them. This lack of developed appellate argumentation constitutes an independently sufficient basis for deeming the argument abandoned. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although we assume arguendo the correctness of the Secretary's assessment of what transpired in 1998, we note that the district court made a series of contemporaneous written findings, which may well have satisfied the narrowness-need-intrusiveness requirements<i>See Morales II,</i> 13 F.Supp.2d at 212 (holding that privatization \"is necessary to protect the members of the plaintiff class from cruel and unusual punishment through constitutionally unacceptable health care services,\" that the remedy \"extends no further than is necessary to correct the violation of the Federal rights of members of the plaintiff class,\" that \"such relief is narrowly drawn,\" and that there \"is no less intrusive means to correct the violation of plaintiffs' Federal rights\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We reject out of hand the Secretary's argument that an order to privatize is a per se violation of the narrowness requirement of the PLRA.
