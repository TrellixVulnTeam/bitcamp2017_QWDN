BUNCHAN,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     James M. Fox, for appellant.\n     Jack W. Pirozzolo, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                       September 2, 2009\n\f            LIPEZ,     Circuit     Judge.    Appellant      James     Bunchan\n\nmasterminded a devastating pyramid scheme that stole nearly twenty\n\nmillion dollars from over five hundred people, most of them of\n\nCambodian origin living in the United States.             Following a jury\n\ntrial, he was convicted of conspiracy, sixteen counts of mail\n\nfraud, and fifteen counts of money laundering. He was sentenced to\n\na term of imprisonment of thirty-five years and ordered to pay\n\nrestitution in the amount of $19,103,121.73.             He now challenges:\n\n1) his convictions, arguing that he was deprived of a fair trial\n\ndue   to   the   district   court's   restriction   on   impeachment    of   a\n\ngovernment witness, and 2) the reasonableness of his sentence.               We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            We recount the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\njury's verdict. United States v. Gonzalez-Ramirez, 561 F.3d 22, 24\n\n(1st Cir. 2009). Appellant was the founder, owner, and director of\n\ntwo   \"multilevel      marketing   companies,\"   World    Marketing    Direct\n\nSelling     (\"WMDS\")     and   Oneuniverseonline    (\"1UOL\").         Bunchan\n\nrepresented to investors that the companies made a profit through\n\nselling cosmetics, health and diet supplements, and other products.\n\nIn reality, the companies sold little of anything and generated\n\nmoney almost exclusively through the recruitment of new investors,\n\nor \"members.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f              Appellant met co-defendant Seng Tan in 1999, around the\n\ntime that he started WMDS, at a WMDS promotional seminar.                     Tan\n\nquickly became the principal recruiter of new investors, and was\n\neventually given the title of \"CEO Executive National Marketing\n\nDirector\" on WMDS and 1UOL promotional materials.               Appellant and\n\nTan were married in 2002.\n\n              Also in 1999, appellant met Christian Rochon, who was a\n\nneighbor in his apartment complex.              He asked Rochon to help him\n\ncreate promotional materials for WMDS.                Appellant, who is from\n\nCambodia, said he wanted an \"American face\" for the company and\n\nsoon made Rochon \"President\" of WMDS.              (Rochon, who is originally\n\nfrom       Canada,   is   Caucasian.)         After   taking   Rochon    to   be\n\nprofessionally photographed, appellant put Rochon's photograph on\n\nWMDS's promotional materials. When 1UOL was created in about 2001,\n\nRochon was also made \"President\" of that company.1             Correspondence\n\nto investors often carried Rochon's name and signature, although\n\nRochon was instructed not to interact with investors.\n\n              Appellant    and   Tan,   who   is   also   Cambodian,    marketed\n\ninvestments in WMDS and 1UOL primarily to members of the Cambodian\n\ncommunity living in the United States. Many of the investors spoke\n\npoor English and had little formal education.                  To recruit new\n\n\n\n       1\n      1UOL was first presented to investors as the retail-store arm\nof WMDS's operation, whereby investors would open stores to sell\nWMDS products. Toward the end of the pyramid schemes, however,\n1UOL was described as a passive investment vehicle, just like WMDS.\n\n                                        -3-\n\finvestors, appellant and Tan held informational seminars, usually\n\nhosted by Tan at the homes of investors.        They often spoke to the\n\nprospective    investors   in   Khmer,   the   Cambodian   language,   and\n\nemphasized their shared experiences as Cambodian immigrants.\n\n              Appellant and Tan represented that WMDS and 1UOL were\n\nprofitable because they generated revenues from the sales of\n\nproducts, and that members earned commissions based on their sales.\n\nInvestors could achieve different levels within the company, either\n\nby making sales, providing a lump-sum payment, recruiting new\n\ninvestors, or doing some combination of the three.          For example,\n\ninvestors could skip the \"Distributor\" level -- and avoid the\n\nrequirement of selling products -- by investing $26,347.86 and\n\nbecoming a \"Director I\".     \"Director I's\" were told that they would\n\nreceive an immediate \"bonus\" of $2,797, followed by a $300 monthly\n\npayment for the rest of their lives and, some were told, through\n\nthe lives of their children and grandchildren.        Appellant created\n\na document that described the \"Director I\" level to distribute at\n\npromotional seminars.      The document read, in part:\n\n          You will get $300.00 each and every month for\n          the rest of your life and pass on down to your\n          children after your death . . . You will see\n          this money working for you while you are\n          sleeping . . . . Our National Marketing\n          Director of W.M.D.S., Inc., knowing exactly\n          how you feel about your $26,347.86 which\n          becomes    a   permanent    investment    with\n          W.M.D.S. . . . you should not be worry [sic]\n          about loosing [sic] your one [sic] of a life\n          time $26,347.86 investment at all. W.M.D.S.,\n          Inc., has an absolute responsibility to take\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           care you [sic] and your family for life. Your\n           investment can be inherited to your children\n           and their generation to come . . . . Because\n           you are the owner of the W.M.D.S., Inc., it is\n           completely different from investing in stock\n           that will go up or down and loose [sic] money.\n           . . . Do not forget that you are a special\n           person who has the best opportunity to meet\n           this company first . . . . W.M.D.S. urges you\n           to sign up now or you will miss your best\n           chance of fulfilling your American Dream.\n\n\nInvestors were also encouraged to become \"Gold Directors\" by\n\ninvesting $130,000 to $160,000.             Gold Directors were promised\n\n$2,500 in unending monthly payments.\n\n           Appellant and Tan encouraged people who did not have\n\nenough cash to borrow money by taking out second mortgages and home\n\ninvestment loans, and many investors did so.               The government\n\nsubmitted at sentencing that more than 150 people had secured\n\nmortgages or borrowed from their retirement accounts to finance\n\ntheir investments in WMDS or 1UOL.\n\n           Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Special Agent Troy Niro\n\ntestified at trial that while investors were contributing money to\n\nWMDS, appellant was using the company coffers like a personal bank\n\naccount   to   pay   for   personal    expenses   and   furnish   a   lavish\n\nlifestyle. He owned several luxury cars, a home in Miami, Florida,\n\nand an expensive yacht named after himself (the \"James B\").            Other\n\nexpenses reflecting his lavish lifestyle, as testified to by Agent\n\nNiro, included: $5,000 spent on hotel room service for two people\n\nin one night, $150,000 spent on diamonds, and $23,000 spent on\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fhairpieces.2    Between 2000 and 2005, appellant also spent over $3.8\n\nmillion at casinos.       He often wrote large checks to casinos from\n\ncompany accounts containing investor funds, at one time writing a\n\nsingle check for $238,370 from the 1UOL account to a Las Vegas\n\ncasino.3       Agent    Niro's   investigation   revealed    that    Bunchan\n\nappropriated at least $3.7 million of investors' funds for himself\n\nand spent an additional $280,000 of investor money on his ex-wife\n\nand other family members.4         Appellant also kept family members,\n\nsuch as his ex-wife and his son, on the payroll of the company even\n\nthough they did not work there.\n\n           Beginning in early 2005, Bunchan and Tan began having\n\ndifficulties recruiting enough new members to meet WMDS and 1UOL's\n\nobligations to existing members.        By June 2005, the companies had\n\naltogether     ceased   making   monthly   payments   to    most    of   their\n\ninvestors, and investors began to complain.           On August 15, 2005,\n\nBunchan had a letter sent to investors falsely blaming the delay on\n\n     2\n      Appellant inappropriately labeled much of his spending, such\nas his children's tuition and tennis lessons, gambling, purchases\nfrom Louis Vuitton, and his hairpieces, as \"business expenses\" on\ncompany records.\n     3\n        About $500,000 of the money appellant spent on casinos came\nfrom Bunchan's personal accounts, while the rest came from company\naccounts containing investor funds. Of the $3.8 million spent on\ncasinos, $1.2 million was sent back to appellant's personal bank\naccount from the casinos; appellant later put some, but not all, of\nthat money back into the companies' accounts. Agent Niro was not\nable to identify any source of income to appellant during 2000-2005\nother than WMDS and 1UOL.\n     4\n        Approximately $500,000 of the investor funds went to Seng\nTan and $300,000 to Christian Rochon.\n\n                                     -6-\n\ftechnological problems and asking for investors' patience until\n\nSeptember. In September, appellant directed that another letter be\n\nsent   to   investors,    again    blaming      the    delay       on    technological\n\nproblems, and explaining that the company was installing \"costly\"\n\nnew upgrades to its check-writing technology.                 Meanwhile, Tan told\n\ninvestors that the delay was caused by computer problems and,\n\nlater, by a disruption in the companies' bank accounts caused by\n\nHurricane Katrina.       During this time, appellant hired attorneys to\n\nthreaten    investors     who    were    complaining         about       their   missed\n\npayments.      The    letters     stated,      in     part,    \"[Y]our        continued\n\ninterference with WMDS and 1UOL's business affairs will be met with\n\nthe full force of the law and WMDS and 1UOL will make you pay for\n\nyour transgressions with all of your personal assets, including\n\nyour personal residence.\"\n\n            In mid-November 2005, appellant, Tan, and Rochon were\n\narrested by the federal authorities for mail fraud due to their\n\nactivities with WMDS and 1UOL.                While in jail awaiting trial,\n\nappellant initiated a murder-for-hire plot that targeted people he\n\nbelieved    might    testify    against    him,       such    as    Rochon,      several\n\ninvestors who had vociferously complained, and eventually the\n\nAssistant United States Attorney prosecuting his case.                        Appellant\n\ndiscussed    his    intentions    with    another      inmate,          who   eventually\n\nnotified the authorities and agreed to cooperate as a confidential\n\ninformant in an undercover investigation.                    In the course of the\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\finvestigation, undercover operators gave appellant the name of a\n\n\"hit man,\" actually an undercover FBI agent, to whom appellant\n\nmailed a list of people he wanted killed.              He had grouped his\n\ntargets into three tiers, in order of priority, and included the\n\nprices he was willing to pay for each \"hit\" (ranging from $10,000\n\nto $20,000).     The FBI also recorded a conversation between the\n\nconfidential informant and appellant in which appellant explained\n\nthat he also wished the hired killer to assassinate the spouses and\n\nchildren of several people named on the list.5\n\n          A    federal   grand   jury   returned   a   second   superseding\n\nindictment against appellant, Tan, and Rochon on August 17, 2006.\n\nAppellant was indicted on all forty counts of the indictment, which\n\nincluded one count of conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371,\n\ntwenty-four counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341,\n\nand fifteen counts of engaging in monetary transactions in proceeds\n\nof an unlawful activity, a form of money laundering, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1957.      On June 4, 2007, the first day of trial,\n\nRochon agreed to plead guilty to seven counts of the indictment,\n\nincluding the conspiracy count, some mail fraud counts, and some\n\n\n\n     5\n       On May 4, 2009, following a jury trial, appellant was\nseparately convicted in the District Court of Massachusetts of\nusing a facility of interstate commerce to commit murder-for-hire,\n18 U.S.C. § 1958, and solicitation of a crime of violence, 18\nU.S.C. § 373, for this conduct. He was sentenced to twenty-five\nyears imprisonment, with the first five years of that sentence to\nbe served concurrently with his sentence in this case.      United\nStates v. Bunchan, No. 07-cr-10085-DPW (D. Mass.).\n\n                                   -8-\n\fcounts of engaging in monetary transactions in proceeds of an\n\nunlawful activity.      Rochon testified for the government during the\n\neleven-day jury trial. The jury convicted appellant of conspiracy,\n\nsixteen   counts   of    mail   fraud,     and   fifteen   counts   of   money\n\nlaundering.     Tan was convicted of conspiracy, sixteen counts of\n\nmail fraud, and four counts of money laundering.6\n\n              The Office of Probation prepared a presentence report\n\n(\"PSR\") calculating appellant's base offense level (\"BOL\") at\n\nseven.7   To this BOL, the PSR added: a twenty-level enhancement\n\nbecause the offense involved a loss of more than $7 million but\n\nless than $20 million (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(K)); a six-level\n\nenhancement because the offense involved more than 250 victims\n\n(U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(2)(C)); a six-level enhancement because the\n\noffense   involved      the   use   of   sophisticated     means    (U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2B1.1(b)(9)(C)); a two-level enhancement because the offense\n\nsubstantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100\n\nor more victims (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(13)(B)(iii))8; a two-level\n\n     6\n       Tan initiated an appeal to this court, but later moved to\nvoluntarily dismiss the appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 42. Her appeal was dismissed on September 5,\n2007.\n     7\n        The PSR applied the 2007 Guidelines, and we cite to those\nGuidelines.\n     8\n         Although the endangerment of the solvency or financial\nsecurity of 100 or more victims would normally occasion a four-\nlevel enhancement, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(13)(B)(iii), the guidelines\nstate that the cumulative adjustments from sections 2B1.1(b)(2) and\n2B1.1(b)(13)(B) shall not exceed eight levels.             U.S.S.G.\n§ 2B1.1(b)(13)(C).   Because a six-level enhancement was applied\n\n                                     -9-\n\fenhancement for abuse of a position of trust (U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3); a\n\nfour-level enhancement because appellant was the organizer of a\n\ncriminal activity that was extensive (U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a)); a two-\n\nlevel enhancement because the offense targeted vulnerable victims\n\n(U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b)(1)); and, finally, a two-level enhancement for\n\nobstruction of justice because appellant initiated the murder-for-\n\nhire plot targeting witnesses against him and the prosecutor of his\n\ncase (U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1).     These enhancements produced a total\n\noffense level (\"TOL\") of forty-seven, which exceeds the highest TOL\n\ncontemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines' sentencing table.   The\n\nPSR placed appellant in Criminal History Category I (\"CHC I\"). The\n\nresultant Guideline Sentence Range (\"GSR\") was life imprisonment.\n\n          On November 28, 2007, the district court conducted a\n\nsentencing hearing in appellant's case.    The government, noting\n\nthat a TOL of forty-seven is \"literally off the chart\" because the\n\nmaximum TOL contemplated by the Guideline sentencing table is\n\nforty-three,9 nonetheless recommended that the court impose a\n\nbelow-guideline sentence of thirty-five years.    Appellant argued\n\nthat, due to his age (fifty-eight at the time of sentencing), even\n\n\n\npursuant to 2B1.1(b)(2), the Office of Probation only recommended\na two-level enhancement pursuant to subsection (b)(13). (We note\nthat as of the 2008 edition of the Guidelines, the enhancement for\nendangerment of the solvency or financial security of 100 or more\nvictims is found at U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1.(b)(14)(iii)).\n     9\n       No matter a defendant's CHC, the Guidelines prescribe \"life\"\n(and not a true sentencing range such as \"360 months - life\") for\nan offense level of forty-three.\n\n                               -10-\n\fa thirty-five year sentence was equivalent to \"putting him in\n\nprison for the rest of his life,\" and would be disproportionate to\n\nthe sentences in other financial fraud cases.          He requested a\n\nmaximum sentence of ten years of imprisonment.      The district court\n\naccepted the government's recommendation and sentenced appellant to\n\nthirty-five years of imprisonment, to be followed by two years of\n\nsupervised    release,   and     restitution   in    the   amount    of\n\n$13,728,985.52, to be paid jointly and severally with Tan and\n\nRochon.   On February 14, 2008, the district court amended the\n\njudgment of restitution to $19,103,121.73, also to be paid jointly\n\nand severally with Tan and Rochon.\n\n          This appeal followed.\n\n                                   II.\n\n          Appellant argues that he was deprived of a fair trial\n\nbecause the district court erroneously restricted his impeachment\n\nof a witness against him, Christian Rochon. We review the district\n\ncourt's evidentiary ruling restricting impeachment for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   United States v. Shinderman, 515 F.3d 5, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n          Appellant sought to cross-examine Rochon about criminal\n\ncharges that were currently pending against him in Massachusetts\n\nstate court for indecent assault and battery of a child.            The\n\ncharges alleged that Rochon had engaged in illegal sexual contact\n\nwith his nephew, a minor.      Before trial, the government sought to\n\nexclude reference to the state charges or, in the alternative, to\n\n                                  -11-\n\flimit the inquiry about the charges. Appellant opposed the motion,\n\narguing that the inquiry was permissible under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 608(b) as a specific instance of prior conduct relevant to\n\nthe witness's character for truthfulness, and, further, relevant to\n\nshow bias because Rochon might believe that he would receive better\n\ntreatment on the state charges if he testified favorably for the\n\nUnited States in the federal criminal case.\n\n            Although    the    district     court    initially      granted      the\n\ngovernment's motion to preclude the inquiry, it reconsidered its\n\nruling at trial.     After a voir dire of Rochon, the district court\n\npermitted appellant to examine Rochon about the pending state court\n\nassault charges but ordered that he could not inquire into the\n\nnature of the charges, stating \"I am going to let you ask the\n\nquestion about whether there is an assault charge pending in the\n\nAttleboro District Court.       I am not going to permit any reference\n\nto the nature of the assault. I find that far too prejudicial under\n\nRule 403.\"    Appellant challenges that ruling.\n\n            Federal Rule of Evidence 403 provides that \"[a]lthough\n\nrelevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\n\nsubstantially     outweighed    by   the    danger    of    unfair       prejudice,\n\nconfusion    of   the   issues,      or    misleading      the     jury,    or    by\n\nconsiderations     of   undue    delay,     waste    of    time,    or     needless\n\npresentation of cumulative evidence.\"          Because \"Rule 403 judgments\n\nare typically battlefield determinations, and great deference is\n\nowed to the trial court's superior coign of vantage,\" Shinderman,\n\n                                     -12-\n\f515 F.3d at 17, \"[o]nly rarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling\n\ncircumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate\n\nrecord, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning\n\nthe relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\"\n\nFreeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n           We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's\n\nrestriction   of    appellant's      cross-examination       of   Rochon.    The\n\ndistrict court's ruling allowed appellant to raise the possibility\n\nthat Rochon had a motive to ingratiate himself with the government\n\nby testifying against appellant.           Appellant inquired into whether\n\nRochon perceived that he would receive lighter treatment on the\n\nstate   charges    if    he   testified    favorably   for    the   government.\n\nExposing the nature of the pending state charges was not necessary\n\nto   establish     the   potential    of   bias   resulting       from   Rochon's\n\nexpectations.\n\n           Furthermore, Rule 608(b) only permits inquiry into prior\n\nconduct if the conduct is probative of the witness's character for\n\ntruthfulness or untruthfulness. The district court's determination\n\nthat the nature of the sexual assault charges was not sufficiently\n\nprobative of Rochon's character for truthfulness to outweigh the\n\nserious danger of prejudicing the jury against him was well within\n\nits discretion.      See United States v. Span, 170 F.3d 798, 803 (7th\n\nCir. 1999) (holding that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in restricting impeachment of government witness to\n\ninquiry about the existence of felony charges against him when\n\n                                      -13-\n\frestriction prohibited defendant from exposing that the charge was\n\nfor first degree sexual assault of a child);     United States v.\n\nRabinowitz, 578 F.2d 910, 912 (2d Cir. 1978) (\"We fail to see the\n\nlogical relevance of the evidence sought to be adduced [--] prior\n\nacts of sodomy upon young children and consequent psychiatric\n\ntreatment therefor [--] to the credibility of the witness.     The\n\nevidence's bearing on the witness's propensity to tell the truth\n\nwas simply too tenuous for us to hold that the district judge\n\nabused his discretion in excluding it.\").\n\n          Finding no error in the district court's limitations on\n\ncross-examination, we affirm appellant's conviction.10\n\n                               III.\n\n          Appellant also challenges his sentence, arguing that it\n\nwas unreasonable.   We review the reasonableness of a sentence\n\n\"under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\" Gall v. United\n\nStates, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591 (2007).\n\n          In determining a sentence, district courts should first\n\ncalculate a defendant's GSR, which \"serve[s] as the sentencing\n\ncourt's 'starting point' or 'initial benchmark.'\" United States v.\n\nMartin, 520 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Gall, 128 S.Ct. at\n\n\n\n     10\n          Although appellant tries to elevate his evidentiary\nargument to a constitutional claim under the Sixth Amendment right\nof confrontation, that argument is advanced so perfunctorily that\nwe deem it waived. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\nCir. 1990). In any event, our analysis of the district court's\nappropriate exercise of its discretion answers any possible\nconstitutional claim.\n\n                               -14-\n\f596).    But \"the sentencing court may not mechanically assume that\n\nthe GSR frames the boundaries of a reasonable sentence in every\n\ncase.\"   Id. at 91.   The court is obligated to consider whether a\n\nguideline sentence is appropriate, taking into account the factors\n\nset forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) to ensure that the sentence is\n\n\"sufficient, but not greater than necessary.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\nThose factors include, inter alia, the seriousness of the offense,\n\nthe need for deterrence, and the need \"to protect the public from\n\nfurther crimes of the defendant.\"\n\n           The district court first calculated appellant's GSR --\n\nlife imprisonment -- and then varied downward from the GSR after\n\nconsidering the section 3553 factors and the recommendation of the\n\ngovernment.   Appellant argues that the district court should have\n\nvaried further downward from the GSR.                We conclude that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a thirty-\n\nfive-year term of imprisonment.\n\n           During trial and at sentencing, the district court heard\n\nseveral victims' stories of the crushing losses they suffered as a\n\nresult of appellant's crime.       For example, one victim explained at\n\nsentencing that he had lost $220,000 and his home and was living in\n\na shelter without heat or a kitchen.          Another victim testified at\n\nsentencing that due to her lost investment of $130,000 she had her\n\ncar   repossessed   and   was    having    trouble   paying   her   mortgage.\n\nAnother spoke of how she had invested $446,000 and now described\n\nherself as \"homeless.\"          Several other victims testified or had\n\n                                    -15-\n\ftheir   stories     included    in    the    PSR,    but   still    their      voices\n\nrepresented only a small fraction of the 500 people targeted by\n\nappellant's scheme.          According to the PSR, over 150 victims had\n\nrefinanced     their    homes    or   used    retirement       savings    to    make\n\ninvestments.\n\n           The district judge remarked at sentencing that he was\n\n\"impressed   with      the   large    lack    of    remorse\"   on   the     part   of\n\nappellant.   He also noted that he had \"considered the enormity of\n\nthe harm done to the victims in this case\" and further explained\n\nthat:\n\n           I have also been influenced by the fact that I\n           agree having heard the government's case\n           presented at trial, that the scheme at issue\n           was a fraud . . . virtually from its\n           inception. I have considered the particular\n           vulnerability   and   susceptibility     of  the\n           victims of the scheme to the appeals that were\n           made to them based on ethnicity and a shared\n           background of tragic life experiences . . . .\n           I have also considered the flagrant manner in\n           which   the   defendants,    particularly    Mr.\n           Bunchan, diverted the proceeds of the scheme\n           to their personal enrichment and amusement. I\n           have considered the necessity of protecting\n           the public and others from schemes like this\n           in the future, which I believe calls for a\n           high component of deterrence in any sentence\n           imposed . . . . Finally, I respect, and\n           ordinarily    agree,    with     Mr.    George's\n           proportionality argument, which has persuaded\n           me before in other sentencings.      What makes\n           Mr. Bunchan's case different, however, in my\n           judgment, is his involvement and attempt to\n           involve himself in the gravest form of\n           obstruction   of   justice;    the   murder   of\n           witnesses and the prosecutor in the case.\n           That, to a court system, is an absolutely\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f           unforgivable crime over and above the crimes\n           for which the defendant is now convicted.11\n\n           Even     after     noting      these       aggravating     aspects      of\n\nappellant's    case,    the   district        court    decided   to     accept    the\n\ngovernment's      recommendation     to    vary       downward   from    the     GSR,\n\nsentencing appellant to thirty-five years of imprisonment.                        We\n\nrecognize that, due to appellant's age, the thirty-five year\n\nsentence is practically equivalent to a life sentence, and that\n\nappellant has also been ordered to pay substantial restitution in\n\naddition to imprisonment.          Nonetheless, we conclude that \"[t]he\n\nsentence   imposed     here   is   grounded     on     a   sensible   (though     not\n\nobligatory) view of the circumstances and the outcome -- given\n\nthose circumstances and the length of the sentence actually imposed\n\n-- is plainly defensible.\"         Martin, 520 F.3d at 96.            There was no\n\nabuse of discretion in the district court's imposition of a thirty-\n\n\n\n\n     11\n        Appellant makes a poorly developed argument that the\ndistrict court improperly punished appellant \"for attempted murder\nwithout jury trial and conviction, by way of the guidelines\nenhancement for obstruction of justice.\" This argument is waived\nbecause of its perfunctory quality.      Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17\n(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by\nsome effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").\nNonetheless, we note that there was no error in the district\ncourt's finding of facts by a preponderance of the evidence to\nsupport the U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 enhancement for obstruction of\njustice, as facts supporting such enhancements may be found by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See United States v. Gonsalves, 435\nF.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[J]udicial fact-finding alone does\nnot violate a defendant's sixth amendment rights so long as the\ndefendant is sentenced at or below the statutory maximum for the\noffense of conviction.\").\n\n                                       -17-\n\ffive year term of imprisonment, two years of supervised release,\n\nand restitution in the amount of $19,103,121.73.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f",

Following a jury trial, he was convicted of conspiracy, sixteen counts of mail fraud, and fifteen counts of money laundering. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of thirty-five years and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $19,103,121.73. He now challenges: 1) his convictions, arguing that he was deprived of a fair trial due to the district court's restriction on impeachment of a government witness, and 2) the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recount the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Ramirez,</i> 561 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir.2009). Appellant was the founder, owner, and director of two \"multilevel marketing companies,\" World Marketing Direct Selling (\"WMDS\") and Oneuniverseonline (\"1UOL\"). Bunchan represented to investors that the companies made a profit through selling cosmetics, health and diet supplements, and other products. In reality, the companies sold little of anything and generated money almost exclusively through the recruitment of new investors, or \"members.\"</p>\n<p>Appellant met co-defendant Seng Tan in 1999, around the time that he started WMDS, at a WMDS promotional seminar. Tan quickly became the principal recruiter of new investors, and was eventually given the title of \"CEO Executive National Marketing Director\" on WMDS and 1UOL promotional materials. Appellant and Tan were married in 2002.</p>\n<p>Also in 1999, appellant met Christian Rochon, who was a neighbor in his apartment complex. He asked Rochon to help him create promotional materials for WMDS. Appellant, who is from Cambodia, said he wanted an \"American face\" for the company and soon made Rochon \"President\" of WMDS. (Rochon, who is originally from Canada, is Caucasian.) After taking Rochon to be professionally photographed, appellant put Rochon's photograph on WMDS's promotional materials. When 1UOL was created in about 2001, Rochon was also made \"President\" of that company.<sup>[1]</sup> Correspondence to investors often carried Rochon's name and signature, although Rochon was instructed not to interact with investors.</p>\n<p>Appellant and Tan, who is also Cambodian, marketed investments in WMDS and 1UOL primarily to members of the Cambodian community living in the United States. Many of the investors spoke poor English and had little formal education. To recruit new investors, appellant and Tan held informational seminars, usually hosted by Tan at the homes of investors. They often spoke to the prospective investors in Khmer, the Cambodian language, and emphasized their shared experiences as Cambodian immigrants.</p>\n<p>Appellant and Tan represented that WMDS and 1UOL were profitable because they generated revenues from the sales of products, and that members earned commissions based on their sales. Investors could achieve different levels within the company, either by making sales, providing a lump-sum payment, recruiting new investors, or doing some combination of the three. For example, investors could skip the \"Distributor\" level  and avoid the requirement of selling products  by investing $26,347.86 and becoming a \"Director I\". \"Director I's\" were told that they would receive an immediate \"bonus\" of $2,797, followed by a $300 monthly payment for the rest of their lives and, some were told, through the lives of their children <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> and grandchildren. Appellant created a document that described the \"Director I\" level to distribute at promotional seminars. The document read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>You will get $300.00 each and every month for the rest of your life and pass on down to your children after your death ... You will see this money working for you while you are sleeping.... Our National Marketing Director of W.M.D.S., Inc., knowing exactly how you feel about your $26,347.86 which becomes a permanent investment with W.M.D.S. .... you should not be worry [sic] about loosing [sic] your one [sic] of a life time $26,347.86 investment at all. W.M.D.S., Inc., has an absolute responsibility to take care you [sic] and your family for life. Your investment can be inherited to your children and their generation to come.... Because you are the owner of the W.M.D.S., Inc., it is completely different from investing in stock that will go up or down and loose [sic] money.... Do not forget that you are a special person who has the best opportunity to meet this company first.... W.M.D.S. urges you to sign up now or you will miss your best chance of fulfilling your American Dream.</blockquote>\n<p>Investors were also encouraged to become \"Gold Directors\" by investing $130,000 to $160,000. Gold Directors were promised $2,500 in unending monthly payments.</p>\n<p>Appellant and Tan encouraged people who did not have enough cash to borrow money by taking out second mortgages and home investment loans, and many investors did so. The government submitted at sentencing that more than 150 people had secured mortgages or borrowed from their retirement accounts to finance their investments in WMDS or 1UOL.</p>\n<p>Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Special Agent Troy Niro testified at trial that while investors were contributing money to WMDS, appellant was using the company coffers like a personal bank account to pay for personal expenses and furnish a lavish lifestyle. He owned several luxury cars, a home in Miami, Florida, and an expensive yacht named after himself (the \"James B\"). Other expenses reflecting his lavish lifestyle, as testified to by Agent Niro, included: $5,000 spent on hotel room service for two people in one night, $150,000 spent on diamonds, and $23,000 spent on hairpieces.<sup>[2]</sup> Between 2000 and 2005, appellant also spent over $3.8 million at casinos. He often wrote large checks to casinos from company accounts containing investor funds, at one time writing a single check for $238,370 from the 1UOL account to a Las Vegas casino.<sup>[3]</sup> Agent Niro's investigation revealed that Bunchan appropriated at least $3.7 million of investors' funds for himself and spent an additional $280,000 of investor money on his ex-wife and other family members.<sup>[4]</sup> Appellant also kept family members, such as his ex-wife and his son, on the payroll of the company even though they did not work there.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> Beginning in early 2005, Bunchan and Tan began having difficulties recruiting enough new members to meet WMDS and 1UOL's obligations to existing members. By June 2005, the companies had altogether ceased making monthly payments to most of their investors, and investors began to complain. On August 15, 2005, Bunchan had a letter sent to investors falsely blaming the delay on technological problems and asking for investors' patience until September. In September, appellant directed that another letter be sent to investors, again blaming the delay on technological problems, and explaining that the company was installing \"costly\" new upgrades to its check-writing technology. Meanwhile, Tan told investors that the delay was caused by computer problems and, later, by a disruption in the companies' bank accounts caused by Hurricane Katrina. During this time, appellant hired attorneys to threaten investors who were complaining about their missed payments. The letters stated, in part, \"[Y]our continued interference with WMDS and 1UOL's business affairs will be met with the full force of the law and WMDS and 1UOL will make you pay for your transgressions with all of your personal assets, including your personal residence.\"</p>\n<p>In mid-November 2005, appellant, Tan, and Rochon were arrested by the federal authorities for mail fraud due to their activities with WMDS and 1UOL. While in jail awaiting trial, appellant initiated a murder-for-hire plot that targeted people he believed might testify against him, such as Rochon, several investors who had vociferously complained, and eventually the Assistant United States Attorney prosecuting his case. Appellant discussed his intentions with another inmate, who eventually notified the authorities and agreed to cooperate as a confidential informant in an undercover investigation. In the course of the investigation, undercover operators gave appellant the name of a \"hit man,\" actually an undercover FBI agent, to whom appellant mailed a list of people he wanted killed. He had grouped his targets into three tiers, in order of priority, and included the prices he was willing to pay for each \"hit\" (ranging from $10,000 to $20,000). The FBI also recorded a conversation between the confidential informant and appellant in which appellant explained that he also wished the hired killer to assassinate the spouses and children of several people named on the list.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>A federal grand jury returned a second superseding indictment against appellant, Tan, and Rochon on August 17, 2006. Appellant was indicted on all forty counts of the indictment, which included one count of conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, twenty-four counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and fifteen counts of engaging in monetary transactions in proceeds of an unlawful activity, a form of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957. On June 4, 2007, the first day of trial, Rochon agreed to plead guilty to seven counts of the indictment, including the conspiracy count, some mail fraud counts, and some counts of engaging in monetary transactions in proceeds of an unlawful activity. Rochon testified for the government during the eleven-day jury trial. The jury convicted appellant of conspiracy, sixteen counts of mail fraud, and fifteen counts of money laundering. Tan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> was convicted of conspiracy, sixteen counts of mail fraud, and four counts of money laundering.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Office of Probation prepared a presentence report (\"PSR\") calculating appellant's base offense level (\"BOL\") at seven.<sup>[7]</sup> To this BOL, the PSR added: a twenty-level enhancement because the offense involved a loss of more than $7 million but less than $20 million (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(K)); a six-level enhancement because the offense involved more than 250 victims (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(2)(C)); a six-level enhancement because the offense involved the use of sophisticated means (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(9)(C)); a two-level enhancement because the offense substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(13)(B)(iii));<sup>[8]</sup> a two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of trust (U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3); a four-level enhancement because appellant was the organizer of a criminal activity that was extensive (U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a)); a two-level enhancement because the offense targeted vulnerable victims (U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b)(1)); and, finally, a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice because appellant initiated the murder-for-hire plot targeting witnesses against him and the prosecutor of his case (U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1). These enhancements produced a total offense level (\"TOL\") of forty-seven, which exceeds the highest TOL contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines' sentencing table. The PSR placed appellant in Criminal History Category I (\"CHC I\"). The resultant Guideline Sentence Range (\"GSR\") was life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>On November 28, 2007, the district court conducted a sentencing hearing in appellant's case. The government, noting that a TOL of forty-seven is \"literally off the chart\" because the maximum TOL contemplated by the Guideline sentencing table is forty-three,<sup>[9]</sup> nonetheless recommended that the court impose a below-guideline sentence of thirty-five years. Appellant argued that, due to his age (fifty-eight at the time of sentencing), even a thirty-five year sentence was equivalent to \"putting him in prison for the rest of his life,\" and would be disproportionate to the sentences in other financial fraud cases. He requested a maximum sentence of ten years of imprisonment. The district court accepted the government's recommendation and sentenced appellant to thirty-five years of imprisonment, to be followed by two years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $13,728,985.52, to be paid jointly and severally with Tan and Rochon. On February 14, 2008, the district court amended the judgment of restitution to $19,103,121.73, also to be paid jointly and severally with Tan and Rochon.</p>\n<p>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> II.</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that he was deprived of a fair trial because the district court erroneously restricted his impeachment of a witness against him, Christian Rochon. We review the district court's evidentiary ruling restricting impeachment for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Shinderman,</i> 515 F.3d 5, 16 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Appellant sought to cross-examine Rochon about criminal charges that were currently pending against him in Massachusetts state court for indecent assault and battery of a child. The charges alleged that Rochon had engaged in illegal sexual contact with his nephew, a minor. Before trial, the government sought to exclude reference to the state charges or, in the alternative, to limit the inquiry about the charges. Appellant opposed the motion, arguing that the inquiry was permissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) as a specific instance of prior conduct relevant to the witness's character for truthfulness, and, further, relevant to show bias because Rochon might believe that he would receive better treatment on the state charges if he testified favorably for the United States in the federal criminal case.</p>\n<p>Although the district court initially granted the government's motion to preclude the inquiry, it reconsidered its ruling at trial. After a voir dire of Rochon, the district court permitted appellant to examine Rochon about the pending state court assault charges but ordered that he could not inquire into the nature of the charges, stating \"I am going to let you ask the question about whether there is an assault charge pending in the Attleboro District Court. I am not going to permit any reference to the nature of the assault. I find that far too prejudicial under Rule 403.\" Appellant challenges that ruling.</p>\n<p>Federal Rule of Evidence 403 provides that \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Because \"Rule 403 judgments are typically battlefield determinations, and great deference is owed to the trial court's superior coign of vantage,\" <i>Shinderman,</i> 515 F.3d at 17, \"[o]nly rarely  and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances  will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Freeman v. Package Mach. Co.,</i> 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p>We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's restriction of appellant's cross-examination of Rochon. The district court's ruling allowed appellant to raise the possibility that Rochon had a motive to ingratiate himself with the government by testifying against appellant. Appellant inquired into whether Rochon perceived that he would receive lighter treatment on the state charges if he testified favorably for the government. Exposing the nature of the pending state charges was not necessary to establish the potential of bias resulting from Rochon's expectations.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Rule 608(b) only permits inquiry into prior conduct if the conduct is probative of the witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. The district court's determination that the nature of the sexual assault charges was not sufficiently probative of Rochon's character for truthfulness to outweigh the serious danger of prejudicing the jury against him was well within its discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Span,</i> 170 F.3d 798, 803 (7th Cir. 1999) (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in restricting impeachment of government witness to inquiry <span class=\"star-pagination\">*72</span> about the existence of felony charges against him when restriction prohibited defendant from exposing that the charge was for first degree sexual assault of a child); <i>United States v. Rabinowitz,</i> 578 F.2d 910, 912 (2d Cir.1978) (\"We fail to see the logical relevance of the evidence sought to be adduced [] prior acts of sodomy upon young children and consequent psychiatric treatment therefor [] to the credibility of the witness. The evidence's bearing on the witness's propensity to tell the truth was simply too tenuous for us to hold that the district judge abused his discretion in excluding it.\").</p>\n<p>Finding no error in the district court's limitations on cross-examination, we affirm appellant's conviction.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Appellant also challenges his sentence, arguing that it was unreasonable. We review the reasonableness of a sentence \"under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\" <i>Gall v. United States,</i> 552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p>In determining a sentence, district courts should-first calculate a defendant's GSR, which \"serve[s] as the sentencing court's `starting point' or `initial benchmark.'\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 596). But \"the sentencing court may not mechanically assume that the GSR frames the boundaries of a reasonable sentence in every case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 91. The court is obligated to consider whether a guideline sentence is appropriate, taking into account the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) to ensure that the sentence is \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Those factors include, <i>inter alia,</i> the seriousness of the offense, the need for deterrence, and the need \"to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\"</p>\n<p>The district court first calculated appellant's GSR  life imprisonment  and then varied downward from the GSR after considering the section 3553 factors and the recommendation of the government. Appellant argues that the district court should have varied further downward from the GSR. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a thirty-five-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>During trial and at sentencing, the district court heard several victims' stories of the crushing losses they suffered as a result of appellant's crime. For example, one victim explained at sentencing that he had lost $220,000 and his home and was living in a shelter without heat or a kitchen. Another victim testified at sentencing that due to her lost investment of $130,000 she had her car repossessed and was having trouble paying her mortgage. Another spoke of how she had invested $446,000 and now described herself as \"homeless.\" Several other victims testified or had their stories included in the PSR, but still their voices represented only a small fraction of the 500 people targeted by appellant's scheme. According to the PSR, over 150 victims had refinanced their homes or used retirement savings to make investments.</p>\n<p>The district judge remarked at sentencing that he was \"impressed with the large lack of remorse\" on the part of appellant. He also noted that he had \"considered the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> enormity of the harm done to the victims in this case\" and further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote>I have also been influenced by the fact that I agree having heard the government's case presented at trial, that the scheme at issue was a fraud ... virtually from its inception. I have considered the particular vulnerability and susceptibility of the victims of the scheme to the appeals that were made to them based on ethnicity and a shared background of tragic life experiences.... I have also considered the flagrant manner in which the defendants, particularly Mr. Bunchan, diverted the proceeds of the scheme to their personal enrichment and amusement. I have considered the necessity of protecting the public and others from schemes like this in the future, which I believe calls for a high component of deterrence in any sentence imposed.... Finally, I respect, and ordinarily agree, with Mr. George's proportionality argument, which has persuaded me before in other sentencings. What makes Mr. Bunchan's case different, however, in my judgment, is his involvement and attempt to involve himself in the gravest form of obstruction of justice; the murder of witnesses and the prosecutor in the case. That, to a court system, is an absolutely unforgivable crime over and above the crimes for which the defendant is now convicted.<sup>[11]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Even after noting these aggravating aspects of appellant's case, the district court decided to accept the government's recommendation to vary downward from the GSR, sentencing appellant to thirty-five years of imprisonment. We recognize that, due to appellant's age, the thirty-five year sentence is practically equivalent to a life sentence, and that appellant has also been ordered to pay substantial restitution in addition to imprisonment. Nonetheless, we conclude that \"[t]he sentence imposed here is grounded on a sensible (though not obligatory) view of the circumstances and the outcome  given those circumstances and the length of the sentence actually imposed  is plainly defensible.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96. There was no abuse of discretion in the district court's imposition of a thirty-five year term of imprisonment, two years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $19,103,121.73.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  1UOL was first presented to investors as the retail-store arm of WMDS's operation, whereby investors would open stores to sell WMDS products. Toward the end of the pyramid schemes, however, 1UOL was described as a passive investment vehicle, just like WMDS.</p>\n<p>[2]  Appellant inappropriately labeled much of his spending, such as his children's tuition and tennis lessons, gambling, purchases from Louis Vuitton, and his hairpieces, as \"business expenses\" on company records.</p>\n<p>[3]  About $500,000 of the money appellant spent on casinos came from Bunchan's personal accounts, while the rest came from company accounts containing investor funds. Of the $3.8 million spent on casinos, $1.2 million was sent back to appellant's personal bank account from the casinos; appellant later put some, but not all, of that money back into the companies' accounts. Agent Niro was not able to identify any source of income to appellant during 2000-2005 other than WMDS and 1UOL.</p>\n<p>[4]  Approximately $500,000 of the investor funds went to Seng Tan and $300,000 to Christian Rochon.</p>\n<p>[5]  On May 4, 2009, following a jury trial, appellant was separately convicted in the District Court of Massachusetts of using a facility of interstate commerce to commit murder-for-hire, 18 U.S.C. § 1958, and solicitation of a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. § 373, for this conduct. He was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment, with the first five years of that sentence to be served concurrently with his sentence in this case. <i>United States v. Bunchan,</i> No. 07-cr-10085-DPW, 2007 WL 3352207 (D.Mass.).</p>\n<p>[6]  Tan initiated an appeal to this court, but later moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42. Her appeal was dismissed on September 5, 2007.</p>\n<p>[7]  The PSR applied the 2007 Guidelines, and we cite to those Guidelines.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the endangerment of the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims would normally occasion a four-level enhancement, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(13)(B)(iii), the guidelines state that the cumulative adjustments from sections 2B1.1(b)(2) and 2B1.1(b)(13)(B) shall not exceed eight levels. U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(13)(C). Because a six-level enhancement was applied pursuant to 2B1.1(b)(2), the Office of Probation only recommended a two-level enhancement pursuant to subsection (b)(13). (We note that as of the 2008 edition of the Guidelines, the enhancement for endangerment of the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims is found at U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1.(b)(14)(iii)).</p>\n<p>[9]  No matter a defendant's CHC, the Guidelines prescribe \"life\" (and not a true sentencing range such as \"360 months  life\") for an offense level of forty-three.</p>\n<p>[10]  Although appellant tries to elevate his evidentiary argument to a constitutional claim under the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, that argument is advanced so perfunctorily that we deem it waived. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). In any event, our analysis of the district court's appropriate exercise of its discretion answers any possible constitutional claim.</p>\n<p>[11]  Appellant makes a poorly developed argument that the district court improperly punished appellant \"for attempted murder without jury trial and conviction, by way of the guidelines enhancement for obstruction of justice.\" This argument is waived because of its perfunctory quality. <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17 (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). Nonetheless, we note that there was no error in the district court's finding of facts by a preponderance of the evidence to support the U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 enhancement for obstruction of justice, as facts supporting such enhancements may be found by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gonsalves,</i> 435 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[J]udicial fact-finding alone does not violate a defendant's sixth amendment rights so long as the defendant is sentenced at or below the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.\").</p>\n\n</div>",

Following a jury trial, he was convicted of conspiracy, sixteen counts of mail fraud, and fifteen counts of money laundering. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of thirty-five years and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $19,103,121.73. He now challenges: 1) his convictions, arguing that he was deprived of a fair trial due to the district court's restriction on impeachment of a government witness, and 2) the reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>We recount the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Ramirez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203748\"><a href=\"/opinion/203748/united-states-v-gonzalez-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.2009). Appellant was the founder, owner, and director of two \"multilevel marketing companies,\" World Marketing Direct Selling (\"WMDS\") and Oneuniverseonline (\"1UOL\"). Bunchan represented to investors that the companies made a profit through selling cosmetics, health and diet supplements, and other products. In reality, the companies sold little of anything and generated money almost exclusively through the recruitment of new investors, or \"members.\"</p>\n<p>Appellant met co-defendant Seng Tan in 1999, around the time that he started WMDS, at a WMDS promotional seminar. Tan quickly became the principal recruiter of new investors, and was eventually given the title of \"CEO Executive National Marketing Director\" on WMDS and 1UOL promotional materials. Appellant and Tan were married in 2002.</p>\n<p>Also in 1999, appellant met Christian Rochon, who was a neighbor in his apartment complex. He asked Rochon to help him create promotional materials for WMDS. Appellant, who is from Cambodia, said he wanted an \"American face\" for the company and soon made Rochon \"President\" of WMDS. (Rochon, who is originally from Canada, is Caucasian.) After taking Rochon to be professionally photographed, appellant put Rochon's photograph on WMDS's promotional materials. When 1UOL was created in about 2001, Rochon was also made \"President\" of that company.<sup>[1]</sup> Correspondence to investors often carried Rochon's name and signature, although Rochon was instructed not to interact with investors.</p>\n<p>Appellant and Tan, who is also Cambodian, marketed investments in WMDS and 1UOL primarily to members of the Cambodian community living in the United States. Many of the investors spoke poor English and had little formal education. To recruit new investors, appellant and Tan held informational seminars, usually hosted by Tan at the homes of investors. They often spoke to the prospective investors in Khmer, the Cambodian language, and emphasized their shared experiences as Cambodian immigrants.</p>\n<p>Appellant and Tan represented that WMDS and 1UOL were profitable because they generated revenues from the sales of products, and that members earned commissions based on their sales. Investors could achieve different levels within the company, either by making sales, providing a lump-sum payment, recruiting new investors, or doing some combination of the three. For example, investors could skip the \"Distributor\" level  and avoid the requirement of selling products  by investing $26,347.86 and becoming a \"Director I\". \"Director I's\" were told that they would receive an immediate \"bonus\" of $2,797, followed by a $300 monthly payment for the rest of their lives and, some were told, through the lives of their children <span class=\"star-pagination\">*68</span> and grandchildren. Appellant created a document that described the \"Director I\" level to distribute at promotional seminars. The document read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>You will get $300.00 each and every month for the rest of your life and pass on down to your children after your death ... You will see this money working for you while you are sleeping.... Our National Marketing Director of W.M.D.S., Inc., knowing exactly how you feel about your $26,347.86 which becomes a permanent investment with W.M.D.S. .... you should not be worry [sic] about loosing [sic] your one [sic] of a life time $26,347.86 investment at all. W.M.D.S., Inc., has an absolute responsibility to take care you [sic] and your family for life. Your investment can be inherited to your children and their generation to come.... Because you are the owner of the W.M.D.S., Inc., it is completely different from investing in stock that will go up or down and loose [sic] money.... Do not forget that you are a special person who has the best opportunity to meet this company first.... W.M.D.S. urges you to sign up now or you will miss your best chance of fulfilling your American Dream.</blockquote>\n<p>Investors were also encouraged to become \"Gold Directors\" by investing $130,000 to $160,000. Gold Directors were promised $2,500 in unending monthly payments.</p>\n<p>Appellant and Tan encouraged people who did not have enough cash to borrow money by taking out second mortgages and home investment loans, and many investors did so. The government submitted at sentencing that more than 150 people had secured mortgages or borrowed from their retirement accounts to finance their investments in WMDS or 1UOL.</p>\n<p>Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") Special Agent Troy Niro testified at trial that while investors were contributing money to WMDS, appellant was using the company coffers like a personal bank account to pay for personal expenses and furnish a lavish lifestyle. He owned several luxury cars, a home in Miami, Florida, and an expensive yacht named after himself (the \"James B\"). Other expenses reflecting his lavish lifestyle, as testified to by Agent Niro, included: $5,000 spent on hotel room service for two people in one night, $150,000 spent on diamonds, and $23,000 spent on hairpieces.<sup>[2]</sup> Between 2000 and 2005, appellant also spent over $3.8 million at casinos. He often wrote large checks to casinos from company accounts containing investor funds, at one time writing a single check for $238,370 from the 1UOL account to a Las Vegas casino.<sup>[3]</sup> Agent Niro's investigation revealed that Bunchan appropriated at least $3.7 million of investors' funds for himself and spent an additional $280,000 of investor money on his ex-wife and other family members.<sup>[4]</sup> Appellant also kept family members, such as his ex-wife and his son, on the payroll of the company even though they did not work there.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*69</span> Beginning in early 2005, Bunchan and Tan began having difficulties recruiting enough new members to meet WMDS and 1UOL's obligations to existing members. By June 2005, the companies had altogether ceased making monthly payments to most of their investors, and investors began to complain. On August 15, 2005, Bunchan had a letter sent to investors falsely blaming the delay on technological problems and asking for investors' patience until September. In September, appellant directed that another letter be sent to investors, again blaming the delay on technological problems, and explaining that the company was installing \"costly\" new upgrades to its check-writing technology. Meanwhile, Tan told investors that the delay was caused by computer problems and, later, by a disruption in the companies' bank accounts caused by Hurricane Katrina. During this time, appellant hired attorneys to threaten investors who were complaining about their missed payments. The letters stated, in part, \"[Y]our continued interference with WMDS and 1UOL's business affairs will be met with the full force of the law and WMDS and 1UOL will make you pay for your transgressions with all of your personal assets, including your personal residence.\"</p>\n<p>In mid-November 2005, appellant, Tan, and Rochon were arrested by the federal authorities for mail fraud due to their activities with WMDS and 1UOL. While in jail awaiting trial, appellant initiated a murder-for-hire plot that targeted people he believed might testify against him, such as Rochon, several investors who had vociferously complained, and eventually the Assistant United States Attorney prosecuting his case. Appellant discussed his intentions with another inmate, who eventually notified the authorities and agreed to cooperate as a confidential informant in an undercover investigation. In the course of the investigation, undercover operators gave appellant the name of a \"hit man,\" actually an undercover FBI agent, to whom appellant mailed a list of people he wanted killed. He had grouped his targets into three tiers, in order of priority, and included the prices he was willing to pay for each \"hit\" (ranging from $10,000 to $20,000). The FBI also recorded a conversation between the confidential informant and appellant in which appellant explained that he also wished the hired killer to assassinate the spouses and children of several people named on the list.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>A federal grand jury returned a second superseding indictment against appellant, Tan, and Rochon on August 17, 2006. Appellant was indicted on all forty counts of the indictment, which included one count of conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, twenty-four counts of mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341, and fifteen counts of engaging in monetary transactions in proceeds of an unlawful activity, a form of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957. On June 4, 2007, the first day of trial, Rochon agreed to plead guilty to seven counts of the indictment, including the conspiracy count, some mail fraud counts, and some counts of engaging in monetary transactions in proceeds of an unlawful activity. Rochon testified for the government during the eleven-day jury trial. The jury convicted appellant of conspiracy, sixteen counts of mail fraud, and fifteen counts of money laundering. Tan <span class=\"star-pagination\">*70</span> was convicted of conspiracy, sixteen counts of mail fraud, and four counts of money laundering.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The Office of Probation prepared a presentence report (\"PSR\") calculating appellant's base offense level (\"BOL\") at seven.<sup>[7]</sup> To this BOL, the PSR added: a twenty-level enhancement because the offense involved a loss of more than $7 million but less than $20 million (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(1)(K)); a six-level enhancement because the offense involved more than 250 victims (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(2)(C)); a six-level enhancement because the offense involved the use of sophisticated means (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(9)(C)); a two-level enhancement because the offense substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims (U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(13)(B)(iii));<sup>[8]</sup> a two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of trust (U.S.S.G. § 3B1.3); a four-level enhancement because appellant was the organizer of a criminal activity that was extensive (U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a)); a two-level enhancement because the offense targeted vulnerable victims (U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b)(1)); and, finally, a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice because appellant initiated the murder-for-hire plot targeting witnesses against him and the prosecutor of his case (U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1). These enhancements produced a total offense level (\"TOL\") of forty-seven, which exceeds the highest TOL contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines' sentencing table. The PSR placed appellant in Criminal History Category I (\"CHC I\"). The resultant Guideline Sentence Range (\"GSR\") was life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>On November 28, 2007, the district court conducted a sentencing hearing in appellant's case. The government, noting that a TOL of forty-seven is \"literally off the chart\" because the maximum TOL contemplated by the Guideline sentencing table is forty-three,<sup>[9]</sup> nonetheless recommended that the court impose a below-guideline sentence of thirty-five years. Appellant argued that, due to his age (fifty-eight at the time of sentencing), even a thirty-five year sentence was equivalent to \"putting him in prison for the rest of his life,\" and would be disproportionate to the sentences in other financial fraud cases. He requested a maximum sentence of ten years of imprisonment. The district court accepted the government's recommendation and sentenced appellant to thirty-five years of imprisonment, to be followed by two years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $13,728,985.52, to be paid jointly and severally with Tan and Rochon. On February 14, 2008, the district court amended the judgment of restitution to $19,103,121.73, also to be paid jointly and severally with Tan and Rochon.</p>\n<p>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*71</span> II.</h2>\n<p>Appellant argues that he was deprived of a fair trial because the district court erroneously restricted his impeachment of a witness against him, Christian Rochon. We review the district court's evidentiary ruling restricting impeachment for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Shinderman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Appellant sought to cross-examine Rochon about criminal charges that were currently pending against him in Massachusetts state court for indecent assault and battery of a child. The charges alleged that Rochon had engaged in illegal sexual contact with his nephew, a minor. Before trial, the government sought to exclude reference to the state charges or, in the alternative, to limit the inquiry about the charges. Appellant opposed the motion, arguing that the inquiry was permissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) as a specific instance of prior conduct relevant to the witness's character for truthfulness, and, further, relevant to show bias because Rochon might believe that he would receive better treatment on the state charges if he testified favorably for the United States in the federal criminal case.</p>\n<p>Although the district court initially granted the government's motion to preclude the inquiry, it reconsidered its ruling at trial. After a voir dire of Rochon, the district court permitted appellant to examine Rochon about the pending state court assault charges but ordered that he could not inquire into the nature of the charges, stating \"I am going to let you ask the question about whether there is an assault charge pending in the Attleboro District Court. I am not going to permit any reference to the nature of the assault. I find that far too prejudicial under Rule 403.\" Appellant challenges that ruling.</p>\n<p>Federal Rule of Evidence 403 provides that \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" Because \"Rule 403 judgments are typically battlefield determinations, and great deference is owed to the trial court's superior coign of vantage,\" <i>Shinderman,</i> 515 F.3d at 17, \"[o]nly rarely  and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances  will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Freeman v.

The district court's ruling allowed appellant to raise the possibility that Rochon had a motive to ingratiate himself with the government by testifying against appellant. Appellant inquired into whether Rochon perceived that he would receive lighter treatment on the state charges if he testified favorably for the government. Exposing the nature of the pending state charges was not necessary to establish the potential of bias resulting from Rochon's expectations.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Rule 608(b) only permits inquiry into prior conduct if the conduct is probative of the witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. The district court's determination that the nature of the sexual assault charges was not sufficiently probative of Rochon's character for truthfulness to outweigh the serious danger of prejudicing the jury against him was well within its discretion. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203196\"><a href=\"/opinion/203196/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 91 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 596). But \"the sentencing court may not mechanically assume that the GSR frames the boundaries of a reasonable sentence in every case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 91. The court is obligated to consider whether a guideline sentence is appropriate, taking into account the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) to ensure that the sentence is \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Those factors include, <i>inter alia,</i> the seriousness of the offense, the need for deterrence, and the need \"to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\"</p>\n<p>The district court first calculated appellant's GSR  life imprisonment  and then varied downward from the GSR after considering the section 3553 factors and the recommendation of the government. Appellant argues that the district court should have varied further downward from the GSR. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a thirty-five-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>During trial and at sentencing, the district court heard several victims' stories of the crushing losses they suffered as a result of appellant's crime. For example, one victim explained at sentencing that he had lost $220,000 and his home and was living in a shelter without heat or a kitchen. Another victim testified at sentencing that due to her lost investment of $130,000 she had her car repossessed and was having trouble paying her mortgage. Another spoke of how she had invested $446,000 and now described herself as \"homeless.\" Several other victims testified or had their stories included in the PSR, but still their voices represented only a small fraction of the 500 people targeted by appellant's scheme. According to the PSR, over 150 victims had refinanced their homes or used retirement savings to make investments.</p>\n<p>The district judge remarked at sentencing that he was \"impressed with the large lack of remorse\" on the part of appellant. He also noted that he had \"considered the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*73</span> enormity of the harm done to the victims in this case\" and further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote>I have also been influenced by the fact that I agree having heard the government's case presented at trial, that the scheme at issue was a fraud ... virtually from its inception. I have considered the particular vulnerability and susceptibility of the victims of the scheme to the appeals that were made to them based on ethnicity and a shared background of tragic life experiences.... I have also considered the flagrant manner in which the defendants, particularly Mr. Bunchan, diverted the proceeds of the scheme to their personal enrichment and amusement. I have considered the necessity of protecting the public and others from schemes like this in the future, which I believe calls for a high component of deterrence in any sentence imposed.... Finally, I respect, and ordinarily agree, with Mr. George's proportionality argument, which has persuaded me before in other sentencings. What makes Mr. Bunchan's case different, however, in my judgment, is his involvement and attempt to involve himself in the gravest form of obstruction of justice; the murder of witnesses and the prosecutor in the case. That, to a court system, is an absolutely unforgivable crime over and above the crimes for which the defendant is now convicted.<sup>[11]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>Even after noting these aggravating aspects of appellant's case, the district court decided to accept the government's recommendation to vary downward from the GSR, sentencing appellant to thirty-five years of imprisonment. We recognize that, due to appellant's age, the thirty-five year sentence is practically equivalent to a life sentence, and that appellant has also been ordered to pay substantial restitution in addition to imprisonment. Nonetheless, we conclude that \"[t]he sentence imposed here is grounded on a sensible (though not obligatory) view of the circumstances and the outcome  given those circumstances and the length of the sentence actually imposed  is plainly defensible.\" <i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 96. There was no abuse of discretion in the district court's imposition of a thirty-five year term of imprisonment, two years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $19,103,121.73.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  1UOL was first presented to investors as the retail-store arm of WMDS's operation, whereby investors would open stores to sell WMDS products. Toward the end of the pyramid schemes, however, 1UOL was described as a passive investment vehicle, just like WMDS.</p>\n<p>[2]  Appellant inappropriately labeled much of his spending, such as his children's tuition and tennis lessons, gambling, purchases from Louis Vuitton, and his hairpieces, as \"business expenses\" on company records.</p>\n<p>[3]  About $500,000 of the money appellant spent on casinos came from Bunchan's personal accounts, while the rest came from company accounts containing investor funds. Of the $3.8 million spent on casinos, $1.2 million was sent back to appellant's personal bank account from the casinos; appellant later put some, but not all, of that money back into the companies' accounts. Agent Niro was not able to identify any source of income to appellant during 2000-2005 other than WMDS and 1UOL.</p>\n<p>[4]  Approximately $500,000 of the investor funds went to Seng Tan and $300,000 to Christian Rochon.</p>\n<p>[5]  On May 4, 2009, following a jury trial, appellant was separately convicted in the District Court of Massachusetts of using a facility of interstate commerce to commit murder-for-hire, 18 U.S.C. § 1958, and solicitation of a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. § 373, for this conduct. He was sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment, with the first five years of that sentence to be served concurrently with his sentence in this case. <i>United States v. Bunchan,</i> No. 07-cr-10085-DPW, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3352207</span></span> (D.Mass.).</p>\n<p>[6]  Tan initiated an appeal to this court, but later moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42. Her appeal was dismissed on September 5, 2007.</p>\n<p>[7]  The PSR applied the 2007 Guidelines, and we cite to those Guidelines.</p>\n<p>[8]  Although the endangerment of the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims would normally occasion a four-level enhancement, U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(13)(B)(iii), the guidelines state that the cumulative adjustments from sections 2B1.1(b)(2) and 2B1.1(b)(13)(B) shall not exceed eight levels. U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(13)(C). Because a six-level enhancement was applied pursuant to 2B1.1(b)(2), the Office of Probation only recommended a two-level enhancement pursuant to subsection (b)(13). (We note that as of the 2008 edition of the Guidelines, the enhancement for endangerment of the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims is found at U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1.(b)(14)(iii)).</p>\n<p>[9]  No matter a defendant's CHC, the Guidelines prescribe \"life\" (and not a true sentencing range such as \"360 months  life\") for an offense level of forty-three.</p>\n<p>[10]  Although appellant tries to elevate his evidentiary argument to a constitutional claim under the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, that argument is advanced so perfunctorily that we deem it waived. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). In any event, our analysis of the district court's appropriate exercise of its discretion answers any possible constitutional claim.</p>\n<p>[11]  Appellant makes a poorly developed argument that the district court improperly punished appellant \"for attempted murder without jury trial and conviction, by way of the guidelines enhancement for obstruction of justice.\" This argument is waived because of its perfunctory quality. <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17 (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"). Nonetheless, we note that there was no error in the district court's finding of facts by a preponderance of the evidence to support the U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 enhancement for obstruction of justice, as facts supporting such enhancements may be found by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Gonsalves,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202028\"><a href=\"/opinion/202028/united-states-v-gonsalves/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"[J]udicial fact-finding alone does not violate a defendant's sixth amendment rights so long as the defendant is sentenced at or below the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.\").</p>\n\n</div>",
