Petitioner    Elisabeth      Paraense-Almeida\n\n(\"Paraense\") appeals the Board of Immigration Appeal's (\"BIA\")\n\ndecision   denying   her   applications   for   asylum,    withholding   of\n\nremoval, and voluntary departure.        We affirm.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n           Paraense is a native and citizen of Brazil. On April 25,\n\n1998, Paraense was arrested, along with her sister,1 while crossing\n\nthe border between the United States and Mexico.             On April 26,\n\n1998, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")2 filed a\n\nNotice to Appear charging Paraense with being removable as an alien\n\npresent in the United States without being admitted or paroled.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).          Paraense appeared before an\n\nimmigration judge, conceded removability, and applied for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and voluntary departure.              In an oral\n\ndecision, the immigration judge denied Paraense's applications for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal, and found that Paraense was\n\nstatutorily ineligible for voluntary departure.        Paraense appealed\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Paraense's sister appeared with Paraense before the immigration\njudge and appealed the immigration judge's decision to the BIA.\nParaense's sister has not appealed the BIA's decision to this\ncourt.\n2\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthis decision to the BIA, and on July 31, 2003, a single member of\n\nthe BIA adopted and affirmed the decision of the immigration judge.\n\n                                 II.     Analysis\n\nA.    Asylum\n\n                An asylum applicant, such as Paraense, bears the burden\n\nof demonstrating her eligibility for asylum. See Albathani v. INS,\n\n318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).                She can meet this burden by\n\ndemonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution based on \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\"                     Id. (quoting 8\n\nC.F.R.      §    208.13(b))   (internal    quotation        marks     omitted).     To\n\nestablish past persecution, an applicant must provide \"conclusive\n\nevidence\" that she was targeted on any of the five grounds.\n\nFesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003).                    To show a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution, an applicant must meet\n\nboth   subjective      and    objective   prongs.          Id.   To    satisfy    the\n\nobjective prong, an applicant's testimony alone may be sufficient,\n\nbut    it   must    constitute    credible     and    specific      evidence   of    a\n\nreasonable fear of persecution.            El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d\n\n195, 203 (1st Cir. 2003).              To meet the subjective prong, the\n\napplicant must show her fear is genuine. See Aguilar-Solís v. INS,\n\n168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                \"Determinations of eligibility for asylum or withholding\n\nof    deportation      are    reviewed    under      the   substantial     evidence\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fstandard.\"    Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 18.      The agency decision is upheld\n\nif it is \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"          Id. (quoting INS v.\n\nElías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).           Under the substantial\n\nevidence standard, \"[t]o reverse the BIA finding we must find that\n\nthe    evidence   not   only   supports    that   conclusion,   but   compels\n\nit. . . .\"        Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).    \"Ordinarily, Courts of Appeals review decisions of the\n\n[BIA], and not those of an IJ.        When the BIA does not render its\n\nown opinion, however, and either defers [to] or adopts the opinion\n\nof the IJ, a Court of Appeals must then review the decision of the\n\nIJ.\"    See Settenda v. Ashcroft, No. 03-1722, 2004 WL 1718288, at 7\n\n(1st Cir. Aug 2, 2004)(quoting Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d at 373)).\n\n             Paraense testified to the following facts.         She was born\n\nin 1978 and lived in northern Brazil.              She is of Ciapo Indian\n\ndescent.     Her parents and most of her siblings still live in\n\nBrazil.    In 1994, Paraense's brother was shot and killed in front\n\nof their family's home. At first, Paraense thought her brother was\n\nkilled during a robbery.          In December 1997, however, Paraense\n\nlearned from her father that her brother was killed by squatters\n\nwho had a land dispute with Paraense's father.          Paraense testified\n\nthat her father, who managed properties, evicted squatters from\n\nsome land at the instruction of the land's owner.                During the\n\neviction, one of the squatters was killed. Paraense testified that\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fher brother was killed in retaliation for the eviction.              At her\n\nfather's urging, Paraense fled Brazil to avoid the escalating land\n\ndisputes.    She testified that she did not want to suffer the same\n\nfate as her brother.          She also testified that she was never\n\npersonally threatened and that her parents and siblings still live\n\nin    Brazil.      Along    with   her   testimony,   Paraense    presented\n\ndocumentary evidence that detailed land conflicts in Brazil.\n\n            The immigration judge concluded that Paraense did not\n\nestablish a nexus between her brother's death and her contention\n\nthat she feared she would suffer persecution if she returned to\n\nBrazil.   Further, the immigration judge noted that Paraense safely\n\nlived in Brazil for over three years after her brother was killed.\n\nThe immigration judge denied Paraense's asylum application.              The\n\nBIA   adopted     the   immigration   judge's   decision   and   found   that\n\nParaense had not met her burden of showing past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected\n\nground.     These findings are supported by substantial evidence.\n\n             1.   Past Persecution\n\n             Paraense argues that she was persecuted because of her\n\nfamily membership and the political opinion imputed to her on the\n\nbasis of her family membership.          Paraense bases this argument on\n\nher brother's murder in 1994 by squatters seeking revenge against\n\nher father for evicting them.         In her brief, Paraense asserts that\n\nshe was persecuted because of her family membership.               However,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fParaense never discusses how the alleged past persecution based on\n\nher family membership constitutes a form of past persecution on\n\naccount of membership in a particular social group.3           \"We have\n\nsteadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory\n\nmanner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\" United States\n\nv. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997). Paraense failed\n\nto adequately argue that past persecution on account of her family\n\nwas a form of past persecution on account of membership in a\n\nparticular social group.     We therefore conclude that the argument\n\nis waived.\n\n           Paraense   also   tries   to   characterize   her   father's\n\nparticipation in the land disputes as indicative of his political\n\nopinion.     However, Paraense has failed to show that her father's\n\nactions in evicting the squatters constituted a political opinion.\n\nSee Cuevas v. INS, 43 F.3d 1167, 1170-71 (7th Cir. 1995) (refusal\n\nto sell land to squatter is an economic, not political, choice);\n\nOntunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, 303 F.3d 341, 351-52 (5th Cir. 2002)\n\n(no evidence that persecution of landlord was a result of politics\n\nrather than economics).      Further, Paraense's sister testified at\n\nthe hearing that Paraense's brother was not politically active in\n\nBrazil, and there was no testimony that Paraense or any family\n\nmember held or expressed any political opinions.         Paraense has\n\n\n3\n  After making the statement that she was persecuted on account of\nher family membership, Paraense simply moves on to discuss her fear\nof future persecution.\n\n                                  -6-\n\ffailed to show that her brother was murdered for an imputed\n\npolitical opinion, and we therefore find that the record does not\n\ncompel a conclusion that Paraense suffered past persecution on\n\naccount of any imputed political opinion.\n\n              2.     Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n              Substantial         evidence      also        exists   to    support       the\n\ndetermination that Paraense did not demonstrate a well-founded fear\n\nof   future      persecution.           Paraense      argues    that,     based    on    her\n\nbrother's murder and the often violent land disputes that are\n\noccurring       in     Brazil,    she    has    a    well-founded     fear    of     future\n\npersecution. To establish a well-founded fear, Paraense must prove\n\nthat   her      fear     is    \"both    genuine      and    objectively    reasonable.\"\n\nAguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 572.                     We focus our discussion on the\n\nobjective prong.              The relevant inquiry is \"whether a reasonable\n\nperson     in      the    asylum       applicant's         circumstances     would      fear\n\npersecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\" Id. We\n\nbelieve that a reasonable person in Paraense's circumstances would\n\nnot fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\n\n              Paraense's brother was murdered in March 1994.                      Paraense\n\nentered the United States in April 1998.                       Paraense presented no\n\nevidence      that,      in    the     nearly   four-year       interim    between      her\n\nbrother's death and her departure from Brazil, she or her family\n\nwas threatened or harmed as a result of the land disputes described\n\nin her testimony and in the documentary evidence.                          Furthermore,\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fParaense's parents and siblings remain in Brazil, and there was no\n\nevidence submitted that they have been harmed or threatened since\n\nParaense left Brazil.     See id. at 573 (\"Without some explanation,\n\nthe fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the\n\nalien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution\n\nawaits [her] return\"); see also Velásquez v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 55,\n\n59 (1st Cir. 2003).     This evidence does not compel a finding that\n\na   reasonable   person   in   Paraense's   circumstances   would   fear\n\npersecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\n\n           Paraense also argues that the immigration judge erred\n\nbecause he made no credibility finding and rejected Paraense's\n\ndocumentary evidence on the grounds that it did not specifically\n\nmention Paraense or her family.      See El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 204.\n\nHowever, both the immigration judge and the BIA treated Paraense's\n\nstory as credible; they simply found that her experiences did not\n\nconstitute past persecution or provide evidence of a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.     While it is true that the immigration\n\njudge noted that Paraense's country condition reports did not\n\nspecifically mention her or her family, there is no indication that\n\nhe rejected them completely.        Rather, the immigration judge's\n\ndecision indicates that, because Paraense remained at home for\n\nseveral years after her brother's murder without incident and\n\nbecause no one else in her family had been harmed or threatened,\n\nshe did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f             We find substantial evidence to support the findings that\n\nParaense failed to demonstrate past persecution due to a protected\n\nground and failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution due to a protected ground.              We affirm the denial of\n\nasylum.\n\nB.   Withholding of Removal\n\n             If a petitioner is unable to satisfy the less stringent\n\nstandard for asylum, she is a fortiori unable to satisfy the test\n\nfor withholding of deportation.           Albathani, 318 F.3d at 372.\n\nC.   Due Process\n\n             Paraense contends that the BIA did not provide a clear\n\nadministrative     finding    because     it   adopted      and    affirmed   the\n\nimmigration judge's decision and added only four sentences of\n\nanalysis.4     We have already ruled that the BIA's streamlined\n\nprocedures do not violate a petitioner's due process rights.                  See,\n\ne.g.,   Albathani,   318    F.3d   at    375-78   (holding    that    the   BIA's\n\n\"affirmance    without     opinion\"     procedure    does    not    violate   due\n\nprocess).      \"If due process requirements are met when the BIA\n\naffirms the IJ's finding without issuing any opinion, the due\n\nprocess requirements are certainly met when the BIA affirms the\n\nIJ's finding with a brief explanatory order.\"               Settenda, 2004 WL\n\n1718288 at *7.       Thus, we reject Paraense's claim that the BIA\n\n\n4\n   While the BIA's decision is four paragraphs long, Paraense's\ncomplaint is that only four sentences analyze the case, while the\nrest recite the facts of the case.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fviolated her due process rights by failing to provide a clear\n\nadministrative finding or adequately review and establish the\n\nrecord of the case.     See id.\n\n             Paraense, citing to 8 C.F.R. §§ 1003.1(a)(7) and e(5),\n\nalso contends that the BIA's single-member decision violated its\n\nown procedures for evaluating and handling a case. We have already\n\nheld that this argument is unavailing, for a variety of reasons.\n\nSee Settenda, 2004 WL 1718288 at 6-7 (finding that comments to the\n\nfinal rule make it clear that single members may go beyond issuing\n\naffirmance    without   opinion,   and    that   §   1003.1(e)(5)   is   more\n\nspecific and was adopted after § 1003.1(a)(7), and therefore\n\nsupercedes § 1003.1(a)(7)).\n\n          Last, Paraense contends that the IJ did not afford her a\n\nfair   hearing     because   the   IJ     interrupted    Paraense    during\n\nquestioning.     \"An immigration judge, like other judicial officers,\n\npossesses broad (though not uncabined) discretion over the conduct\n\nof trial proceedings.\"       Aguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 568.             While\n\npossessing broad discretion, an immigration judge must function as\n\na \"neutral and impartial arbiter[].\"         Id. at 569.     In this case,\n\nthe immigration judge acted in a neutral manner.           The immigration\n\njudge did not restrict Paraense's opportunity to present her\n\ntestimony or other evidence fully.          While he may have exhibited\n\nimpatience and abruptness, \"[t]his is not the stuff from which a\n\ndue process violation can be fashioned.\"             Id. (citing Liteky v.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fUnited   States,   510   U.S.   540,   555-56   (1994)(stating   that\n\n\"expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even\n\nanger\" do not by themselves establish judicial bias)). In sum, we\n\nfind that Paraense had a full and fair hearing.     Id.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

Paraense appeared before an\n\nimmigration judge, conceded removability, and applied for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and voluntary departure.              In an oral\n\ndecision, the immigration judge denied Paraense's applications for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal, and found that Paraense was\n\nstatutorily ineligible for voluntary departure.        Paraense appealed\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Paraense's sister appeared with Paraense before the immigration\njudge and appealed the immigration judge's decision to the BIA.\nParaense's sister has not appealed the BIA's decision to this\ncourt.\n2\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\").

Aug 2, 2004)(quoting Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d at 373)).\n\n             Paraense testified to the following facts.         She was born\n\nin 1978 and lived in northern Brazil.              She is of Ciapo Indian\n\ndescent.     Her parents and most of her siblings still live in\n\nBrazil.    In 1994, Paraense's brother was shot and killed in front\n\nof their family's home. At first, Paraense thought her brother was\n\nkilled during a robbery.          In December 1997, however, Paraense\n\nlearned from her father that her brother was killed by squatters\n\nwho had a land dispute with Paraense's father.          Paraense testified\n\nthat her father, who managed properties, evicted squatters from\n\nsome land at the instruction of the land's owner.                During the\n\neviction, one of the squatters was killed. Paraense testified that\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fher brother was killed in retaliation for the eviction.              At her\n\nfather's urging, Paraense fled Brazil to avoid the escalating land\n\ndisputes.    She testified that she did not want to suffer the same\n\nfate as her brother.          She also testified that she was never\n\npersonally threatened and that her parents and siblings still live\n\nin    Brazil.      Along    with   her   testimony,   Paraense    presented\n\ndocumentary evidence that detailed land conflicts in Brazil.\n\n            The immigration judge concluded that Paraense did not\n\nestablish a nexus between her brother's death and her contention\n\nthat she feared she would suffer persecution if she returned to\n\nBrazil.   Further, the immigration judge noted that Paraense safely\n\nlived in Brazil for over three years after her brother was killed.\n\nThe immigration judge denied Paraense's asylum application.              The\n\nBIA   adopted     the   immigration   judge's   decision   and   found   that\n\nParaense had not met her burden of showing past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected\n\nground.     These findings are supported by substantial evidence.\n\n             1.   Past Persecution\n\n             Paraense argues that she was persecuted because of her\n\nfamily membership and the political opinion imputed to her on the\n\nbasis of her family membership.          Paraense bases this argument on\n\nher brother's murder in 1994 by squatters seeking revenge against\n\nher father for evicting them.         In her brief, Paraense asserts that\n\nshe was persecuted because of her family membership.               However,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fParaense never discusses how the alleged past persecution based on\n\nher family membership constitutes a form of past persecution on\n\naccount of membership in a particular social group.3           \"We have\n\nsteadfastly deemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory\n\nmanner, not accompanied by developed argumentation.\" United States\n\nv.

Paraense failed\n\nto adequately argue that past persecution on account of her family\n\nwas a form of past persecution on account of membership in a\n\nparticular social group.     We therefore conclude that the argument\n\nis waived.\n\n           Paraense   also   tries   to   characterize   her   father's\n\nparticipation in the land disputes as indicative of his political\n\nopinion.     However, Paraense has failed to show that her father's\n\nactions in evicting the squatters constituted a political opinion.\n\nSee Cuevas v.

Further, Paraense's sister testified at\n\nthe hearing that Paraense's brother was not politically active in\n\nBrazil, and there was no testimony that Paraense or any family\n\nmember held or expressed any political opinions.         Paraense has\n\n\n3\n  After making the statement that she was persecuted on account of\nher family membership, Paraense simply moves on to discuss her fear\nof future persecution.\n\n                                  -6-\n\ffailed to show that her brother was murdered for an imputed\n\npolitical opinion, and we therefore find that the record does not\n\ncompel a conclusion that Paraense suffered past persecution on\n\naccount of any imputed political opinion.\n\n              2.     Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n              Substantial         evidence      also        exists   to    support       the\n\ndetermination that Paraense did not demonstrate a well-founded fear\n\nof   future      persecution.           Paraense      argues    that,     based    on    her\n\nbrother's murder and the often violent land disputes that are\n\noccurring       in     Brazil,    she    has    a    well-founded     fear    of     future\n\npersecution. To establish a well-founded fear, Paraense must prove\n\nthat   her      fear     is    \"both    genuine      and    objectively    reasonable.\"\n\nAguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 572.                     We focus our discussion on the\n\nobjective prong.              The relevant inquiry is \"whether a reasonable\n\nperson     in      the    asylum       applicant's         circumstances     would      fear\n\npersecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\" Id. We\n\nbelieve that a reasonable person in Paraense's circumstances would\n\nnot fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\n\n              Paraense's brother was murdered in March 1994.                      Paraense\n\nentered the United States in April 1998.                       Paraense presented no\n\nevidence      that,      in    the     nearly   four-year       interim    between      her\n\nbrother's death and her departure from Brazil, she or her family\n\nwas threatened or harmed as a result of the land disputes described\n\nin her testimony and in the documentary evidence.                          Furthermore,\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fParaense's parents and siblings remain in Brazil, and there was no\n\nevidence submitted that they have been harmed or threatened since\n\nParaense left Brazil.     See id. at 573 (\"Without some explanation,\n\nthe fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the\n\nalien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution\n\nawaits [her] return\"); see also Velásquez v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783402\"><a href=\"/opinion/783402/ricardo-f-velasquez-susana-d-granados-urizar-eluvia-r-granados-urizar/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n59 (1st Cir. 2003).     This evidence does not compel a finding that\n\na   reasonable   person   in   Paraense's   circumstances   would   fear\n\npersecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\n\n           Paraense also argues that the immigration judge erred\n\nbecause he made no credibility finding and rejected Paraense's\n\ndocumentary evidence on the grounds that it did not specifically\n\nmention Paraense or her family.      See El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 204.\n\nHowever, both the immigration judge and the BIA treated Paraense's\n\nstory as credible; they simply found that her experiences did not\n\nconstitute past persecution or provide evidence of a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.     While it is true that the immigration\n\njudge noted that Paraense's country condition reports did not\n\nspecifically mention her or her family, there is no indication that\n\nhe rejected them completely.        Rather, the immigration judge's\n\ndecision indicates that, because Paraense remained at home for\n\nseveral years after her brother's murder without incident and\n\nbecause no one else in her family had been harmed or threatened,\n\nshe did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f             We find substantial evidence to support the findings that\n\nParaense failed to demonstrate past persecution due to a protected\n\nground and failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution due to a protected ground.              We affirm the denial of\n\nasylum.\n\nB.   Withholding of Removal\n\n             If a petitioner is unable to satisfy the less stringent\n\nstandard for asylum, she is a fortiori unable to satisfy the test\n\nfor withholding of deportation.           Albathani, 318 F.3d at 372.\n\nC.   Due Process\n\n             Paraense contends that the BIA did not provide a clear\n\nadministrative     finding    because     it   adopted      and    affirmed   the\n\nimmigration judge's decision and added only four sentences of\n\nanalysis.4     We have already ruled that the BIA's streamlined\n\nprocedures do not violate a petitioner's due process rights.                  See,\n\ne.g.,   Albathani,   318    F.3d   at    375-78   (holding    that    the   BIA's\n\n\"affirmance    without     opinion\"     procedure    does    not    violate   due\n\nprocess).      \"If due process requirements are met when the BIA\n\naffirms the IJ's finding without issuing any opinion, the due\n\nprocess requirements are certainly met when the BIA affirms the\n\nIJ's finding with a brief explanatory order.\"               Settenda, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1718288</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *7.       Thus, we reject Paraense's claim that the BIA\n\n\n4\n   While the BIA's decision is four paragraphs long, Paraense's\ncomplaint is that only four sentences analyze the case, while the\nrest recite the facts of the case.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fviolated her due process rights by failing to provide a clear\n\nadministrative finding or adequately review and establish the\n\nrecord of the case.

We have already\n\nheld that this argument is unavailing, for a variety of reasons.\n\nSee Settenda, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1718288</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 6-7 (finding that comments to the\n\nfinal rule make it clear that single members may go beyond issuing\n\naffirmance    without   opinion,   and    that   §   1003.1(e)(5)   is   more\n\nspecific and was adopted after § 1003.1(a)(7), and therefore\n\nsupercedes § 1003.1(a)(7)).\n\n          Last, Paraense contends that the IJ did not afford her a\n\nfair   hearing     because   the   IJ     interrupted    Paraense    during\n\nquestioning.     \"An immigration judge, like other judicial officers,\n\npossesses broad (though not uncabined) discretion over the conduct\n\nof trial proceedings.\"       Aguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 568.             While\n\npossessing broad discretion, an immigration judge must function as\n\na \"neutral and impartial arbiter[].\"         Id. at 569.     In this case,\n\nthe immigration judge acted in a neutral manner.           The immigration\n\njudge did not restrict Paraense's opportunity to present her\n\ntestimony or other evidence fully.
