Trinidad-Rodríguez\n\n(\"Trinidad\") appeals from his within-guidelines sentence, imposed\n\nafter United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), on the grounds\n\nthat the district court gave too much weight to the guidelines and\n\ntoo   little     to   his   individual       history   and    characteristics,\n\nparticularly his lack of a prior criminal record and his otherwise\n\nproductive life both before and after his conviction.                       After\n\ncareful review of the parties' briefs and the underlying record, we\n\naffirm the sentence.\n\n           Although Trinidad does not dispute the accuracy of the\n\ndistrict court's calculation of his advisory guidelines sentencing\n\nrange of 41 to 51 months, he faults the court for relying too\n\nheavily on that range in crafting the ultimate 41-month sentence.\n\nIn particular, he focuses on the district court's statement that\n\nTrinidad's proffered mitigating circumstances were not sufficiently\n\n\"compelling,\"     \"substantial,\"       or   \"extraordinary,\"       to   warrant   a\n\nbelow-guidelines sentence.\n\n           In another case where a judge used similar terminology--\n\nalso, as here, without the benefit of our subsequent guidance as to\n\nthe appropriate sentencing protocol post-Booker--we agreed that \"a\n\nparty need not make an 'extraordinary' showing in order to persuade\n\nthe   district    court     that   a   sentence    below     the    G[uidelines]\n\nS[entencing] R[ange] is warranted.\"            United States v.

But we declined to view such language\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fas \"indicat[ing] that the court did not understand the latitude it\n\npossessed to impose a nonguidelines sentence.\"           Id.   Rather,\n\nreading that language in context, we deemed the district court \"to\n\nhave engaged in a substantially similar . . . analysis\" to that\n\nwhich we endorsed in United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514,\n\n517-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), i.e., requiring the proponent of\n\na nonguidelines sentence to provide \"persuasive\" reasons for such\n\na sentence, Rivera, 448 F.3d at 85 (citing Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d\n\nat 517-19).    See also United States v. Feliz, 453 F.3d 33, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (declining to remand for resentencing where, despite its\n\nphraseology,    \"[t]he   court's    understanding   of     Booker   was\n\nsubstantially correct\"); United States v. Navedo-Concepción, 450\n\nF.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 2006) (same).\n\n          We read the district court's decision here the same way.\n\nDespite its choice of words, it is clear, in context, that the\n\ndistrict court understood that it was required to--and did in fact-\n\n-consider not only what it characterized as the          \"now-advisory\"\n\nguidelines sentencing range but also the other sentencing factors\n\nset forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).         In particular, the court\n\nexpressly considered the individual circumstances that Trinidad\n\nbrought to its attention--that other than the instant offense, he\n\nwas a productive member of society, a good father, and a law-\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fabiding citizen both before and after his conviction1–-but was not\n\npersuaded that those circumstances warranted a below-guidelines\n\nsentence.    As grounds for reaching that conclusion, the court was\n\npresumably more impressed by the government's counter-arguments\n\nthat the seriousness of the instant offense--in which Trinidad\n\npersonally laundered $330,000 of funds in multiple transactions\n\nover a substantial period of time--warranted a within-guidelines\n\nsentence,    which   already      took   into   account    his   first-offender\n\nstatus,    rather    than   the    probationary       sentence   that   Trinidad\n\nrequested.     The court nevertheless presumably took those factors\n\ninto account in sentencing Trinidad to the bottom of the applicable\n\nsentencing    range,    rather    than    the   top   as   the   government   had\n\nrecommended.        We see nothing implausible about that implicit\n\nexplanation or unreasonable about the resulting 41-month sentence.\n\n            \"If the court had completely disregarded the[] sentencing\n\nfactors [that Trinidad relied upon], this might be a different\n\ncase.     Here, however, the record makes manifest that the judge\n\npondered . . . the . . . factors cited by [Trinidad]; he simply\n\ncame to a different, yet altogether plausible, conclusion as to\n\ntheir salience.\"       United States v.
