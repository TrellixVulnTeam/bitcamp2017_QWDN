R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\nNos. 01-2159\n     01-2610\n\n                         UNITED STATES,\n\n                            Appellee,\n\n                               v.\n\n                      ARTHUR D'AMARIO, III,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n        [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]*\n        [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]*\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Arthur D'Amario, III on brief pro se.\n     Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Donald C.\nLockhart, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 12, 2003\n\n\n*Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f             Per Curiam.      In Appeal No. 01-2159, Arthur D'Amario,\n\n III, has appealed a district court order denying his motion to\n\n recover     postconviction       investigative        expenses       D'Amario\n\n incurred.     In    Appeal    No.    01-2610,    D'Amario    has     appealed\n\n district court orders denying his motion for a new trial and\n\n his motion to modify the conditions of his supervised release.\n\n We reject the government's contention that the notices of\n\n appeal were untimely filed and affirm the district court\n\n orders.1\n\n Appeal No. 01-2159\n\n             After   his   conviction,      D'Amario     hired    a   private\n\n investigator.       After we affirmed that conviction, D'Amario\n\n proffered the paid $1000 invoice to the district court and\n\n sought to have the government reimburse him for the money he\n\n had spent. The district court denied the motion, reciting that\n\n its pretrial approval of investigative expenses did not cover\n\n these   expenses    and   that      D'Amario    had   not   obtained    prior\n\n approval before incurring these postconviction expenses.\n\n             There was no abuse of discretion in denying this\n\n motion for reimbursement.           See United States v. Manning, 79\n\n F.3d 212, 218 (1st Cir.) (reciting standard of review), cert.\n\n denied, 519 U.S. 853 (1996). The court was correct in reciting\n\n\n\n    1\n      We deny D'Amario's motion to consolidate these                    instant\nappeals with United States v. D'Amario, No. 02-2354.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fthat D'Amario had failed to obtain preapproval and D'Amario\n\nprovides    no   authority    for    his   bare     assertion     that    he    is\n\nentitled to reimbursement.           Moreover, contrary to D'Amario's\n\ncurrent contention, the pretrial expenses that had received\n\npreapproval, in fact, were incurred and were paid.\n\n            When D'Amario filed his motion for reimbursement, he\n\ndid not ask that the district court judge (Judge DiClerico)\n\nrecuse himself from ruling on it. On appeal, D'Amario contends\n\nthat Judge DiClerico should have recused himself, sua sponte.\n\nAssuming,    without     deciding,      that   the       issue   is   properly\n\npreserved, there is no point in granting D'Amario's requested\n\nrelief, i.e., a remand for reconsideration by another judge.\n\nThis   is   so   whether    the     standard   of    review      is   abuse     of\n\ndiscretion, see In re Allied-Signal Inc., 891 F.2d 967, 970\n\n(1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 957 (1990), or error of\n\nlaw (plain or otherwise), see United States v. Antar, 53 F.3d\n\n568, 573 (3rd Cir. 1995).         D'Amario did not obtain preapproval\n\nfor his after-conviction incurrence of $1000 in expenses for\n\ninvestigative services.        No judge could conclude otherwise.\n\n            We affirm the July 30, 2001 order of the district\n\ncourt denying the motion for reimbursement of expenses.\n\nAppeal No. 01-2610\n\n            While   we     ordinarily      review    a    challenge      to    the\n\nimposition of conditions of supervised release for abuse of\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdiscretion, D'Amario did not object to any of the conditions\n\neither at sentencing or on direct appeal and, thus, we would\n\nreview for plain error.       See United States v. Allen, 312 F.3d\n\n512, 514 (1st Cir. 2002).          The standard of review can not be\n\nmore generous where here D'Amario is challenging not the\n\nimposition of conditions of supervised release but the district\n\ncourt's subsequent refusal to modify certain conditions of\n\nsupervised release.        D'Amario's current challenge does not\n\nestablish    plain   error    in   the    district   court's    denial   of\n\nD'Amario's   motion   to     modify   conditions     of   his   supervised\n\nrelease.\n\n            There was no manifest abuse of discretion in denying\n\nD'Amario's new trial motion.          See United States v. Desir, 273\n\nF.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 2001). D'Amario's arguments on appeal do\n\nnot convincingly suggest that the proffered \"evidence\" was\n\nnewly discovered, obtained with due diligence, or material to\n\nthe criminal charge.\n\n            We affirm the October 30, 2001 orders of the district\n\ncourt denying the motion for a new trial and the motion to\n\nmodify the conditions of supervised release.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
