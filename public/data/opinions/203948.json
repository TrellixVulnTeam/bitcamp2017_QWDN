App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nEric H. Holder, Jr. has been substituted for former Attorney\nGeneral Michael B. Mukasey as the respondent.\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.     Iqbal Hussain, a native and citizen\n\nof Pakistan, seeks review of a final order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying his application for withholding\n\nof removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture\n\n(\"CAT\") and rejecting his request for voluntary departure.                   The\n\nrecord supports the BIA's conclusions.               We lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview the denial of requests for voluntary departure.                  We deny\n\nHussain's petition for review in part, and dismiss it in part.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Hussain entered the United States without inspection on\n\nJune 1, 2001.     On October 31, 2004, the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity issued a Notice to Appear, charging Hussain as a removable\n\nalien   because   of   his   presence     in   the    United   States   without\n\nadmission    or   parole.      On   May    17,       2005,   Hussain    conceded\n\nremovability and filed an application for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval based on political persecution, and protection under the\n\nCAT.    In the alternative, Hussain requested voluntary departure.\n\nHearings before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") occurred on March 5,\n\n2007, by which point Hussain had abandoned his application for\n\nasylum.\n\n            Hussain testified that he previously faced persecution\n\nfor his political beliefs while he served as a secretary general of\n\nthe Pakistan Muslim League in his village in the Swat region of\n\nPakistan. He claimed that during a dispute over Hussain's handling\n\n                                    -2-\n\fof a drainage project, which he admitted was a personal matter, the\n\nfather of a political rival threw a shoe at him and broke his hand.\n\nThe police arrested this man but later released him.     Later, in\n\nearly 1999, the individual, armed with a gun, was looking for (but\n\ndid not find) Hussain, and Hussain left the village for Karachi.\n\nHussain also claimed that after he left the village, he heard from\n\nhis family that the police repeatedly had come looking for him.\n\nHussain added that he feared returning to Pakistan because the same\n\npolitical rival remained in the village, he felt the police would\n\nnot protect him, and he was concerned about his ability to support\n\nhis family financially.    In his application, though not at the\n\nhearing, Hussain also claimed that he feared the government would\n\ntorture him based on the government's alleged practice of torturing\n\nand killing the political opposition.\n\n           In an oral decision on March 5, 2007, the IJ held that\n\nHussain had failed to establish eligibility for withholding of\n\nremoval.   The IJ determined that Hussain could not show past\n\npersecution on political grounds because he never established what\n\npolitical views he held.   Nor did Hussain's claims to have had his\n\nhand broken and to have been sought by a man with a gun qualify as\n\npersecution.   The IJ further concluded that Hussain had presented\n\nno evidence showing an objective fear of future persecution on\n\npolitical grounds.   His testimony regarding his fears of returning\n\nto Pakistan centered on his future economic welfare.        The IJ\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fsimilarly rejected Hussain's claim of future persecution based on\n\nhis assertion that the police were looking for him, since Hussain\n\nhypothesized that the police merely may have been investigating\n\nallegations that Hussain made personal use of bank loans.\n\n            The   IJ   also   expressed    \"serious   reservations\"    about\n\nHussain's credibility. The IJ cited Hussain's misleading testimony\n\nregarding the dates of his children's births, the notarization of\n\nhis marriage certificate, his payment for a work permit, and his\n\napplication   for      adjustment   of   status   based   on   a   fraudulent\n\nmarriage.\n\n            The IJ also found that Hussain's CAT protection claim\n\nfailed because \"[t]here is no evidence whatsoever in the record\n\nthat the Court could find that [Hussain] would be tortured by\n\nofficials of the government\" upon his return to Pakistan. Finally,\n\nthe IJ denied the request for voluntary departure on the grounds\n\nthat Hussain had illegally purchased work authorization, had failed\n\nto file tax returns, had applied for adjustment of status based on\n\na non-existent marriage, and had not shown that he could post the\n\nvoluntary departure bond.\n\n            The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision in an opinion issued\n\non August 26, 2008.       It agreed that \"the experiences described by\n\nrespondent do not amount to past persecution\" and that the record\n\ndid not support a finding that Hussain had an objective fear of\n\nfuture persecution.       The BIA further agreed with the IJ's finding\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthat \"nothing in the record\" suggested Hussain was at risk of being\n\ntortured if he returned to Pakistan and that he thus failed to show\n\neligibility for CAT relief.              The BIA then affirmed the IJ's\n\ndiscretionary denial of voluntary departure for substantially the\n\nsame reasons as the IJ. Finally, the BIA rejected Hussain's motion\n\nto remand on the basis of alleged changes in country conditions in\n\nPakistan, which Hussain had filed during the pendency of the\n\nappeal.\n\n             This petition for review followed.\n\n                                        II.\n\n             We review the agency's factual determinations by applying\n\nthe deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard.                 Touch v. Holder,\n\n568   F.3d   32,   38   (1st    Cir.   2009).        So   long   as   \"reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole\" supports these determinations, we must accept them. Shahari\n\nv. Gonzáles, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     Under this test, \"we reverse only if 'any reasonable\n\nadjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'\"\n\nBudiono v. Mukasey, 548 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)).              We review both the IJ's and BIA's\n\nopinions when, as here, the BIA affirmed the IJ's ruling but also\n\nanalyzed     various    bases   for    the    IJ's   conclusions.       Limani   v.\n\nMukasey, 538 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fA.             Withholding of Removal\n\n               Applicants for withholding of removal bear the burden of\n\nshowing that their \"life or freedom would be threatened in the\n\nproposed       country     of    removal   on    account     of       race,    religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"       8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).            Applicants can satisfy this\n\nburden by showing that they were subject to past persecution, which\n\ncarries the rebuttable presumption that the applicant will be\n\nsubject    to     future     persecution.         8   C.F.R.      §    1208.16(b)(1).\n\nAlternately, applicants can demonstrate that they will \"more likely\n\nthan not\" face future persecution.               8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2).\n\n               Here, substantial evidence supports the determination\n\nthat Hussain neither faced past persecution nor a likelihood of\n\nfuture persecution.             Hussain argues that because his broken hand\n\nconstituted tangible physical harm, the BIA and the IJ erred in\n\nconcluding that he had not suffered past persecution.                         But the law\n\nof this circuit is clear that not every instance of physical harm\n\nrises     to    the   level       of   persecution,    for     \"[t]o      qualify     as\n\npersecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering.\" Jorgji v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d\n\n53, 57 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263\n\n(1st Cir. 2000)).        Because we have found an absence of persecution\n\neven in cases where the physical harm was more severe and more\n\nclearly politically motivated, we cannot conclude that the BIA and\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fthe    IJ   erred      in   dismissing       Hussain's      allegations     of    past\n\npersecution.      See, e.g., Journal v. Keisler, 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st\n\nCir. 2007) (no persecution where members of rival political party\n\nlooked for applicant at his home and later hit applicant on the\n\nhead and shoulders); Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262-64 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (no persecution where members of police beat applicant\n\nin two separate incidents and threatened him with death).\n\n            Moreover, Hussain's experiences comprise two separate\n\nevents that stemmed from a private dispute with a single individual\n\nover a drainage project.          On the basis of the record, Hussain was\n\nnot \"subjected to systematic maltreatment rising to the level of\n\npersecution,      as    opposed   to    a    series    of    isolated     incidents.\"\n\nTopalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir. 2005); see also\n\nPalma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 2005).                       We\n\ncannot find that the evidence compels a conclusion that Hussain\n\nsuffered past persecution.\n\n            Substantial evidence also supports the conclusion that\n\nHussain did not show a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nHussain does not challenge the IJ's and the BIA's conclusion that\n\nhe    presented     insufficient       evidence       of    his   fears   of     future\n\npersecution.      In his brief before this court, he instead contends\n\nfor the first time that the Taliban's recent targeting of pro-\n\nAmerican Pakistanis in the Swat region independently establishes\n\nHussain's well-founded fear of future persecution.                        Because we\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fcannot entertain new arguments or new factual predicates for old\n\narguments on appeal, we will not evaluate this claim.                   See Cochran\n\nv. Quest Software, Inc., 328 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nB.          CAT Protection\n\n            The record amply supports the conclusion that Hussain\n\npresented   no    evidence     regarding      the   likelihood     of    his   being\n\ntortured upon his return to Pakistan.               Applicants are entitled to\n\nCAT protection only if they show that in the country of removal,\n\nthey will more likely than not face torture with the consent or\n\nacquiescence of the government.              See 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2),\n\n1208.18(a).      He did not.\n\n            Perhaps recognizing this, in his brief before this court,\n\nHussain's     lone   argument     is   that    recent     reports       of   Taliban\n\nactivities in the Swat region show that he is likely to face\n\ntorture at the hands of the Taliban due to his \"previous United\n\nStates residency.\"        This is the same newly advanced argument as he\n\nuses to bolster his claims of future persecution, and we cannot\n\nconsider it for the same reasons.\n\n            Finally, we agree with the government's contention that\n\nHussain has waived his challenge to the BIA's denial of the motion\n\nto remand based on changed country conditions.                   Though Hussain's\n\nbrief   cites    recent    news   articles     and    a   2008    country      report\n\nregarding Taliban activities in the Swat region, it omits any\n\nmention of the motion to remand or the BIA's reasons for rejecting\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fthe motion.     The mere assertion of facts that potentially support\n\nthe motion is not enough to preserve the argument.              The materials\n\nin question cannot be considered in any event because they were\n\nneither introduced into the record nor included in support of the\n\nmotion to remand. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A) (requiring court of\n\nappeals to decide the petition \"only on the administrative record\n\non which the order of removal is based\").               We conclude that the\n\nissue was waived. See Dawoud v. Holder, 561 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\nC.         Voluntary Departure\n\n           Hussain also argues that the BIA erred in affirming the\n\nIJ's discretionary denial of voluntary departure.                 The IJ, he\n\nmaintains, abused her discretion in finding that he was statutorily\n\nineligible for voluntary departure because he was not a person of\n\n\"good moral character\" for the preceding five years.                 This court\n\nhas no jurisdiction to review denials of voluntary departure.               See\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229c(f) (\"No court shall have jurisdiction over an\n\nappeal   from   denial   of   a    request   for   an   order   of    voluntary\n\ndeparture\" entered by an IJ at the conclusion of proceedings); id.\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); Naeem v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 33, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (recognizing that Congress \"altered the power of the federal\n\ncourts   with     respect     to    voluntary      departure,     withdrawing\n\njurisdiction to review grants or denials of voluntary departure\").\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f           The petition for review is dismissed in part and denied\n\nin part.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

The record supports the BIA's conclusions. We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of requests for voluntary departure. We deny Hussain's petition for review in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> I.</h2>\n<p>Hussain entered the United States without inspection on June 1, 2001. On October 31, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear, charging Hussain as a removable alien because of his presence in the United States without admission or parole. On May 17, 2005, Hussain conceded removability and filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal based on political persecution, and protection under the CAT. In the alternative, Hussain requested voluntary departure. Hearings before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") occurred on March 5, 2007, by which point Hussain had abandoned his application for asylum.</p>\n<p>Hussain testified that he previously faced persecution for his political beliefs while he served as a secretary general of the Pakistan Muslim League in his village in the Swat region of Pakistan. He claimed that during a dispute over Hussain's handling of a drainage project, which he admitted was a personal matter, the father of a political rival threw a shoe at him and broke his hand. The police arrested this man but later released him. Later, in early 1999, the individual, armed with a gun, was looking for (but did not find) Hussain, and Hussain left the village for Karachi. Hussain also claimed that after he left the village, he heard from his family that the police repeatedly had come looking for him. Hussain added that he feared returning to Pakistan because the same political rival remained in the village, he felt the police would not protect him, and he was concerned about his ability to support his family financially. In his application, though not at the hearing, Hussain also claimed that he feared the government would torture him based on the government's alleged practice of torturing and killing the political opposition.</p>\n<p>In an oral decision on March 5, 2007, the IJ held that Hussain had failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. The IJ determined that Hussain could not show past persecution on political grounds because he never established what political views he held. Nor did Hussain's claims to have had his hand broken and to have been sought by a man with a gun qualify as persecution. The IJ further concluded that Hussain had presented no evidence showing an objective fear of future persecution on political grounds. His testimony regarding his fears of returning to Pakistan centered on his future economic welfare. The IJ similarly rejected Hussain's claim of future persecution based on his assertion that the police were looking for him, since Hussain hypothesized that the police merely may have been investigating allegations that Hussain made personal use of bank loans.</p>\n<p>The IJ also expressed \"serious reservations\" about Hussain's credibility. The IJ cited Hussain's misleading testimony regarding the dates of his children's births, the notarization of his marriage certificate, his payment for a work permit, and his application for adjustment of status based on a fraudulent marriage.</p>\n<p>The IJ also found that Hussain's CAT protection claim failed because \"[t]here is no evidence whatsoever in the record that the Court could find that [Hussain] would be tortured by officials of the government\" upon his return to Pakistan. Finally, the IJ denied the request for voluntary departure on the grounds that Hussain had illegally purchased work authorization, had failed to file tax returns, had applied for adjustment of status based on a non-existent marriage, and had not shown that he could post the voluntary departure bond.</p>\n<p>The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision in an opinion issued on August 26, 2008. It agreed that \"the experiences described by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> respondent do not amount to past persecution\" and that the record did not support a finding that Hussain had an objective fear of future persecution. The BIA further agreed with the IJ's finding that \"nothing in the record\" suggested Hussain was at risk of being tortured if he returned to Pakistan and that he thus failed to show eligibility for CAT relief. The BIA then affirmed the IJ's discretionary denial of voluntary departure for substantially the same reasons as the IJ. Finally, the BIA rejected Hussain's motion to remand on the basis of alleged changes in country conditions in Pakistan, which Hussain had filed during the pendency of the appeal.</p>\n<p>This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the agency's factual determinations by applying the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Touch v. Holder,</i> 568 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir.2009). So long as \"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole\" supports these determinations, we must accept them. <i>Shahari v. Gonzáles,</i> 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this test, \"we reverse only if `any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.'\" <i>Budiono v. Mukasey,</i> 548 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)). We review both the IJ's and BIA's opinions when, as here, the BIA affirmed the IJ's ruling but also analyzed various bases for the IJ's conclusions. <i>Limani v. Mukasey,</i> 538 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Withholding of Removal</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Applicants for withholding of removal bear the burden of showing that their \"life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b). Applicants can satisfy this burden by showing that they were subject to past persecution, which carries the rebuttable presumption that the applicant will be subject to future persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1). Alternately, applicants can demonstrate that they will \"more likely than not\" face future persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p>Here, substantial evidence supports the determination that Hussain neither faced past persecution nor a likelihood of future persecution. Hussain argues that because his broken hand constituted tangible physical harm, the BIA and the IJ erred in concluding that he had not suffered past persecution. But the law of this circuit is clear that not every instance of physical harm rises to the level of persecution, for \"[t]o qualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\" <i>Jorgji v.

Because we have found an absence of persecution even in cases where the physical harm was more severe and more clearly politically motivated, we cannot conclude that the BIA and the IJ erred in dismissing Hussain's allegations of past persecution. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Journal v. Keisler,</i> 507 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.2007) (no persecution where members of rival political party looked for applicant at his home and later hit applicant on the head and shoulders); <i>Bocova v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 257, 262-64 (1st Cir.2005) (no persecution where members of police beat applicant in two separate incidents and threatened him with death).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> Moreover, Hussain's experiences comprise two separate events that stemmed from a private dispute with a single individual over a drainage project. On the basis of the record, Hussain was not \"subjected to systematic maltreatment rising to the level of persecution, as opposed to a series of isolated incidents.\" <i>Topalli v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> 428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir.2005). We cannot find that the evidence compels a conclusion that Hussain suffered past persecution.</p>\n<p>Substantial evidence also supports the conclusion that Hussain did not show a well-founded fear of future persecution. Hussain does not challenge the IJ's and the BIA's conclusion that he presented insufficient evidence of his fears of future persecution. In his brief before this court, he instead contends for the first time that the Taliban's recent targeting of pro-American Pakistanis in the Swat region independently establishes Hussain's well-founded fear of future persecution. Because we cannot entertain new arguments or new factual predicates for old arguments on appeal, we will not evaluate this claim. <i>See </i><i>Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc.,</i> 328 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>CAT Protection</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The record amply supports the conclusion that Hussain presented no evidence regarding the likelihood of his being tortured upon his return to Pakistan. Applicants are entitled to CAT protection only if they show that in the country of removal, they will more likely than not face torture with the consent or acquiescence of the government. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.18(a). He did not.</p>\n<p>Perhaps recognizing this, in his brief before this court, Hussain's lone argument is that recent reports of Taliban activities in the Swat region show that he is likely to face torture at the hands of the Taliban due to his \"previous United States residency.\" This is the same newly advanced argument as he uses to bolster his claims of future persecution, and we cannot consider it for the same reasons.</p>\n<p>Finally, we agree with the government's contention that Hussain has waived his challenge to the BIA's denial of the motion to remand based on changed country conditions. Though Hussain's brief cites recent news articles and a 2008 country report regarding Taliban activities in the Swat region, it omits any mention of the motion to remand or the BIA's reasons for rejecting the motion. The mere assertion of facts that potentially support the motion is not enough to preserve the argument. The materials in question cannot be considered in any event because they were neither introduced into the record nor included in support of the motion to remand. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A) (requiring court of appeals to decide the petition \"only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based\"). We conclude that the issue was waived. <i>See </i><i>Dawoud v. Holder,</i> 561 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Voluntary Departure</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Hussain also argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ's discretionary denial of voluntary departure. The IJ, he maintains, abused her discretion in finding that he was statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure because he was not a person of \"good moral character\" for the preceding five years. This court has no jurisdiction to review denials of voluntary departure. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(f) (\"No court shall have jurisdiction over an appeal from denial of a request for an order of voluntary departure\" entered by an IJ at the conclusion of proceedings); <i>id.</i> § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <i>Naeem v.

Scadron, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, SELYA and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>Iqbal Hussain, a native and citizen of Pakistan, seeks review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying his application for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\") and rejecting his request for voluntary departure. The record supports the BIA's conclusions. We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of requests for voluntary departure. We deny Hussain's petition for review in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> I.</h2>\n<p>Hussain entered the United States without inspection on June 1, 2001. On October 31, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear, charging Hussain as a removable alien because of his presence in the United States without admission or parole. On May 17, 2005, Hussain conceded removability and filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal based on political persecution, and protection under the CAT. In the alternative, Hussain requested voluntary departure. Hearings before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") occurred on March 5, 2007, by which point Hussain had abandoned his application for asylum.</p>\n<p>Hussain testified that he previously faced persecution for his political beliefs while he served as a secretary general of the Pakistan Muslim League in his village in the Swat region of Pakistan. He claimed that during a dispute over Hussain's handling of a drainage project, which he admitted was a personal matter, the father of a political rival threw a shoe at him and broke his hand. The police arrested this man but later released him. Later, in early 1999, the individual, armed with a gun, was looking for (but did not find) Hussain, and Hussain left the village for Karachi. Hussain also claimed that after he left the village, he heard from his family that the police repeatedly had come looking for him. Hussain added that he feared returning to Pakistan because the same political rival remained in the village, he felt the police would not protect him, and he was concerned about his ability to support his family financially. In his application, though not at the hearing, Hussain also claimed that he feared the government would torture him based on the government's alleged practice of torturing and killing the political opposition.</p>\n<p>In an oral decision on March 5, 2007, the IJ held that Hussain had failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. The IJ determined that Hussain could not show past persecution on political grounds because he never established what political views he held. Nor did Hussain's claims to have had his hand broken and to have been sought by a man with a gun qualify as persecution. The IJ further concluded that Hussain had presented no evidence showing an objective fear of future persecution on political grounds. His testimony regarding his fears of returning to Pakistan centered on his future economic welfare. The IJ similarly rejected Hussain's claim of future persecution based on his assertion that the police were looking for him, since Hussain hypothesized that the police merely may have been investigating allegations that Hussain made personal use of bank loans.</p>\n<p>The IJ also expressed \"serious reservations\" about Hussain's credibility. The IJ cited Hussain's misleading testimony regarding the dates of his children's births, the notarization of his marriage certificate, his payment for a work permit, and his application for adjustment of status based on a fraudulent marriage.</p>\n<p>The IJ also found that Hussain's CAT protection claim failed because \"[t]here is no evidence whatsoever in the record that the Court could find that [Hussain] would be tortured by officials of the government\" upon his return to Pakistan. Finally, the IJ denied the request for voluntary departure on the grounds that Hussain had illegally purchased work authorization, had failed to file tax returns, had applied for adjustment of status based on a non-existent marriage, and had not shown that he could post the voluntary departure bond.</p>\n<p>The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision in an opinion issued on August 26, 2008. It agreed that \"the experiences described by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> respondent do not amount to past persecution\" and that the record did not support a finding that Hussain had an objective fear of future persecution. The BIA further agreed with the IJ's finding that \"nothing in the record\" suggested Hussain was at risk of being tortured if he returned to Pakistan and that he thus failed to show eligibility for CAT relief. The BIA then affirmed the IJ's discretionary denial of voluntary departure for substantially the same reasons as the IJ. Finally, the BIA rejected Hussain's motion to remand on the basis of alleged changes in country conditions in Pakistan, which Hussain had filed during the pendency of the appeal.</p>\n<p>This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the agency's factual determinations by applying the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Touch v.

So long as \"reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole\" supports these determinations, we must accept them. <i>Shahari v.

We review both the IJ's and BIA's opinions when, as here, the BIA affirmed the IJ's ruling but also analyzed various bases for the IJ's conclusions. <i>Limani v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203442\"><a href=\"/opinion/203442/limani-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Withholding of Removal</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Applicants for withholding of removal bear the burden of showing that their \"life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b). Applicants can satisfy this burden by showing that they were subject to past persecution, which carries the rebuttable presumption that the applicant will be subject to future persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(1). Alternately, applicants can demonstrate that they will \"more likely than not\" face future persecution. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p>Here, substantial evidence supports the determination that Hussain neither faced past persecution nor a likelihood of future persecution. Hussain argues that because his broken hand constituted tangible physical harm, the BIA and the IJ erred in concluding that he had not suffered past persecution. But the law of this circuit is clear that not every instance of physical harm rises to the level of persecution, for \"[t]o qualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\" <i>Jorgji v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386154\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386154/jorgji-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting <i>Nelson v.
