Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n               Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges,\n                    and Lisi,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Michael J. Barkoff, for appellants.\n     Thomas H. Boyd, with whom Charles (C.J.) Schoenwetter,\nWinthrop & Weinstine, P.A., Posternak Blankstein & Lund, LLP,\nJoseph P. Crimmins and Jennifer L. Finger, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         February 27, 2004\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.              This is an appeal from an\n\norder and judgment granting defendant-appellee Marvin Lumber and\n\nCedar   Co.,      Inc.'s    (\"Marvin     Lumber\")       motion    to    dismiss   the\n\nappellants' complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).                       The\n\ncomplaint      alleges     damages      by     reason    of    defective       windows\n\nmanufactured by Marvin Lumber, a Minnesota corporation, which were\n\npurchased      by   appellants,        Massachusetts      residents,        through   a\n\nsupplier in Massachusetts.\n\n            In its motion, Marvin Lumber raised as a defense to the\n\npresent suit the preclusive effects of a settlement and judgment\n\nentered in a class action brought in the state courts of Minnesota,\n\nentitled O'Hara v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co., Inc., Civil Action\n\nNo. PD 00-014027 (\"the O'Hara suit\").                The district court agreed\n\nwith Marvin Lumber, and this appeal followed.                  Appellants contend\n\nthat the district court erred in dismissing their complaint on res\n\njudicata grounds, because they allegedly failed to receive actual\n\nnotice of the O'Hara suit and because their claims were distinct\n\nfrom those litigated in O'Hara.              It is their view that to allow\n\npreclusive effect to such a judgment violates their right to due\n\nprocess.\n\n            For     the    reasons     hereinafter      stated,    we    affirm   the\n\ndecision of the district court.\n\n            Between       1985   and    1988,    Marvin       Lumber,   a    national\n\nmanufacturer of windows and doors, treated its products with a wood\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fpreservative known as \"PILT\" which it acquired from PPG Industries,\n\nInc. This preservative was ineffective and defective, resulting in\n\nthe premature deterioration of many of Marvin Lumber's windows.\n\nThis situation spawned the O'Hara class action in 1999, in which\n\nthe class was defined as all owners of defective windows and doors\n\nmanufactured by Marvin Lumber treated with PILT during the years\n\n1985 to 1988.      Damages were sought in excess of $70 million\n\ndollars, including damages resulting from Marvin Lumber's alleged\n\nfailure to warn about the defective PILT treatment.            Recovery was\n\nsought based on the consumer protection statutes of all fifty\n\nstates and the District of Columbia.\n\n          Eventually,    the   O'Hara   suit    was    settled,      with   the\n\napproval of the judge presiding over said matter, in Minnesota's\n\nFourth Judicial District, that state's trial court of general\n\njurisdiction.    Pursuant to Minnesota Rule of Civil Procedure 23,\n\nwhich is substantially similar to its federal counterpart, Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 23, a fund was established in the amount of $300,000 to pay\n\nfor the costs of notifying the class members.          Thereafter, direct\n\nmail notices were sent to all identifiable class members, with\n\nsimilar notices being published in 33 newspapers throughout the\n\nUnited States.     The notices included a toll-free number and the\n\naddress of a web-site, established to provide potential class\n\nmembers with     information   about   the   class    action   and    to    make\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\favailable appropriate forms for their active participation in the\n\nproceedings or to allow them to opt out of the suit.\n\n           Thereafter, and before the class settlement was approved,\n\nthe Minnesota court, as required by state law (in similar fashion\n\nto its federal counterpart), held a fairness hearing to determine\n\nwhether the settlement was reasonable, adequate, and in the best\n\ninterest of   the    class.      At   least   one   Massachusetts       resident\n\nappeared at the hearing to challenge the settlement, on the grounds\n\nthat under Massachusetts law the claims were not yet time-barred,\n\nan objection that was overruled by the court.1               On December 4,\n\n2001, the O'Hara court determined that the settlement was fair,\n\nadequate, and reasonable, and proceeded to approve it.                 The court\n\nspecifically concluded that the notice provided to class members\n\nwas the best notice practicable, and thus entered final judgment.\n\n           The appellants purchased windows manufactured by Marvin\n\nLumber   windows    in   1988.    This      was   done   through   a    building\n\ncontractor who acquired the windows from a local hardware store in\n\nMassachusetts.      Thereafter, the windows were installed in their\n\nresidences.   In the autumn of 2002, it was discovered that they\n\nwere suffering from wood decay problems and related damage to\n\nappellants' residence and upon inspection it was concluded that\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Relying on Cody v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co., 167 F. Supp. 2d\n166 (D. Mass. 2001)(holding that any claims against Marvin were\ntime-barred under Massachusetts law).\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthese were caused by the inadequate preservatives used in the\n\nmanufacturing process.\n\n            Appellants filed the present action in the Massachusetts\n\nstate courts seeking damages for negligence, failure to warn, and\n\nviolation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.2     The suit was removed to the\n\nfederal jurisdiction by Marvin Lumber, and as previously indicated,\n\nthe district court upon motion dismissed the suit, and this appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                        I.   Standard of review\n\n            A dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is\n\nreviewable de novo.     Carreiro v. Rhodes Gill & Co., Ltd., 68 F.3d\n\n1443, 1446 (1st Cir. 1995).    The facts are considered in the light\n\nmost favorable to the non-moving party, who receives the benefit of\n\nall reasonable inferences.     Id.\n\nII.   Class actions and the doctrines of res judicata and release\n\n            \"It is beyond cavil that a suit can be barred by the\n\nearlier settlement of another suit in either of two ways: res\n\njudicata or release.\"    Nottingham Partners v. Trans-Lux Corp., 925\n\nF.2d 29, 31-32 (1st Cir. 1991).      Although in this case the district\n\ncourt ruled only on res judicata grounds, appellee claims the\n\napplicability of both defenses.\n\n\n\n2\n    Chapter 93A prohibits \"[u]nfair methods of competition and\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade\nor commerce,\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, ยง 2, and provides for\nenforcement by the Attorney General and through civil actions.\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            Res judicata is a valid defense to a later suit if (1)\n\nthere is a final judgment on the merits of an earlier action, and\n\n(2) there is identity of the parties and (3) identity of the claims\n\nin both suits.      See United States v. Cunan, 156 F.3d 110, 114 (1st\n\nCir.    1998).      In   appropriate        circumstances        these    rules     are\n\napplicable to class actions. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd.\n\nv. Epstein, 516 U.S. 367, 379 (1996) (\"There is of course no\n\ndispute that under elementary principles of prior adjudication a\n\njudgment in a properly entertained class action is binding on class\n\nmembers in any subsequent litigation.\") (quoting Cooper v. Fed.\n\nReserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 867, 874 (1984))(quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            The first prong of this rule, whether there is extant a\n\nfinal   judgment    on   the    merits    in    the   first   suit,      is   clearly\n\nsatisfied considering the final judgment of the Minnesota court in\n\nO'Hara.\n\n            The issue in the second prong, the identity of the\n\nparties, is intermingled with appellants' due process claims,\n\nwherein appellants allege that they failed to receive actual notice\n\nof the O'Hara suit and settlement, and thus are not bound by the\n\nsubsequent judgment.       Although it is a fundamental requirement of\n\ndue process that interested parties be apprised of the pendency of\n\nactions   in     which   they   have   an      interest,   and    be     afforded    an\n\nopportunity to present their allegations, such requirements can be\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fmet in appropriate cases by methods of notification other than\n\nactual personal notice.      Cf. Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Tr. Co., 339\n\nU.S. 306 (1950); Lombard v. United States, No. 03-1430, 2004 U.S.\n\nApp. LEXIS 1214, *8-11 (1st Cir. Jan. 23, 2004).\n\n            \"Individual notice of class proceedings is not meant to\n\nguarantee that every member entitled to individual notice receives\n\nsuch notice,\" but \"it is the court's duty to ensure that the notice\n\nordered   is    reasonably   calculated   to   reach   the   absent   class\n\nmembers.\"      Hallman v. Pa. Life Ins. Co., 536 F. Supp. 745, 748-49\n\n(N.D. Ala. 1982) (quotation marks and citation omitted); see also\n\nIn re Viatron Computer Sys. Corp. Litig., 614 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n1980); Key v. Gillette Co., 90 F.R.D. 606, 612 (D. Mass. 1981); cf.\n\nLombard, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS at *8-11.          After such appropriate\n\nnotice is given, if the absent class members fail to opt out of the\n\nclass action, such members will be bound by the court's actions,\n\nincluding settlement and judgment, even though those individuals\n\nnever actually receive notice. Cooper, 467 U.S. at 874; 7B Charles\n\nAlan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and\n\nProcedure ยง 1789 (2d ed. 1986).\n\n            Such is the present case, with notification by mail to\n\nall known members of the certified class, and the publication of\n\nthis notice being placed in 33 newspapers of general circulation\n\nthroughout the United States. The record shows that appellants did\n\nnot receive mailed notification of the O'Hara proceedings because,\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fnot having purchased Marvin Lumber's products directly from that\n\ncompany, their names did not appear in any Marvin Lumber record.\n\nHowever,   the   notice     was   published     in   the    Boston   Globe,    a\n\nMassachusetts newspaper of general circulation.              The O'Hara court\n\nfound that the notice procedures met the requirements of the\n\napplicable Minnesota Rule of Civil Procedure and comported with due\n\nprocess requirements.3      At a minimum, as applied to appellants, the\n\nnewspaper notices met the legal requirements of due process.                  See\n\nLombard, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 1214 at *8-9.\n\n           The O'Hara court determined that the class had been\n\nadequately represented and that the settlement was fair, entering\n\njudgment approving the settlement.          Appellants, having purchased\n\nMarvin Lumber windows in 1988, were merged into the O'Hara class.\n\nThe second prong of the res judicata standard, identity of the\n\nparties, was thus met.\n\n           Appellants reserve their strongest arguments in support\n\nof their challenge to compliance with the third res judicata prong,\n\nthe   identity   of   the    O'Hara    action    with      the   present   one.\n\nEssentially, appellants argue lack of identity of causes of action\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Given that such findings and judgment are entitled to full faith\nand credit, U.S. Const. art IV, ยง 1, it is doubtful that their\nvalidity is subject to collateral challenge in a proceeding in the\nfederal courts. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1257; D.C. Court of Appeals v.\nFeldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263\nU.S. 413 (1923).\n\n                                      -8-\n\fin that the present suit is based on Marvin Lumber's breach of its\n\npost-sale duty to warn persons who purchased its products, while\n\nthe O'Hara complaint stated claims for breach of contract, and\n\nbreach    of     express     and    implied      warranties.     They   attempt   to\n\ndistinguish the two suits by characterizing the O'Hara suit as one\n\narising     from       the   sale     of    Marvin      Lumber    products     while\n\ncharacterizing their own as one arising from a post-sale duty to\n\nwarn,     which    continued        through      the   O'Hara    proceedings      and\n\nthereafter.        Appellants also claim that the present action is\n\n\"qualitatively different\" from the O'Hara suit in that the relief\n\nsought in that case was for damages for replacement of the windows\n\nand costs associated with replacement of the same, while in the\n\npresent     case    appellants       seek     damages    for     property    damages\n\nassociated with the defects inherent in the windows.\n\n               When viewed in the light of established res judicata\n\ndoctrine,      these    arguments     present      distinctions     without    legal\n\nsignificance.\n\n               To begin with, we are unaware of, nor do appellants point\n\nto, any cognizable precedent holding that the type of relief sought\n\nin any way factors into the res judicata formula.                   Succinctly, it\n\nis the operative facts and the underlying causes of actions that\n\nare of determinative relevance.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f           Although we are not convinced that there is meaningful\n\ndifference between the actions,4 appellants must surmount an even\n\nmore   difficult    hurdle.   Even    if    the   claims   are   sufficiently\n\ndissimilar, established law requires us to look to the law of the\n\nstate where the prior judgment was entered to determine the res\n\njudicata consequences of that judgment, Nottingham Partners, 925\n\nF.2d at 32, an exercise which does not favor appellants' position.\n\nUnder Minnesota law, \"res judicata principles apply 'not only as to\n\nevery matter which was actually litigated, but also as to every\n\nmatter which might have been litigated, therein.\"            Thompson v. Am.\n\nTobacco Co., Inc., 189 F.R.D. 544, 550 (D. Minn. 1999) (quoting\n\nYoungstown Mines Corp. v. Prout, 124 N.W.2d 328, 340 (Minn. 1963)).\n\nSee also Sondel v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 934, 938 (8th\n\nCir. 1995) (\"[A] judgment on the merits constitutes an absolute bar\n\nto a second suit for the same cause of action, and is conclusive\n\nbetween parties and privies, not only as to every other matter\n\nwhich was actually litigated, but also as to every matter which\n\nmight have been litigated therein.\")(quoting Dorso Trailer v. Am.\n\nBody &   Trailer,    482   N.W.2d    771,   774   (Minn.   1992))   (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n4\n   The common nucleus of operative fact between the two cases is\nMarvin's sale of defective windows, and both plaintiffs in O'Hara\nand here seek compensation for their injuries caused by those\ndefective windows. As stated in the district court's dismissal\norder, appellant's \"argument that the substance of their claims was\nnot litigated as part of the class action cannot be sustained on\nany fair reading of the underlying amended class action complaint.\"\n\n                                     -10-\n\f             Appellants' reliance on language in Cameron v. Tomes, 990\n\nF.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1993) is misplaced.              There, quoting the\n\nSupreme Court in Cooper v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S.\n\nat 880, we stated that \"a class action judgment . . . binds the\n\nclass members as to matters actually litigated but does not resolve\n\nany claim based on individual circumstances that was not addressed\n\nin the class action.\"            Cameron 990 F.2d at 17.           In Cameron,\n\nhowever, the prior class action challenged general conditions at a\n\nstate treatment center for the sexually dangerous, while Cameron's\n\nlater suit rested\n\n             primarily on [his] claims that his unusual\n             situation requires special accommodations;\n             specifically, that his physical disability\n             affects his need for outside medical visits,\n             freer movement within the Treatment Center,\n             and separate bunking arrangements adapted to\n             his handicap, and that his mental condition\n             . . . makes ordinary physical searches,\n             disciplinary     arrangements     and    other\n             constraints unsuitable, indeed psychologically\n             dangerous, for him.\n\nId. at 18.\n\n             Cameron's quoted language is clearly distinguishable from\n\nthe    present   case,   in   which    appellants    point   to     no   unique\n\ncircumstances applicable to their case which was outside the scope\n\nof    the   matters   actually    litigated,   or   that   could    have   been\n\nlitigated, in O'Hara. Appellants place their reliance on allegedly\n\ndistinct causes of action, not different factual predicates.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f          Last, it is clear that the release entered into in the\n\nO'Hara case, and approved by the court as part of the settlement\n\nprocess, is an equally imposing hurdle to the present suit.   \"[A]\n\ncourt-approved settlement containing a release may be applied\n\nagainst a class member who is not a representative member, even if\n\nthat member objects to the settlement, so long as acceptable\n\nprocedural safeguards have been employed.\"    Nottingham Partners,\n\n925 F.2d at 33.   \"[I]n order to achieve a comprehensive settlement\n\nthat would prevent litigation of settled questions at the core of\n\na class action, a court may permit the release of a claim based on\n\nthe identical factual predicate as that underlying the claims in\n\nthe settled class action even though the claim was not presented\n\nand might not even have been presentable in the class action.\"\n\nMatsushita, 516 U.S. at 377 (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n          Such was the release in the O'Hara case settlement. It\n\nprovides for the release of:\n\n          any and all claims, rights, damages, losses,\n          demands, obligations, actions, causes of\n          actions, suits, cross-claims, matters, issues,\n          debts,    liens,    contracts,    liabilities,\n          arguments, costs or expenses of any nature\n          whatsoever   ascertained   or   unascertained,\n          suspected or unsuspected, existing or claimed\n          to exist, . . . that have been or could have\n          been asserted arising out of any purchase or\n          performance of a Marvin PILT unit(either\n          directly or indirectly) to the extent that\n          such claims are based upon any allegations\n          that were or could have been asserted in the\n          Amended Complaint filed in this Action . . .\n          or that are based on any theory of breach of\n          contract, breach of expressed warranty, breach\n\n                                -12-\n\f          of implied warranties, violation of consumer\n          protection statutes, unlawful trade practices,\n          or any other theory . . . that might in the\n          future be asserted. . . .\n\nUnquestionably, this release is sufficiently broad to encompass the\n\nappellants' complaint and the allegations therein.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          We have considered all of the issues raised by appellants\n\nand find them without legal merit. The order and judgment appealed\n\nfrom are hereby affirmed.

R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The complaint alleges damages by reason of defective windows manufactured by Marvin Lumber, a Minnesota corporation, which were purchased by appellants, Massachusetts residents, through a supplier in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its motion, Marvin Lumber raised as a defense to the present suit the preclusive effects of a settlement and judgment entered in a class action brought in the state courts of Minnesota, entitled <i>O'Hara v. Marvin Lumber &amp; Cedar Co., Inc.,</i> Civil Action No. PD 00-014027 (\"the <i>O'Hara</i> suit\"). The district court agreed with Marvin Lumber, and this appeal followed. Appellants contend that the district court erred in dismissing their complaint on res judicata grounds, because they allegedly failed to receive actual notice of the <i>O'Hara</i> suit and because their claims were distinct from those litigated in <i>O'Hara.</i> It is their view that to allow preclusive effect to such a judgment violates their right to due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons hereinafter stated, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1985 and 1988, Marvin Lumber, a national manufacturer of windows and doors, treated its products with a wood preservative known as \"PILT\" which it acquired from PPG Industries, Inc. This preservative was ineffective and defective, resulting in the premature deterioration of many of Marvin Lumber's windows. This situation spawned the <i>O'Hara</i> class action in 1999, in which the class was defined as all owners of defective windows and doors manufactured by Marvin Lumber treated with PILT during the years 1985 to 1988. Damages were sought in excess of $70 million dollars, including damages resulting from Marvin Lumber's alleged failure to warn about the defective PILT treatment. Recovery was sought based on the consumer protection statutes of all fifty states and the District of Columbia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, the <i>O'Hara</i> suit was settled, with the approval of the judge presiding over said matter, in Minnesota's Fourth Judicial District, that state's trial court of general jurisdiction. Pursuant to Minnesota Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which is substantially similar to its federal counterpart, Fed.R.Civ.P. 23, a fund was established in the amount of $300,000 to pay for the costs of notifying the class members. Thereafter, direct mail notices were sent to all identifiable class members, with similar notices being published in 33 newspapers throughout the United States. The notices included a toll-free number and the address of a web-site, established to provide potential class members with information about the class action and to make available appropriate forms for their active participation in the proceedings or to allow them to opt out of the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, and before the class settlement was approved, the Minnesota court, as required by state law (in similar fashion to its federal counterpart), held a fairness hearing to determine whether the settlement was reasonable, adequate, and in the best interest of the class. At least one Massachusetts resident appeared at the hearing to challenge the settlement, on the grounds that under Massachusetts law the claims were not yet time-barred, an objection that was overruled by the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On December 4, 2001, the <i>O'Hara</i> court determined that the settlement was fair, adequate, and reasonable, and proceeded to approve it. The court specifically concluded that the notice provided to class members was the best notice practicable, and thus entered final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants purchased windows manufactured by Marvin Lumber windows in 1988. This was done through a building contractor who acquired the windows from a local hardware store in Massachusetts. Thereafter, the windows were installed in their residences. In the autumn of 2002, it was discovered that they were suffering from wood decay problems and related damage to appellants' residence and upon inspection it was concluded that these were caused by the inadequate preservatives used in the manufacturing process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants filed the present action in the Massachusetts state courts seeking damages for negligence, failure to warn, and violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The suit was removed to the federal jurisdiction by Marvin Lumber, and as previously indicated, the district court upon motion dismissed the suit, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Standard of review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) is reviewable de novo. <i>Carreiro v. Rhodes Gill &amp; Co., Ltd.,</i> 68 F.3d 1443, 1446 (1st Cir.1995). The facts are considered in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, who receives the benefit of all reasonable inferences. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Class actions and the doctrines of res judicata and release</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is beyond cavil that a suit can be barred by the earlier settlement of another suit in either of two ways: res judicata or release.\" <i>Nottingham Partners v. Trans-Lux Corp.,</i> 925 F.2d 29, 31-32 (1st Cir. 1991). Although in this case the district court ruled only on res judicata grounds, appellee claims the applicability of both defenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Res judicata is a valid defense to a later suit if (1) there is a final judgment on the merits of an earlier action, and (2) there is identity of the parties and (3) identity of the claims in both suits. <i>See United States v. Cunan,</i> 156 F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir.1998). In appropriate circumstances these rules are applicable to class actions. <i>See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Epstein,</i> 516 U.S. 367, 379, 116 S.Ct. 873, 134 L.Ed.2d 6 (1996) (\"There is of course no dispute that under elementary principles of prior adjudication a judgment in a properly entertained class action is binding on class members in any subsequent litigation.\") (quoting <i>Cooper v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond,</i> 467 U.S. 867, 874, 104 S.Ct. 2794, 81 L.Ed.2d 718 (1984))(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first prong of this rule, whether there is extant a final judgment on the merits in the first suit, is clearly satisfied considering the final judgment of the Minnesota court in <i>O'Hara.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue in the second prong, the identity of the parties, is intermingled with appellants' due process claims, wherein appellants allege that they failed to receive <i>actual</i> notice of the <i>O'Hara</i> suit and settlement, and thus are not bound by the subsequent judgment. Although it is a fundamental requirement of due process that interested parties be apprised of the pendency of actions in which they have an interest, and be afforded an opportunity to present their allegations, such requirements can be met in appropriate cases by methods of notification other than actual personal notice. <i>Cf. Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Tr. Co.,</i> 339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950); <i>Lombard v. United States,</i> 356 F.3d 151, 156 (1st Cir. 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Individual notice of class proceedings is not meant to guarantee that every member entitled to individual notice receives such notice,\" but \"it is the court's duty to ensure that the notice ordered is reasonably calculated to reach the absent class members.\" <i>Hallman v. Pa. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 536 F.Supp. 745, 748-49 (N.D.Ala. 1982) (quotation marks and citation omitted); <i>see also In re Viatron Computer Sys. Corp.

After such appropriate notice is given, if the absent class members fail to opt out of the class action, such members will be bound by the court's actions, including settlement and judgment, even though those individuals never actually receive notice. <i>Cooper,</i> 467 U.S. at 874, 104 S.Ct. 2794; 7B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1789 (2d ed.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such is the present case, with notification by mail to all known members of the certified class, and the publication of this notice being placed in 33 newspapers of general circulation throughout the United States. The record shows that appellants did not receive mailed notification of the <i>O'Hara</i> proceedings because, not having purchased Marvin Lumber's products directly from that company, their names did not appear in any Marvin Lumber record. However, the notice was published in the <i>Boston Globe,</i> a Massachusetts newspaper of general circulation. The O'Hara court found that the notice procedures met the requirements of the applicable Minnesota Rule of Civil Procedure and comported with due process requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At a minimum, as applied to appellants, the newspaper notices met the legal requirements of due process. <i>See Lombard,</i> at 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>O'Hara</i> court determined that the class had been adequately represented and that the settlement was fair, entering judgment approving the settlement. Appellants, having purchased Marvin Lumber windows in 1988, were merged into the <i>O'Hara</i> class. The second prong of the res judicata standard, identity of the parties, was thus met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants reserve their strongest arguments in support of their challenge to compliance with the third res judicata prong, the identity of the <i>O'Hara</i> action with the present one. Essentially, appellants argue lack of identity of causes of action in that the present suit is based on Marvin Lumber's breach of its post-sale duty to warn persons who purchased its products, while the <i>O'Hara</i> complaint stated claims for breach of contract, and breach of express and implied warranties. They attempt to distinguish the two suits by characterizing the <i>O'Hara</i> suit as one arising from the sale of Marvin Lumber products while characterizing their own as one arising from a post-sale duty to warn, which continued through the <i>O'Hara</i> proceedings and thereafter. Appellants also claim that the present action is \"qualitatively different\" from the <i>O'Hara</i> suit in that the relief sought in that case was for damages for replacement of the windows and costs associated with replacement of the same, while in the present case appellants seek damages for property damages associated with the defects inherent in the windows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When viewed in the light of established res judicata doctrine, these arguments present distinctions without legal significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, we are unaware of, nor do appellants point to, any cognizable precedent holding that the type of relief sought in any way factors into the res judicata formula. Succinctly, it is the operative facts and the underlying causes of actions that are of determinative relevance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are not convinced that there is meaningful difference between the actions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> appellants must surmount an even more difficult hurdle. Even if the claims are sufficiently dissimilar, established law requires us to look to the law of the state where the prior judgment was entered to determine the res judicata consequences of that judgment, <i>Nottingham Partners,</i> 925 F.2d at 32, an exercise which does not favor appellants' position. Under Minnesota law, \"res judicata principles apply `not only as to every matter which was actually litigated, but also as to every matter which might have been litigated, therein.'\" <i>Thompson v. Am. Tobacco Co., Inc.,</i> 189 F.R.D. 544, 550 (D.Minn.1999) (quoting <i>Youngstown Mines Corp. v. Prout,</i> 266 Minn. 450, 124 N.W.2d 328, 340 (1963)). <i>See also Sondel v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</i> 56 F.3d 934, 938 (8th Cir.1995) (\"[A] judgment on the merits constitutes an absolute bar to a second suit for the same cause of action, and is conclusive between parties and privies, not only as to every other matter which was actually litigated, but also as to every matter which might have been litigated therein.\")(quoting <i>Dorso Trailer v. Am. Body &amp; Trailer,</i> 482 N.W.2d 771, 774 (Minn.1992)) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' reliance on language in <i>Cameron v. Tomes,</i> 990 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1993) is misplaced. There, quoting the Supreme Court in <i>Cooper v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond,</i> 467 U.S. at 880, 104 S.Ct. 2794, we stated that \"a class action judgment ... binds the class members as to matters actually litigated but does not resolve any claim based on individual circumstances that was not addressed in the class action.\" <i>Cameron</i> 990 F.2d at 17. In <i>Cameron,</i> however, the prior class action challenged general conditions at a state treatment center for the sexually dangerous, while Cameron's later suit rested</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">primarily on [his] claims that his unusual situation requires special accommodations; specifically, that his physical disability affects his need for outside medical visits, freer movement within the Treatment Center, and separate bunking arrangements adapted to his handicap, and that his mental condition ... makes ordinary physical searches, disciplinary arrangements and other constraints unsuitable, indeed psychologically dangerous, for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Cameron's</i> quoted language is clearly distinguishable from the present case, in which appellants point to no unique circumstances applicable to their case which was outside the scope of the matters actually litigated, or that could have been litigated, in <i>O'Hara.</i> Appellants place their reliance on allegedly distinct causes of action, not different factual predicates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last, it is clear that the release entered into in the <i>O'Hara</i> case, and approved by the court as part of the settlement process, is an equally imposing hurdle to the present suit. \"[A] court-approved settlement containing a release may be applied against a class member who is not a representative member, even if that member objects to the settlement, so long as acceptable procedural safeguards have been employed.\" <i>Nottingham Partners,</i> 925 F.2d at 33. \"[I]n order to achieve a comprehensive settlement that would prevent litigation of settled questions at the core of a class action, a court may permit the release of a claim based on the identical factual predicate as that underlying the claims in the settled class action even though the claim was not presented and might not even have been presentable in the class action.\" <i>Matsushita,</i> 516 U.S. at 377, 116 S.Ct. 873 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such was the release in the <i>O'Hara</i> case settlement.

Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> &#167; 1789 (2d ed.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such is the present case, with notification by mail to all known members of the certified class, and the publication of this notice being placed in 33 newspapers of general circulation throughout the United States. The record shows that appellants did not receive mailed notification of the <i>O'Hara</i> proceedings because, not having purchased Marvin Lumber's products directly from that company, their names did not appear in any Marvin Lumber record. However, the notice was published in the <i>Boston Globe,</i> a Massachusetts newspaper of general circulation. The O'Hara court found that the notice procedures met the requirements of the applicable Minnesota Rule of Civil Procedure and comported with due process requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At a minimum, as applied to appellants, the newspaper notices met the legal requirements of due process. <i>See Lombard,</i> at 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>O'Hara</i> court determined that the class had been adequately represented and that the settlement was fair, entering judgment approving the settlement. Appellants, having purchased Marvin Lumber windows in 1988, were merged into the <i>O'Hara</i> class. The second prong of the res judicata standard, identity of the parties, was thus met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants reserve their strongest arguments in support of their challenge to compliance with the third res judicata prong, the identity of the <i>O'Hara</i> action with the present one. Essentially, appellants argue lack of identity of causes of action in that the present suit is based on Marvin Lumber's breach of its post-sale duty to warn persons who purchased its products, while the <i>O'Hara</i> complaint stated claims for breach of contract, and breach of express and implied warranties. They attempt to distinguish the two suits by characterizing the <i>O'Hara</i> suit as one arising from the sale of Marvin Lumber products while characterizing their own as one arising from a post-sale duty to warn, which continued through the <i>O'Hara</i> proceedings and thereafter. Appellants also claim that the present action is \"qualitatively different\" from the <i>O'Hara</i> suit in that the relief sought in that case was for damages for replacement of the windows and costs associated with replacement of the same, while in the present case appellants seek damages for property damages associated with the defects inherent in the windows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When viewed in the light of established res judicata doctrine, these arguments present distinctions without legal significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin with, we are unaware of, nor do appellants point to, any cognizable precedent holding that the type of relief sought in any way factors into the res judicata formula. Succinctly, it is the operative facts and the underlying causes of actions that are of determinative relevance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are not convinced that there is meaningful difference between the actions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> appellants must surmount an even more difficult hurdle. Even if the claims are sufficiently dissimilar, established law requires us to look to the law of the state where the prior judgment was entered to determine the res judicata consequences of that judgment, <i>Nottingham Partners,</i> 925 F.2d at 32, an exercise which does not favor appellants' position.
