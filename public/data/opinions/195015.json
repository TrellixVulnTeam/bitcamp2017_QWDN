Following  a guilty verdict, a reviewing\n\ncourt  must   scrutinize  the  record,  drawing   all  reasonable\n\ninferences in  favor of the  verdict, to ascertain if  a rational\n\njury could have found that  the government proved each element of\n\nthe  crime beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.   See  United States  v.\n                                                             \n\nEcheverri, 982  F.2d 675, 677  (1st Cir. 1993); United  States v.\n                                                              \n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d  707, 711 (1st  Cir. 1992), cert. denied,  113 S.\n                                                        \n\nCt. 1005 (1993).   The government can satisfy its burden of proof\n\nby  either direct or circumstantial evidence.  See Echeverri, 982\n                                                            \n\nF.2d at  679; United  States v.

To sustain a\n                             \n\nconviction,  a reviewing  court  need not  conclude  that only  a\n\nguilty verdict could appropriately be reached; it is  enough that\n\nthe  jury's  determination  draws its  essence  from  a plausible\n\nreading of  the record.   See Echeverri, 982 F.2d  at 677; Ortiz,\n                                                                \n\n966 F.2d at 711.

Id.  at 998.  See also Smith  v. United States,\n                                                                \n\n113 S.

Maryland, 373 U.S.\n                                                       \n\n83, 87 (1963),  and by the Jencks  Act, 18 U.S.C.    3500 (1988).\n\nThis  complaint  misconstrues  the  constraints  under  which the\n\ngovernment must operate in a criminal case.  \n\n          Appellant brands  three different pieces  of \"evidence\"\n\nas improperly withheld.  The  first item is a supposed  Bureau of\n\nCriminal Identification report.   The record  fails to show  that\n\n                    \n\n     2Appellant's  furtive actions    he  admitted,  for example,\nhaving  defenestrated the narcotics inventory as trouble loomed  \nwere frosting on the cake, so to speak.\n\n                                4\n\nany such report  ever existed.  The second  item, never precisely\n\ndescribed,  concerns \"Jose Garcia.\"   The reference  is puzzling:\n\nalthough  the prosecutor  mentioned Garcia  fleetingly in  cross-\n\nexamining appellant, the record does  not contain even a  whisper\n\nof  a hint  of a  suggestion  that the  government possessed  any\n\nstatement from, report concerning, or other concrete  information\n\nanent \"Jose  Garcia.\"  The  government is surely not  required to\n\ndisclose  nonexistent  documents  or information  unknown  to it.\n\nSee,  e.g., United States v. Aichele, 941 F.2d 761, 764 (9th Cir.\n                                    \n\n1991); United States v. Glaze, 643 F.2d 549, 552 (8th Cir. 1981).\n                             \n\n          The last  piece of  evidence is  a so-called  \"N.C.I.C.\n\nreport.\"   This report was,  in fact, given to  appellant, albeit\n\nbelatedly   but appellant neglected to seek a continuance when he\n\nreceived the report and, what is more,  he has failed to show the\n\nslightest  prejudice arising from the delayed disclosure.3  Thus,\n\neven assuming, arguendo  , that the N.C.I.C.  report comes within\n                       \n\nthe Brady  realm, the assignment  of error founders.   See, e.g.,\n                                                                \n\nUnited States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 290 (1st Cir. 1990); United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Ingraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 413 (1st Cir. 1986).\n                  \n\n                               III \n                               III\n\n          Appellant's  final   claim  of  error  relates  to  the\n\ndistrict  court's admission  of the  handgun into evidence.   The\n\n                    \n\n     3The  N.C.I.C. report  contained  only  a  single  piece  of\n(negative) information:   it indicated that  the handgun was  not\nlisted as  stolen property.   It is hard  to see how  this tidbit\ncomprised relevant evidence.  See Fed. R. Evid. 402.\n                                 \n\n                                5\n\ncenterpiece of this claim is the asseveration that the government\n\ndid  not satisfactorily  forge the  chain  of custody.   We  have\n\nexamined the  record closely  and are  satisfied that, here,  the\n\narguable  gaps in the  chain of custody  go to the  weight of the\n\nevidence  rather than  to its  admissibility.  See,  e.g., United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Ladd,  885 F.2d  954, 956  (1st Cir. 1989).   No  error\n              \n\ninhered.\n\n                                IV\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.    Our  perscrutation  fully\n\npersuades  us that  appellant's legal  arguments  lack merit  and\n\nthat, therefore, his conviction must stand.\n\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n              \n\n                                6\n",

Following a guilty verdict, a reviewing court must scrutinize the record, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict, to ascertain if a rational jury could have found that the government proved each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.   See United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 677 (1st Cir. 1993);  United States v.

To sustain a conviction, a reviewing court need not conclude that only a guilty verdict could appropriately be reached;  it is enough that the jury's determination draws its essence from a plausible reading of the record.   See Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 677;   Ortiz, 966 F.2d at 711.  Using these guideposts, the quantum of evidence adduced here, though largely circumstantial, is adequate to the task.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In  United States v.

Drugs and a handgun were thrown from the window as the police effected an entry.  Appellant was the sole person discovered inside the apartment.  He admitted to an INS agent, Bernstein, that he knew the pistol was kept at the premises where drugs were being sold.  We think this evidence is more than ample.  Applying the Hadfield standard, a rational jury could certainly find a facilitative nexus, that is, the jury could reasonably conclude that the weapon was kept in the apartment to be \"available for use\" during and in relation to the ongoing drug trafficking-and that appellant knew as much.
