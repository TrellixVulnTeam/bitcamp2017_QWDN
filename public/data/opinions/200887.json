This    pregnancy   and   gender\n\ndiscrimination case is before us for the second time. See Alberty-\n\nVélez v. Corporación de Puerto Rico Para La Difusión Pública, 242\n\nF.3d       418   (1st   Cir.    2001)    (\"Alberty-Vélez    I\").      Despite   its\n\ncomplicated        history,      this   second   appeal    presents   a   familiar\n\nquestion--did the district court correctly grant summary judgment\n\nfor the defendant?              We conclude that summary disposition was\n\nappropriate because a reasonable fact finder could only conclude\n\nthat the plaintiff was an independent contractor and therefore not\n\ncovered by Title VII or the Puerto Rico anti-discrimination laws.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm.\n\n                     I.     Background and Prior Proceedings\n\n                 Victoria      Lis    Alberty-Vélez      brought   suit     against\n\nCorporación de Puerto Rico para la Difusión Pública (\"WIPR\") for\n\npregnancy and gender discrimination, in violation of Title VII of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, P.R. Laws Ann. Tit. 29,\n\n146 et seq., and P.R. Laws Ann. Tit. 29, 467 et seq.                  Because our\n\ndecision rests on Alberty's independent contractor status, we limit\n\nour factual summary to the undisputed facts concerning the parties'\n\nrelationship.1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Our ability to determine the undisputed facts has been\nhampered by Alberty's failure to file a compliant brief. Alberty\nfailed to provide appendix citations for her recitation of the\nfacts relevant to her employee status argument. See Fed. R. App.\nP. 28(a)(7). We will resolve any resulting uncertainty against\nAlberty. See Credit Francais, Int'l v. Bio-Vita, Ltd., 78 F.3d\n698, 701 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\f            Alberty's     relationship      with    WIPR,     a   Puerto    Rico\n\ntelevision station, began in 1993, when she agreed to host its new\n\nshow \"Desde Mi Pueblo.\"            This program profiled municipalities\n\nthroughout Puerto Rico by presenting interviews with residents and\n\ninteresting information about the featured community. The show had\n\nthree hosts, Alberty, Luis Antonio Rivera, and Deborah Carthy Deu.\n\n            Alberty appeared on the program from July 1993 until\n\nNovember 1994.    Instead of signing a single contract to host the\n\nshow, Alberty signed a new contract for each episode.                       Each\n\ncontract obligated       Alberty    to   work   a   certain   number   of   days\n\n(usually two) filming the show in a specific town.                  Under the\n\nparties' arrangement, Alberty was not obliged to film additional\n\nepisodes beyond the one for which she contracted, and WIPR was not\n\nobliged   to   enter    into   contracts    with    Alberty   for   additional\n\nepisodes.\n\n            Filming of the show did not occur weekly, and Alberty was\n\nnot obligated to WIPR during off weeks.             On the days that Alberty\n\nfilmed the show, she was on-call for the entire day.                During her\n\n\"off\" time, in addition to preparing for future episodes of \"Desde\n\nMi Pueblo\", Alberty worked other jobs, including acting on another\n\nWIPR show entitled \"Será Acaso Este Su Caso,\" hosting a concert for\n\nthe Piano Suzuki Company, and acting as the master of ceremonies\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\ffor the graduation of the Academia Infantil Nairda Hernández.2\n\nAlberty's contracts did not permit WIPR to require her to do work\n\nother than film \"Desde Mi Pueblo.\"\n\n            While filming \"Desde Mi Pueblo,\" Alberty was directed by\n\nWilliam Denizard, the show's producer.         He set the location and\n\nhours of filming, and established the basic content of the program.\n\nWIPR provided the equipment for filming (i.e., lights, camera, and\n\nmakeup).     Alberty was responsible for providing her clothing,\n\nshoes,   accessories,   hair   stylist   and   the    other   services    and\n\nmaterials required for her appearance on the show.               She could\n\neither purchase these services and materials herself or locate\n\nsponsors to provide them for her.    WIPR had to approve any sponsors\n\nthat Alberty wished to use.\n\n            Alberty received a lump sum payment for each episode of\n\n\"Desde Mi Pueblo\" that she filmed, ranging from $400 to $550.              To\n\nreceive payment, Alberty presented a signed invoice to WIPR showing\n\nthat she had performed the agreed upon work.         WIPR did not withhold\n\nincome or social security taxes from Alberty's check and did not\n\nprovide Alberty with benefits such as health insurance, life\n\ninsurance,   retirement,   paid   sick   leave,      maternity   leave,    or\n\nvacation.    On her tax return, Alberty described her income as\n\n\n\n     2\n      Alberty had a similar lump sum payment arrangement with WIPR\nfor her work on \"Será Acaso Este Su Caso.\" When Alberty performed\non both \"Desde Mi Pueblo\" and \"Será Acaso Este Su Caso,\" she\nreceived separate checks for each performance.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fderiving from professional services rendered, and WIPR did not\n\nprovide Alberty with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-2.           After\n\nher separation, Alberty received unemployment compensation from the\n\nPuerto   Rico   Department   of   Labor   indicating   that   this   agency\n\nconsidered her WIPR's employee.\n\n           Alberty's employee status has been contested throughout\n\nthe course of this litigation.      On December 24, 1998, the district\n\ncourt granted partial summary judgment for Alberty on this issue,\n\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d), declaring her an employee of WIPR.           At\n\nthe subsequent trial, the district court reversed course and\n\ngranted WIPR's motion for judgment as a matter of law, see Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 50, because Alberty was an independent contractor.              In\n\nAlberty-Vélez I, 242 F.3d at 421-26, we vacated this judgment\n\nbecause the district court did not provide Alberty with notice of\n\nits intention to revisit the employee/independent contractor issue\n\nat trial, thereby denying Alberty a fair opportunity to contest\n\nthis issue.\n\n           On remand, the parties consented to assigning the case to\n\na magistrate judge.    After the case was reassigned, WIPR filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment on the employee/independent contractor\n\nissue.   Alberty opposed the motion both on the merits and on the\n\nground that the issue should not be reconsidered in light of the\n\nearlier ruling declaring Alberty an employee.          The district court\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fentertained WIPR's summary judgment motion but denied it because of\n\nfactual disputes.3\n\n            Alberty and WIPR also cross-moved for summary judgment on\n\nthe discrimination issue. The district court determined that there\n\nwas no evidence of discriminatory animus by WIPR toward Alberty and\n\naccordingly entered judgment in WIPR's favor.           Alberty appealed.4\n\n                      II. Summary Judgment Standard\n\n         We review summary judgment rulings de novo.        See Serapion v.\n\nMartínez, 119 F.3d 982, 987 (1st Cir. 1997).           A court should grant\n\nsummary    judgment   “if   the   pleadings,    depositions,      answers    to\n\ninterrogatories,      and   admissions    on   file,   together    with     the\n\n\n\n     3\n     Alberty cross-moved for summary judgment on the employee\nstatus issue. The district court also denied this motion.\n     4\n      WIPR cross-appealed from the denial of its motion for summary\njudgment based on independent contractor status. This was not the\nproper procedure.     A party may not appeal from a favorable\njudgment.   See California v. Rooney, 483 U.S. 307, 311 (1987).\nWIPR received the entire relief that it sought from the district\ncourt (i.e., favorable judgment on all counts) and therefore cannot\nappeal. See Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 333\n(1980) (A \"party who receives all that he has sought generally is\nnot aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief and cannot\nappeal from it.\").      However, on appeal, WIPR may argue for\naffirming the summary judgment ruling based on arguments that the\ndistrict court rejected. See United States v. American Ry. Express\nCo., 265 U.S. 425, 435 (1924) (\"[T]he appellee may, without taking\na cross-appeal, urge in support of a decree any matter appearing in\nthe record, although his argument may involve an attack upon the\nreasoning of the lower court or an insistence upon matter\noverlooked or ignored by it.\").     Therefore, WIPR may argue, in\nopposition to Alberty's appeal, that the summary judgment ruling\nwas correct because Alberty was an independent contractor. We will\ntreat WIPR's cross-appeal as a request that we affirm the summary\njudgment ruling on this basis.\n\n                                    -6-\n\faffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.”    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n         We may affirm a summary judgment ruling on any basis\n\napparent from the record.    See Fabiano v. Hopkins, 352 F.3d 447,\n\n452 (1st Cir. 2003).    Although the district court granted summary\n\njudgment because Alberty failed to present evidence of unlawful\n\ndiscrimination, we resolve the matter on the threshold question of\n\nemployee/independent contractor status.     See supra at n.4.5\n\n                            III. Analysis\n\n         Title VII protects employees from discrimination based on\n\npregnancy and gender.    See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k); Cal. Fed. Sav. &\n\nLoan Ass'n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272, 277 (1987).         The statute\n\n\n     5\n      We reject Alberty's contention that, because the district\ncourt initially granted partial summary judgment declaring Alberty\nan employee of WIPR, the magistrate judge to whom the case was\nreassigned could not reconsider this ruling later in the\nlitigation.   A partial summary judgment order is not a final\njudgment but is merely a pre-trial adjudication that certain issues\nare established for trial.       See Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v.\nMassingill, 24 F.3d 768, 774 (5th Cir. 1994); Deimer v. Cincinnati\nSub-Zero Prods., Inc., 990 F.2d 342, 345-46 (7th Cir. 1993). A\ndistrict court \"retains jurisdiction to modify a [Rule 56(d)] order\nat any time.\" Alberty-Vélez I, 242 F.3d at 422 (citing 10B Charles\nA. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice &\nProcedure, § 2737 (3d ed. 1998)). However, if a district court\nrevisits a partial summary judgment order, it must \"inform the\nparties and give them an opportunity to present evidence relating\nto the newly revived issue.\"       Id. (quoting Leddy v. Standard\nDrywall, Inc., 875 F.2d 383, 386 (2d Cir. 1989)). Alberty received\nadequate notice that the magistrate judge intended to revisit the\nemployee status issue prior to its adjudication, and she was able\nto present evidence on the matter by responding to WIPR's summary\njudgment motion.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fdefines an \"employee\" as \"an individual employed by an employer.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e(f).     This definition \"is completely circular and\n\nexplains nothing.\" Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S.\n\n318, 323 (1992); Alberty-Vélez I, 242 F.3d at 421.         However, it is\n\nnow clear that it does not cover independent contractors.               See\n\nDykes v. DePuy, Inc., 140 F.3d 31, 37 n.6 (1st Cir. 1998).           Thus,\n\nan independent contractor may not maintain a Title VII action\n\nagainst the entity with which she contracts. See Alexander v. Rush\n\nNorth Med. Ctr., 101 F.3d 487, 492 (7th Cir. 1996); Barbara\n\nLindeman & Paul Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law, 1284 (3d\n\ned. 1996)\n\n         This circuit has yet to identify the test to apply to\n\ndetermine whether an individual meets Title VII's definition of\n\n\"employee.\"      Relying on Darden, we have applied the \"common law\n\nagency   test\"     in   cases   arising   under    other   federal   anti-\n\ndiscrimination     statutes     containing   the   same    definition   of\n\n\"employee\" as Title VII.6       See Dykes,    140 F.3d at 38 (applying\n\ncommon law test under Americans with Disabilities Act); Speen v.\n\nCrown Clothing Corp., 102 F.3d      625, 631 (1st Cir. 1998) (applying\n\ncommon law test under ERISA and Age Discrimination Employment Act).\n\nWe see no reason to apply a different test under Title VII and\n\n\n\n     6\n      Darden held that the common law agency test applies to\nidentify employees under ERISA, which, like Title VII, defines\nemployee as \"any individual employed by an employer.\" 503 U.S. at\n323.\n\n                                    -8-\n\ftherefore will apply the common law test to determine whether\n\nAlberty was WIPR's employee or an independent contractor. See,\n\ne.g., Farlow v. Wachovia Bank of N.C., 259 F.3d 309, 313-14 (4th\n\nCir. 2001) (applying common law agency test in Title VII case);\n\nEisenberg v. Advance Relocation & Storage, Inc., 237 F.3d 111, 113-\n\n14 (2d Cir. 2000) (same).   See also Employment Discrimination Law,\n\nsupra at 908 (3d ed. 2002 supp.) (stating that after \"Darden most\n\ncourts have utilized a common law agency test to determine whether\n\na plaintiff is an employee under Title VII\").\n\n         Under the common law test, a court must consider:\n\n         the hiring party's right to control the manner\n         and   means    by  which    the   product   is\n         accomplished. Among other factors relevant to\n         this inquiry are the skills required; the\n         source of the instrumentalities and tools; the\n         location of the work; the duration of the\n         relationship between the parties; whether the\n         hiring party has the right to assign\n         additional projects to the hired party; the\n         extent of the hired party's discretion over\n         when and how long to work; the method of\n         payment; the hired party's role in hiring and\n         paying assistants; whether the work is part of\n         the regular business of the hiring party;\n         whether the hiring party is in business; the\n         provision of employee benefits; and the tax\n         treatment of the hired party.\n\nDykes, 140 F.3d at 37-38 (quoting Darden, 503 U.S. at 323-24).\n\n\"The test provides 'no shorthand formula or magic phrase that can\n\nbe applied to find the answer, . . . all of the incidents of the\n\nrelationship must be assessed and weighed with no one factor being\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fdecisive.'\"            Id. at       37    (quoting      Darden,   503   U.S.   at   324).7\n\nHowever, in most situations, the extent to which the hiring party\n\ncontrols \"the manner and means\" by which the worker completes her\n\ntasks will be the most important factor in the analysis.                                 See\n\nEisenberg, 237 F.3d at 114 (citing cases).\n\n               At oral argument, Alberty conceded that there were no\n\ndisputed issues of material fact concerning employment status. In\n\nsuch       a   case,     a       court    may    decide    the    employee/independent\n\ncontractor question as a matter of law if the factors point so\n\nfavorably in one direction that a fact finder could not reasonably\n\nreach the opposite conclusion.                         See Dykes, 140 F.3d at 38-39\n\n(affirming grant of summary judgment concluding individual was\n\nindependent contractor); Speen, 102 F.3d at 634 (affirming grant\n\nof   judgment       as       a    matter    of    law     concluding    individual       was\n\nindependent contractor).\n\n               Several       factors       favor       classifying      Alberty     as    an\n\nindependent contractor.                  First, a television actress is a skilled\n\nposition requiring talent and training not available on-the-job.\n\nCf. Aymes v. Bonelli, 980 F.2d 857, 862 (2d Cir. 1992) (\"courts\n\nthat have addressed the level of skill necessary to indicate that\n\n\n\n       7\n      A court must tailor these factors to the relationship at\nissue. Often certain factors will not be relevant to a particular\ncase, and a court should not consider them as favoring either side.\nSee Eisenberg, 237 F.3d at 114. In this case, the parties present\nno evidence concerning Alberty's role, if any, in hiring and paying\nassistants. Therefore, we will not consider it.\n\n                                                -10-\n\fa party is an independent contractor have held . . . architects,\n\nphotographers, . . . artists, [and] drafters . . . to be highly\n\nskilled independent contractors\") (citing cases). In this regard,\n\nAlberty possesses a master's degree in public communications and\n\njournalism; is trained in dance, singing, and modeling; taught\n\nwithin the drama department at the University of Puerto Rico; and\n\nacted in several theater and television productions prior to her\n\naffiliation with \"Desde Mi Pueblo.\"\n\n            Second, Alberty provided the \"tools and instrumentalities\"\n\nnecessary for her to perform.          Specifically, she provided, or\n\nobtained sponsors to provide, the costumes, jewelry, and other\n\nimage-related supplies and services necessary for her appearance.8\n\n            Alberty disputes that this factor favors independent\n\ncontractor status because WIPR provided the \"equipment necessary\n\nto   tape   the   show.\"   Alberty's     argument   is   misplaced.      The\n\nequipment necessary for Alberty to conduct her job as host of\n\n\"Desde Mi Pueblo\" related to her appearance on the show.              Others\n\nprovided equipment for filming and producing the show, but these\n\n\n\n      8\n      That WIPR reserved the right to approve Alberty's sponsors\ndoes not alter this conclusion.    A company may require that it\nprovide prior approval before an independent contractor takes an\naction or associates with an entity that could reflect poorly on\nthe company. Cf. Oestman v. National Farmers Union Ins. Co., 958\nF.2d 303, 306 (10th Cir. 1992) (stating that requiring insurance\nagent to submit advertisements for pre-approval is not necessarily\nindicative of employee status because company has \"substantial\ninterest\" in advertising reflecting company standards, even if\nissued by independent contractor).\n\n                                  -11-\n\fwere not the primary tools that Alberty used to perform her\n\nparticular function.         If we accepted this argument, independent\n\ncontractors could never work on collaborative projects because\n\nother   individuals       often   provide     the   equipment   required   for\n\ndifferent aspects of the collaboration.             See Hanson v. Friends of\n\nMinnesota Sinfonia, 181 F. Supp. 2d             1003, 1008 (D. Minn. 2002)\n\n(stating     that         independent-contractor         musician     provided\n\n\"instrumentalities and tools\" by providing instrument, even though\n\nsymphony provided musical scores, rehearsal facilities, music\n\nstands, and concert schedules), aff'd sub nom. Lerohl v. Friends\n\nof Minnesota Sinfonia, 322 F.3d 486 (8th Cir. 2003), cert. denied\n\n124 S.Ct. 469 (2003).\n\n           Third, WIPR could not assign Alberty work in addition to\n\nfilming    \"Desde    Mi    Pueblo.\"      Alberty's      contracts   with   WIPR\n\nspecifically provided that WIPR hired her \"professional services\n\nas Hostess for the Program Desde Mi Pueblo.\"             There is no evidence\n\nthat WIPR assigned Alberty tasks in addition to work related to\n\nthese tapings.       To be sure, Alberty did other work for WIPR by\n\ntaping episodes of \"Será Acaso Este Su Caso\"; however, for these\n\nengagements, she signed separate contracts and received separate\n\nremuneration.\n\n           Fourth,    the     method    of    payment     favors    independent\n\ncontractor status.          Alberty received a lump sum fee for each\n\nepisode. Her compensation was based on completing the filming, not\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fthe time consumed.    If she did not film an episode she did not get\n\npaid.     See Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730,\n\n753 (1989) (pay for \"completion of a specific job [is] a method by\n\nwhich independent contractors are often compensated\") (quoting\n\nHolt v. Winpisinger, 811 F.2d 1532, 1540 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).\n\n           Fifth, WIPR did not provide Alberty with benefits.        She\n\ndid not receive paid leave, health insurance, life insurance, or\n\nretirement benefits from WIPR.9       See, e.g., Farlow, 259 F.3d at 315\n\n(stating that lack of benefits indicates independent contractor\n\nstatus); Aymes, 980 F.2d at 862 (same).\n\n           Sixth,   Alberty's   tax    treatment   suggests   independent\n\ncontractor status.      Both she and WIPR classified her income as\n\nderiving from professional services rendered rather than wages\n\nearned.     See Dykes, 140 F.3d at 38; Speen, 102 F.3d 633.\n\n           Despite these factors favoring independent contractor\n\nstatus, Alberty argues that she was WIPR's employee because WIPR\n\ncontrolled the manner of her work by directing her during filming,\n\ndictated the location of her work by selecting the filming sites,\n\nand determined the hours of her work by requiring her to be on-call\n\n\n\n     9\n     Alberty disputes this factor by arguing that, on one occasion,\nWIPR paid her, even though she could not complete an episode\nbecause of a death in her family. While Alberty tries to paint this\nas a general benefit, she identifies no evidence suggesting that\nthis was anything but a single occurrence.      Further, her other\ntestimony contradicts her assertion that there was a policy to pay\nher when she could not film. As she stated several times, if she\ndid not film an episode she did not get paid.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fduring filming days.          While      \"control\" over the manner, location,\n\nand   hours     of     work    is     often   critical      to     the   independent\n\ncontractor/employee analysis, it must be considered in light of the\n\nwork performed and the industry at issue.                   See Cilecek v. Inova\n\nHealth Sys. Servs., 115 F.3d 256, 260 (4th Cir. 1997). Considering\n\nthe tasks that an actor performs, we do not believe that the sort\n\nof control identified by Alberty necessarily indicates employee\n\nstatus.\n\n          A recent Eighth Circuit case illustrates the point.                     See\n\nLerohl    322   F.3d    486.        In   Lerohl,    the    court    considered    the\n\nemployment status of two \"regular\" musicians in the Minnesota\n\nSinfonia.       Id. at 489.           The musicians argued that they were\n\nemployees because the conductor selected the music, scheduled the\n\nrehearsals and concerts, and determined the manner in which the\n\nmusic would be played.              Id. at 490.      The court \"emphatically\"\n\nrejected the argument that the \"control\" exercised by the conductor\n\nnecessarily demonstrated the musicians' employee status because\n\n\"work by independent contractors is often performed to the exacting\n\nspecifications of the hiring party.\"               Id.    Musicians participating\n\nin an orchestra are, by necessity, subject to the control and\n\nscheduling      of   the   conductor      because    such    control     allows   the\n\nsymphony to perform as a single unit.              See id.    The court concluded\n\nthat, in these circumstances, the relevant control issue was not\n\nwhether the conductor could instruct the musicians \"where to sit\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fand when to play\" but whether the musicians retained the discretion\n\nto   decline   to   participate   in   Sinfonia   concerts   and    to   play\n\nelsewhere.     Id. at 491.\n\n           We think that a similar analysis is apt here.           Alberty's\n\nwork on \"Desde Mi Pueblo\" required her to film at the featured\n\nsites at the required times and to follow the instructions of the\n\ndirector.      WIPR could only achieve its goal of producing its\n\nprogram by having Alberty follow these directions.            Just as an\n\norchestra musician is subject to the control of the conductor\n\nduring concerts and rehearsals, an actor is subject to the control\n\nof the director during filming.        To hold that this sort of control\n\ndetermines Alberty's status would defy \"common sense\" as it would\n\nresult in classifying all actors as employees, regardless of the\n\nother aspects of the relationship.         Lerohl, 322 F.3d at 490; see\n\nalso Reid, 490 U.S. at 752-53 (sculptor was independent contractor\n\neven though association that hired him defined scene to be sculpted\n\nand specified most details of sculpture's appearance including its\n\nscale and materials to be used); Powell-Ross v. All Star Radio,\n\nInc., 68 Fair Empl. Prac. Cases 1148, 1153-54 (E.D. Pa. 1995)\n\n(radio disk jockey was independent contractor under Title VII even\n\nthough station required disk jockey to appear at station to perform\n\nshow at certain times).10\n\n\n      10\n      To further understand our conclusion on the control factor,\nit may be useful to distinguish the Second Circuit's decision in\nEisenberg. See 237 F.3d 111. There, the court held that control\n\n                                   -15-\n\f         Like the musicians in Lerohl, who could decline to play in\n\nfuture concerts, Alberty could decline to host future \"Desde Mi\n\nPueblo\" episodes by refusing to sign additional contracts.    It is\n\nundisputed that \"Alberty did not have any contractual obligation to\n\ncontinue working with WIPR and WIPR had no contractual obligation\n\nto continue renewing her contracts.\"     Thus, under the parties'\n\narrangement, Alberty controlled the extent to which she wished to\n\ncommit her professional time to filming \"Desde Mi Pueblo.\"      See\n\nLerohl, 322 F.3d at 492.\n\n         In addition to control over the manner, location and time\n\nof the work, Alberty emphasizes additional facts which she claims\n\nfavor employee status.     First, she argues that, as a matter of\n\n\"economic reality,\" she was an employee of WIPR because this is the\n\nentity from which she derived most of her income.   Some courts have\n\napplied an \"economic reality test\" to determine employee status\n\n\n\nwas the dispositive factor in determining that the plaintiff\nfurniture movers were employees, even though the movers did not\nreceive W-2 Forms and were ineligible for benefits. The movers in\nEisenberg were hourly, full-time warehouse workers. See id. at\n113. The Eisenberg court recognized that the movers held positions\ntypically occupied by employees but that the employer had\nmanipulated the benefits and tax treatment factors to favor\nindependent contractor status.    See id. at 119.    It refused to\nallow such manipulation to cloud the essential employee-character\nof the movers' position. See id. Here, there is no evidence of\nsimilar factor manipulation by WIPR.     Alberty was a free-lance\nprofessional who was subject to only minimal control. That most of\nthe other factors (e.g., method of payment, lack of benefits, tax\ntreatment) favor independent contractor status is consistent with\nthe limited control exercised by WIPR. See Lerohl, 322 F.3d at 492\n(distinguishing Eisenberg on similar basis).\n\n                                -16-\n\funder Title VII.   See Armbruster v. Quinn, 711 F.2d 1332, 1340 (6th\n\nCir. 1983).    Under this test, \"employees are those who as a matter\n\nof economic reality are dependent upon the business to which they\n\nrender service.\"    Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U.S. 126, 130 (1947).\n\nOther courts have applied a so-called \"hybrid test\" in which\n\nemployee status is determined by measuring the economic reality of\n\nthe relationship as well as the common law factors.      See Nowlin v.\n\nResolution Trust Corp., 33 F.3d 498, 505-06 (5th Cir. 1994).       In\n\nSpeen, we declined to apply either of these tests, instead focusing\n\nsolely on the common law test.    See 102 F.3d at 632.    Because the\n\ncommon law test does not consider \"economic reality\" to be an\n\nindicator of employee status, the fact that Alberty's income\n\nderived primarily from WIPR does not weigh heavily in favor of\n\nemployee status.\n\n         Second, Alberty contends that we should consider the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of Labor's determination that she was an\n\n\"employee\" eligible for unemployment compensation as indicating\n\nemployee status under Title VII. Determining employee status under\n\nTitle VII is a matter of federal law.      See Alberty-Vélez I, 242\n\nF.3d at 421.   As such, Alberty's status as an employee for purposes\n\nof the Puerto Rico unemployment compensation system is irrelevant\n\nto this analysis.     See Serapion, 119 F.3d at 988-89 (concluding\n\nindividual's status as employee under Puerto Rico law is irrelevant\n\nto determining whether individual is employee under Title VII).\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f             Third, Alberty contends that her sixteen-month relationship\n\nwith WIPR favors classifying her as an employee.                 Our cases do not\n\nsupport her assertion. In Dykes, the parties' six-year relationship\n\ndid not alter our conclusion that the plaintiff was an independent\n\ncontractor.      See 140 F.3d at 34-36.           And in Speen, we determined\n\nthat   the    plaintiff    was     an   independent      contractor   despite   the\n\nparties' twenty-year relationship. See 102 F.3d at 627. Given this\n\nprecedent, we do not think that a sixteen-month relationship implies\n\nemployee status.\n\n             Finally, Alberty argues that the facts that WIPR is in\n\nbusiness and that her work on \"Desde Mi Pueblo\" was part of WIPR's\n\nbusiness as a television station favor employee status.                   We agree\n\nwith Alberty.         Under the common law test, these facts support her\n\nclaim of employee status.\n\n             While no one factor is dispositive, it is clear, based on\n\nthe parties' entire relationship, that a reasonable fact finder\n\ncould only conclude that Alberty was an independent contractor. The\n\nparties structured their relationship through the use of set length\n\ncontracts      that    permitted    Alberty     the    freedom   to   pursue   other\n\nopportunities and assured WIPR that it would not have to pay Alberty\n\nfor the weeks that it was not filming.                See Worth v. Tyer, 276 F.3d\n\n249, 264 (7th Cir. 2001) (noting that \"[c]ontracts of a set length\n\noften indicate independent contractor status\").                  Further, the lack\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fof benefits, the method of payment, and the parties' own description\n\nof their relationship in tax documents all indicate independent\n\ncontractor status.    Alberty's \"per-job\" arrangement with WIPR is\n\ntypical of an independent contractor, and we cannot disregard the\n\nparties' decision to choose this form of relationship simply because\n\nit deprives Alberty of Title VII protection.             Alberty has not\n\nidentified   any   case   law    suggesting   a   different   conclusion.11\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that Alberty was an independent contractor\n\nas a matter of law and therefore cannot maintain a Title VII action\n\nagainst WIPR.12\n\n                                IV. Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n      Alberty's reliance on Diana v. Schlosser, 20 F. Supp. 2d 348,\n350-52 (D. Conn. 1998) is misplaced.      In that case, the court\npermitted an on-air traffic reporter to maintain a Title VII action\nagainst a radio broadcaster because, even though the broadcaster\ndid not employ the reporter, the broadcaster exercised significant\ncontrol over the reporter's ability to obtain other employment\nopportunities. Alberty has not demonstrated that WIPR maintained\nthis sort of control over other employment opportunities available\nto her.\n     12\n      Citing Fernández v. A.T.P.R., 104 D.P.R. 464, 465 (1975),\nAlberty acknowledges that a similar analysis determines whether she\nis an employee covered under Puerto Rico's anti-discrimination\nlaws. Because Alberty has not argued for a different conclusion\nunder Puerto Rico law, our conclusion that Alberty is an\nindependent contractor for purposes of Title VII also disposes of\nher Puerto Rico law claims.\n\n                                    -19-\n\f",

The show had\n\nthree hosts, Alberty, Luis Antonio Rivera, and Deborah Carthy Deu.\n\n            Alberty appeared on the program from July 1993 until\n\nNovember 1994.    Instead of signing a single contract to host the\n\nshow, Alberty signed a new contract for each episode.                       Each\n\ncontract obligated       Alberty    to   work   a   certain   number   of   days\n\n(usually two) filming the show in a specific town.                  Under the\n\nparties' arrangement, Alberty was not obliged to film additional\n\nepisodes beyond the one for which she contracted, and WIPR was not\n\nobliged   to   enter    into   contracts    with    Alberty   for   additional\n\nepisodes.\n\n            Filming of the show did not occur weekly, and Alberty was\n\nnot obligated to WIPR during off weeks.             On the days that Alberty\n\nfilmed the show, she was on-call for the entire day.                During her\n\n\"off\" time, in addition to preparing for future episodes of \"Desde\n\nMi Pueblo\", Alberty worked other jobs, including acting on another\n\nWIPR show entitled \"Será Acaso Este Su Caso,\" hosting a concert for\n\nthe Piano Suzuki Company, and acting as the master of ceremonies\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\ffor the graduation of the Academia Infantil Nairda Hernández.2\n\nAlberty's contracts did not permit WIPR to require her to do work\n\nother than film \"Desde Mi Pueblo.\"\n\n            While filming \"Desde Mi Pueblo,\" Alberty was directed by\n\nWilliam Denizard, the show's producer.         He set the location and\n\nhours of filming, and established the basic content of the program.\n\nWIPR provided the equipment for filming (i.e., lights, camera, and\n\nmakeup).     Alberty was responsible for providing her clothing,\n\nshoes,   accessories,   hair   stylist   and   the    other   services    and\n\nmaterials required for her appearance on the show.               She could\n\neither purchase these services and materials herself or locate\n\nsponsors to provide them for her.    WIPR had to approve any sponsors\n\nthat Alberty wished to use.\n\n            Alberty received a lump sum payment for each episode of\n\n\"Desde Mi Pueblo\" that she filmed, ranging from $400 to $550.              To\n\nreceive payment, Alberty presented a signed invoice to WIPR showing\n\nthat she had performed the agreed upon work.         WIPR did not withhold\n\nincome or social security taxes from Alberty's check and did not\n\nprovide Alberty with benefits such as health insurance, life\n\ninsurance,   retirement,   paid   sick   leave,      maternity   leave,    or\n\nvacation.    On her tax return, Alberty described her income as\n\n\n\n     2\n      Alberty had a similar lump sum payment arrangement with WIPR\nfor her work on \"Será Acaso Este Su Caso.\" When Alberty performed\non both \"Desde Mi Pueblo\" and \"Será Acaso Este Su Caso,\" she\nreceived separate checks for each performance.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fderiving from professional services rendered, and WIPR did not\n\nprovide Alberty with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-2.           After\n\nher separation, Alberty received unemployment compensation from the\n\nPuerto   Rico   Department   of   Labor   indicating   that   this   agency\n\nconsidered her WIPR's employee.\n\n           Alberty's employee status has been contested throughout\n\nthe course of this litigation.      On December 24, 1998, the district\n\ncourt granted partial summary judgment for Alberty on this issue,\n\nsee Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d), declaring her an employee of WIPR.           At\n\nthe subsequent trial, the district court reversed course and\n\ngranted WIPR's motion for judgment as a matter of law, see Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 50, because Alberty was an independent contractor.              In\n\nAlberty-Vélez I, 242 F.3d at 421-26, we vacated this judgment\n\nbecause the district court did not provide Alberty with notice of\n\nits intention to revisit the employee/independent contractor issue\n\nat trial, thereby denying Alberty a fair opportunity to contest\n\nthis issue.\n\n           On remand, the parties consented to assigning the case to\n\na magistrate judge.    After the case was reassigned, WIPR filed a\n\nmotion for summary judgment on the employee/independent contractor\n\nissue.   Alberty opposed the motion both on the merits and on the\n\nground that the issue should not be reconsidered in light of the\n\nearlier ruling declaring Alberty an employee.          The district court\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fentertained WIPR's summary judgment motion but denied it because of\n\nfactual disputes.3\n\n            Alberty and WIPR also cross-moved for summary judgment on\n\nthe discrimination issue. The district court determined that there\n\nwas no evidence of discriminatory animus by WIPR toward Alberty and\n\naccordingly entered judgment in WIPR's favor.           Alberty appealed.4\n\n                      II. Summary Judgment Standard\n\n         We review summary judgment rulings de novo.

First, a television actress is a skilled\n\nposition requiring talent and training not available on-the-job.\n\nCf. Aymes v.

In this case, the parties present\nno evidence concerning Alberty's role, if any, in hiring and paying\nassistants. Therefore, we will not consider it.\n\n                                                -10-\n\fa party is an independent contractor have held . . . architects,\n\nphotographers, . . . artists, [and] drafters . . . to be highly\n\nskilled independent contractors\") (citing cases).

Specifically, she provided, or\n\nobtained sponsors to provide, the costumes, jewelry, and other\n\nimage-related supplies and services necessary for her appearance.8\n\n            Alberty disputes that this factor favors independent\n\ncontractor status because WIPR provided the \"equipment necessary\n\nto   tape   the   show.\"   Alberty's     argument   is   misplaced.      The\n\nequipment necessary for Alberty to conduct her job as host of\n\n\"Desde Mi Pueblo\" related to her appearance on the show.              Others\n\nprovided equipment for filming and producing the show, but these\n\n\n\n      8\n      That WIPR reserved the right to approve Alberty's sponsors\ndoes not alter this conclusion.

See Dykes, 140 F.3d at 38; Speen, 102 F.3d 633.\n\n           Despite these factors favoring independent contractor\n\nstatus, Alberty argues that she was WIPR's employee because WIPR\n\ncontrolled the manner of her work by directing her during filming,\n\ndictated the location of her work by selecting the filming sites,\n\nand determined the hours of her work by requiring her to be on-call\n\n\n\n     9\n     Alberty disputes this factor by arguing that, on one occasion,\nWIPR paid her, even though she could not complete an episode\nbecause of a death in her family. While Alberty tries to paint this\nas a general benefit, she identifies no evidence suggesting that\nthis was anything but a single occurrence.      Further, her other\ntestimony contradicts her assertion that there was a policy to pay\nher when she could not film. As she stated several times, if she\ndid not film an episode she did not get paid.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fduring filming days.

Considering\n\nthe tasks that an actor performs, we do not believe that the sort\n\nof control identified by Alberty necessarily indicates employee\n\nstatus.\n\n          A recent Eighth Circuit case illustrates the point.                     See\n\nLerohl    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781191\"><a href=\"/opinion/781191/tricia-lerohl-shelley-hanson-plaintiffsappellants-v-friends-of-minnesota/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>    <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.        In   Lerohl,    the    court    considered    the\n\nemployment status of two \"regular\" musicians in the Minnesota\n\nSinfonia.       Id. at 489.           The musicians argued that they were\n\nemployees because the conductor selected the music, scheduled the\n\nrehearsals and concerts, and determined the manner in which the\n\nmusic would be played.              Id. at 490.      The court \"emphatically\"\n\nrejected the argument that the \"control\" exercised by the conductor\n\nnecessarily demonstrated the musicians' employee status because\n\n\"work by independent contractors is often performed to the exacting\n\nspecifications of the hiring party.\"               Id.    Musicians participating\n\nin an orchestra are, by necessity, subject to the control and\n\nscheduling      of   the   conductor      because    such    control     allows   the\n\nsymphony to perform as a single unit.              See id.    The court concluded\n\nthat, in these circumstances, the relevant control issue was not\n\nwhether the conductor could instruct the musicians \"where to sit\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fand when to play\" but whether the musicians retained the discretion\n\nto   decline   to   participate   in   Sinfonia   concerts   and    to   play\n\nelsewhere.     Id. at 491.\n\n           We think that a similar analysis is apt here.           Alberty's\n\nwork on \"Desde Mi Pueblo\" required her to film at the featured\n\nsites at the required times and to follow the instructions of the\n\ndirector.      WIPR could only achieve its goal of producing its\n\nprogram by having Alberty follow these directions.            Just as an\n\norchestra musician is subject to the control of the conductor\n\nduring concerts and rehearsals, an actor is subject to the control\n\nof the director during filming.        To hold that this sort of control\n\ndetermines Alberty's status would defy \"common sense\" as it would\n\nresult in classifying all actors as employees, regardless of the\n\nother aspects of the relationship.         Lerohl, 322 F.3d at 490; see\n\nalso Reid, 490 U.S. at 752-53 (sculptor was independent contractor\n\neven though association that hired him defined scene to be sculpted\n\nand specified most details of sculpture's appearance including its\n\nscale and materials to be used); Powell-Ross v. All Star Radio,\n\nInc., 68 Fair Empl. Prac. Cases 1148, 1153-54 (E.D. Pa. 1995)\n\n(radio disk jockey was independent contractor under Title VII even\n\nthough station required disk jockey to appear at station to perform\n\nshow at certain times).10\n\n\n      10\n      To further understand our conclusion on the control factor,\nit may be useful to distinguish the Second Circuit's decision in\nEisenberg. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771703\"><a href=\"/opinion/771703/julianne-eisenberg-v-advance-relocation-storage-inc-advance/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. There, the court held that control\n\n                                   -15-\n\f         Like the musicians in Lerohl, who could decline to play in\n\nfuture concerts, Alberty could decline to host future \"Desde Mi\n\nPueblo\" episodes by refusing to sign additional contracts.    It is\n\nundisputed that \"Alberty did not have any contractual obligation to\n\ncontinue working with WIPR and WIPR had no contractual obligation\n\nto continue renewing her contracts.\"     Thus, under the parties'\n\narrangement, Alberty controlled the extent to which she wished to\n\ncommit her professional time to filming \"Desde Mi Pueblo.\"      See\n\nLerohl, 322 F.3d at 492.\n\n         In addition to control over the manner, location and time\n\nof the work, Alberty emphasizes additional facts which she claims\n\nfavor employee status.     First, she argues that, as a matter of\n\n\"economic reality,\" she was an employee of WIPR because this is the\n\nentity from which she derived most of her income.   Some courts have\n\napplied an \"economic reality test\" to determine employee status\n\n\n\nwas the dispositive factor in determining that the plaintiff\nfurniture movers were employees, even though the movers did not\nreceive W-2 Forms and were ineligible for benefits. The movers in\nEisenberg were hourly, full-time warehouse workers. See id. at\n113. The Eisenberg court recognized that the movers held positions\ntypically occupied by employees but that the employer had\nmanipulated the benefits and tax treatment factors to favor\nindependent contractor status.    See id. at 119.    It refused to\nallow such manipulation to cloud the essential employee-character\nof the movers' position. See id. Here, there is no evidence of\nsimilar factor manipulation by WIPR.     Alberty was a free-lance\nprofessional who was subject to only minimal control. That most of\nthe other factors (e.g., method of payment, lack of benefits, tax\ntreatment) favor independent contractor status is consistent with\nthe limited control exercised by WIPR. See Lerohl, 322 F.3d at 492\n(distinguishing Eisenberg on similar basis).\n\n                                -16-\n\funder Title VII.   See Armbruster v. Quinn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421672\"><a href=\"/opinion/421672/lynn-armbruster-v-terry-quinn/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1332</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1340 (6th\n\nCir. 1983).    Under this test, \"employees are those who as a matter\n\nof economic reality are dependent upon the business to which they\n\nrender service.\"    Bartels v. Birmingham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104456\"><a href=\"/opinion/104456/bartels-v-birmingham/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130 (1947).\n\nOther courts have applied a so-called \"hybrid test\" in which\n\nemployee status is determined by measuring the economic reality of\n\nthe relationship as well as the common law factors.      See Nowlin v.\n\nResolution Trust Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677032\"><a href=\"/opinion/677032/65-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1870-65-empl-prac-dec-p-43413-jolene/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505-06 (5th Cir. 1994).       In\n\nSpeen, we declined to apply either of these tests, instead focusing\n\nsolely on the common law test.    See 102 F.3d at 632.    Because the\n\ncommon law test does not consider \"economic reality\" to be an\n\nindicator of employee status, the fact that Alberty's income\n\nderived primarily from WIPR does not weigh heavily in favor of\n\nemployee status.\n\n         Second, Alberty contends that we should consider the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of Labor's determination that she was an\n\n\"employee\" eligible for unemployment compensation as indicating\n\nemployee status under Title VII. Determining employee status under\n\nTitle VII is a matter of federal law.      See Alberty-Vélez I, 242\n\nF.3d at 421.   As such, Alberty's status as an employee for purposes\n\nof the Puerto Rico unemployment compensation system is irrelevant\n\nto this analysis.     See Serapion, 119 F.3d at 988-89 (concluding\n\nindividual's status as employee under Puerto Rico law is irrelevant\n\nto determining whether individual is employee under Title VII).\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f             Third, Alberty contends that her sixteen-month relationship\n\nwith WIPR favors classifying her as an employee.                 Our cases do not\n\nsupport her assertion. In Dykes, the parties' six-year relationship\n\ndid not alter our conclusion that the plaintiff was an independent\n\ncontractor.      See 140 F.3d at 34-36.           And in Speen, we determined\n\nthat   the    plaintiff    was     an   independent      contractor   despite   the\n\nparties' twenty-year relationship. See 102 F.3d at 627. Given this\n\nprecedent, we do not think that a sixteen-month relationship implies\n\nemployee status.\n\n             Finally, Alberty argues that the facts that WIPR is in\n\nbusiness and that her work on \"Desde Mi Pueblo\" was part of WIPR's\n\nbusiness as a television station favor employee status.                   We agree\n\nwith Alberty.         Under the common law test, these facts support her\n\nclaim of employee status.\n\n             While no one factor is dispositive, it is clear, based on\n\nthe parties' entire relationship, that a reasonable fact finder\n\ncould only conclude that Alberty was an independent contractor. The\n\nparties structured their relationship through the use of set length\n\ncontracts      that    permitted    Alberty     the    freedom   to   pursue   other\n\nopportunities and assured WIPR that it would not have to pay Alberty\n\nfor the weeks that it was not filming.                See Worth v. Tyer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">249</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264 (7th Cir. 2001) (noting that \"[c]ontracts of a set length\n\noften indicate independent contractor status\").                  Further, the lack\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fof benefits, the method of payment, and the parties' own description\n\nof their relationship in tax documents all indicate independent\n\ncontractor status.    Alberty's \"per-job\" arrangement with WIPR is\n\ntypical of an independent contractor, and we cannot disregard the\n\nparties' decision to choose this form of relationship simply because\n\nit deprives Alberty of Title VII protection.             Alberty has not\n\nidentified   any   case   law    suggesting   a   different   conclusion.11\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that Alberty was an independent contractor\n\nas a matter of law and therefore cannot maintain a Title VII action\n\nagainst WIPR.12\n\n                                IV. Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n      Alberty's reliance on Diana v. Schlosser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2423514\"><a href=\"/opinion/2423514/diana-v-schlosser/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n350-52 (D. Conn. 1998) is misplaced.      In that case, the court\npermitted an on-air traffic reporter to maintain a Title VII action\nagainst a radio broadcaster because, even though the broadcaster\ndid not employ the reporter, the broadcaster exercised significant\ncontrol over the reporter's ability to obtain other employment\nopportunities. Alberty has not demonstrated that WIPR maintained\nthis sort of control over other employment opportunities available\nto her.\n     12\n      Citing Fernández v. A.T.P.R., 104 D.P.R. 464, 465 (1975),\nAlberty acknowledges that a similar analysis determines whether she\nis an employee covered under Puerto Rico's anti-discrimination\nlaws. Because Alberty has not argued for a different conclusion\nunder Puerto Rico law, our conclusion that Alberty is an\nindependent contractor for purposes of Title VII also disposes of\nher Puerto Rico law claims.\n\n                                    -19-\n\f</pre>",
