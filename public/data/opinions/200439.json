Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n                    Lynch, Circuit Judge, and\n          Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n          Manuel R. Suarez Jiménez for appellant.\n          Robert P. Mallory, with whom Jennifer J. Waldner,\nMcDermott, Will & Emery, Néstor M. Méndez Gómez, Oreste R. Ramos,\nand Pietrantoni Méndez & Alvarez LLP were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 6, 2003\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           This case raises the issue of\n\nwhether   the   defendant   public    corporation      is       an   arm   of   the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico and so entitled to assert immunity\n\nunder the Eleventh Amendment.             It causes us to reshape this\n\ncircuit's arm-of-the-state test in light of intervening Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.\n\n           Our analysis under the reshaped test leads us to affirm\n\nthe district court's conclusion that the defendant, Puerto Rico and\n\nthe Carribean Cardiovascular Center Corp. (PRCCCC), is not an arm\n\nof the Commonwealth and so is not entitled to immunity.                    We also\n\nuphold the district court's finding that PRCCCC was adequately\n\nserved with process.    The underlying lawsuit involves a claim by\n\nFresenius Medical Care Cardiovascular Resources, Inc. (FMC) against\n\nPRCCCC for breach of contract, the details of which are not germane\n\nto the issues on appeal.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           On   September   28,   2001,      FMC   filed    a    federal     court\n\ncomplaint against PRCCCC, asserting diversity jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1332(a)(1), (d) (2000).            It sought over $7,000,000 in\n\ndamages for breach of contract and of the implied covenant of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing. It also sought an order requiring specific\n\nperformance of the contract by PRCCCC and a declaratory judgment\n\nthat FMC was not in material breach of the agreement.\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            PRCCCC moved to dismiss the complaint on November 13,\n\n2001.    It moved to dismiss on the grounds that PRCCCC is an arm of\n\nthe state entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity; that PRCCCC is\n\nnot a citizen of Puerto Rico for diversity purposes since it is an\n\narm of the state; that FMC lacked standing; and that there was\n\ndefective service of process.           PRCCCC attached to its motion an\n\nunauthenticated chart listing the hospital's total revenues and\n\nlegislative appropriations as well as a statement under penalty of\n\nperjury by José Soler Zapata, Acting Medical Director of PRCCCC and\n\nformer Secretary of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nFMC, in its opposition, submitted a statement under penalty of\n\nperjury by Bill Watson, its executive responsible for dealing with\n\nPRCCCC,    and   objected   to   the   Zapata   statement   on    evidentiary\n\ngrounds.    After receiving two extensions, PRCCCC eventually filed\n\nan untimely reply.\n\n            The district court denied PRCCCC's motion in an opinion\n\nand order dated March 18, 2002. The court applied the multi-factor\n\narm-of-the-state test set forth in Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto\n\nRico Aqueduct & Sewer Authority, 991 F.2d 935, 939-40 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).     Noting that the most important factor is the entity's\n\nrelationship to the public fisc, the district court held that this\n\nfactor     weighed   against     a   finding    of   immunity    because   the\n\nCommonwealth would not be obligated to pay a judgment against\n\nPRCCCC and because PRCCCC receives a relatively small share of its\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ffunds from the Commonwealth. It also rejected PRCCCC's argument of\n\ninadequate service of process.\n\n          PRCCCC filed two motions for reconsideration of the\n\ndistrict court's March 18 decision.     PRCCCC produced new evidence\n\nin support of its second motion for reconsideration: statements by\n\nLuisa Rivera Lúgaro, the former Executive Director of PRCCCC, and\n\nMiguel Bustelo, the Chief Financial Officer of PRCCCC.     Bustelo's\n\naffidavit attached a new income statement identifying sources of\n\ngovernment     funding   apart   from   legislative   appropriations.\n\nPlaintiff again objected to consideration of the evidence.        The\n\ndistrict court, without providing plaintiff the opportunity to\n\nproduce more evidence, considered this late-filed information but\n\ndenied the motion in a six page opinion and order dated May 7,\n\n2002.1\n\n             On May 21, 2002, PRCCCC filed an interlocutory appeal.\n\nSee P.R. Acqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S.\n\n139, 147 (1993) (entities claiming to be arms of the state may\n\nimmediately appeal a district court order denying a claim of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity under the collateral order doctrine).\n\nIt also filed a motion in the district court to stay proceedings\n\nwhile its appeal was pending.     The district court denied the stay\n\n\n     1\n       In its opinion and order denying the second motion for\nreconsideration, the district court also correctly found that FMC\ndid not, as defendant charges, provide misleading adjusted budget\npercentages about PRCCCC's operations.\n\n                                  -4-\n\frequest on June 4, 2002 and denied a motion for reconsideration of\n\nthat order on July 1, 2002.2\n\n            PRCCCC finally sought a stay from this court on October\n\n15, 2002, more than four months after the district court denied its\n\nstay request.   On November 6, 2002, this court denied the request.3\n\n     2\n       At the same time, PRCCCC failed to meet its obligations to\nmove forward either its appeal or the trial court proceedings. In\nits appeal of the district court's March 18 and May 7 rulings,\nPRCCCC missed the deadlines to file counsel's appearance form, its\ndocketing statement, and its brief, after those deadlines were\nextended. In the district court, it disregarded a September 23,\n2002 court order requiring PRCCCC to comply with discovery requests\nthat had been pending for over six months.\n     In its appeal of the district court's Eleventh Amendment\nfinding, PRCCCC again failed to meet its obligations when it\nsubmitted its reply brief to this court. The reply brief was late\nand longer than our rules permit. In addition, the reply brief\nrepeatedly made new and unsupported factual allegations. See Fed.\nR. App. P. 28(a)(7). Plaintiff opposed the filing of the reply\nbrief on the grounds that it was untimely, oversized, and made\nirrelevant factual accusations. We strike the statement of facts\nand new factual references in the reply brief but have considered\nthe legal arguments made.\n     3\n         This court's order denying the stay said:\n\n         A request for a stay essentially invokes the equitable\n   powers of this court.       Here, the conduct of [PRCCCC]\n   evidences a pattern of causing delay in this litigation, both\n   in this court and the district court, including missing\n   filing deadlines after those deadlines were extended.\n   Accordingly, we think the Hospital is in a poor position to\n   claim that it will suffer injury if the stay is not granted.\n   We therefore deny the motion for a stay.\n        We will, however, expedite this appeal. . . . Should\n   the trial date in the district court arrive before this court\n   has decided the appeal, then the Hospital may reapply for a\n   stay.\n\n     A month later, PRCCCC filed an \"urgent motion for\nreconsideration\" of this court's denial of the stay request,\nclaiming that the trial date had in fact arrived before this court\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                                     II.\n\nA.    Standards for Arm-of-the-State Analysis\n\n           We review de novo the conclusion that PRCCCC is not\n\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity.              Arecibo Cmty. Health\n\nCare, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 270 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           The   question    of   whether    PRCCCC    is   an   arm   of   the\n\nCommonwealth and entitled to share its Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nis a question of federal law.       Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Doe,\n\n519 U.S. 425, 429 n.5 (1997).        The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is\n\ntreated as a state for Eleventh Amendment purposes.               P.R. Ports\n\nAuth. v. M/V Manhattan Prince, 897 F.2d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1990).               Here\n\nthe Commonwealth itself is not a party nor has it sought to express\n\nits views in this litigation as a party or amicus; PRCCCC is the\n\nparty and is attempting to cloak itself in the Commonwealth's\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity under the theory that it is an arm of\n\nthe   state.     PRCCCC,    the   entity   asserting   Eleventh    Amendment\n\nimmunity, bears the burden of showing it is an arm of the state.\n\n\n\n\nhad decided the appeal.       PRCCCC's claim was false.      PRCCCC\nsuggested that the parties would engage in arbitration at the\ndistrict court's behest, before the appeal was decided, and that\nthis was the equivalent of a trial date. In fact, no steps had\nbeen taken by either side to initiate arbitration. No date for\narbitration had been set, and an arbitrator had not been contacted.\nBecause nothing had changed since the issuance of the November 6\norder, this court denied the motion for reconsideration on December\n19, 2002.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fWojcik v. Mass. State Lottery Comm'n, 300 F.3d 92, 99 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n             The arm-of-the-state doctrine arises in connection with\n\nat least three types of entities.4               The first is a political\n\nsubdivision of the state, such as a city or county.                    Political\n\nsubdivisions are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. See,\n\ne.g., Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356,\n\n369 (2001) (citing Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529, 530-31\n\n(1890)); see also Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693, 717-721\n\n(1973) (political subdivision not arm of the state for diversity\n\njurisdiction purposes).           The second entity is established by two\n\n(or more) states by compact and approved by Congress.              The third,\n\nthe   type    at    issue    here,    involves   a    special-purpose    public\n\ncorporation established at the behest of a state.                 Multi-state\n\ncompact      entities       and    special-purpose      public   corporations\n\nestablished    by    a   state    sometimes   share    the   state's    Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity.         The arm of the state analytical doctrine has\n\nmoved     freely   amongst    these   three   categories,     applying   common\n\nprinciples.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       PRCCCC does not argue that it is simply acting as an\nagent of the state, such as a private corporation acting under\ncontract as a fiscal intermediary for a health insurance\nprogram for state employees.     See Shards Teaching Hosp. &\nClinics, Inc. v. Beech St. Corp., 208 F.3d 1308 (11th Cir.\n2000). Nor would the record support any such argument.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f          The Supreme Court's modern arm-of-the-state jurisprudence\n\nstarts with Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v.\n\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), which rejected the school board's claim\n\nthat it was an arm of the state and not a political subdivision.\n\nIn Mt. Healthy, the Supreme Court looked in part to state law to\n\nconsider the \"nature of the entity created by law.\"    Id. at 280.\n\nIt concluded that state law rendered the board more like a county\n\nor city, and thus not an arm of the state.   The court considered a\n\nbalance of factors: The board obtained guidance and extensive\n\nmonies from the state, but that was offset by the board's revenue-\n\nraising power, including its power to issue bonds and levy taxes.\n\nId.   It was unclear whether \"the Court was using state law as an\n\nindication of the state's intention with respect to school bonds or\n\nas a structural feature that the Court would look to regardless of\n\nthe state's intention.\" Morris v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n\n781 F.2d 218, 223 (D.C. Cir. 1986).      This court, as discussed\n\nbelow, has chosen to ask the question in terms of how the state\n\nstructured its relationship to the entity.\n\n          The Mt. Healthy decision was followed by Lake Country\n\nEstates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391\n\n(1979), which, by contrast, involved a bi-state agency, and thus\n\nraised different concerns, including the interests of the federal\n\ngovernment under the Compact Clause.   There the court held:\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f          [S]ome agencies exercising state power have been\n          permitted to invoke the Amendment in order to protect the\n          state treasury from liability that would have had\n          essentially the same practical consequences as a judgment\n          against the State itself.\n\nId. at 400-01.    Lake Country also considered several facts as\n\npertinent to the analysis.5\n\n          That was the state of the doctrine in 1993, when this\n\ncourt decided Metcalf & Eddy, 991 F.2d at 939-40.     For the past\n\ndecade the courts of this circuit, under Metcalf & Eddy, have\n\nassessed an entity's arm-of-the-state status by focusing on whether\n\n\n     5\n       The Court in Lake Country identified the following facts as\ngermane to the arm-of-the-state status of the Tahoe Regional\nPlanning Agency (TRPA):\n          1. the designation in the interstate compact of the TRPA\n          as a \"separate legal entity\" and a \"political\n          subdivision\";\n          2. the power that resided in counties to appoint six of\n          the ten governing members of the TRPA whereas the states\n          appointed only four members;\n          3. the funding of the TRPA exclusively by the counties;\n          4. the express pronouncement in the compact that\n          obligations of the TRPA were not binding on either state;\n          5. the function of the TRPA, which was to regulate land\n          use; and\n          6. the failure of the states to preserve veto power over\n          rules promulgated by the TRPA.\nSee 440 U.S. at 401-02. Thus, the analysis considered (a) how the\nentity is characterized under state law; (b) the level of control\nexercised by the state; (c) the entity's relationship to the public\ntreasury (both the relative size of its government appropriation\nand whether the government is legally liable for the entity's\ndebts); and (d) whether the entity performs a state function. See\ngenerally A.E. Rogers, Note, Clothing State Governmental\nEntities With Sovereign Immunity:       Disarray in the Eleventh\nAmendment Arm-of-the-State Doctrine, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 1243\n(1992) (criticizing the Court's continuing use of a multi-\nfactor approach).\n\n                               -9-\n\fthe structure established by the state reveals that the agency is\n\nan arm of the state; if the structure does not resolve the\n\nquestion, then the primary focus is on whether the action is in\n\nessence one for recovery from the state.           Because answers are not\n\nalways clear, we have encouraged the use of a non-exclusive list of\n\nfactors, and identified at least seven areas of inquiry.6              These\n\nmulti-factor tests, as we noted in Neo Gen Screening, Inc. v. New\n\nEngland Newborn Screening Program, 187 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\n\"are not easy to apply.\"              Still, Metcalf & Eddy presciently\n\npredicted the ways in which the Supreme Court would view the issue.\n\n                 In the intervening decade since Metcalf & Eddy there have\n\nbeen       two   Supreme   Court   decisions   addressing   arm-of-the-state\n\nissues: Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp., 513 U.S. 30, 33\n\n(1994), involving a bi-state entity, which updated and clarified\n\n       6\n       \"These areas, each of which can be mined for information\nthat might clarify the institution's structure and function,\ninclude:\n          (1) whether the agency has the funding power to enable it\n          to satisfy judgments without direct state participation\n          or guarantees;\n          (2) whether the agency's function is governmental or\n          proprietary;\n          (3) whether the agency is separately incorporated;\n          (4) whether the state exerts control over the agency, and\n          if so, to what extent;\n          (5) whether the agency has the power to sue, be sued, and\n          enter contracts in its own name and right;\n          (6) whether the agency's property is subject to state\n          taxation; and\n          (7) whether the state has immunized itself from\n          responsibility for the agency's acts or omissions.\"\n\nId. at 939-940.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fthe arm-of-the-state doctrine; and Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452,\n\n456 n.1 (1997), which briefly applied Hess to an intra-state\n\nentity.   Additionally, in that time, a number of important Supreme\n\nCourt decisions have reshaped Eleventh Amendment doctrine.                      The\n\nquestion is raised then as to whether those opinions cause us to\n\nreshape the Metcalf & Eddy test.\n\n            We start with the larger Eleventh Amendment doctrine.\n\nSeveral points, at least, are informative to our analysis.                      The\n\nfirst is that the Supreme Court has said that it is not just the\n\nstate's interest in its public treasury which is at stake in the\n\nassertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity.               The state also has a\n\n\"dignity\" interest as a sovereign in not being haled into federal\n\ncourt.    Fed. Mar. Comm'n v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 535 U.S. 743,\n\n122 S. Ct. 1864, 1874-75 (2002).            These twin goals of the Eleventh\n\nAmendment    --    protection    of   the    state's    treasury     and   of   its\n\ndignitary interests        --   explicitly     govern   the   arm-of-the-state\n\nanalysis.    Hess, 513 U.S. at 39-41.\n\n            The changes in Eleventh Amendment doctrine have created\n\ndifferent consequences for a finding that an entity partakes of\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity as an arm of the state.                The Eleventh\n\nAmendment has always acted to restrict the jurisdiction of the\n\nfederal courts to entertain claims against the state when the\n\nunderlying        source   of    federal      jurisdiction      is     diversity\n\njurisdiction.       See Univ. of R.I. v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 2 F.3d\n\n                                      -11-\n\f1200, 1202-03 (1st Cir. 1993).          The Amendment also restricts the\n\njurisdiction of the federal courts to hear private claims based on\n\nfederal causes of action created by the Congress, see Edelman v.\n\nJordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662-64 (1974), subject to the Ex Parte Young\n\nexception for injunctions against state officers, Ex Parte Young,\n\n209 U.S. 123, 159 (1908). Importantly, the Court has recently held\n\nthat the Amendment's inherent notions of state sovereign immunity\n\nimpose restrictions on the power of Congress, acting under certain\n\nArticle I powers, to create privately enforced federal causes of\n\naction against the states.      Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44\n\n(1996).    Where the Eleventh Amendment bars jurisdiction over a\n\nclaim in   federal   court,     the   states    may   decline    on       sovereign\n\nimmunity grounds to entertain such an action.              Alden v. Maine, 527\n\nU.S. 706, 731-32 (1999).\n\n           While this case is a diversity action for breach of\n\ncontract, the criteria for rules about what is an arm of the\n\nstate have not varied with whether the basis for federal\n\njurisdiction is diversity or federal question.                  Accordingly,\n\nany arm-of-the-state conclusion here has implications for the\n\nenforceability of federal laws enacted under Article I in\n\nsuits by private persons against PRCCCC.\n\n           Thus,   where   an    entity      claims   to    share     a    state's\n\nsovereignty and the state has not clearly demarcated the entity as\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fsharing its sovereignty, there is great reason for caution.            It\n\nwould be every bit as much an affront to the state's dignity and\n\nfiscal interests were a federal court to find erroneously that an\n\nentity was an arm of the state, when the state did not structure\n\nthe entity to share its sovereignty.         The consequences of an arm-\n\nof-the-state finding are considerable.        For example, where a state\n\nconsents to suit in its own courts, such an arm-of-the-state\n\nfinding may pose a threat to the state treasury, even if the state\n\nhas not structured the entity so as to put its treasury at risk.\n\nIn an era when many states face budget crises and impose cutbacks\n\non recognized state agencies, yet another claimant on the treasury\n\nmay not be welcomed.\n\n             Not all entities created by states are meant to share\n\nstate sovereignty.       Some entities may be part of an effort at\n\nprivatization, representing an assessment by the state that the\n\nprivate sector may perform a function better than the state.           Cf.\n\nRichardson v. McKnight, 521 U.S. 399, 405-07 (1997) (discussing\n\nadvantages    of    private   sector   entities   performing   government\n\nfunctions     and     role    of   private    contractors      in   prison\n\nadministration).       Some entities may be meant to be commercial\n\nenterprises, viable and competitive in the marketplace in which\n\nthey operate.       Such enterprises may need incentives to encourage\n\nothers to contract with them, such as the incentives of application\n\nof usual legal standards between private contracting parties.          The\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fdollar cap on recovery found in many state sovereign immunity\n\nstatutes would be a powerful disincentive to a private party to\n\ncontract with an entity, unless the private party first obtained a\n\nwaiver of immunity from the entity.                     See generally Defendini\n\nCollazo v. Commonwealth of P.R., 134 D.P.R. 28 (1993), available at\n\n1993 WL 839857 (discussing limited waivers of sovereign immunity\n\nunder Puerto Rico law).            In Puerto Rico, a breach of contract\n\naction against the Commonwealth is capped at $75,000. 32 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. § 3077(c) (2001).\n\n              A conclusion that the entity is beyond the control of\n\nprivately enforced Article I legislation enacted by the Congress\n\nmay also be undesirable to a state.            A state may not have intended,\n\nfor   example,    that    the   employees      of   the      entity    be   unable   to\n\nprivately enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-\n\n219 (2000), see Alden, 527 U.S. at 712 (dismissing FLSA lawsuit by\n\nstate employees on grounds that Congress, acting pursuant to its\n\nArticle I powers, could not abrogate the sovereign immunity of\n\nstates   in    state     court);   or   Title       I   of    the     Americans   with\n\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111-12117 (2000), see Garrett, 531\n\nU.S. at 360 (holding that suits by state employees to recover money\n\ndamages for a state's failure to comply with the provisions of\n\nTitle I of the ADA are barred by the Eleventh Amendment); or the\n\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634, see\n\nKimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 82-83 (2000) (holding\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fthat ADEA's purported abrogation of the states' sovereign immunity\n\nis invalid because ADEA is not \"appropriate legislation\" under\n\nsection five of the Fourteenth Amendment); or provisions of the\n\nFamily and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2654, see Laro v.\n\nNew Hampshire, 259 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2001) (invalidating on\n\nEleventh Amendment grounds a private cause of action for money\n\ndamages   against   the    state   under   the   personal   medical   leave\n\nprovision of the FMLA).      A state could adjudge that those effects\n\nmay be unwanted disincentives to people who might otherwise seek\n\nemployment with the entity, or that it is unwise to differentiate\n\nthe entity's employees from those in the private sector.           In sum,\n\nstates set up entities for many reasons.         An erroneous arm-of-the-\n\nstate decision may frustrate, not advance, a state's dignity and\n\nits interests.\n\n           Against that context of the serious consequences on both\n\nsides of this issue, it is the developments in the arm-of-the-state\n\ncase law from the Supreme Court which bind us here.               The most\n\nrecent full discussion of the doctrine is in Hess.          Hess, like Lake\n\nCountry before it, involves an entity created by two states under\n\nthe Compact Clause of the Constitution. A closely divided court in\n\nHess held that the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation was not\n\nan arm of the state.      As noted above, the Hess analysis explicitly\n\nrecognizes the Eleventh Amendment's twin interests: protection of\n\nthe fisc and the dignity of the states.          513 U.S. at 39-40, 47.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f                  As to bi-state Compact Clause entities, the Hess court\n\ncontinued the general approach taken in Lake Country:\n\n                  We would presume the Compact Clause agency does not\n                  qualify for Eleventh Amendment immunity \"unless there is\n                  good reason to believe that the States structured the new\n                  agency to enable it to enjoy the special constitutional\n                  protection of the states themselves and that Congress\n                  concurred in that purpose.\"\n\nId. at 43-44 (quoting Lake Country, 440 U.S. at 401).                     Putting\n\naside       the    question    of    presumption,   Hess   requires   a   two-step\n\nanalysis.          Accord Harter v. Vernon, 101 F.3d 334, 337 (4th Cir.\n\n1996).       The first step of the analysis concerns how the state has\n\nstructured the entity.              This step, we think, pays deference to the\n\nstate's dignitary interest in extending or withholding Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity from an entity.               After all, a state may easily\n\nmake clear by statute its view that an entity is to share the\n\nstate's immunity.          Where the state has not made a clear statement,\n\nits dignity interests are nonetheless protected by an examination\n\nof the structure the state has chosen to establish.               In evaluating\n\nwhether the state had structured an agency to be an arm of the\n\nstate, Hess looked at \"various indicators of immunity or the\n\nabsence thereof.\"7            513 U.S. at 44.\n\n\n        7\n       Among the indicators Hess considered were:\n     1. extent of state control including through the appointment\nof board members and the state's power to veto board actions or\nenlarge the entity's responsibilities;\n     2. how the enabling and implementing legislation characterized\nthe entity and how the state courts have viewed the entity;\n     3. whether the entity's functions are readily classifiable as\nstate functions or local or non-governmental functions; and\n\n                                          -16-\n\f          If   the   structural    indicators   point    in   different\n\ndirections, then the second stage of analysis comes into play.       At\n\nthis stage, the vulnerability of the state's purse is the most\n\nsalient factor in the Eleventh Amendment determination.8       Where it\n\nis clear that the state treasury is not at risk, then the control\n\nexercised by the state over the entity does not entitle the entity\n\nto Eleventh Amendment immunity.     See id. at 47-49.9\n\n\n\n     4. whether the state bore legal liability for the entity's\ndebts. See 513 U.S. at 44-46.\n     8\n       This Hess vulnerability inquiry includes examination of\nthese, among other, factors: whether the state laws impose an\nobligation on the state to be responsible for payment of judgments\nagainst the entity (on this point federal courts are not free to\nassume that a state will voluntarily assume the payment of the\nentity's debts if the entity is in need); other sources of revenue\nfor the entity; and whether the agency is so structured that, as a\npractical matter, the state anticipated budget shortfalls that\nwould render the entity constantly dependent on the state. Id. at\n49-50.\n     9\n        Although the dissent in Hess would reach a different\nconclusion on the facts there, it agrees that the key initial\nquestion is whether \"the State has structured the entity in the\nexpectation that immunity will inhere.\" Id. at 58 (O'Connor, J.,\ndissenting).    The dissent also agrees that if the entity's\nliabilities are funded by the taxpayers' dollars, then there is\nEleventh Amendment immunity. Id. at 60-61. The Hess dissent did\nnot agree that the converse was true: that if the state treasury\nwas not directly implicated, then there would be no immunity. The\ndissent would then ask whether the state \"possesses sufficient\ncontrol over an entity performing governmental functions that the\nentity may properly be called an extension of the State itself.\"\nId. at 61. If \"the lines of oversight are clear and substantial --\nfor example, if the state appoints and removes an entity's\ngoverning personnel and retains veto or approval power over an\nentity's undertakings\" -- then, on the dissent's reasoning, the\nentity should be deemed an arm of the state for Eleventh Amendment\npurposes. Id.\n\n                                  -17-\n\f           In the aftermath of Hess, the circuits almost uniformly\n\nfind that, when there is an ambiguity about the direction in which\n\nthe structural analysis points, the potential payment from the\n\nstate treasury is the most critical factor in determining whether\n\nan entity is operating as an arm of the state.   See 17A J.W. Moore\n\net al., Moore's Federal Practice § 123.23(4)(b), at 123-60 & n.51\n\n(3d ed. 2000) [hereinafter Moore's] (collecting cases).\n\n           The question for the lower federal courts becomes what\n\nparts of Hess govern the analysis of an intra-state entity such as\n\nPRCCCC.   Compact Clause entities by their nature involve different\n\nfederalism concerns than intra-state entities.   Several objections\n\nmight be made to applying Hess here.   The presumption announced in\n\nHess may be limited to multi-state entities.      It might also be\n\nthought that the two-step Hess analysis applies only to multi-state\n\nCompact Clause entities, and so not to a public corporation formed\n\nby the Commonwealth alone. Or it might be thought, more generally,\n\nthat Hess is inconsistent with later Eleventh Amendment case law,\n\nand so should not be taken as establishing doctrine controlling\n\nnow.\n\n           Hess itself noted there was reason to treat Compact\n\nClause entities somewhat differently.    513 U.S. at 42 (\"There is\n\ngood reason not to amalgamate Compact Clause entities with agencies\n\nof one of the United States for Eleventh Amendment purposes.\")\n\n(internal quotation omitted); accord Hadley v. N. Ark. Cmty.\n\n                                -18-\n\fTechnical Coll., 76 F.3d 1437, 1439 (8th Cir. 1996) (interpreting\n\nHess).      \"As    part    of    the   federal   plan     prescribed   by   the\n\nConstitution, the States agreed to the power sharing, coordination,\n\nand unified action that typify Compact Clause creations. . . .\n\n[T]he    federal   tribunal      cannot   be   regarded   as   alien   in   this\n\ncooperative, tri-governmental arrangement.\"             Hess, 513 U.S. at 41-\n\n42.     Here, by contrast, the federal government is not a party to\n\nthe arrangement.     As a result, we think the presumption announced\n\nin Hess -- a presumption against an entity being an arm of the\n\nstate -- applies only to Compact Clause entities, and the logic of\n\nit does not extend to the two other categories of cases.\n\n            We conclude, however, that the two-step analysis of Hess\n\nis not limited to Compact Clause entities. Several reasons support\n\nthis conclusion.          First, Hess is founded on the twin reasons\n\nunderlying the Eleventh Amendment, reasons common to all categories\n\nof cases.    Further, the Hess court cited Metcalf & Eddy, which did\n\nnot involve a multi-state Compact Clause entity, among cases\n\nsupporting the point that \"the vulnerability of the State's purse\n\n[is] the most salient factor in Eleventh Amendment determinations.\"\n\nHess, 513 U.S. at 48.            Hess also cited cases from four other\n\ncircuits adhering to that principle when the entities involved\n\nincluded intra-state authorities, as well as political subdivisions\n\nand bi-state entities.          Id. at 48-49.    There is no indication the\n\ncourt intended to differentiate in the application of its major\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\ftests depending on the nature of the entity.   Thus, Metcalf & Eddy\n\nforeshadowed Hess's determination that when there is ambiguity from\n\nthe structure about whether an entity is an arm of the state, the\n\nprimary focus is on the risk to the state treasury.\n\n          Next, the circuits have also viewed Hess as applying to\n\npolitical subdivision and intra-state corporation cases.   Mancuso\n\nv. N.Y. State Thruway Auth., 86 F.3d 289, 293 (2d Cir. 1996)\n\n(\"Although Hess involved a bi-state entity, we nevertheless believe\n\nthat it is the proper starting place for our Eleventh Amendment\n\ninquiry in this case,\" involving an intra-state entity); see, e.g.,\n\nHarter, 101 F.3d at 337-40 (applying Hess to determine whether an\n\nentity should be characterized as a political subdivision or a\n\nstate agency).\n\n          Finally, Auer v. Robbins, a case involving an intra-state\n\nentity, the Board of Police Commissioners, supports our reading\n\nthat the two-step analysis applies beyond Compact Clause entities.\n\nIn a footnote, the Court held the Board was not an arm of the state\n\nbecause the state was not responsible for the Board's financial\n\nliabilities and the only form of state control was the governor's\n\npower to appoint four of five Board members.   519 U.S. at 456 n.1.\n\nThe Court did not cite to its earlier precedent, such as Mt.\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\fHealthy, but rather to its bi-state compact cases, Hess and Lake\n\nCountry.10\n\n             As to the more general concern, some have questioned\n\nHess's viability in light of Seminole and its aftermath. See Thiel\n\nv. State Bar, 94 F.3d 399, 401-03 (7th Cir. 1996) (viewing Hess as\n\nimplicitly limited by Seminole).     Hess's emphasis on protection of\n\nthe state fisc as a primary component of an arm-of-the-state\n\nanalysis has been criticized as not entirely consistent with the\n\nbroader Eleventh Amendment interests established by other and later\n\ncases.       See   C.M.   Vazquez,   What   Is   Eleventh   Amendment\n\nImmunity?, 106 Yale L.J. 1683, 1731-32 (1997); see also Thiel,\n\n94 F.3d at 401-02.\n\n             One response would be that Hess was concerned with an\n\nentirely different problem. Seminole and its progeny are addressed\n\nto what protection is given the state by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nHess is concerned with who is entitled to share that protection.\n\nWhen the state has not made it clear through structure that an\n\nentity is to share its immunity, there is reason not to reach a\n\n\n\n     10\n       In Regents of the University of California v. Doe, the Court\nsaid generally:\n\n     Of course, the question of whether a money judgment against a\n     state instrumentality or official would be enforceable against\n     the State is of considerable importance to any evaluation of\n     the relationship between the State and the entity being sued.\n\n519 U.S. at 430.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fresult inconsistent with what the state has apparently hoped to\n\neffectuate (that is, an independent entity) unless there is a risk\n\nto the state fisc.\n\n           Another response would be that Seminole and its progeny\n\naffirm the longstanding view, operationalized in Hess, that the\n\nEleventh   Amendment   exists   to    protect   the   fiscal   and   dignity\n\ninterests of the state.   Seminole, 517 U.S. at 58.       The first prong\n\nof Hess pays considerable deference to the dignity interests of the\n\nstate, focusing on both explicit and implicit indications that the\n\nstate sought to cloak an entity in its Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n           Finally, even were the criticism to have force, Hess\n\nbinds us and has not been overruled.        To the contrary, it has been\n\nconsistently cited by the Court.11          We must follow it until the\n\nSupreme Court decides otherwise.        State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S.\n\n3, 20 (1997) (\"[I]t is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule\n\none of its precedents.\"); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am.\n\nExpress, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989).\n\n           Accordingly, in the aftermath of Hess, Auer and Regents\n\nof the University of California, we think the Hess analysis governs\n\nand has refined the Metcalf & Eddy analysis, which is consistent\n\n\n\n\n     11\n       E.g., Solid Waste Agency v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs,\n531 U.S. 159, 174 (2001); Alden, 527 U.S. at 746; Seminole,\n517 U.S. at 58.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fwith Hess.      We view Hess as involving two key questions, with many\n\nfactors instructive on each:\n\n               1.   Has the state clearly structured the entity to share\n\nits sovereignty?        This evaluation is undertaken12 in light of the\n\ndifferent factors described in Hess, Lake Country and Metcalf &\n\nEddy.\n\n               2.   If the factors assessed in analyzing the structure\n\npoint     in   different   directions,   then   the   dispositive   question\n\nconcerns the risk that the damages will be paid from the public\n\ntreasury.      This is the rule of Metcalf & Eddy, valid today as well.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n        Lest our focus on the structure created by the state be\nmisunderstood, whether an entity is entitled to partake of a\nstate's Eleventh Amendment immunity is a question of federal law,\nnot state law:\n\n               Ultimately, of course, the question whether a particular\n               state agency has the same kind of independent status as\n               a county or is instead an arm of the State, and therefore\n               \"one of the United States\" within the meaning of the\n               Eleventh Amendment, is a question of federal law. But\n               that federal question can be answered only after\n               considering the provisions of state law that define the\n               agency's character.\n\nRegents of the Univ. of Cal., 519 U.S. at 429 n.5. The Supreme\nCourt has adverted to state law, but has not defined what role it\nis to play. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 280. In Hess\nitself the majority declined to adopt the state court's\ncharacterization of the agency. See 513 U.S. at 45 (holding that\nthe Port Authority does not enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity\ndespite the fact that \"[s]tate courts . . . repeatedly have typed\nthe Port Authority an agency of the States rather than a municipal\nunit or local district\").\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fThis    analysis   focuses   on   whether   the   state   has   legally   or\n\npractically obligated itself to pay the entity's indebtedness.\n\n              The control asserted by the state is an important guide\n\nto the initial inquiry.      But where the evidence is that the state\n\ndid not structure the entity to put the state treasury at risk of\n\npaying the judgment, then the fact that the state appoints the\n\nmajority of the governing board of the agency does not itself lead\n\nto the conclusion that the entity is an arm of the state.\n\nB.     Application of Standards\n\n             We now apply these standards to the facts of this case.\n\nThere are no factual findings of disputed facts by the district\n\ncourt, as the issue was decided under Rules 56 and 12(b)(6).13\n\nPRCCCC does not claim that there were disputed facts requiring\n\nresolution by the trial court.         The parties do draw different\n\nconclusions from the undisputed financial records of PRCCCC.\n\nWe consider the facts from admissible evidence that are germane to\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's\n\nfavor.      Wojcik, 300 F.3d at 96.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n        We treat the Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion               raising\nPRCCCC's Eleventh Amendment defense as a motion for                summary\njudgment, since both parties presented and the court              did not\nexclude evidence outside the pleadings. Fed. R. Civ. P.           12(b).\n\n                                   -24-\n\f1.   Structuring of PRCCCC\n\na.   The Enabling Act\n\n             The enabling act that created PRCCCC, 24 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§§ 343-343k (2000), does not by its terms structure PRCCCC to be an\n\narm of the state.          In fact, it suggests exactly the opposite.          The\n\nact creates an \"entity which is independent and separate from any\n\nother      agency    or    instrumentality     of   the    Government   of     the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"              Id. § 343a.     Moreover, PRCCCC is\n\nexplicitly empowered to enter into contracts with the state,\n\nspecifically        the     Commonwealth's    Department     of    Health,     the\n\nUniversity      of        Puerto   Rico,     and    \"any   other    bodies      or\n\ninstrumentalities of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"14                     Id. §\n\n434b(n).     Further, the act provides that PRCCCC may \"borrow\" money\n\nfrom the Commonwealth, id. § 343b(g), and that the Commonwealth\n\nwill charge it rent for use of its building, which \"shall help to\n\namortize the debt for a period of thirty (30) years,\" id. § 343g.\n\nThe Board is authorized to create a budget, which it must submit to\n\nthe legislature, but the budget is required to stay \"within the\n\nlimits of [PRCCCC's] estimated income so as to keep from incurring\n\n\n\n      14\n        In PRCCCC's favor is that it has been exempted from all\ntaxes and fees collected by the government of Puerto Rico and its\npolitical subdivisions.    Id. § 343e.   By like token, that very\nlanguage indicates it is not a political subdivision. In reference\nto PRCCCC's tax exempt status, FMC executive Watson observes that\nmany of the private hospitals he has dealt with are also exempt\nfrom local taxes and duties.\n\n                                       -25-\n\fshortfalls.\"     Id. § 343h.   Importantly, the act does not say the\n\ntreasury of the Commonwealth will pay for those shortfalls.15\n\n           Nonetheless, in PRCCCC's favor, the act does not contain\n\nlanguage declaring that the Commonwealth is not responsible for\n\nPRCCCC's debt, as was true of the statutory schemes in Metcalf &\n\nEddy, see 991 F.2d at 940, and Royal Caribbean Corp. v. Puerto Rico\n\nPorts Authority, 973 F. 2d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1992).     In that sense,\n\nthis is a closer case.\n\nb.   Other State Statutes\n\n          PRCCCC relies on statutes outside its own enabling act to\n\nargue that it is an arm of the state.    It points to the definition\n\nof public funds set forth in 33 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3022(11), (14),\n\nwhich provide:\n\n          (11) Commonwealth of Puerto Rico -- Comprises its\n          municipalities, agencies, public corporations, political\n          subdivisions and other dependencies or instrumentalities.\n\n           (14) Public funds or public treasury -- Means all bonds\n           or liabilities and evidences of indebtedness and all\n           moneys belonging to the Government of the Commonwealth of\n           Puerto Rico, the municipalities, agencies, public,\n           municipal and state corporations, political subdivisions\n\n\n     15\n       Interestingly, PRCCCC's own evidence showed that one of\nthe purposes of creating the public corporation was that\npublic funds allocated to the hospital \"could be insulated\nfrom the budgetary constraints the [Commonwealth's] Health\nDepartment always had.\"    Another purpose was to serve as\n\"justification to 'privatize' the health system.\" These are\nalso indicia that the Commonwealth wanted PRCCCC to be at\narm's length, not to be an arm of the state.\n\n                                 -26-\n\f            and other dependencies, and all moneys, securities, bonds\n            and evidences of indebtedness received and kept by\n            officials or employees of the aforementioned entities, in\n            their official character.\n\nWe reject for four reasons the contention that this definition of\n\npublic    funds   is   a   statement   that   all   \"public   corporations\"\n\nestablished by Puerto Rico are arms of the state.               First, the\n\ndefinitions are explicitly limited to the subtitle in which they\n\nappear, a part of the Penal Code of Puerto Rico.          See id. § 3022.\n\nSecond, when Puerto Rico has chosen to make an entity an arm of the\n\nstate, it has used other language.             For example, the Medical\n\nServices Administration (MSA), another health care entity created\n\nby the Commonwealth,16 was \"created as an instrumentality of the\n\nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, attached to the\n\nCommonwealth Department of Health . . . under the direction and\n\nsupervision of the Secretary of Health.\"        24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 342b;\n\nsee Rodriguez Diaz v. Sierra Martinez, 717 F. Supp. 27, 29-31\n\n(D.P.R. 1989). Third, it is a maxim of statutory construction that\n\nthe more specific statute, here PRCCCC's enabling act, governs over\n\nthe more general, such as the definitions in § 3022.             See In re\n\n\n     16\n       PRCCCC witness Zapata asserts claims that the structure of\nthe PRCCCC is \"similar, if not identical\" to that of the public\nmedical center known (in English) as the Medical Services\nAdministration (MSA).     This is untrue, as discussed above.\nFurthermore, unlike the PRCCCC enabling legislation, see 24 P.R.\nLaws Ann. §§ 343-343k, the MSA enabling legislation provides that\ncivil litigants against the MSA are subject to the cap on recovery\nestablished under the Commonwealth's state sovereign immunity, 24\nP.R. Laws Ann. § 343g.\n\n                                   -27-\n\fWeinstein, 272 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 2001).           Fourth, such a\n\nconstruction would be inconsistent with a number of our cases\n\nfinding various public authorities and corporations created by\n\nPuerto Rico not to be arms of the state.      See, e.g., Metcalf &\n\nEddy, 991 F.2d 935; Royal Carribean Corp., 973 F.2d 8 (Breyer,\n\nC.J.).\n\nc.   State Court Decisions\n\n           Apart from the statutory schemes, we consider how the\n\nstate courts have treated PRCCCC.      The Supreme Court has found\n\nstate court decisions a useful resource.   See Hess, 513 U.S. at 45;\n\nMoor, 411 U.S. at 720-721.     PRCCCC has not provided us with a\n\nsingle opinion from a court of Puerto Rico holding that PRCCCC is\n\npart of the government of Puerto Rico, or, for that matter, that\n\nthe Commonwealth will stand behind PRCCCC's debt.17    It is PRCCCC's\n\nburden to do so.   See Wojcik, 300 F.3d at 99; Gragg v. Ky. Cabinet\n\nfor Workforce Dev., 289 F.3d 958, 963 (6th Cir. 2002); Skelton v.\n\nCamp, 234 F.3d 292, 297 (5th Cir. 2000).\n\n           PRCCCC points to the Penal Code, stating that PRCCCC\n\nemployees are considered public employees under the Penal Code of\n\nPuerto Rico.   The Penal Code's definition of a public employee,\n\nwhich is expressly limited to the subtitle in which it appears, see\n\n\n\n      17\n        PRCCCC refers to a 1987 opinion by the Attorney\nGeneral; we do not read that opinion as supporting PRCCCC even\nassuming, dubitante, that it has some authoritative value.\n\n                                -28-\n\f33 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3022, includes persons working for municipal\n\nand local government bodies and other entities that do not enjoy\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity, see id. § 3022(16).              Meanwhile, other\n\nstatutory definitions of public employee seem to exclude PRCCCC\n\nemployees.        See, e.g., 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 729c(b) (chapter on\n\ncompensation and benefits of government personnel adopts definition\n\nof employee that specifically excludes \"the officials and employees\n\nof the public corporations and of the University of Puerto Rico\").\n\nd.   Functions of PRCCCC\n\n            PRCCCC       contends   that   its   functions    are    those   of   a\n\ngovernment.       If true, that would assist its structural argument.\n\nPRCCCC points to no judicial authority to support its proposition.\n\nInstead, it offers three arguments.\n\n            First,       Zapata   contends    that   PRCCCC   is    an   essential\n\ncomponent    of    the    Commonwealth's      strategy   to   comply     with   its\n\nobligation, under the Constitution of Puerto Rico, Article II,\n\nSection 20, to provide health care to indigent residents.                         It\n\nappears Section 20 is not binding. The Constitution of Puerto Rico\n\nhad to be approved by the U.S. Congress before going into effect.\n\nFigueroa v. People of P.R., 232 F.2d 615, 620 (1st Cir. 1956).\n\nCongress conditioned its approval of the Puerto Rico Constitution\n\npartly on deletion of Article II, Section 20.             See Pub. L. No. 82-\n\n447, 66 Stat. 327, 327 (1952). Furthermore, Article II, Section 20\n\nappears to have been intended as an aspirational statement, modeled\n\n                                       -29-\n\fon language in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, rather\n\nthan as a basis for legal obligations.            The Section enumerates a\n\nlist of human rights including the right to work, the right to an\n\nadequate standard of living, and the right to medical care; it then\n\nstates, \"The rights set forth in this section . . . require, for\n\ntheir full effectiveness, sufficient resources and an agricultural\n\nand industrial development not yet attained by the Puerto Rican\n\ncommunity.\"    (emphasis added).\n\n           Second, PRCCCC's enabling legislation says that it will\n\nbe responsible for public policy relating to the provision of\n\ncardiovascular services in Puerto Rico.           24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 343b.\n\nPRCCCC presents no evidence indicating that it has helped set\n\npolicies applicable     to   other      facilities      in   Puerto   Rico.    It\n\nacknowledges, moreover, that since the Commonwealth carried out a\n\nmajor health reform in 1993, PRCCCC has competed with private\n\nhospitals for legislative appropriations and other pubic funds\n\nallocated for cardiovascular surgery.18              This reform presumably\n\ndiminished any policymaking function of PRCCCC.\n\n           Third, Zapata observes that PRCCCC's mission includes\n\ntraining   medical    students,      interns,     and    residents     from   the\n\nUniversity    of   Puerto   Rico   (a    public   university).         But    many\n\nhospitals unaffiliated with state governments (or the Commonwealth)\n\n\n     18\n       Further, Watson notes that PRCCCC functions with respect to\nits vendors like a private, rather than a government, hospital.\n\n                                     -30-\n\femploy   (and   train)   interns    and    residents   from   state   medical\n\nschools.\n\n           The provision of medical care, in our economy, is not\n\nprimarily a state function.        Even medical care for the poor is a\n\nresponsibility often imposed on private hospitals, through free\n\ncare pools,     Medicaid,   and    other    devices.    The   difficulty    of\n\ncontaining costs for these services may be exactly why Puerto Rico\n\nhas chosen in PRCCCC's enabling act not to make its treasury\n\naccountable for PRCCCC's debts.            That PRCCCC receives Medicaid\n\nfunding does not distinguish it from a private sector hospital,\n\neither not-for-profit or for-profit. A mosaic of medical providers\n\nserves the poor and the uninsured, and nothing about PRCCCC marks\n\nit as serving a uniquely governmental function.\n\ne.   Control by the State\n\n           PRCCCC also argues that it is subject to a fair degree of\n\ncontrol by the Commonwealth.       Under the enabling act, the Board is\n\ncomposed of seven members, three of whom are ex officio members and\n\nare high-ranking state officials.          33 P.R. Laws Ann. § 343(c).     The\n\ngovernor appoints the remaining four members to four-year terms.\n\nThe Secretary of Health of Puerto Rico is chairman of the Board.\n\nThe votes of four members are needed for action; thus the ex\n\nofficio members presumably vote.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\f               The governor's appointment power over the board is not\n\nenough in itself to establish that PRCCCC is an arm of the state.\n\nSee Auer, 519 U.S. at 456 n.1.              The statute itself does not give\n\nthe governor power to remove Board members, and it is unclear where\n\nsuch power resides.19 Nor does the statute give the Commonwealth\n\nveto power over the decisions of the Board, a key element of\n\ncontrol.\n\n               In   her    statement,   Lúgaro   asserts     that   the   governor\n\nintervenes periodically in PRCCCC management and personnel issues.\n\nShe asserts that the Commonwealth's Comptroller audits PRCCCC. She\n\nalso    says    that      the   Executive   Director   and   other   key    PRCCCC\n\npersonnel have to file annual reports with the Government Ethics\n\nOffice.     These are indicia of control, but hardly determinative in\n\nview of the statutory structure.20\n\n\n\n\n       19\n       PRCCCC, which bears the burden of proof, offers only\ninadmissible hearsay evidence on this point. See Vazquez v.\nLopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Evidence that\nis inadmissible at trial, such as inadmissible hearsay, may\nnot be considered on summary judgment.\").\n       20\n        Even the view of the dissent in Hess on the importance of\ncontrol does not assist PRCCCC.     Though it does not propose a\nbright-line rule demarcating the level of control necessary to\nwarrant a finding that an entity is an arm of the state, the Hess\ndissent does observe that such a finding is warranted \"if the State\nappoints and removes an entity's governing personnel and retains\nveto or approval power over an entity's undertakings.\" Hess, 513\nU.S. at 61 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); see Brotherton v. Cleveland,\n173 F.3d 552, 561 n.5 (6th Cir. 1999). Key elements of control,\nsuch as veto power, are absent here.\n\n                                        -32-\n\f          We cannot say the indicia all point in the direction of\n\nPRCCCC being an arm of the state and so reach the second stage of\n\nthe analysis.\n\n2.   Would the Commonwealth's Treasury Be Obligated to Pay a\nJudgment Against PRCCCC?\n\n          Our next inquiry is whether any judgment in this action\n\nwould be paid by the Commonwealth's treasury.     As Hess explained,\n\n\"If the expenditures of the enterprise exceed receipts, is the\n\nState in fact obligated to bear and pay the resulting indebtedness\n\nof the enterprise?    When the answer is 'No' -- both legally and\n\npractically -- then the Eleventh Amendment's core concern is not\n\nimplicated.\"    513 U.S. at 51.   Thus we examine two areas:   what is\n\nsaid by state law on the topic21 and what in fact has happened.\n\n          The enabling act does not, as we have said, make the\n\nCommonwealth liable for the debts of PRCCCC.      Still, it could be\n\nthat the Commonwealth has assumed that obligation in fact, either\n\ndirectly or indirectly, by providing virtually all the funds needed\n\nfor the operation of PRCCCC. The facts, discussed below, show that\n\nthe Commonwealth has not done that.      Rather, the Commonwealth has\n\n\n\n     21\n        Zapata states that the team of experts which advised the\nlegislature on the creation of PRCCCC concluded that sixty percent\nof the hospital's revenues would need to come from legislative\nappropriations.    If that is so, then the fact that PRCCCC's\nenabling legislation does not require the legislature to provide a\nfixed percentage (or other level) of support for PRCCCC is telling.\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fleft itself free to provide or not provide funds to PRCCCC as it\n\nsees fit, and it has not come close to obligating itself to assume\n\nthe burden of paying PRCCCC's debt.     The Commonwealth has provided\n\nfor PRCCCC to have independent sources of revenue and, indeed, the\n\nmajority of PRCCCC's funding now comes from sources other than the\n\nCommonwealth's treasury.\n\n            We start with the statutory scheme and consider two\n\nfactors:    the provisions as to funding of debts and any provisions\n\nfor raising revenues.      There are no provisions for funding of\n\nPRCCCC's debts, just an admonition in the enabling act that PRCCCC\n\nmust live within its means.     The legislative intent seems to be\n\nthat PRCCCC not incur debts that it cannot pay from budgeted sums.\n\nAs to revenue, the statutory scheme contemplates a number of\n\nsources of income.    The statute provides that PRCCCC may\n\n            1.     borrow money from any funding source, 24 P.R.\n                   Laws Ann. § 343b(g);\n            2.     sell its services to private entities, id. §\n                   343b(k);\n            3.     sell materials to private entities, id. §\n                   343b(m);\n            4.     request and accept federal, state, or other funds\n                   and grants, § 343b(o); and\n            5.     enter    with   others   into   a    corporation,\n                   partnership, joint venture, or association, id. §\n                   343b(r).\n\nIn addition, the statute provides that PRCCCC may issue bonds, id.\n\n§ 343k.    It is noteworthy that the Commonwealth is not a guarantor\n\non the bonds.\n\n                                 -34-\n\f           PRCCCC replies that the capacity to issue bonds and raise\n\nrevenues is a \"dead letter.\"    That is because private lenders will\n\nnot provide financing \"unless the Commonwealth funds are pledged as\n\nwarranty of payment through the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nWith an operating deficit that exceeds an [annual] average of $7\n\nmillion . . . PRCCCC does not have the credit that will enable it\n\nto borrow money and obtain loans, much less issue bonds.\"               Though\n\nrelevant, this evidence does not show that PRCCCC's debts would\n\nbecome the Commonwealth's.\n\n           PRCCCC   also   points    to    the   language    of   the     1986\n\nappropriations act, which provided PRCCCC with $500,000 in initial\n\nworking capital.    Act of June 30, 1986, No. 51, at p. 170, § 13,\n\nquoted in 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 343, history.         The bill also said:\n\n           The funds needed in subsequent years to carry out the\n           purposes of this act [chapter] shall be consigned in the\n           General Expense Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico.\n\nId.   There are three responses to the argument.            First, this is\n\nlanguage in an appropriations act for a particular year. Such acts\n\nnormally expire within the year, and PRCCCC has not presented any\n\nargument that the language must be read to extend to all future\n\nyears.    See Minis v. United States, 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 423, 445\n\n(1841).    Second, this language was not put into the codified law\n\nenacted in 1986, nor has it been added since then.                Third, in\n\n\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fpractice the legislature did not consider itself bound by that\n\nlanguage in years after 1986.\n\n                 PRCCCC's other argument is that it is required to submit\n\nan   operating       expenses     and   capital    investments     budget    to   the\n\nlegislature.         24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 343h.          That alone does not show\n\nthat PRCCCC's debts will be paid by the Commonwealth; it is better\n\nread    as   imposing       discipline    meant    to    discourage    PRCCCC     from\n\nbuilding up unpaid debts.           There is, moreover, no evidence in the\n\nrecord (and the burden is on PRCCCC) that PRCCCC took any steps to\n\ncomply with this requirement before February 25, 2002, more than\n\nthree months after it formally asserted an Eleventh Amendment\n\ndefense to FMC's lawsuit.22\n\n                 We turn to what in practice has happened.            \"If the state\n\nsubstantially funds the entity, those funds would be a probable\n\nsource      to    satisfy   any   judgment      against   the    entity.     On    the\n\ncontrary, if the entity has taxing powers and can issue bonds,\n\nstate funds might not be at risk in litigation against the entity.\"\n\nMoore's, supra, § 123.23[4][b], at 123-57 to 123-58.\n\n                 PRCCCC   witness   Bustelo     states    that    PRCCCC    receives\n\nseveral types of financial support from government entities: (a)\n\nlegislative        appropriations;       (b)   reimbursements      from    insurance\n\n\n\n       22\n        On February 25, 2002, Lúgaro requested a legislative\nappropriation to pay the rent during FY 2001 and FY 2002 and cover\nthe rest of PRCCCC's deficit.\n\n                                         -36-\n\fcompanies linked to the Department of Health; (c) payments from the\n\nCity    of   San   Juan;   and    (d)   \"indirect   subsidies,\"     which   are\n\neffectively short-term loans, from public utilities and other\n\npublic corporations.           Because of PRCCCC's relationship to the\n\nstate, Bustelo contends, public corporations such as PRCCCC's\n\nlandlord have not initiated eviction proceedings or otherwise\n\ndenied services when PRCCCC's payments were late.\n\n             We start with the most recent history.            In FY 2001,\n\nPRCCCC received over $50 million in revenues.           It received nothing\n\nin legislative appropriations, although it was running a $12\n\nmillion deficit.        In FY 2002, it again received no legislative\n\nappropriation. Most of PRCCCC's revenues are from fees for patient\n\nservices     received   from     private   insurance   companies,   patients,\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, or the Commonwealth's public health system,23\n\njust as revenues come in to private hospitals in Puerto Rico.\n\nLooking back further, PRCCCC's legislative appropriations amounted\n\nto less than 14 percent of its total revenues from fiscal years\n\n1993 to 2001.\n\n\n\n\n       23\n        Although the Commonwealth participates in Medicare and\nMedicaid, it also has a separate public health system. Medicare is\na federally funded program overseen by part of the federal\ngovernment; Medicaid is a jointly funded federal-state program\noverseen by federal and state entities but usually administered at\nthe county level.    By contrast, the Commonwealth's own public\nhealth system receives no federal funding.\n\n                                        -37-\n\f           In   its   role   as   an    insurer,    the    Commonwealth      also\n\nreimbursed PRCCCC for particular medical procedures. Even counting\n\nthese reimbursements, the share of PRCCCC revenues coming from the\n\nPuerto Rico government between FY 1993 and 2001 was about 41\n\npercent.    These reimbursements were presumably made under the\n\nCommonwealth's public health system and the Medicaid program.\n\nSince private, for-profit hospitals receive these reimbursements as\n\na matter of course, it is doubtful whether they should be counted\n\nfor Eleventh Amendment purposes.          We do not count payments made by\n\nthe municipality of San Juan as revenue from the state treasury.\n\n           Overall, the share of funding provided by the legislature\n\nand by the Commonwealth as a whole has diminished sharply over\n\ntime.   In FY 1993 and 1994, the first two years for which figures\n\nare available, the legislature provided approximately 21 percent of\n\nPRCCCC's   revenues     by    appropriation.              Counting   insurance\n\nreimbursements as well as appropriations, the Commonwealth provided\n\nover 64 percent of PRCCCC's revenues during that period.                    In FY\n\n2000 and 2001, the last two years for which complete figures are\n\navailable, the legislature provided approximately 8 percent and the\n\nCommonwealth in toto provided approximately 26 percent of its\n\nrevenue. As noted above, the legislature provided no appropriation\n\nwhatsoever during FY 2001 or FY 2002.               The elimination of any\n\nlegislative     appropriations    presumably       reflects    the   fact    that\n\nPRCCCC's operational revenues -- that is, its fees from providing\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\fcardiovascular       medical     care      to     patients    --    increased    by\n\napproximately 400 percent between FY 1993 and FY 2001.\n\n            PRCCCC    argues    that    this      accounting      understates   the\n\nCommonwealth's       actual    contribution        to    PRCCCC    because   public\n\nutilities    and     other     allegedly         government-controlled       public\n\ncorporations have allowed PRCCCC to receive services without paying\n\nfor them.    The record refutes this argument.                Like virtually all\n\nbusinesses, PRCCCC has accounts payable: bills from suppliers for\n\ngoods and services purchased on credit.                 There is every indication\n\nthat, as a general practice, PRCCCC pays its accounts to public\n\nutilities and other public corporations.                   For example, Bustelo\n\nstated that the legislative appropriation has been used mainly to\n\npay PRCCCC's largest account payable: its debt to the Public\n\nHousing Administration (PHA), the state agency that owns its\n\nphysical plant.      PRCCCC has not shown that it has failed to pay any\n\ndebt, apart from its FY 2001 debt to the PHA, in a timely fashion.\n\nMoreover, the FY 2001 PHA debt was only unpaid as of March 2002,\n\nand accounts payable are typically due within 12 months.\n\n            Between    FY     1993   and    FY    2001,    PRCCCC's    operational\n\nexpenses exceeded its total revenues by approximately $18 million.\n\nThe income statement does not provide any detail on the hospital's\n\ndebt structure; nevertheless, there is no evidence distinguishing\n\nthis level of debt for an institution whose operational revenues\n\nnow exceed $50 million per year from private sector debt. PRCCCC's\n\n                                        -39-\n\foperational revenues have grown at a substantially steeper rate\n\nthan its operational expenses between FY 1993 and FY 2001.\n\n            The     fact    that    PRCCCC     receives    significant,      but\n\ndiminishing, state funding (now less than thirty percent counting\n\nall sources, including insurance) is simply not enough to enable it\n\nto claim Eleventh Amendment immunity.             Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at\n\n280. In the end, PRCCCC's argument is simply that a judgment would\n\ndeplete its operating funds, that the Commonwealth might choose to\n\nrescue it,    and    that   this    would    indirectly   deplete   the   state\n\ntreasury.    We rejected this very argument in Metcalf & Eddy, 991\n\nF.2d at 941, and do so here.\n\nC.   Insufficiency of Service of Process\n\n            The district court made factual findings regarding the\n\nRule 12(b)(2) and the associated Rule 12(b)(5) claims. See Rivera-\n\nFlores v. P.R. Tel. Co., 64 F.3d 742, 748 (1st Cir.                       1995).\n\nFindings of fact by the district court may not be set aside unless\n\nthey are clearly erroneous.          Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); Anderson v.\n\nCity of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985).             There was no error.\n\n            Rule     4(h)(1)       governs    service     of   process      upon\n\ncorporations.      Proper service under Puerto Rico law satisfies Rule\n\n4(h)(1). See Sea-Land Serv., Inc. v. Ceramica Europa II, Inc., 160\n\nF.3d 849, 853 (1st Cir. 1998).         Under Puerto Rico law, process can\n\nbe served by \"leaving [a copy of the summons and complaint] at the\n\n\n\n                                      -40-\n\fregistered office or other place of business of the corporation in\n\nthe Commonwealth.\"   14 P.R.

Plaintiff\n\nunquestionably met this requirement.\n\n                              III.\n\n          We affirm the district court's decisions that PRCCCC is\n\nnot an arm of the state and so is not entitled to Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity and that there was adequate service of process.\n\nCosts are awarded to plaintiff.\n\n\n\n\n                              -41-\n\f",

This case raises the issue of\n\nwhether   the   defendant   public    corporation      is       an   arm   of   the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico and so entitled to assert immunity\n\nunder the Eleventh Amendment.             It causes us to reshape this\n\ncircuit's arm-of-the-state test in light of intervening Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.\n\n           Our analysis under the reshaped test leads us to affirm\n\nthe district court's conclusion that the defendant, Puerto Rico and\n\nthe Carribean Cardiovascular Center Corp. (PRCCCC), is not an arm\n\nof the Commonwealth and so is not entitled to immunity.                    We also\n\nuphold the district court's finding that PRCCCC was adequately\n\nserved with process.    The underlying lawsuit involves a claim by\n\nFresenius Medical Care Cardiovascular Resources, Inc. (FMC) against\n\nPRCCCC for breach of contract, the details of which are not germane\n\nto the issues on appeal.\n\n                                     I.\n\n           On   September   28,   2001,      FMC   filed    a    federal     court\n\ncomplaint against PRCCCC, asserting diversity jurisdiction under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1332(a)(1), (d) (2000).            It sought over $7,000,000 in\n\ndamages for breach of contract and of the implied covenant of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing. It also sought an order requiring specific\n\nperformance of the contract by PRCCCC and a declaratory judgment\n\nthat FMC was not in material breach of the agreement.\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            PRCCCC moved to dismiss the complaint on November 13,\n\n2001.    It moved to dismiss on the grounds that PRCCCC is an arm of\n\nthe state entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity; that PRCCCC is\n\nnot a citizen of Puerto Rico for diversity purposes since it is an\n\narm of the state; that FMC lacked standing; and that there was\n\ndefective service of process.           PRCCCC attached to its motion an\n\nunauthenticated chart listing the hospital's total revenues and\n\nlegislative appropriations as well as a statement under penalty of\n\nperjury by José Soler Zapata, Acting Medical Director of PRCCCC and\n\nformer Secretary of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\nFMC, in its opposition, submitted a statement under penalty of\n\nperjury by Bill Watson, its executive responsible for dealing with\n\nPRCCCC,    and   objected   to   the   Zapata   statement   on    evidentiary\n\ngrounds.    After receiving two extensions, PRCCCC eventually filed\n\nan untimely reply.\n\n            The district court denied PRCCCC's motion in an opinion\n\nand order dated March 18, 2002.

Noting that the most important factor is the entity's\n\nrelationship to the public fisc, the district court held that this\n\nfactor     weighed   against     a   finding    of   immunity    because   the\n\nCommonwealth would not be obligated to pay a judgment against\n\nPRCCCC and because PRCCCC receives a relatively small share of its\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ffunds from the Commonwealth. It also rejected PRCCCC's argument of\n\ninadequate service of process.\n\n          PRCCCC filed two motions for reconsideration of the\n\ndistrict court's March 18 decision.     PRCCCC produced new evidence\n\nin support of its second motion for reconsideration: statements by\n\nLuisa Rivera Lúgaro, the former Executive Director of PRCCCC, and\n\nMiguel Bustelo, the Chief Financial Officer of PRCCCC.     Bustelo's\n\naffidavit attached a new income statement identifying sources of\n\ngovernment     funding   apart   from   legislative   appropriations.\n\nPlaintiff again objected to consideration of the evidence.        The\n\ndistrict court, without providing plaintiff the opportunity to\n\nproduce more evidence, considered this late-filed information but\n\ndenied the motion in a six page opinion and order dated May 7,\n\n2002.1\n\n             On May 21, 2002, PRCCCC filed an interlocutory appeal.\n\nSee P.R.

On November 6, 2002, this court denied the request.3\n\n     2\n       At the same time, PRCCCC failed to meet its obligations to\nmove forward either its appeal or the trial court proceedings. In\nits appeal of the district court's March 18 and May 7 rulings,\nPRCCCC missed the deadlines to file counsel's appearance form, its\ndocketing statement, and its brief, after those deadlines were\nextended. In the district court, it disregarded a September 23,\n2002 court order requiring PRCCCC to comply with discovery requests\nthat had been pending for over six months.\n     In its appeal of the district court's Eleventh Amendment\nfinding, PRCCCC again failed to meet its obligations when it\nsubmitted its reply brief to this court. The reply brief was late\nand longer than our rules permit. In addition, the reply brief\nrepeatedly made new and unsupported factual allegations. See Fed.\nR. App. P. 28(a)(7). Plaintiff opposed the filing of the reply\nbrief on the grounds that it was untimely, oversized, and made\nirrelevant factual accusations. We strike the statement of facts\nand new factual references in the reply brief but have considered\nthe legal arguments made.\n     3\n         This court's order denying the stay said:\n\n         A request for a stay essentially invokes the equitable\n   powers of this court.       Here, the conduct of [PRCCCC]\n   evidences a pattern of causing delay in this litigation, both\n   in this court and the district court, including missing\n   filing deadlines after those deadlines were extended.\n   Accordingly, we think the Hospital is in a poor position to\n   claim that it will suffer injury if the stay is not granted.\n   We therefore deny the motion for a stay.\n        We will, however, expedite this appeal. . . . Should\n   the trial date in the district court arrive before this court\n   has decided the appeal, then the Hospital may reapply for a\n   stay.\n\n     A month later, PRCCCC filed an \"urgent motion for\nreconsideration\" of this court's denial of the stay request,\nclaiming that the trial date had in fact arrived before this court\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                                     II.\n\nA.

For the past\n\ndecade the courts of this circuit, under Metcalf & Eddy, have\n\nassessed an entity's arm-of-the-state status by focusing on whether\n\n\n     5\n       The Court in Lake Country identified the following facts as\ngermane to the arm-of-the-state status of the Tahoe Regional\nPlanning Agency (TRPA):\n          1. the designation in the interstate compact of the TRPA\n          as a \"separate legal entity\" and a \"political\n          subdivision\";\n          2. the power that resided in counties to appoint six of\n          the ten governing members of the TRPA whereas the states\n          appointed only four members;\n          3. the funding of the TRPA exclusively by the counties;\n          4. the express pronouncement in the compact that\n          obligations of the TRPA were not binding on either state;\n          5. the function of the TRPA, which was to regulate land\n          use; and\n          6. the failure of the states to preserve veto power over\n          rules promulgated by the TRPA.\nSee 440 U.S. at 401-02. Thus, the analysis considered (a) how the\nentity is characterized under state law; (b) the level of control\nexercised by the state; (c) the entity's relationship to the public\ntreasury (both the relative size of its government appropriation\nand whether the government is legally liable for the entity's\ndebts); and (d) whether the entity performs a state function.

The Eleventh\n\nAmendment has always acted to restrict the jurisdiction of the\n\nfederal courts to entertain claims against the state when the\n\nunderlying        source   of    federal      jurisdiction      is     diversity\n\njurisdiction.

Accordingly,\n\nany arm-of-the-state conclusion here has implications for the\n\nenforceability of federal laws enacted under Article I in\n\nsuits by private persons against PRCCCC.\n\n           Thus,   where   an    entity      claims   to    share     a    state's\n\nsovereignty and the state has not clearly demarcated the entity as\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fsharing its sovereignty, there is great reason for caution.            It\n\nwould be every bit as much an affront to the state's dignity and\n\nfiscal interests were a federal court to find erroneously that an\n\nentity was an arm of the state, when the state did not structure\n\nthe entity to share its sovereignty.         The consequences of an arm-\n\nof-the-state finding are considerable.        For example, where a state\n\nconsents to suit in its own courts, such an arm-of-the-state\n\nfinding may pose a threat to the state treasury, even if the state\n\nhas not structured the entity so as to put its treasury at risk.\n\nIn an era when many states face budget crises and impose cutbacks\n\non recognized state agencies, yet another claimant on the treasury\n\nmay not be welcomed.\n\n             Not all entities created by states are meant to share\n\nstate sovereignty.       Some entities may be part of an effort at\n\nprivatization, representing an assessment by the state that the\n\nprivate sector may perform a function better than the state.

The most\n\nrecent full discussion of the doctrine is in Hess.          Hess, like Lake\n\nCountry before it, involves an entity created by two states under\n\nthe Compact Clause of the Constitution. A closely divided court in\n\nHess held that the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation was not\n\nan arm of the state.      As noted above, the Hess analysis explicitly\n\nrecognizes the Eleventh Amendment's twin interests: protection of\n\nthe fisc and the dignity of the states.          513 U.S. at 39-40, 47.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f                  As to bi-state Compact Clause entities, the Hess court\n\ncontinued the general approach taken in Lake Country:\n\n                  We would presume the Compact Clause agency does not\n                  qualify for Eleventh Amendment immunity \"unless there is\n                  good reason to believe that the States structured the new\n                  agency to enable it to enjoy the special constitutional\n                  protection of the states themselves and that Congress\n                  concurred in that purpose.\"\n\nId. at 43-44 (quoting Lake Country, 440 U.S. at 401).                     Putting\n\naside       the    question    of    presumption,   Hess   requires   a   two-step\n\nanalysis.          Accord Harter v. Vernon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729952\"><a href=\"/opinion/729952/wayne-harter-robert-payne-v-cd-vernon-individually-and-in-his-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 337 (4th Cir.\n\n1996).       The first step of the analysis concerns how the state has\n\nstructured the entity.              This step, we think, pays deference to the\n\nstate's dignitary interest in extending or withholding Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity from an entity.               After all, a state may easily\n\nmake clear by statute its view that an entity is to share the\n\nstate's immunity.          Where the state has not made a clear statement,\n\nits dignity interests are nonetheless protected by an examination\n\nof the structure the state has chosen to establish.               In evaluating\n\nwhether the state had structured an agency to be an arm of the\n\nstate, Hess looked at \"various indicators of immunity or the\n\nabsence thereof.\"7            513 U.S. at 44.\n\n\n        7\n       Among the indicators Hess considered were:\n     1. extent of state control including through the appointment\nof board members and the state's power to veto board actions or\nenlarge the entity's responsibilities;\n     2. how the enabling and implementing legislation characterized\nthe entity and how the state courts have viewed the entity;\n     3. whether the entity's functions are readily classifiable as\nstate functions or local or non-governmental functions; and\n\n                                          -16-\n\f          If   the   structural    indicators   point    in   different\n\ndirections, then the second stage of analysis comes into play.       At\n\nthis stage, the vulnerability of the state's purse is the most\n\nsalient factor in the Eleventh Amendment determination.8       Where it\n\nis clear that the state treasury is not at risk, then the control\n\nexercised by the state over the entity does not entitle the entity\n\nto Eleventh Amendment immunity.     See id. at 47-49.9\n\n\n\n     4. whether the state bore legal liability for the entity's\ndebts. See 513 U.S. at 44-46.\n     8\n       This Hess vulnerability inquiry includes examination of\nthese, among other, factors: whether the state laws impose an\nobligation on the state to be responsible for payment of judgments\nagainst the entity (on this point federal courts are not free to\nassume that a state will voluntarily assume the payment of the\nentity's debts if the entity is in need); other sources of revenue\nfor the entity; and whether the agency is so structured that, as a\npractical matter, the state anticipated budget shortfalls that\nwould render the entity constantly dependent on the state. Id. at\n49-50.\n     9\n        Although the dissent in Hess would reach a different\nconclusion on the facts there, it agrees that the key initial\nquestion is whether \"the State has structured the entity in the\nexpectation that immunity will inhere.\" Id. at 58 (O'Connor, J.,\ndissenting).    The dissent also agrees that if the entity's\nliabilities are funded by the taxpayers' dollars, then there is\nEleventh Amendment immunity. Id. at 60-61. The Hess dissent did\nnot agree that the converse was true: that if the state treasury\nwas not directly implicated, then there would be no immunity. The\ndissent would then ask whether the state \"possesses sufficient\ncontrol over an entity performing governmental functions that the\nentity may properly be called an extension of the State itself.\"\nId. at 61. If \"the lines of oversight are clear and substantial --\nfor example, if the state appoints and removes an entity's\ngoverning personnel and retains veto or approval power over an\nentity's undertakings\" -- then, on the dissent's reasoning, the\nentity should be deemed an arm of the state for Eleventh Amendment\npurposes. Id.\n\n                                  -17-\n\f           In the aftermath of Hess, the circuits almost uniformly\n\nfind that, when there is an ambiguity about the direction in which\n\nthe structural analysis points, the potential payment from the\n\nstate treasury is the most critical factor in determining whether\n\nan entity is operating as an arm of the state.   See 17A J.W. Moore\n\net al., Moore's Federal Practice § 123.23(4)(b), at 123-60 & n.51\n\n(3d ed. 2000) [hereinafter Moore's] (collecting cases).\n\n           The question for the lower federal courts becomes what\n\nparts of Hess govern the analysis of an intra-state entity such as\n\nPRCCCC.   Compact Clause entities by their nature involve different\n\nfederalism concerns than intra-state entities.   Several objections\n\nmight be made to applying Hess here.   The presumption announced in\n\nHess may be limited to multi-state entities.      It might also be\n\nthought that the two-step Hess analysis applies only to multi-state\n\nCompact Clause entities, and so not to a public corporation formed\n\nby the Commonwealth alone. Or it might be thought, more generally,\n\nthat Hess is inconsistent with later Eleventh Amendment case law,\n\nand so should not be taken as establishing doctrine controlling\n\nnow.\n\n           Hess itself noted there was reason to treat Compact\n\nClause entities somewhat differently.    513 U.S. at 42 (\"There is\n\ngood reason not to amalgamate Compact Clause entities with agencies\n\nof one of the United States for Eleventh Amendment purposes.\")\n\n(internal quotation omitted); accord Hadley v.

As a result, we think the presumption announced\n\nin Hess -- a presumption against an entity being an arm of the\n\nstate -- applies only to Compact Clause entities, and the logic of\n\nit does not extend to the two other categories of cases.\n\n            We conclude, however, that the two-step analysis of Hess\n\nis not limited to Compact Clause entities. Several reasons support\n\nthis conclusion.          First, Hess is founded on the twin reasons\n\nunderlying the Eleventh Amendment, reasons common to all categories\n\nof cases.    Further, the Hess court cited Metcalf & Eddy, which did\n\nnot involve a multi-state Compact Clause entity, among cases\n\nsupporting the point that \"the vulnerability of the State's purse\n\n[is] the most salient factor in Eleventh Amendment determinations.\"\n\nHess, 513 U.S. at 48.            Hess also cited cases from four other\n\ncircuits adhering to that principle when the entities involved\n\nincluded intra-state authorities, as well as political subdivisions\n\nand bi-state entities.          Id. at 48-49.    There is no indication the\n\ncourt intended to differentiate in the application of its major\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\ftests depending on the nature of the entity.   Thus, Metcalf & Eddy\n\nforeshadowed Hess's determination that when there is ambiguity from\n\nthe structure about whether an entity is an arm of the state, the\n\nprimary focus is on the risk to the state treasury.\n\n          Next, the circuits have also viewed Hess as applying to\n\npolitical subdivision and intra-state corporation cases.

Hess's emphasis on protection of\n\nthe state fisc as a primary component of an arm-of-the-state\n\nanalysis has been criticized as not entirely consistent with the\n\nbroader Eleventh Amendment interests established by other and later\n\ncases.       See   C.M.   Vazquez,   What   Is   Eleventh   Amendment\n\nImmunity?, 106 Yale L.J. 1683, 1731-32 (1997); see also Thiel,\n\n94 F.3d at 401-02.\n\n             One response would be that Hess was concerned with an\n\nentirely different problem. Seminole and its progeny are addressed\n\nto what protection is given the state by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nHess is concerned with who is entitled to share that protection.\n\nWhen the state has not made it clear through structure that an\n\nentity is to share its immunity, there is reason not to reach a\n\n\n\n     10\n       In Regents of the University of California v. Doe, the Court\nsaid generally:\n\n     Of course, the question of whether a money judgment against a\n     state instrumentality or official would be enforceable against\n     the State is of considerable importance to any evaluation of\n     the relationship between the State and the entity being sued.\n\n519 U.S. at 430.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fresult inconsistent with what the state has apparently hoped to\n\neffectuate (that is, an independent entity) unless there is a risk\n\nto the state fisc.\n\n           Another response would be that Seminole and its progeny\n\naffirm the longstanding view, operationalized in Hess, that the\n\nEleventh   Amendment   exists   to    protect   the   fiscal   and   dignity\n\ninterests of the state.   Seminole, 517 U.S. at 58.       The first prong\n\nof Hess pays considerable deference to the dignity interests of the\n\nstate, focusing on both explicit and implicit indications that the\n\nstate sought to cloak an entity in its Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n           Finally, even were the criticism to have force, Hess\n\nbinds us and has not been overruled.        To the contrary, it has been\n\nconsistently cited by the Court.11          We must follow it until the\n\nSupreme Court decides otherwise.        State Oil Co. v.

We view Hess as involving two key questions, with many\n\nfactors instructive on each:\n\n               1.   Has the state clearly structured the entity to share\n\nits sovereignty?        This evaluation is undertaken12 in light of the\n\ndifferent factors described in Hess, Lake Country and Metcalf &\n\nEddy.\n\n               2.   If the factors assessed in analyzing the structure\n\npoint     in   different   directions,   then   the   dispositive   question\n\nconcerns the risk that the damages will be paid from the public\n\ntreasury.      This is the rule of Metcalf & Eddy, valid today as well.\n\n\n\n\n     12\n        Lest our focus on the structure created by the state be\nmisunderstood, whether an entity is entitled to partake of a\nstate's Eleventh Amendment immunity is a question of federal law,\nnot state law:\n\n               Ultimately, of course, the question whether a particular\n               state agency has the same kind of independent status as\n               a county or is instead an arm of the State, and therefore\n               \"one of the United States\" within the meaning of the\n               Eleventh Amendment, is a question of federal law. But\n               that federal question can be answered only after\n               considering the provisions of state law that define the\n               agency's character.\n\nRegents of the Univ. of Cal., 519 U.S. at 429 n.5. The Supreme\nCourt has adverted to state law, but has not defined what role it\nis to play. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 280. In Hess\nitself the majority declined to adopt the state court's\ncharacterization of the agency. See 513 U.S. at 45 (holding that\nthe Port Authority does not enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity\ndespite the fact that \"[s]tate courts . . . repeatedly have typed\nthe Port Authority an agency of the States rather than a municipal\nunit or local district\").\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fThis    analysis   focuses   on   whether   the   state   has   legally   or\n\npractically obligated itself to pay the entity's indebtedness.\n\n              The control asserted by the state is an important guide\n\nto the initial inquiry.      But where the evidence is that the state\n\ndid not structure the entity to put the state treasury at risk of\n\npaying the judgment, then the fact that the state appoints the\n\nmajority of the governing board of the agency does not itself lead\n\nto the conclusion that the entity is an arm of the state.\n\nB.     Application of Standards\n\n             We now apply these standards to the facts of this case.\n\nThere are no factual findings of disputed facts by the district\n\ncourt, as the issue was decided under Rules 56 and 12(b)(6).13\n\nPRCCCC does not claim that there were disputed facts requiring\n\nresolution by the trial court.         The parties do draw different\n\nconclusions from the undisputed financial records of PRCCCC.\n\nWe consider the facts from admissible evidence that are germane to\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's\n\nfavor.      Wojcik, 300 F.3d at 96.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n        We treat the Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion               raising\nPRCCCC's Eleventh Amendment defense as a motion for                summary\njudgment, since both parties presented and the court              did not\nexclude evidence outside the pleadings. Fed. R. Civ. P.           12(b).\n\n                                   -24-\n\f1.   Structuring of PRCCCC\n\na.   The Enabling Act\n\n             The enabling act that created PRCCCC, 24 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§§ 343-343k (2000), does not by its terms structure PRCCCC to be an\n\narm of the state.          In fact, it suggests exactly the opposite.          The\n\nact creates an \"entity which is independent and separate from any\n\nother      agency    or    instrumentality     of   the    Government   of     the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"              Id. § 343a.     Moreover, PRCCCC is\n\nexplicitly empowered to enter into contracts with the state,\n\nspecifically        the     Commonwealth's    Department     of    Health,     the\n\nUniversity      of        Puerto   Rico,     and    \"any   other    bodies      or\n\ninstrumentalities of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\"14                     Id. §\n\n434b(n).     Further, the act provides that PRCCCC may \"borrow\" money\n\nfrom the Commonwealth, id. § 343b(g), and that the Commonwealth\n\nwill charge it rent for use of its building, which \"shall help to\n\namortize the debt for a period of thirty (30) years,\" id. § 343g.\n\nThe Board is authorized to create a budget, which it must submit to\n\nthe legislature, but the budget is required to stay \"within the\n\nlimits of [PRCCCC's] estimated income so as to keep from incurring\n\n\n\n      14\n        In PRCCCC's favor is that it has been exempted from all\ntaxes and fees collected by the government of Puerto Rico and its\npolitical subdivisions.    Id. § 343e.   By like token, that very\nlanguage indicates it is not a political subdivision. In reference\nto PRCCCC's tax exempt status, FMC executive Watson observes that\nmany of the private hospitals he has dealt with are also exempt\nfrom local taxes and duties.\n\n                                       -25-\n\fshortfalls.\"     Id. § 343h.   Importantly, the act does not say the\n\ntreasury of the Commonwealth will pay for those shortfalls.15\n\n           Nonetheless, in PRCCCC's favor, the act does not contain\n\nlanguage declaring that the Commonwealth is not responsible for\n\nPRCCCC's debt, as was true of the statutory schemes in Metcalf &\n\nEddy, see 991 F.2d at 940, and Royal Caribbean Corp. v. Puerto Rico\n\nPorts Authority, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589642\"><a href=\"/opinion/589642/royal-caribbean-corp-and-caribbean-cruise-line-ltd-v-puerto-rico-ports/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1st Cir. 1992).     In that sense,\n\nthis is a closer case.\n\nb.   Other State Statutes\n\n          PRCCCC relies on statutes outside its own enabling act to\n\nargue that it is an arm of the state.    It points to the definition\n\nof public funds set forth in 33 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3022(11), (14),\n\nwhich provide:\n\n          (11) Commonwealth of Puerto Rico -- Comprises its\n          municipalities, agencies, public corporations, political\n          subdivisions and other dependencies or instrumentalities.\n\n           (14) Public funds or public treasury -- Means all bonds\n           or liabilities and evidences of indebtedness and all\n           moneys belonging to the Government of the Commonwealth of\n           Puerto Rico, the municipalities, agencies, public,\n           municipal and state corporations, political subdivisions\n\n\n     15\n       Interestingly, PRCCCC's own evidence showed that one of\nthe purposes of creating the public corporation was that\npublic funds allocated to the hospital \"could be insulated\nfrom the budgetary constraints the [Commonwealth's] Health\nDepartment always had.\"    Another purpose was to serve as\n\"justification to 'privatize' the health system.\" These are\nalso indicia that the Commonwealth wanted PRCCCC to be at\narm's length, not to be an arm of the state.\n\n                                 -26-\n\f            and other dependencies, and all moneys, securities, bonds\n            and evidences of indebtedness received and kept by\n            officials or employees of the aforementioned entities, in\n            their official character.\n\nWe reject for four reasons the contention that this definition of\n\npublic    funds   is   a   statement   that   all   \"public   corporations\"\n\nestablished by Puerto Rico are arms of the state.               First, the\n\ndefinitions are explicitly limited to the subtitle in which they\n\nappear, a part of the Penal Code of Puerto Rico.          See id. § 3022.\n\nSecond, when Puerto Rico has chosen to make an entity an arm of the\n\nstate, it has used other language.             For example, the Medical\n\nServices Administration (MSA), another health care entity created\n\nby the Commonwealth,16 was \"created as an instrumentality of the\n\nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, attached to the\n\nCommonwealth Department of Health . . . under the direction and\n\nsupervision of the Secretary of Health.\"        24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 342b;\n\nsee Rodriguez Diaz v.

Third, it is a maxim of statutory construction that\n\nthe more specific statute, here PRCCCC's enabling act, governs over\n\nthe more general, such as the definitions in § 3022.             See In re\n\n\n     16\n       PRCCCC witness Zapata asserts claims that the structure of\nthe PRCCCC is \"similar, if not identical\" to that of the public\nmedical center known (in English) as the Medical Services\nAdministration (MSA).     This is untrue, as discussed above.\nFurthermore, unlike the PRCCCC enabling legislation, see 24 P.R.\nLaws Ann. §§ 343-343k, the MSA enabling legislation provides that\ncivil litigants against the MSA are subject to the cap on recovery\nestablished under the Commonwealth's state sovereign immunity, 24\nP.R.

Fourth, such a\n\nconstruction would be inconsistent with a number of our cases\n\nfinding various public authorities and corporations created by\n\nPuerto Rico not to be arms of the state.      See, e.g., Metcalf &\n\nEddy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605529\"><a href=\"/opinion/605529/metcalf-eddy-inc-v-puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Royal Carribean Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589642\"><a href=\"/opinion/589642/royal-caribbean-corp-and-caribbean-cruise-line-ltd-v-puerto-rico-ports/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Breyer,\n\nC.J.).\n\nc.   State Court Decisions\n\n           Apart from the statutory schemes, we consider how the\n\nstate courts have treated PRCCCC.      The Supreme Court has found\n\nstate court decisions a useful resource.   See Hess, 513 U.S. at 45;\n\nMoor, 411 U.S. at 720-721.     PRCCCC has not provided us with a\n\nsingle opinion from a court of Puerto Rico holding that PRCCCC is\n\npart of the government of Puerto Rico, or, for that matter, that\n\nthe Commonwealth will stand behind PRCCCC's debt.17    It is PRCCCC's\n\nburden to do so.

The Penal Code's definition of a public employee,\n\nwhich is expressly limited to the subtitle in which it appears, see\n\n\n\n      17\n        PRCCCC refers to a 1987 opinion by the Attorney\nGeneral; we do not read that opinion as supporting PRCCCC even\nassuming, dubitante, that it has some authoritative value.\n\n                                -28-\n\f33 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3022, includes persons working for municipal\n\nand local government bodies and other entities that do not enjoy\n\nEleventh Amendment immunity, see id. § 3022(16).              Meanwhile, other\n\nstatutory definitions of public employee seem to exclude PRCCCC\n\nemployees.        See, e.g., 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 729c(b) (chapter on\n\ncompensation and benefits of government personnel adopts definition\n\nof employee that specifically excludes \"the officials and employees\n\nof the public corporations and of the University of Puerto Rico\").\n\nd.   Functions of PRCCCC\n\n            PRCCCC       contends   that   its   functions    are    those   of   a\n\ngovernment.       If true, that would assist its structural argument.\n\nPRCCCC points to no judicial authority to support its proposition.\n\nInstead, it offers three arguments.\n\n            First,       Zapata   contends    that   PRCCCC   is    an   essential\n\ncomponent    of    the    Commonwealth's      strategy   to   comply     with   its\n\nobligation, under the Constitution of Puerto Rico, Article II,\n\nSection 20, to provide health care to indigent residents.                         It\n\nappears Section 20 is not binding. The Constitution of Puerto Rico\n\nhad to be approved by the U.S. Congress before going into effect.\n\nFigueroa v.

Furthermore, Article II, Section 20\n\nappears to have been intended as an aspirational statement, modeled\n\n                                       -29-\n\fon language in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, rather\n\nthan as a basis for legal obligations.            The Section enumerates a\n\nlist of human rights including the right to work, the right to an\n\nadequate standard of living, and the right to medical care; it then\n\nstates, \"The rights set forth in this section . . . require, for\n\ntheir full effectiveness, sufficient resources and an agricultural\n\nand industrial development not yet attained by the Puerto Rican\n\ncommunity.\"    (emphasis added).\n\n           Second, PRCCCC's enabling legislation says that it will\n\nbe responsible for public policy relating to the provision of\n\ncardiovascular services in Puerto Rico.           24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 343b.\n\nPRCCCC presents no evidence indicating that it has helped set\n\npolicies applicable     to   other      facilities      in   Puerto   Rico.    It\n\nacknowledges, moreover, that since the Commonwealth carried out a\n\nmajor health reform in 1993, PRCCCC has competed with private\n\nhospitals for legislative appropriations and other pubic funds\n\nallocated for cardiovascular surgery.18              This reform presumably\n\ndiminished any policymaking function of PRCCCC.\n\n           Third, Zapata observes that PRCCCC's mission includes\n\ntraining   medical    students,      interns,     and    residents     from   the\n\nUniversity    of   Puerto   Rico   (a    public   university).         But    many\n\nhospitals unaffiliated with state governments (or the Commonwealth)\n\n\n     18\n       Further, Watson notes that PRCCCC functions with respect to\nits vendors like a private, rather than a government, hospital.\n\n                                     -30-\n\femploy   (and   train)   interns    and    residents   from   state   medical\n\nschools.\n\n           The provision of medical care, in our economy, is not\n\nprimarily a state function.        Even medical care for the poor is a\n\nresponsibility often imposed on private hospitals, through free\n\ncare pools,     Medicaid,   and    other    devices.    The   difficulty    of\n\ncontaining costs for these services may be exactly why Puerto Rico\n\nhas chosen in PRCCCC's enabling act not to make its treasury\n\naccountable for PRCCCC's debts.            That PRCCCC receives Medicaid\n\nfunding does not distinguish it from a private sector hospital,\n\neither not-for-profit or for-profit. A mosaic of medical providers\n\nserves the poor and the uninsured, and nothing about PRCCCC marks\n\nit as serving a uniquely governmental function.\n\ne.   Control by the State\n\n           PRCCCC also argues that it is subject to a fair degree of\n\ncontrol by the Commonwealth.       Under the enabling act, the Board is\n\ncomposed of seven members, three of whom are ex officio members and\n\nare high-ranking state officials.          33 P.R. Laws Ann. § 343(c).     The\n\ngovernor appoints the remaining four members to four-year terms.\n\nThe Secretary of Health of Puerto Rico is chairman of the Board.\n\nThe votes of four members are needed for action; thus the ex\n\nofficio members presumably vote.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -31-\n\f               The governor's appointment power over the board is not\n\nenough in itself to establish that PRCCCC is an arm of the state.\n\nSee Auer, 519 U.S. at 456 n.1.              The statute itself does not give\n\nthe governor power to remove Board members, and it is unclear where\n\nsuch power resides.19 Nor does the statute give the Commonwealth\n\nveto power over the decisions of the Board, a key element of\n\ncontrol.\n\n               In   her    statement,   Lúgaro   asserts     that   the   governor\n\nintervenes periodically in PRCCCC management and personnel issues.\n\nShe asserts that the Commonwealth's Comptroller audits PRCCCC. She\n\nalso    says    that      the   Executive   Director   and   other   key    PRCCCC\n\npersonnel have to file annual reports with the Government Ethics\n\nOffice.     These are indicia of control, but hardly determinative in\n\nview of the statutory structure.20\n\n\n\n\n       19\n       PRCCCC, which bears the burden of proof, offers only\ninadmissible hearsay evidence on this point. See Vazquez v.\nLopez-Rosario, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750689\"><a href=\"/opinion/750689/waldo-g-vazquez-v-carlos-lopez-rosario/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"Evidence that\nis inadmissible at trial, such as inadmissible hearsay, may\nnot be considered on summary judgment.\").\n       20\n        Even the view of the dissent in Hess on the importance of\ncontrol does not assist PRCCCC.     Though it does not propose a\nbright-line rule demarcating the level of control necessary to\nwarrant a finding that an entity is an arm of the state, the Hess\ndissent does observe that such a finding is warranted \"if the State\nappoints and removes an entity's governing personnel and retains\nveto or approval power over an entity's undertakings.\" Hess, 513\nU.S. at 61 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); see Brotherton v. Cleveland,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763232\"><a href=\"/opinion/763232/deborah-s-brotherton-individually-on-behalf-of-those-members-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 561 n.5 (6th Cir. 1999). Key elements of control,\nsuch as veto power, are absent here.\n\n                                        -32-\n\f          We cannot say the indicia all point in the direction of\n\nPRCCCC being an arm of the state and so reach the second stage of\n\nthe analysis.\n\n2.   Would the Commonwealth's Treasury Be Obligated to Pay a\nJudgment Against PRCCCC?\n\n          Our next inquiry is whether any judgment in this action\n\nwould be paid by the Commonwealth's treasury.     As Hess explained,\n\n\"If the expenditures of the enterprise exceed receipts, is the\n\nState in fact obligated to bear and pay the resulting indebtedness\n\nof the enterprise?    When the answer is 'No' -- both legally and\n\npractically -- then the Eleventh Amendment's core concern is not\n\nimplicated.\"    513 U.S. at 51.   Thus we examine two areas:   what is\n\nsaid by state law on the topic21 and what in fact has happened.\n\n          The enabling act does not, as we have said, make the\n\nCommonwealth liable for the debts of PRCCCC.      Still, it could be\n\nthat the Commonwealth has assumed that obligation in fact, either\n\ndirectly or indirectly, by providing virtually all the funds needed\n\nfor the operation of PRCCCC. The facts, discussed below, show that\n\nthe Commonwealth has not done that.      Rather, the Commonwealth has\n\n\n\n     21\n        Zapata states that the team of experts which advised the\nlegislature on the creation of PRCCCC concluded that sixty percent\nof the hospital's revenues would need to come from legislative\nappropriations.    If that is so, then the fact that PRCCCC's\nenabling legislation does not require the legislature to provide a\nfixed percentage (or other level) of support for PRCCCC is telling.\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fleft itself free to provide or not provide funds to PRCCCC as it\n\nsees fit, and it has not come close to obligating itself to assume\n\nthe burden of paying PRCCCC's debt.     The Commonwealth has provided\n\nfor PRCCCC to have independent sources of revenue and, indeed, the\n\nmajority of PRCCCC's funding now comes from sources other than the\n\nCommonwealth's treasury.\n\n            We start with the statutory scheme and consider two\n\nfactors:    the provisions as to funding of debts and any provisions\n\nfor raising revenues.      There are no provisions for funding of\n\nPRCCCC's debts, just an admonition in the enabling act that PRCCCC\n\nmust live within its means.     The legislative intent seems to be\n\nthat PRCCCC not incur debts that it cannot pay from budgeted sums.\n\nAs to revenue, the statutory scheme contemplates a number of\n\nsources of income.    The statute provides that PRCCCC may\n\n            1.     borrow money from any funding source, 24 P.R.\n                   Laws Ann. § 343b(g);\n            2.     sell its services to private entities, id. §\n                   343b(k);\n            3.     sell materials to private entities, id. §\n                   343b(m);\n            4.     request and accept federal, state, or other funds\n                   and grants, § 343b(o); and\n            5.     enter    with   others   into   a    corporation,\n                   partnership, joint venture, or association, id. §\n                   343b(r).\n\nIn addition, the statute provides that PRCCCC may issue bonds, id.\n\n§ 343k.    It is noteworthy that the Commonwealth is not a guarantor\n\non the bonds.\n\n                                 -34-\n\f           PRCCCC replies that the capacity to issue bonds and raise\n\nrevenues is a \"dead letter.\"    That is because private lenders will\n\nnot provide financing \"unless the Commonwealth funds are pledged as\n\nwarranty of payment through the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nWith an operating deficit that exceeds an [annual] average of $7\n\nmillion . . . PRCCCC does not have the credit that will enable it\n\nto borrow money and obtain loans, much less issue bonds.\"               Though\n\nrelevant, this evidence does not show that PRCCCC's debts would\n\nbecome the Commonwealth's.\n\n           PRCCCC   also   points    to    the   language    of   the     1986\n\nappropriations act, which provided PRCCCC with $500,000 in initial\n\nworking capital.    Act of June 30, 1986, No. 51, at p. 170, § 13,\n\nquoted in 24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 343, history.         The bill also said:\n\n           The funds needed in subsequent years to carry out the\n           purposes of this act [chapter] shall be consigned in the\n           General Expense Budget of the Government of Puerto Rico.\n\nId.   There are three responses to the argument.            First, this is\n\nlanguage in an appropriations act for a particular year. Such acts\n\nnormally expire within the year, and PRCCCC has not presented any\n\nargument that the language must be read to extend to all future\n\nyears.    See Minis v. United States, 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 423, 445\n\n(1841).    Second, this language was not put into the codified law\n\nenacted in 1986, nor has it been added since then.                Third, in\n\n\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fpractice the legislature did not consider itself bound by that\n\nlanguage in years after 1986.\n\n                 PRCCCC's other argument is that it is required to submit\n\nan   operating       expenses     and   capital    investments     budget    to   the\n\nlegislature.         24 P.R. Laws Ann. § 343h.          That alone does not show\n\nthat PRCCCC's debts will be paid by the Commonwealth; it is better\n\nread    as   imposing       discipline    meant    to    discourage    PRCCCC     from\n\nbuilding up unpaid debts.           There is, moreover, no evidence in the\n\nrecord (and the burden is on PRCCCC) that PRCCCC took any steps to\n\ncomply with this requirement before February 25, 2002, more than\n\nthree months after it formally asserted an Eleventh Amendment\n\ndefense to FMC's lawsuit.22\n\n                 We turn to what in practice has happened.            \"If the state\n\nsubstantially funds the entity, those funds would be a probable\n\nsource      to    satisfy   any   judgment      against   the    entity.     On    the\n\ncontrary, if the entity has taxing powers and can issue bonds,\n\nstate funds might not be at risk in litigation against the entity.\"\n\nMoore's, supra, § 123.23[4][b], at 123-57 to 123-58.\n\n                 PRCCCC   witness   Bustelo     states    that    PRCCCC    receives\n\nseveral types of financial support from government entities: (a)\n\nlegislative        appropriations;       (b)   reimbursements      from    insurance\n\n\n\n       22\n        On February 25, 2002, Lúgaro requested a legislative\nappropriation to pay the rent during FY 2001 and FY 2002 and cover\nthe rest of PRCCCC's deficit.\n\n                                         -36-\n\fcompanies linked to the Department of Health; (c) payments from the\n\nCity    of   San   Juan;   and    (d)   \"indirect   subsidies,\"     which   are\n\neffectively short-term loans, from public utilities and other\n\npublic corporations.           Because of PRCCCC's relationship to the\n\nstate, Bustelo contends, public corporations such as PRCCCC's\n\nlandlord have not initiated eviction proceedings or otherwise\n\ndenied services when PRCCCC's payments were late.\n\n             We start with the most recent history.            In FY 2001,\n\nPRCCCC received over $50 million in revenues.           It received nothing\n\nin legislative appropriations, although it was running a $12\n\nmillion deficit.        In FY 2002, it again received no legislative\n\nappropriation. Most of PRCCCC's revenues are from fees for patient\n\nservices     received   from     private   insurance   companies,   patients,\n\nMedicare, Medicaid, or the Commonwealth's public health system,23\n\njust as revenues come in to private hospitals in Puerto Rico.\n\nLooking back further, PRCCCC's legislative appropriations amounted\n\nto less than 14 percent of its total revenues from fiscal years\n\n1993 to 2001.\n\n\n\n\n       23\n        Although the Commonwealth participates in Medicare and\nMedicaid, it also has a separate public health system. Medicare is\na federally funded program overseen by part of the federal\ngovernment; Medicaid is a jointly funded federal-state program\noverseen by federal and state entities but usually administered at\nthe county level.    By contrast, the Commonwealth's own public\nhealth system receives no federal funding.\n\n                                        -37-\n\f           In   its   role   as   an    insurer,    the    Commonwealth      also\n\nreimbursed PRCCCC for particular medical procedures. Even counting\n\nthese reimbursements, the share of PRCCCC revenues coming from the\n\nPuerto Rico government between FY 1993 and 2001 was about 41\n\npercent.    These reimbursements were presumably made under the\n\nCommonwealth's public health system and the Medicaid program.\n\nSince private, for-profit hospitals receive these reimbursements as\n\na matter of course, it is doubtful whether they should be counted\n\nfor Eleventh Amendment purposes.          We do not count payments made by\n\nthe municipality of San Juan as revenue from the state treasury.\n\n           Overall, the share of funding provided by the legislature\n\nand by the Commonwealth as a whole has diminished sharply over\n\ntime.   In FY 1993 and 1994, the first two years for which figures\n\nare available, the legislature provided approximately 21 percent of\n\nPRCCCC's   revenues     by    appropriation.              Counting   insurance\n\nreimbursements as well as appropriations, the Commonwealth provided\n\nover 64 percent of PRCCCC's revenues during that period.                    In FY\n\n2000 and 2001, the last two years for which complete figures are\n\navailable, the legislature provided approximately 8 percent and the\n\nCommonwealth in toto provided approximately 26 percent of its\n\nrevenue. As noted above, the legislature provided no appropriation\n\nwhatsoever during FY 2001 or FY 2002.               The elimination of any\n\nlegislative     appropriations    presumably       reflects    the   fact    that\n\nPRCCCC's operational revenues -- that is, its fees from providing\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\fcardiovascular       medical     care      to     patients    --    increased    by\n\napproximately 400 percent between FY 1993 and FY 2001.\n\n            PRCCCC    argues    that    this      accounting      understates   the\n\nCommonwealth's       actual    contribution        to    PRCCCC    because   public\n\nutilities    and     other     allegedly         government-controlled       public\n\ncorporations have allowed PRCCCC to receive services without paying\n\nfor them.    The record refutes this argument.                Like virtually all\n\nbusinesses, PRCCCC has accounts payable: bills from suppliers for\n\ngoods and services purchased on credit.                 There is every indication\n\nthat, as a general practice, PRCCCC pays its accounts to public\n\nutilities and other public corporations.                   For example, Bustelo\n\nstated that the legislative appropriation has been used mainly to\n\npay PRCCCC's largest account payable: its debt to the Public\n\nHousing Administration (PHA), the state agency that owns its\n\nphysical plant.      PRCCCC has not shown that it has failed to pay any\n\ndebt, apart from its FY 2001 debt to the PHA, in a timely fashion.\n\nMoreover, the FY 2001 PHA debt was only unpaid as of March 2002,\n\nand accounts payable are typically due within 12 months.\n\n            Between    FY     1993   and    FY    2001,    PRCCCC's    operational\n\nexpenses exceeded its total revenues by approximately $18 million.\n\nThe income statement does not provide any detail on the hospital's\n\ndebt structure; nevertheless, there is no evidence distinguishing\n\nthis level of debt for an institution whose operational revenues\n\nnow exceed $50 million per year from private sector debt. PRCCCC's\n\n                                        -39-\n\foperational revenues have grown at a substantially steeper rate\n\nthan its operational expenses between FY 1993 and FY 2001.\n\n            The     fact    that    PRCCCC     receives    significant,      but\n\ndiminishing, state funding (now less than thirty percent counting\n\nall sources, including insurance) is simply not enough to enable it\n\nto claim Eleventh Amendment immunity.             Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at\n\n280. In the end, PRCCCC's argument is simply that a judgment would\n\ndeplete its operating funds, that the Commonwealth might choose to\n\nrescue it,    and    that   this    would    indirectly   deplete   the   state\n\ntreasury.    We rejected this very argument in Metcalf & Eddy, 991\n\nF.2d at 941, and do so here.\n\nC.
