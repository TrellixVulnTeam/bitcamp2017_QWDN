Sedney and Brody, Hardoon, Perkins & Kesten, LLP on\nbrief for appellees Fred Varone, Buildings Inspector, Kevin Nigro,\nBuildings Inspector, and Town of Saugus.\n\n\n\n                             December 20, 2002\n\f              Per   Curiam.       Safi    Kachmar     brought    this   action\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against                Kanaiyalal Patel (\"Ken\n\nPatel\"), Mujala Patel, the Town of Saugus, and two Saugus\n\nofficials, claiming due process and equal protection violations\n\nbased on allegations that defendants had \"ordered [him] to\n\nclose down his business . . . and [fined him] $1,000 per day.\"\n\nWe   concur    with   the     district    court's      conclusion   that     the\n\nallegations in the amended complaint fail to state a claim upon\n\nwhich relief can be granted.\n\n              Although Kachmar brought this action in his own name\n\nd/b/a Security & Communications Center (\"S & C\"), he concedes\n\nin his appellate brief that S & C was incorporated long before\n\nhe commenced the action and that Ken Patel was the sole\n\ndirector,      officer      and   shareholder         of   the   corporation.\n\nKachmar's     amended    complaint       does   not    allege    that   he   was\n\nauthorized to sue on the corporation's behalf and no such\n\nauthority is evident in any of the documents incorporated into\n\nthe complaint.        Kachmar therefore lacks standing to sue on\n\nbehalf of the corporation. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n\n504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).\n\n              Moreover, to the extent Kachmar's claims are based on\n\nthe town defendants' interpretation of the liquor license for\n\nthe commercial site Kachmar sought for S & C, Kachmar fails to\n\nallege any property interest in the license sufficient to\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\finvoke the district court's jurisdiction; to establish standing\n\nsufficient to maintain a federal claim, a plaintiff must\n\ndemonstrate    (1)       an    \"injury-in-fact\"           (2)    that     is   fairly\n\ntraceable\" to the proceeding below, and (3) is \"likely\" to be\n\n\"redressed by a favorable decision.\"                 Id.       Moreover, Kachmar's\n\nown allegations and the documents annexed to his complaint\n\nclearly show that Ken Patel was the holder of the license.\n\nAgain, Kachmar       fails      to    allege   an    invasion       of    a    legally\n\nprotected interest and is therefore without standing to pursue\n\nthis litigation.         Id.\n\n            In any event, Kachmar's claims are insufficient to\n\nstate a § 1983 claim.                 In the absence of a \"fundamental\n\nprocedural irregularity [or] racial animus,\" a conventional\n\nzoning dispute does not implicate constitutional concerns.\n\nCreative Environments, Inc. v. Estabrook, 680 F.2d 822, 833\n\n(1st Cir. 1982); Chongris v. Board of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 41-\n\n42   (1st   Cir.    1987).           Kachmar   has       not    alleged    any   such\n\nprocedural defect or animus.\n\n            We further note that Kachmar has failed to state a\n\nclaim against Ken and Mujala Patel for the additional reason\n\nthat neither of them is a state actor.                   Malachowski v. City of\n\nKeene, 787 F.2d 704, 710 (1st Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (\"It is\n\nblack-letter       law   that    a     showing      of    interference         with   a\n\nconstitutionally-protected right by someone acting under color\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fof state law is a prerequisite to a § 1983 action.\").   Finally,\n\nKachmar's claims against the Town of Saugus were also properly\n\ndismissed because the complaint did not allege that any policy\n\nor custom of the town was responsible for inflicting any of the\n\nclaimed injuries. See Burrell v. Hampshire County, 307 F.3d 1,\n\n10 (1st Cir. 2002); Kelley v. LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n          Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n\nsummarily affirmed.   See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                              -4-\n\f",
