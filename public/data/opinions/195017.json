For more than thirty years,\n                              \n\nNew  England employees of United Parcel Service (\"UPS\") have\n\nparticipated  in the  New  England  Teamsters  and  Trucking\n\nIndustry  Pension Fund (the  \"Teamsters Pension Fund\").   In\n\n1986,  a group  of  those employees  decided they  wanted to\n\nleave  the  Teamsters  Pension Fund.    They  hoped (through\n\ncollective bargaining) to secure their employer's assistance\n\nin setting up a separate  pension fund covering only UPS New\n\nEngland employees.  \n\n          The employees failed to  bring about the  creation\n\nof a separate  fund.  And, they blame  the Teamsters Pension\n\nFund trustees for that failure.  In particular, they believe\n\nthat the trustees have thwarted their efforts to negotiate a\n\nplan  switch, not through direct opposition, but by refusing\n\nto permit a transfer of any Teamsters Pension Fund assets to\n\nany  new pension fund  that they,  together with  UPS, might\n\ncreate.   They brought  this lawsuit  against the  trustees,\n\nclaiming,  in relevant part,  that the trustees'  refusal to\n\ntransfer  assets violates  various  laws, including  certain\n\nprovisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n\n1974 (ERISA).  See 29 U.S.C.    1104(a)(1), 1414(a).\n                  \n\n          After a  trial, the  district court  found in  the\n\ntrustees' favor.   The employees now appeal.   They argue in\n\nessence  that  the  trustees, in  refusing  to  transfer any\n\nassets to a newly created  fund, have violated the fiduciary\n\nobligations that  ERISA imposes upon  them.  We can  find no\n\nsuch violation, however; and, we  affirm the judgment in the\n\ntrustees' favor.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n                             A\n\n                 The Teamsters Pension Fund\n                                           \n\n          The  large, multiemployer  Teamsters Pension  Fund\n\npools  contributions from  nearly two  thousand New  England\n\nfirms.   Eight trustees  (four Teamster  representatives and\n\nfour  employer representatives)  manage the  fund, investing\n\nthe pooled money  and paying guaranteed monthly  benefits to\n\nemployees  who  retire.    We  have  read  the  record  with\n\nconsiderable care to  try to understand, from  the testimony\n\nand documents,  as well  as the  briefs,  how the  Teamsters\n\nPension  Fund  works.   Based  on our  understanding  of the\n\nrecord, we describe its significant features as follows.\n\n          First,  employers contribute to the fund at a rate\n\nthat, in 1986, varied, among employers, between 36 cents and\n\n$1.66 per employee  working hour.  The  precise rate depends\n\nupon  the  results  of local  collective  bargaining.   Each\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nemployer pays the collective-bargained hourly rate for every\n                                                            \n\nhour  that  any  employee works,  whether  the  employee who\n               \n\nperforms the  work is young or old,  part-time or full-time,\n\ntemporary or long-term.\n\n          Second,  a retiring  employee  receives a  pension\n\nbenefit  in  an amount  defined  by a  schedule  that varies\n\nbenefits  depending primarily upon  the employee's length of\n\nservice  and upon his, or her, employer's contribution rate.\n\nThe schedule thus pays the  same pension to two retirees who\n\nhave worked for  the same number of years  for employers who\n\ncontribute  at the  same rate.    In 1986,  for example,  an\n\nemployee  who worked for  twenty-five years for  an employer\n\nwho contributed  $1.66 per hour  (UPS' actual rate  in 1986)\n\nwould  receive a  pension of  $900 per  month.   The benefit\n\nschedule  imposes a minimum length  of service (ten years as\n\nof 1986, lowered  to five in 1990); no  employee is entitled\n\nto  any pension  benefits until  he has worked  the minimum,\n\ni.e., until his Fund  benefits have \"vested.\"   The schedule\n\nappears to set a maximum  length of service as well (twenty-\n\nfive or thirty years, depending on retirement age).  Once an\n\nemployee  works the maximum number of years, additional work\n\ndone does not entitle him to any additional benefit.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          It is  important to understand  that the Teamsters\n\nPension  Fund (like most \"defined benefit\" pension plans and\n\nunlike  \"defined contribution\" plans  such as those  of many\n\nuniversity employees)  does not guarantee any  employee that\n                               \n\nhe  will receive  a  pension that  exactly reflects  all the\n                                          \n\ncontributions  made  on behalf  of that  particular employee\n                                                            \n\nover the years  (plus the investment income  associated with\n\nthose contributions).  As  we have just said, an  individual\n\nemployee who works  more than  the maximum  number of  years\n\nloses the benefit  of some contributions made in  respect to\n\nsome of  his work  hours.  More  important, an  employee who\n\nleaves  covered employment  before  his  Fund benefits  vest\n\nloses the  benefit of all  contributions made in  respect to\n                         \n\nhis work.  Less obviously, employees who are young also lose\n\nthe benefit of some contributions.  For example, an employee\n\nwho  works a certain  number of years,  say fifteen, between\n\nthe ages of forty  and fifty-five (and then quits)  receives\n\nno more upon his  retirement at sixty-five than  an employee\n\nwho works the  same fifteen years between the  ages of fifty\n\nand sixty-five; yet the contributions  made on behalf of the\n\nfirst employee  are likely more valuable, for  they have had\n\nmore time to accrue investment income before retirement age.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n          This  lack of  a  perfect fit  between  individual\n\ncontributions   and   individual    benefits   may   reflect\n\nadministrative considerations.  It may, for example, reflect\n\na judgment  not to  create discrepancies  in benefit  levels\n               \n\nthat turn solely upon the relation between investment market\n\nperformance and the time that  an individual's contributions\n\nare made.  But, the  most important reason for the imperfect\n\nfit,  as the  Ninth Circuit  has  pointed out,  is that  the\n\n\"excess\"  contributions made in respect to some workers help\n\nto assure that all workers  (who work a reasonable number of\n                  \n\nyears)  will  have a  decent  pension.   \"A  modern  defined\n\nbenefit pension plan pools contributions for all workers . .\n\n. to  provide reasonable  pensions for  workers who  satisfy\n\nreasonable eligibility  standards.  The  formula necessarily\n\nassumes  [inter alia]  that the  pensions  of a  significant\n                    \n\nnumber  of employees may  never vest.\"   Phillips  v. Alaska\n                                                            \n\nHotel and Restaurant  Employees Pension Fund, 944  F.2d 509,\n                                            \n\n517 (9th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 112 S.\n                                                    \n\nCt. 1942  (1992); see  also Local 144  Nursing Home  Pension\n                                                            \n\nFund v. Demisay, 113 S.  Ct. 2252, 2260 (1993) (Stevens, J.,\n               \n\nconcurring) (\"That  some  portion of  [some defined  benefit\n\nplan employees']  contributions will go  to benefit  [other]\n\nemployees  .  .  .  is,  of  course,  in  the  nature  of  a\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\nmultiemployer  plan.   Such  plans  .  .  . pool[]  employer\n\ncontributions for  the joint  benefit  of all  participating\n\nemployees.\").  \n\n          At  the same time,  the plan retains  an important\n\nconnection between  an individual's  contributions and  that\n\nindividual's benefits.   By tying benefit levels to years of\n\nservice and  employer  contribution rates,  the  Fund  still\n\nensures that those employees who do not get the full benefit\n\nof  contributions  made on  their  behalf get  much  of that\n                                                   \n\nbenefit (at least if their pension rights have vested).\n\n          Third,   the   Teamsters   Pension   Fund   is   a\n\nmultiemployer plan.   The  fact that  it is  \"multiemployer\"\n\nmeans  the fund  is large,  thereby  permitting trustees  to\n\ndiversify investment risks and also lowering  administrative\n\ncosts   per   pension  dollar.      Moreover,  multiemployer\n\n\"reciprocity\"   permits  a  worker  to  change  jobs,  among\n\nparticipating employers,  without losing the benefit of past\n\ncontributions.\n\n          Finally,  the Teamsters  Pension  Fund contains  a\n\nspecial feature  -- a \"no asset  transfer\" rule -- which the\n\nUPS employees now challenge.  That rule says:\n\n          If any employee or group of employees  .\n          . .  shall cease  to be  covered by  the\n          Fund  for  any reason  whatsoever,  they\n          shall  not be  entitled  to receive  any\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          assets  of the  Fund or  portion thereof\n          nor shall the Trustees  be authorized to\n          make any transfer of assets on behalf of\n          such employees.\n\nNew  England Teamsters and  Trucking Industry  Pension Fund,\n\nAgreement and Declaration  of Trust, Article XII,  section 9\n\n(1958).   According to the trustees, this seemingly absolute\n\nprohibition  is  modified  by  the  Trust  Agreement's  next\n\nsection.   That section  requires the trustees  to interpret\n\nand apply the Agreement\n\n          so  as to be in full compliance with all\n          applicable provisions of  law, including\n          the Employee Retirement  Income Security\n          Act of 1974, as amended.\n\nNew England  Teamsters and  Trucking Industry  Pension Fund,\n\nRestated Agreement and  Declaration of  Trust, Article  XII,\n\nsection 10 (1982).\n\n                             B\n\n                         This Case\n                                  \n\n          In 1986,  a group  of UPS  employees learned  that\n\nthey  could dramatically improve the level of their pensions\n\nwere  they, with UPS, to withdraw from the Teamsters Pension\n\nFund and  create their  own single-employer  plan.   That is\n\nbecause, as confirmed in the findings of the district court,\n\nUPS  employs a relatively large number of temporary workers,\n\nfor whom the company contributes for every hour  worked, but\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nwho leave  the New  England trucking  industry before  their\n\npensions  vest.   The UPS  workforce also  includes a  large\n\npercentage  of younger  workers.   Thus,  UPS' contributions\n\nmade  on  behalf  of its  employees  contain  a higher-than-\n\naverage  amount of  \"excess\" contributions.   The  Teamsters\n\nPension  Fund,  being  a  multi-employer fund,  spreads  the\n\nbenefits of such excess contributions among all participants\n\nin the Fund.   In a single-employer plan,  the UPS employees\n\nrealized, they would not  have to share their  \"excess\" with\n\nothers.   And unshared, UPS' $1.66 per hour contribution, as\n                      \n\nof 1986, could  buy pensions of $2600 per  month (instead of\n\n$900  per  month) for  UPS  employees who  retired  from UPS\n\nservice after twenty-five  years.  Alternatively, UPS,  in a\n\nsingle-employer  plan, could fund the $900 per month pension\n\nfor employees retiring after 25 years with a contribution of\n\nless  than 70 cents  (rather than $1.66)  for every employee\n\nhour worked.\n\n          The UPS  employees' brief  explains what  happened\n\nafter  they learned of  the potential benefits  of a single-\n\nemployer plan:   \"In an  effort to remedy  their inequitable\n\ntreatment  within the Teamsters  Fund, the  UPS Participants\n\nrepeatedly  petitioned  their  union  leaders  to  negotiate\n\n[through  collective bargaining  with UPS management]  for a\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nseparate pension plan on their behalf\" -- a plan, the record\n\nindicates,  that  the  employees  assumed  would  involve  a\n\ntransfer  of some portion  of Teamsters Pension  Fund assets\n\nand liabilities to  the new fund.   \"However,\" the employees\n\nadd,  \"the UPS Participants' efforts to negotiate a separate\n\nUPS pension  plan [were]  thwarted by  the provision in  the\n\nTeamster   Fund's  governing   documents  which   absolutely\n\nprohibits  any  transfer of  assets  .  . .  .\"   Brief  for\n\nPlaintiffs-Appellants at 10.\n\n          \"Thwarted\" in  their efforts  to take assets  from\n\nthe  Teamsters Pension  Fund, and  thereby,  in their  view,\n\n\"thwarted\" in their efforts to bring about the creation of a\n\nnew fund, the UPS employees filed suit against the trustees.\n\nThey asked  the court  either (1) to  order the  trustees to\n\ncreate special  benefit levels within  the Teamsters Pension\n\nFund for UPS participants (to  reflect, in whole or in part,\n\ntheir  favorable actuarial  status), or  (2)  to loosen  the\n\nprohibition  on asset  transfers,  thereby,  in their  view,\n\nmaking it possible for them  to negotiate a plan switch with\n\nUPS management.   They argued that the  trustees' failure to\n\ndo one or the other violated various provisions of the Labor\n\nManagement Relations  Act (LMRA), 29  U.S.C.   141  et seq.,\n                                                           \n\nand of ERISA.   As we have said, after a trial, the district\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\ncourt  entered judgment for the trustees.  The employees now\n\nappeal that judgment.\n\n          The UPS employees have  simplified their claims on\n\nappeal.  They have abandoned their demand that  the trustees\n\ncreate  a special  level of  benefits  within the  Teamsters\n\nPension Fund.  They focus  instead upon the trustees'  rule-\n\nbased refusal to permit any transfer of assets to a new UPS-\n\nonly fund.\n\n          The  passage of  time  has  also  simplified  this\n\nappeal.  The Supreme Court has recently decided a case which\n\nwe awaited  before deciding  this appeal,  namely Local  144\n                                                            \n\nNursing  Home  Pension Fund  v.  Demisay,  113 S.  Ct.  2252\n                                        \n\n(1993).   Demisay involved  LMRA- and ERISA-based challenges\n                 \n\nto  a refusal, by trustees  of a multiemployer pension plan,\n\nto transfer  assets to another  plan.  In its  decision, the\n\nCourt  barred   the  LMRA-based  claims   on  jurisdictional\n\ngrounds, but it remanded  (without deciding) the ERISA-based\n\nclaims.   As a  result of that  decision, the  UPS employees\n\nconcede that they  \"can no longer pursue a  claim for relief\n\nunder [the applicable section of] the LMRA.\"\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n          The  UPS  employees  now  pursue  their  remaining\n\nclaim, namely  that  the  trustees'  rule-based  refusal  to\n\ntransfer assets violates ERISA.\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n                             II\n\n                          Standing\n                                  \n\n          We  begin with  the trustees'  assertion  that the\n\nemployees  lack standing.   They concede that  the employees\n\nmay  bring an  ERISA  action if  they  have been  \"adversely\n\naffected by the  act or  omission of  any party .  . .  with\n\nrespect to  a  multiemployer plan.\"   29  U.S.C.    1451(a).\n\nThey  claim, however,  that  the  employees  have  not  been\n\n\"adversely  affected\"  by  the  asset  transfer  prohibition\n\nprincipally   because,   in   the   trustees'   view,   \"UPS\n\nparticipants  could  receive  the same  level  of  [pension]\n\nbenefits  with or  without a  transfer  of assets  to a  new\n                          \n\nsingle-employer fund.\"  Brief for Defendants-Appellees at 34\n\n(emphasis  added).  Insofar  as we understand  this somewhat\n\ncounter-intuitive argument, we cannot agree with it. \n\n          In   evaluating  the   argument,   we  have   kept\n\nseparately  in mind two  different groups of  UPS employees.\n\nIn the first group are those employees who, were a switch to\n\noccur,  would not yet have any vested Teamsters Pension Fund\n                                     \n\nrights but who will keep working for several years after the\n\nswitch (e.g., a UPS employee  who worked, say, four years at\n\nthe time of the  switch, and continues to work for more than\n\nan additional year).  Both  sides agree that a new, UPS-only\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\npension plan  would need  to give these  employees (whom  we\n\nshall call \"not-yet-vested employees\") full credit for their\n\npast years of  Teamsters-Pension-Fund-related service (e.g.,\n\nthe plan  would need  to give  the four-year  employee fully\n\nvested,  five-year, rights after one more additional year of\n\nwork).  Everyone  also agrees, however,  that the \"no  asset\n\ntransfer\" rule means that the new fund would be left without\n\nany  assets to  pay for  these  past service  credits.   The\n   \n\nemployees'  counsel   estimates  the   \"loss   of  the   UPS\n\nParticipants'  unvested benefits\" (which we take to mean the\n\ncost  of these  past service  credits)  at approximately  $5\n\nmillion.  Brief  for Plaintiffs-Appellants at  10 n.1.   The\n\ntrustees' figures, if  anything, appear to place  the figure\n\nhigher. \n\n          In  the second group are those employees who, were\n\na switch  to  occur, would  already have  vested rights  (we\n                                   \n\nshall  call  them  \"already-vested  employees\").    Everyone\n\nagrees  that a  new, UPS-only  fund  would not  have to  pay\n                                              \n\npensions  reflecting  the  past years  of  service  of these\n\nalready-vested  employees, for  those  pension rights  would\n                                     \n\nremain the  legal  responsibility of  the Teamsters  Pension\n\nFund. (In practice,  the old fund pays  supplemental pension\n\nbenefits directly to the employee after retiring.)   Since a\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nnew fund  would not  have to pay  for these  employees' past\n\nyears of service, it  would not need assets to  help it make\n\nany  such  payments.   And,  thus,  the  new fund  would  be\n\nsomewhat  indifferent to the  presence of the  trustees' \"no\n\nasset transfer\" rule.   The employees recognize  this point,\n\nwhich is why they suggest they would ultimately ask only for\n\nthe approximately $5 million --  or some portion thereof  --\n\nthey claim it  would cost to pay the past service credits of\n\nthe not-yet-vested employees.\n                  \n\n          With this distinction  in mind, we have  turned to\n\nthe  trustees' \"no standing\" argument.  The argument depends\n\nupon a table  (entitled \"Transfer of Assets  and Liabilities\n\nVs. No Transfer -- Hancock  Numbers\") that seems designed to\n\nshow   that,  if  asset   transfers  were  permissible,  the\n\nfollowing would  occur: (1)  the new  fund would assume  all\n\npension liability for  the already-vested employees;  (2) it\n                                         \n\nwould  obtain assets  from the  old  fund to  help pay  that\n\n(already-vested employee)  liability; but,  (3) for  reasons\n\nhaving  to do with  the inadequate funding  of the Teamsters\n\nPension Fund as  a whole, these assets would  fall far short\n\nof  the  amount   needed  to  pay  for   the  already-vested\n\nemployees; (4) the  asset shortfall (in respect  to already-\n\nvested  employees) would more  than outweigh any  benefit to\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nthe new fund through its  obtaining a share of the (roughly)\n\n$5  million of  assets  in  respect  to  the  not-yet-vested\n                                                            \n\nemployees'  pensions;   (5)  the   rules  related  to   UPS'\n\n\"withdrawal liability\" (a  complicated statutory requirement\n\nthat employers  who leave a  multiemployer plan  pay a  fair\n\nshare of the fund's overall deficit) would then somehow even\n\nthings out,  so that UPS  would be neither better  nor worse\n\noff with a transfer of assets than without one.\n\n          The  problem  with  the table  is  that  we cannot\n\nunderstand the   reasoning that underlies it.   The trustees\n\nnowhere explain why a new  fund could not request a transfer\n\nonly  of  assets  related to  not-yet-vested  benefits  (and\n    \n\nsimply  not   bother  with   a  transfer   of  assets,   and\n\nliabilities,  related to vested benefits).   And, so long as\n\nthe  employees limit their request  in this, or some similar\n\nway, it  seems plain to us that a rule blocking the transfer\n\nof any  assets means a  poorer fund.  We  assume, therefore,\n\nthat the employees  have standing,  and we  proceed on  that\n\nbasis.\n\n                            III\n\n             Fiduciary Obligations Under ERISA\n                                              \n\n     The UPS employees' basic argument is that the trustees,\n\nin maintaining a \"no asset transfer\" rule, have violated the\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nfiduciary obligations that  ERISA imposes upon them.   Those\n\nobligations are \"strict.\"   NLRB v. Amax Coal  Co., 453 U.S.\n                                                  \n\n322, 332  (1981).

At  the same  time, where,  as here,\n\nthere is no claim of trustee self-dealing or the like, we do\n\nnot simply substitute our judgment for that of the trustees.\n\nWe review the trustees' decision at a distance.

In reaching this conclusion, we have considered\n\ntwo possible arguments.  The first (implicit in much of what\n\nthe UPS  employees say) is  that the Teamsters  Pension Fund\n\nhas treated them  unfairly while they  have remained in  the\n\nFund by not giving them  higher pension benefits than  other\n\nemployee    groups    with    less    favorable    actuarial\n\ncharacteristics.  On this view, the sole fact that they were\n\nearning (as  of 1986)  a $900 pension  when they  could have\n                                                       \n\nbeen earning a $2600 pension had the  Fund treated them as a\n\nseparate actuarial group demonstrates this unfairness.  And,\n\narguably,  this  \"unfair\"  treatment warrants  some  special\n\ntransfer of assets should they leave the Fund.\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\n          The  problem  with  this  argument  is  that   the\n\ndiscrepancy  between $900  and $2600  does  not, by  itself,\n                                               \n\nindicate  that   the  Teamsters  Pension  Fund  treated  the\n\nemployees unfairly (and  nor have the employees  offered any\n\nother evidence of  unfair treatment while in the  Fund).  As\n\ndiscussed above, see supra pp.  6-7, multiemployer, defined-\n                          \n\nbenefit pension  funds  provide their  participants a  whole\n\ncluster  of  benefits,  most  notably,  a  guaranteed decent\n\npension for all  longtime workers.   And  as also  discussed\n\nabove, such  funds do  this largely  by collecting  \"excess\"\n\ncontributions in respect\n\nto  certain kinds  of employees  such  as temporary  workers\n\n(whose  benefits  never  vest),  young workers,  and  super-\n\nlongterm   employees,   and   by   sharing   these    excess\n\ncontributions  with all the employees  in the fund, not just\n                       \n\nwith  the  employees  of  employers  who  paid  the  excess.\n\nAccordingly,  a  basic  objective of  these  funds  would be\n\nundermined  if  every employee  group (such  as UPS)  with a\n\ndisproportionate  share of  excess contributions  (and there\n\nmay be many others) wanted special pension levels to reflect\n\nthat fact.  It is thus no coincidence that, according to the\n\nfindings of the  district court, no other  regional Teamster\n\npension  fund  provides  special  benefits  for  actuarially\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nfavorable employee groups, and only one non-Teamster fund in\n\nthe entire country does so.\n\n          In  short, UPS and  its employees could  have quit\n\nthe Teamsters Pension Fund at any time, but so  long as they\n\nstayed  --  and  enjoyed   the  guaranteed,  mobile  pension\n\nbenefits  the Fund provides -- there seems nothing obviously\n\nunfair in denying them special (e.g., $2600)  benefits.  The\n\nUPS employees, by abandoning on appeal their demand for such\n\nbenefits, seem,  in effect, to  concede the point.   (We add\n\nthat, on appeal, the UPS employees also seem to suggest that\n\na new  fund would  not be  entitled to  an amount of  assets\n\nanywhere near as large as  the amount that would reflect the\n\nUPS employees' \"excess\" contribution.) \n\n          The  second basic argument  that the trustees have\n\nacted arbitrarily focuses  on the \"no  transfer\" rule.   The\n\nemployees argue that if they quit the Teamsters Pension Fund\n\n(because they no longer, in  the future, want to share their\n\nexcess  contributions),  the  rule would  prevent  them,  as\n\nexplained  in  the  standing section,  supra  Part  II, from\n                                            \n\ngetting any assets to help  pay for the past service credits\n           \n\nof the not-yet-vested employees.  And, it would prevent  the\n\nnew  fund  from getting  such  assets  even though  UPS  has\n\ndutifully made contributions into the old fund on  behalf of\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nthese same employees.  This,  they say, is unfair.  The  UPS\n\nemployees  concede,  again  as  mentioned  in  the  standing\n\nsection, that the \"no transfer  rule\" is a wash with respect\n\nto already-vested employees and, to that extent, the rule is\n                 \n\nnot  unfair.   They  also  recognize that,  as  long as  the\n   \n\nTeamsters  Pension Fund  has liabilities  in  excess of  its\n\nassets, they might not be entitled to get funds to cover all\n                                                            \n\nof the past service credits of not-yet-vested employees; yet\n\nthey say they are entitled to funds  to cover at least some.\n                                                           \n\n          Can the  trustees' decision  not to  transfer even\n\none dime of the Fund's assets attributable to not-yet-vested\n\npension  rights (keeping  those assets  for  the benefit  of\n\nother  non-UPS   participants)  be   considered  reasonable?\n\nAlthough we find  the question a  difficult one, we  believe\n\nthe  answer is  \"yes\" --  at least  in  the absence  of some\n\nspecial circumstance that  the record here does  not reveal.\n\nIn arriving at this conclusion, we  fully recognize that the\n\ntrustees'  blanket  refusal  operates  in  practice  like  a\n\npenalty for withdrawing from the  Fund -- a penalty somewhat\n\nsimilar  to the  penalties  bank  customers  pay  for  early\n\nwithdrawals  from   CDs  and   the  like,   but  a   penalty\n\nnonetheless.   Whether such a penalty is reasonable depends,\n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n\nin our view,  upon whether it serves a  legitimate deterrent\n\npurpose,  upon whether  the participants  in  the fund  know\n\nabout it  in advance, and upon  its size in relation  to its\n\nfunction.\n\n          The   penalty's   deterrent   function   here   is\n\nlegitimate.   Multiemployer,  defined-benefit pension  plans\n\nalmost inevitably produce some actuarially-favored, and some\n\nactuarially-disfavored, groups.   Such plans  have a  strong\n\ninterest in discouraging actuarially-favored employee groups\n\nfrom withdrawing.  For the employees left behind, withdrawal\n\nmeans,  among other  things,  a  smaller fund,  consequently\n\ngreater  investment costs and risks, and fewer employers for\n\nwhom those employees  can work without losing  their accrued\n\nyears of  service.  Those  left behind, moreover,  also lose\n\nthe  benefit of  sharing  the departing  employer's \"excess\"\n\ncontributions,  say, those  related to  temporary employees.\n\nSome departing employees, we should remind them, would be in\n\nthe same  situation had  personal circumstances  earlier led\n\nthem to  switch to actuarially-disfavored employers.   Also,\n\ndeparting  employees, up until  the time of  departure, have\n\nenjoyed  the benefits  of  the  large  fund  that  departure\n\ndisincentives have helped to maintain.\n\n                            -22-\n                             22\n\n          Moving  to   the  next  inquiry,   we  think  that\n\nemployees  leaving the Fund might reasonably expect to incur\n\nsome such departure penalty (not to be confused, by the way,\n\nwith  \"withdrawal liability,\"  mentioned  supra pp.  14-15).\n                                               \n\nThe governing  document of  the Teamsters  Pension Fund  has\n\ncontained  the \"no asset  transfer\" clause since  the Fund's\n\ncreation.  More  importantly, the penalty concerns  the loss\n\nof  a special  kind  of  asset, namely  the  loss of  assets\n\nrelated to not-yet-vested contributions.   And, participants\n\nin many  pension funds  normally lose  such assets  entirely\n\nwhen they  leave fund-covered  employment prior  to vesting.\n\nDeparting  employees  leave Teamsters  Pension  Fund-covered\n\nemployment whether  they quit  the industry  or whether,  by\n\nswitching  plans, they and their employer leave the Teamster\n\nPension Fund.   Of course, the two activities  -- quitting a\n\njob and switching plans -- are not the same.  But,  they are\n\nclosely  enough   related  to   make  the   penalty  of   an\n\nunsurprising kind (and, of course, from the point of view of\n\nthe remaining participants,  the effect of departure  is the\n\nsame).\n\n          It  also  seems  to  us  that  the  size  of   the\n\nwithdrawal  penalty  is  relatively  modest.    The   record\n\nsuggests  that the  employees can  take  advantage of  their\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\nactuarially favorable position by leaving the Teamster  Fund\n\neven without an asset transfer, albeit not quite to the same\n                              \n\ndegree.   In absolute terms, we have  already mentioned that\n\nthe employees  appear to  value the  not-yet-vested employee\n\nliability  at roughly  $5  million;  we  have  also  already\n\nmentioned  that the employees  recognize that they  would be\n\nentitled,  the Teamsters Pension  Fund being in  debt, to an\n\namount  of assets  to  cover  only some,  not  all, of  this\n                                       \n\nliability -- i.e., an  amount less than $5  million, perhaps\n\nmuch  less.  (Our  own crude calculations,  based on figures\n\nfrom the trustees' table, puts  the amount at $3.7 million.)\n\nWhatever  the  exact figure,  it  is a  fairly  small amount\n\ncompared  to other amounts such as UPS' annual contributions\n\n($18 million dollars as of 1986, according to the employees'\n\nactuaries) or  the \"withdrawal liability\"  UPS would  likely\n\nhave  to pay  upon departure  (in  the tens  of millions  of\n\ndollars, again as of 1986).\n\n          Finally, if the \"no asset transfer\" rule costs the\n\nnew fund too much, there is  a safety valve.  The  employees\n\ncan  automatically entitle  themselves to  a  share of  fund\n\nassets should the  matter become so critically  important to\n\nthem that they take the  drastic step of changing collective\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n\nbargaining representatives (i.e., of leaving the Teamsters).\n\nSee ERISA, 29 U.S.C   1415(a).\n   \n\n          Ultimately,  the   weighing  of   the  conflicting\n\ninterests here at  issue -- those of  departing employees in\n\nobtaining the nonvested share of assets versus those of most\n\nfund participants in discouraging departures -- is up to the\n\ntrustees  (who reflect the  interests both of  employers and\n\nthe   employees,   through   their   collective   bargaining\n\nrepresentatives).  The question is close  enough so that, in\n\nour view,  the ultimate  weighing is not  up to  the courts.\n\nThe treatment  of the  departing employees  (that they  must\n\nforfeit unvested  rights) is  not so unfair  as to  make the\n\nrule arbitrary.   We do  not say that  any rule that  blocks\n                                          \n\nasset  transfers is  reasonable, nor  that  the present  \"no\n\ntransfer\"  rule  is  reasonable in  all  circumstances.   We\n                                       \n\nsimply  say that the  record before us  does not demonstrate\n\nthat it  is arbitrary as applied to the circumstances before\n\nus.  Thus, we do not find a violation of the basic fiduciary\n\nobligations that ERISA imposes upon trustees.\n\n                             IV\n\n                   ERISA Section 4234(a)\n                                        \n\n                            -25-\n                             25\n\n          The  UPS employees also  claim that the  \"no asset\n\ntransfer\" rule violates  ERISA section 4234(a),  which says,\n\nin relevant part, that\n\n          [a]   transfer   of    assets   from   a\n          multiemployer plan to another plan shall\n          comply with  asset-transfer rules  which\n          shall  be adopted  by the  multiemployer\n          plan and which . . . do not unreasonably\n          restrict the transfer of plan assets  in\n          connection  with  the transfer  of  plan\n          liabilities.\n\n29 U.S.C.    1414(a).  They argue (1) that  the provision is\n\napplicable  to the instant case, (2)  that the trustees have\n\nfailed to \"adopt[]\" any \"asset-transfer rules,\" and (3) that\n\nany such  rules they  might have  adopted are  \"unreasonably\n\nrestrict[ive].\"  \n\n          The  trustees do  not  agree  that  the  provision\n\napplies  to this  case.   Specifically,  they argue  that it\n\napplies only where a fund's trustees intend to transfer some\n\nof  its liabilities  -- not  the situation  here --  and the\n\nquestion is  whether, or to  what extent, the  trustees must\n\nallow assets to accompany the transferred liabilities.  This\n\nis the interpretation  of the statute that the Third Circuit\n\nhas endorsed, and with which, for the reasons stated in that\n\nopinion, we  agree.   See Vornado, Inc.  v.

For more than thirty years,\n                              \n\nNew  England employees of United Parcel Service (\"UPS\") have\n\nparticipated  in the  New  England  Teamsters  and  Trucking\n\nIndustry  Pension Fund (the  \"Teamsters Pension Fund\").   In\n\n1986,  a group  of  those employees  decided they  wanted to\n\nleave  the  Teamsters  Pension Fund.    They  hoped (through\n\ncollective bargaining) to secure their employer's assistance\n\nin setting up a separate  pension fund covering only UPS New\n\nEngland employees.  \n\n          The employees failed to  bring about the  creation\n\nof a separate  fund.  And, they blame  the Teamsters Pension\n\nFund trustees for that failure.  In particular, they believe\n\nthat the trustees have thwarted their efforts to negotiate a\n\nplan  switch, not through direct opposition, but by refusing\n\nto permit a transfer of any Teamsters Pension Fund assets to\n\nany  new pension fund  that they,  together with  UPS, might\n\ncreate.   They brought  this lawsuit  against the  trustees,\n\nclaiming,  in relevant part,  that the trustees'  refusal to\n\ntransfer  assets violates  various  laws, including  certain\n\nprovisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n\n1974 (ERISA).  See 29 U.S.C.    1104(a)(1), 1414(a).\n                  \n\n          After a  trial, the  district court  found in  the\n\ntrustees' favor.   The employees now appeal.   They argue in\n\nessence  that  the  trustees, in  refusing  to  transfer any\n\nassets to a newly created  fund, have violated the fiduciary\n\nobligations that  ERISA imposes upon  them.  We can  find no\n\nsuch violation, however; and, we  affirm the judgment in the\n\ntrustees' favor.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n                             A\n\n                 The Teamsters Pension Fund\n                                           \n\n          The  large, multiemployer  Teamsters Pension  Fund\n\npools  contributions from  nearly two  thousand New  England\n\nfirms.   Eight trustees  (four Teamster  representatives and\n\nfour  employer representatives)  manage the  fund, investing\n\nthe pooled money  and paying guaranteed monthly  benefits to\n\nemployees  who  retire.    We  have  read  the  record  with\n\nconsiderable care to  try to understand, from  the testimony\n\nand documents,  as well  as the  briefs,  how the  Teamsters\n\nPension  Fund  works.   Based  on our  understanding  of the\n\nrecord, we describe its significant features as follows.\n\n          First,  employers contribute to the fund at a rate\n\nthat, in 1986, varied, among employers, between 36 cents and\n\n$1.66 per employee  working hour.  The  precise rate depends\n\nupon  the  results  of local  collective  bargaining.   Each\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\nemployer pays the collective-bargained hourly rate for every\n                                                            \n\nhour  that  any  employee works,  whether  the  employee who\n               \n\nperforms the  work is young or old,  part-time or full-time,\n\ntemporary or long-term.\n\n          Second,  a retiring  employee  receives a  pension\n\nbenefit  in  an amount  defined  by a  schedule  that varies\n\nbenefits  depending primarily upon  the employee's length of\n\nservice  and upon his, or her, employer's contribution rate.\n\nThe schedule thus pays the  same pension to two retirees who\n\nhave worked for  the same number of years  for employers who\n\ncontribute  at the  same rate.    In 1986,  for example,  an\n\nemployee  who worked for  twenty-five years for  an employer\n\nwho contributed  $1.66 per hour  (UPS' actual rate  in 1986)\n\nwould  receive a  pension of  $900 per  month.   The benefit\n\nschedule  imposes a minimum length  of service (ten years as\n\nof 1986, lowered  to five in 1990); no  employee is entitled\n\nto  any pension  benefits until  he has worked  the minimum,\n\ni.e., until his Fund  benefits have \"vested.\"   The schedule\n\nappears to set a maximum  length of service as well (twenty-\n\nfive or thirty years, depending on retirement age).  Once an\n\nemployee  works the maximum number of years, additional work\n\ndone does not entitle him to any additional benefit.\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n          It is  important to understand  that the Teamsters\n\nPension  Fund (like most \"defined benefit\" pension plans and\n\nunlike  \"defined contribution\" plans  such as those  of many\n\nuniversity employees)  does not guarantee any  employee that\n                               \n\nhe  will receive  a  pension that  exactly reflects  all the\n                                          \n\ncontributions  made  on behalf  of that  particular employee\n                                                            \n\nover the years  (plus the investment income  associated with\n\nthose contributions).  As  we have just said, an  individual\n\nemployee who works  more than  the maximum  number of  years\n\nloses the benefit  of some contributions made in  respect to\n\nsome of  his work  hours.  More  important, an  employee who\n\nleaves  covered employment  before  his  Fund benefits  vest\n\nloses the  benefit of all  contributions made in  respect to\n                         \n\nhis work.  Less obviously, employees who are young also lose\n\nthe benefit of some contributions.  For example, an employee\n\nwho  works a certain  number of years,  say fifteen, between\n\nthe ages of forty  and fifty-five (and then quits)  receives\n\nno more upon his  retirement at sixty-five than  an employee\n\nwho works the  same fifteen years between the  ages of fifty\n\nand sixty-five; yet the contributions  made on behalf of the\n\nfirst employee  are likely more valuable, for  they have had\n\nmore time to accrue investment income before retirement age.\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\n          This  lack of  a  perfect fit  between  individual\n\ncontributions   and   individual    benefits   may   reflect\n\nadministrative considerations.  It may, for example, reflect\n\na judgment  not to  create discrepancies  in benefit  levels\n               \n\nthat turn solely upon the relation between investment market\n\nperformance and the time that  an individual's contributions\n\nare made.  But, the  most important reason for the imperfect\n\nfit,  as the  Ninth Circuit  has  pointed out,  is that  the\n\n\"excess\"  contributions made in respect to some workers help\n\nto assure that all workers  (who work a reasonable number of\n                  \n\nyears)  will  have a  decent  pension.   \"A  modern  defined\n\nbenefit pension plan pools contributions for all workers . .\n\n. to  provide reasonable  pensions for  workers who  satisfy\n\nreasonable eligibility  standards.  The  formula necessarily\n\nassumes  [inter alia]  that the  pensions  of a  significant\n                    \n\nnumber  of employees may  never vest.\"   Phillips  v.

Demisay, 113 S.

Such  plans  .  .  . pool[]  employer\n\ncontributions for  the joint  benefit  of all  participating\n\nemployees.\").  \n\n          At  the same time,  the plan retains  an important\n\nconnection between  an individual's  contributions and  that\n\nindividual's benefits.   By tying benefit levels to years of\n\nservice and  employer  contribution rates,  the  Fund  still\n\nensures that those employees who do not get the full benefit\n\nof  contributions  made on  their  behalf get  much  of that\n                                                   \n\nbenefit (at least if their pension rights have vested).\n\n          Third,   the   Teamsters   Pension   Fund   is   a\n\nmultiemployer plan.   The  fact that  it is  \"multiemployer\"\n\nmeans  the fund  is large,  thereby  permitting trustees  to\n\ndiversify investment risks and also lowering  administrative\n\ncosts   per   pension  dollar.      Moreover,  multiemployer\n\n\"reciprocity\"   permits  a  worker  to  change  jobs,  among\n\nparticipating employers,  without losing the benefit of past\n\ncontributions.\n\n          Finally,  the Teamsters  Pension  Fund contains  a\n\nspecial feature  -- a \"no asset  transfer\" rule -- which the\n\nUPS employees now challenge.  That rule says:\n\n          If any employee or group of employees  .\n          . .  shall cease  to be  covered by  the\n          Fund  for  any reason  whatsoever,  they\n          shall  not be  entitled  to receive  any\n\n                            -7-\n                             7\n\n          assets  of the  Fund or  portion thereof\n          nor shall the Trustees  be authorized to\n          make any transfer of assets on behalf of\n          such employees.\n\nNew  England Teamsters and  Trucking Industry  Pension Fund,\n\nAgreement and Declaration  of Trust, Article XII,  section 9\n\n(1958).   According to the trustees, this seemingly absolute\n\nprohibition  is  modified  by  the  Trust  Agreement's  next\n\nsection.   That section  requires the trustees  to interpret\n\nand apply the Agreement\n\n          so  as to be in full compliance with all\n          applicable provisions of  law, including\n          the Employee Retirement  Income Security\n          Act of 1974, as amended.\n\nNew England  Teamsters and  Trucking Industry  Pension Fund,\n\nRestated Agreement and  Declaration of  Trust, Article  XII,\n\nsection 10 (1982).\n\n                             B\n\n                         This Case\n                                  \n\n          In 1986,  a group  of UPS  employees learned  that\n\nthey  could dramatically improve the level of their pensions\n\nwere  they, with UPS, to withdraw from the Teamsters Pension\n\nFund and  create their  own single-employer  plan.   That is\n\nbecause, as confirmed in the findings of the district court,\n\nUPS  employs a relatively large number of temporary workers,\n\nfor whom the company contributes for every hour  worked, but\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nwho leave  the New  England trucking  industry before  their\n\npensions  vest.   The UPS  workforce also  includes a  large\n\npercentage  of younger  workers.   Thus,  UPS' contributions\n\nmade  on  behalf  of its  employees  contain  a higher-than-\n\naverage  amount of  \"excess\" contributions.   The  Teamsters\n\nPension  Fund,  being  a  multi-employer fund,  spreads  the\n\nbenefits of such excess contributions among all participants\n\nin the Fund.   In a single-employer plan,  the UPS employees\n\nrealized, they would not  have to share their  \"excess\" with\n\nothers.   And unshared, UPS' $1.66 per hour contribution, as\n                      \n\nof 1986, could  buy pensions of $2600 per  month (instead of\n\n$900  per  month) for  UPS  employees who  retired  from UPS\n\nservice after twenty-five  years.  Alternatively, UPS,  in a\n\nsingle-employer  plan, could fund the $900 per month pension\n\nfor employees retiring after 25 years with a contribution of\n\nless  than 70 cents  (rather than $1.66)  for every employee\n\nhour worked.\n\n          The UPS  employees' brief  explains what  happened\n\nafter  they learned of  the potential benefits  of a single-\n\nemployer plan:   \"In an  effort to remedy  their inequitable\n\ntreatment  within the Teamsters  Fund, the  UPS Participants\n\nrepeatedly  petitioned  their  union  leaders  to  negotiate\n\n[through  collective bargaining  with UPS management]  for a\n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nseparate pension plan on their behalf\" -- a plan, the record\n\nindicates,  that  the  employees  assumed  would  involve  a\n\ntransfer  of some portion  of Teamsters Pension  Fund assets\n\nand liabilities to  the new fund.   \"However,\" the employees\n\nadd,  \"the UPS Participants' efforts to negotiate a separate\n\nUPS pension  plan [were]  thwarted by  the provision in  the\n\nTeamster   Fund's  governing   documents  which   absolutely\n\nprohibits  any  transfer of  assets  .  . .  .\"   Brief  for\n\nPlaintiffs-Appellants at 10.\n\n          \"Thwarted\" in  their efforts  to take assets  from\n\nthe  Teamsters Pension  Fund, and  thereby,  in their  view,\n\n\"thwarted\" in their efforts to bring about the creation of a\n\nnew fund, the UPS employees filed suit against the trustees.\n\nThey asked  the court  either (1) to  order the  trustees to\n\ncreate special  benefit levels within  the Teamsters Pension\n\nFund for UPS participants (to  reflect, in whole or in part,\n\ntheir  favorable actuarial  status), or  (2)  to loosen  the\n\nprohibition  on asset  transfers,  thereby,  in their  view,\n\nmaking it possible for them  to negotiate a plan switch with\n\nUPS management.   They argued that the  trustees' failure to\n\ndo one or the other violated various provisions of the Labor\n\nManagement Relations  Act (LMRA), 29  U.S.C.   141  et seq.,\n                                                           \n\nand of ERISA.

The employees now\n\nappeal that judgment.\n\n          The UPS employees have  simplified their claims on\n\nappeal.  They have abandoned their demand that  the trustees\n\ncreate  a special  level of  benefits  within the  Teamsters\n\nPension Fund.  They focus  instead upon the trustees'  rule-\n\nbased refusal to permit any transfer of assets to a new UPS-\n\nonly fund.\n\n          The  passage of  time  has  also  simplified  this\n\nappeal.  The Supreme Court has recently decided a case which\n\nwe awaited  before deciding  this appeal,  namely Local  144\n                                                            \n\nNursing  Home  Pension Fund  v.

Demisay involved  LMRA- and ERISA-based challenges\n                 \n\nto  a refusal, by trustees  of a multiemployer pension plan,\n\nto transfer  assets to another  plan.  In its  decision, the\n\nCourt  barred   the  LMRA-based  claims   on  jurisdictional\n\ngrounds, but it remanded  (without deciding) the ERISA-based\n\nclaims.   As a  result of that  decision, the  UPS employees\n\nconcede that they  \"can no longer pursue a  claim for relief\n\nunder [the applicable section of] the LMRA.\"\n\n                            -11-\n                             11\n\n          The  UPS  employees  now  pursue  their  remaining\n\nclaim, namely  that  the  trustees'  rule-based  refusal  to\n\ntransfer assets violates ERISA.\n\n                            -12-\n                             12\n\n                             II\n\n                          Standing\n                                  \n\n          We  begin with  the trustees'  assertion  that the\n\nemployees  lack standing.   They concede that  the employees\n\nmay  bring an  ERISA  action if  they  have been  \"adversely\n\naffected by the  act or  omission of  any party .  . .  with\n\nrespect to  a  multiemployer plan.\"   29  U.S.C.    1451(a).\n\nThey  claim, however,  that  the  employees  have  not  been\n\n\"adversely  affected\"  by  the  asset  transfer  prohibition\n\nprincipally   because,   in   the   trustees'   view,   \"UPS\n\nparticipants  could  receive  the same  level  of  [pension]\n\nbenefits  with or  without a  transfer  of assets  to a  new\n                          \n\nsingle-employer fund.\"  Brief for Defendants-Appellees at 34\n\n(emphasis  added).  Insofar  as we understand  this somewhat\n\ncounter-intuitive argument, we cannot agree with it. \n\n          In   evaluating  the   argument,   we  have   kept\n\nseparately  in mind two  different groups of  UPS employees.\n\nIn the first group are those employees who, were a switch to\n\noccur,  would not yet have any vested Teamsters Pension Fund\n                                     \n\nrights but who will keep working for several years after the\n\nswitch (e.g., a UPS employee  who worked, say, four years at\n\nthe time of the  switch, and continues to work for more than\n\nan additional year).  Both  sides agree that a new, UPS-only\n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\npension plan  would need  to give these  employees (whom  we\n\nshall call \"not-yet-vested employees\") full credit for their\n\npast years of  Teamsters-Pension-Fund-related service (e.g.,\n\nthe plan  would need  to give  the four-year  employee fully\n\nvested,  five-year, rights after one more additional year of\n\nwork).  Everyone  also agrees, however,  that the \"no  asset\n\ntransfer\" rule means that the new fund would be left without\n\nany  assets to  pay for  these  past service  credits.   The\n   \n\nemployees'  counsel   estimates  the   \"loss   of  the   UPS\n\nParticipants'  unvested benefits\" (which we take to mean the\n\ncost  of these  past service  credits)  at approximately  $5\n\nmillion.  Brief  for Plaintiffs-Appellants at  10 n.1.   The\n\ntrustees' figures, if  anything, appear to place  the figure\n\nhigher. \n\n          In  the second group are those employees who, were\n\na switch  to  occur, would  already have  vested rights  (we\n                                   \n\nshall  call  them  \"already-vested  employees\").    Everyone\n\nagrees  that a  new, UPS-only  fund  would not  have to  pay\n                                              \n\npensions  reflecting  the  past years  of  service  of these\n\nalready-vested  employees, for  those  pension rights  would\n                                     \n\nremain the  legal  responsibility of  the Teamsters  Pension\n\nFund. (In practice,  the old fund pays  supplemental pension\n\nbenefits directly to the employee after retiring.)   Since a\n\n                            -14-\n                             14\n\nnew fund  would not  have to pay  for these  employees' past\n\nyears of service, it  would not need assets to  help it make\n\nany  such  payments.   And,  thus,  the  new fund  would  be\n\nsomewhat  indifferent to the  presence of the  trustees' \"no\n\nasset transfer\" rule.   The employees recognize  this point,\n\nwhich is why they suggest they would ultimately ask only for\n\nthe approximately $5 million --  or some portion thereof  --\n\nthey claim it  would cost to pay the past service credits of\n\nthe not-yet-vested employees.\n                  \n\n          With this distinction  in mind, we have  turned to\n\nthe  trustees' \"no standing\" argument.  The argument depends\n\nupon a table  (entitled \"Transfer of Assets  and Liabilities\n\nVs. No Transfer -- Hancock  Numbers\") that seems designed to\n\nshow   that,  if  asset   transfers  were  permissible,  the\n\nfollowing would  occur: (1)  the new  fund would assume  all\n\npension liability for  the already-vested employees;  (2) it\n                                         \n\nwould  obtain assets  from the  old  fund to  help pay  that\n\n(already-vested employee)  liability; but,  (3) for  reasons\n\nhaving  to do with  the inadequate funding  of the Teamsters\n\nPension Fund as  a whole, these assets would  fall far short\n\nof  the  amount   needed  to  pay  for   the  already-vested\n\nemployees; (4) the  asset shortfall (in respect  to already-\n\nvested  employees) would more  than outweigh any  benefit to\n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n\nthe new fund through its  obtaining a share of the (roughly)\n\n$5  million of  assets  in  respect  to  the  not-yet-vested\n                                                            \n\nemployees'  pensions;   (5)  the   rules  related  to   UPS'\n\n\"withdrawal liability\" (a  complicated statutory requirement\n\nthat employers  who leave a  multiemployer plan  pay a  fair\n\nshare of the fund's overall deficit) would then somehow even\n\nthings out,  so that UPS  would be neither better  nor worse\n\noff with a transfer of assets than without one.\n\n          The  problem  with  the table  is  that  we cannot\n\nunderstand the   reasoning that underlies it.   The trustees\n\nnowhere explain why a new  fund could not request a transfer\n\nonly  of  assets  related to  not-yet-vested  benefits  (and\n    \n\nsimply  not   bother  with   a  transfer   of  assets,   and\n\nliabilities,  related to vested benefits).   And, so long as\n\nthe  employees limit their request  in this, or some similar\n\nway, it  seems plain to us that a rule blocking the transfer\n\nof any  assets means a  poorer fund.  We  assume, therefore,\n\nthat the employees  have standing,  and we  proceed on  that\n\nbasis.\n\n                            III\n\n             Fiduciary Obligations Under ERISA\n                                              \n\n     The UPS employees' basic argument is that the trustees,\n\nin maintaining a \"no asset transfer\" rule, have violated the\n\n                            -16-\n                             16\n\nfiduciary obligations that  ERISA imposes upon them.

In reaching this conclusion, we have considered\n\ntwo possible arguments.  The first (implicit in much of what\n\nthe UPS  employees say) is  that the Teamsters  Pension Fund\n\nhas treated them  unfairly while they  have remained in  the\n\nFund by not giving them  higher pension benefits than  other\n\nemployee    groups    with    less    favorable    actuarial\n\ncharacteristics.  On this view, the sole fact that they were\n\nearning (as  of 1986)  a $900 pension  when they  could have\n                                                       \n\nbeen earning a $2600 pension had the  Fund treated them as a\n\nseparate actuarial group demonstrates this unfairness.  And,\n\narguably,  this  \"unfair\"  treatment warrants  some  special\n\ntransfer of assets should they leave the Fund.\n\n                            -18-\n                             18\n\n          The  problem  with  this  argument  is  that   the\n\ndiscrepancy  between $900  and $2600  does  not, by  itself,\n                                               \n\nindicate  that   the  Teamsters  Pension  Fund  treated  the\n\nemployees unfairly (and  nor have the employees  offered any\n\nother evidence of  unfair treatment while in the  Fund).  As\n\ndiscussed above, see supra pp.  6-7, multiemployer, defined-\n                          \n\nbenefit pension  funds  provide their  participants a  whole\n\ncluster  of  benefits,  most  notably,  a  guaranteed decent\n\npension for all  longtime workers.   And  as also  discussed\n\nabove, such  funds do  this largely  by collecting  \"excess\"\n\ncontributions in respect\n\nto  certain kinds  of employees  such  as temporary  workers\n\n(whose  benefits  never  vest),  young workers,  and  super-\n\nlongterm   employees,   and   by   sharing   these    excess\n\ncontributions  with all the employees  in the fund, not just\n                       \n\nwith  the  employees  of  employers  who  paid  the  excess.\n\nAccordingly,  a  basic  objective of  these  funds  would be\n\nundermined  if  every employee  group (such  as UPS)  with a\n\ndisproportionate  share of  excess contributions  (and there\n\nmay be many others) wanted special pension levels to reflect\n\nthat fact.  It is thus no coincidence that, according to the\n\nfindings of the  district court, no other  regional Teamster\n\npension  fund  provides  special  benefits  for  actuarially\n\n                            -19-\n                             19\n\nfavorable employee groups, and only one non-Teamster fund in\n\nthe entire country does so.\n\n          In  short, UPS and  its employees could  have quit\n\nthe Teamsters Pension Fund at any time, but so  long as they\n\nstayed  --  and  enjoyed   the  guaranteed,  mobile  pension\n\nbenefits  the Fund provides -- there seems nothing obviously\n\nunfair in denying them special (e.g., $2600)  benefits.  The\n\nUPS employees, by abandoning on appeal their demand for such\n\nbenefits, seem,  in effect, to  concede the point.   (We add\n\nthat, on appeal, the UPS employees also seem to suggest that\n\na new  fund would  not be  entitled to  an amount of  assets\n\nanywhere near as large as  the amount that would reflect the\n\nUPS employees' \"excess\" contribution.) \n\n          The  second basic argument  that the trustees have\n\nacted arbitrarily focuses  on the \"no  transfer\" rule.   The\n\nemployees argue that if they quit the Teamsters Pension Fund\n\n(because they no longer, in  the future, want to share their\n\nexcess  contributions),  the  rule would  prevent  them,  as\n\nexplained  in  the  standing section,  supra  Part  II, from\n                                            \n\ngetting any assets to help  pay for the past service credits\n           \n\nof the not-yet-vested employees.  And, it would prevent  the\n\nnew  fund  from getting  such  assets  even though  UPS  has\n\ndutifully made contributions into the old fund on  behalf of\n\n                            -20-\n                             20\n\nthese same employees.  This,  they say, is unfair.  The  UPS\n\nemployees  concede,  again  as  mentioned  in  the  standing\n\nsection, that the \"no transfer  rule\" is a wash with respect\n\nto already-vested employees and, to that extent, the rule is\n                 \n\nnot  unfair.   They  also  recognize that,  as  long as  the\n   \n\nTeamsters  Pension Fund  has liabilities  in  excess of  its\n\nassets, they might not be entitled to get funds to cover all\n                                                            \n\nof the past service credits of not-yet-vested employees; yet\n\nthey say they are entitled to funds  to cover at least some.\n                                                           \n\n          Can the  trustees' decision  not to  transfer even\n\none dime of the Fund's assets attributable to not-yet-vested\n\npension  rights (keeping  those assets  for  the benefit  of\n\nother  non-UPS   participants)  be   considered  reasonable?\n\nAlthough we find  the question a  difficult one, we  believe\n\nthe  answer is  \"yes\" --  at least  in  the absence  of some\n\nspecial circumstance that  the record here does  not reveal.\n\nIn arriving at this conclusion, we  fully recognize that the\n\ntrustees'  blanket  refusal  operates  in  practice  like  a\n\npenalty for withdrawing from the  Fund -- a penalty somewhat\n\nsimilar  to the  penalties  bank  customers  pay  for  early\n\nwithdrawals  from   CDs  and   the  like,   but  a   penalty\n\nnonetheless.   Whether such a penalty is reasonable depends,\n\n                            -21-\n                             21\n\nin our view,  upon whether it serves a  legitimate deterrent\n\npurpose,  upon whether  the participants  in  the fund  know\n\nabout it  in advance, and upon  its size in relation  to its\n\nfunction.\n\n          The   penalty's   deterrent   function   here   is\n\nlegitimate.   Multiemployer,  defined-benefit pension  plans\n\nalmost inevitably produce some actuarially-favored, and some\n\nactuarially-disfavored, groups.   Such plans  have a  strong\n\ninterest in discouraging actuarially-favored employee groups\n\nfrom withdrawing.  For the employees left behind, withdrawal\n\nmeans,  among other  things,  a  smaller fund,  consequently\n\ngreater  investment costs and risks, and fewer employers for\n\nwhom those employees  can work without losing  their accrued\n\nyears of  service.  Those  left behind, moreover,  also lose\n\nthe  benefit of  sharing  the departing  employer's \"excess\"\n\ncontributions,  say, those  related to  temporary employees.\n\nSome departing employees, we should remind them, would be in\n\nthe same  situation had  personal circumstances  earlier led\n\nthem to  switch to actuarially-disfavored employers.   Also,\n\ndeparting  employees, up until  the time of  departure, have\n\nenjoyed  the benefits  of  the  large  fund  that  departure\n\ndisincentives have helped to maintain.\n\n                            -22-\n                             22\n\n          Moving  to   the  next  inquiry,   we  think  that\n\nemployees  leaving the Fund might reasonably expect to incur\n\nsome such departure penalty (not to be confused, by the way,\n\nwith  \"withdrawal liability,\"  mentioned  supra pp.  14-15).\n                                               \n\nThe governing  document of  the Teamsters  Pension Fund  has\n\ncontained  the \"no asset  transfer\" clause since  the Fund's\n\ncreation.  More  importantly, the penalty concerns  the loss\n\nof  a special  kind  of  asset, namely  the  loss of  assets\n\nrelated to not-yet-vested contributions.   And, participants\n\nin many  pension funds  normally lose  such assets  entirely\n\nwhen they  leave fund-covered  employment prior  to vesting.\n\nDeparting  employees  leave Teamsters  Pension  Fund-covered\n\nemployment whether  they quit  the industry  or whether,  by\n\nswitching  plans, they and their employer leave the Teamster\n\nPension Fund.   Of course, the two activities  -- quitting a\n\njob and switching plans -- are not the same.  But,  they are\n\nclosely  enough   related  to   make  the   penalty  of   an\n\nunsurprising kind (and, of course, from the point of view of\n\nthe remaining participants,  the effect of departure  is the\n\nsame).\n\n          It  also  seems  to  us  that  the  size  of   the\n\nwithdrawal  penalty  is  relatively  modest.    The   record\n\nsuggests  that the  employees can  take  advantage of  their\n\n                            -23-\n                             23\n\nactuarially favorable position by leaving the Teamster  Fund\n\neven without an asset transfer, albeit not quite to the same\n                              \n\ndegree.   In absolute terms, we have  already mentioned that\n\nthe employees  appear to  value the  not-yet-vested employee\n\nliability  at roughly  $5  million;  we  have  also  already\n\nmentioned  that the employees  recognize that they  would be\n\nentitled,  the Teamsters Pension  Fund being in  debt, to an\n\namount  of assets  to  cover  only some,  not  all, of  this\n                                       \n\nliability -- i.e., an  amount less than $5  million, perhaps\n\nmuch  less.  (Our  own crude calculations,  based on figures\n\nfrom the trustees' table, puts  the amount at $3.7 million.)\n\nWhatever  the  exact figure,  it  is a  fairly  small amount\n\ncompared  to other amounts such as UPS' annual contributions\n\n($18 million dollars as of 1986, according to the employees'\n\nactuaries) or  the \"withdrawal liability\"  UPS would  likely\n\nhave  to pay  upon departure  (in  the tens  of millions  of\n\ndollars, again as of 1986).\n\n          Finally, if the \"no asset transfer\" rule costs the\n\nnew fund too much, there is  a safety valve.  The  employees\n\ncan  automatically entitle  themselves to  a  share of  fund\n\nassets should the  matter become so critically  important to\n\nthem that they take the  drastic step of changing collective\n\n                            -24-\n                             24\n\nbargaining representatives (i.e., of leaving the Teamsters).\n\nSee ERISA, 29 U.S.C   1415(a).\n   \n\n          Ultimately,  the   weighing  of   the  conflicting\n\ninterests here at  issue -- those of  departing employees in\n\nobtaining the nonvested share of assets versus those of most\n\nfund participants in discouraging departures -- is up to the\n\ntrustees  (who reflect the  interests both of  employers and\n\nthe   employees,   through   their   collective   bargaining\n\nrepresentatives).  The question is close  enough so that, in\n\nour view,  the ultimate  weighing is not  up to  the courts.\n\nThe treatment  of the  departing employees  (that they  must\n\nforfeit unvested  rights) is  not so unfair  as to  make the\n\nrule arbitrary.   We do  not say that  any rule that  blocks\n                                          \n\nasset  transfers is  reasonable, nor  that  the present  \"no\n\ntransfer\"  rule  is  reasonable in  all  circumstances.   We\n                                       \n\nsimply  say that the  record before us  does not demonstrate\n\nthat it  is arbitrary as applied to the circumstances before\n\nus.  Thus, we do not find a violation of the basic fiduciary\n\nobligations that ERISA imposes upon trustees.\n\n                             IV\n\n                   ERISA Section 4234(a)\n                                        \n\n                            -25-\n                             25\n\n          The  UPS employees also  claim that the  \"no asset\n\ntransfer\" rule violates  ERISA section 4234(a),  which says,\n\nin relevant part, that\n\n          [a]   transfer   of    assets   from   a\n          multiemployer plan to another plan shall\n          comply with  asset-transfer rules  which\n          shall  be adopted  by the  multiemployer\n          plan and which . . . do not unreasonably\n          restrict the transfer of plan assets  in\n          connection  with  the transfer  of  plan\n          liabilities.\n\n29 U.S.C.    1414(a).  They argue (1) that  the provision is\n\napplicable  to the instant case, (2)  that the trustees have\n\nfailed to \"adopt[]\" any \"asset-transfer rules,\" and (3) that\n\nany such  rules they  might have  adopted are  \"unreasonably\n\nrestrict[ive].\"  \n\n          The  trustees do  not  agree  that  the  provision\n\napplies  to this  case.   Specifically,  they argue  that it\n\napplies only where a fund's trustees intend to transfer some\n\nof  its liabilities  -- not  the situation  here --  and the\n\nquestion is  whether, or to  what extent, the  trustees must\n\nallow assets to accompany the transferred liabilities.  This\n\nis the interpretation  of the statute that the Third Circuit\n\nhas endorsed, and with which, for the reasons stated in that\n\nopinion, we  agree.   See Vornado, Inc.  v. Trustees  of The\n                                                            \n\nRetail Store Employees' Union  Local 1262, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494615\"><a href=\"/opinion/494615/vornado-inc-ta-two-guys-v-trustees-of-the-retail-store-employees/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">416</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d\n                                         \n\nCir. 1987).\n\n                            -26-\n                             26\n\n          Even assuming that the provision applies, however,\n\nwe cannot accept the employees' claim that the trustees have\n\nfailed to  \"adopt[]\" any  \"asset-transfer rules.\"   The  \"no\n\nasset  transfer\" is  itself a  rule  about asset  transfers.\n                           \n\nMoreover, that rule  is not quite as absolute  as it sounds,\n\nfor the trustees acknowledge that, if ERISA's fiduciary duty\n\nrules require them to transfer assets, the rule permits them\n\nto comply.
