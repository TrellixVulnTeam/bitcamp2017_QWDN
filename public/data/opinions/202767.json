Oliveras-González for petitioner.\n     Stacy Garrick Zimmerman, Attorney, National Labor Relations\nBoard, with whom David Habenstreit, Supervisory Attorney, Ronald\nMeisburg, General Counsel, John E. Higgins, Jr., Deputy General\nCounsel, John H. Ferguson, Associate General Counsel, and Aileen\nA. Armstrong, Deputy Associate General Counsel, National Labor\nRelations Board, were on brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          May 30, 2007\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Hospital Cristo Redentor of Puerto\n\nRico petitions for review of a decision and order of the National\n\nLabor Relations Board; the Board has filed a cross-application to\n\nenforce the order.\n\n          While the outcome of the case is largely driven by the\n\nfacts and by the substantial evidence rule, there is one basic\n\npoint of law worth stressing.   This court has previously rejected,\n\nand we do so again, arguments by petitioners that because they\n\nsupposedly have complied with Puerto Rico Law 80, P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 29, §§ 185a-185m, they have a defense against enforcement of\n\na Board unfair labor practice decision and order.   Such arguments\n\nfundamentally misunderstand both the operation of federal labor\n\nrelations law and the role of courts reviewing Board orders.\n\n          The Board's July 31, 2006 decision and order affirmed an\n\nAdministrative Law Judge's decision that the Hospital had violated\n\nthe National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 151-169, as to its\n\nemployee and union delegate Carlos Garcia Santiago (\"Garcia\"). The\n\nHospital did so by: (1) interrogating Garcia about his union\n\nactivities and threatening him in relation to those activities, in\n\nviolation of section 8(a)(1) of the Act; and (2) both suspending\n\nand discharging Garcia for his union activities in violation of\n\nsection 8(a)(3) and section 8(a)(1) of the Act.       Hosp. Cristo\n\nRedentor, Inc., 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 1 (July 31, 2006).     The\n\nBoard's remedy consisted of a cease-and-desist order, posting of\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe remedial order, and full reinstatement of Garcia, with make-\n\nwhole compensation and removal of all references to the unlawful\n\nsuspension and discharge from the Hospital's files.             Id. at 6, 25.\n\n            We have jurisdiction to review the Board's final order.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 160(e)-(f).\n\n                                      I.\n\n            With one exception related to the interplay between Law\n\n80 and the NLRA, discussed later, the Hospital does not contend\n\nthat the Board utilized incorrect legal standards.             We outline the\n\nbasic federal labor laws at issue, and then discuss the evidence\n\nwithin that context.\n\n            Section 7 of the NLRA guarantees employees the right to\n\norganize.    Id. § 157.    It provides: \"Employees shall have the right\n\nto self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations,\n\nto   bargain      collectively   through   representatives     of   their   own\n\nchoosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the\n\npurpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection\n\n. . . .\"    Id.    Section 8(a)(1) of the Act implements the guarantees\n\nin section 7 of the Act.            Id. § 158(a)(1).      Section 8(a)(1)\n\nprovides: \"It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\n\n. . . to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the\n\nexercise of\" their section 7 rights.          Id.\n\n            Employers violate section 8(a)(1) of the Act by, inter\n\nalia,   \"coercively      interrogating     employees   about    their   union\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\factivities or sentiments, or about the activities or sentiments of\n\nothers,     and    by     either        directly      or        indirectly       threatening\n\nemployees.\"       NLRB v. Horizons Hotel Corp., 49 F.3d 795, 804 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (quoting 3-E Co. v. NLRB, 26 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1994))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).                  The Board determines whether\n\nthere is coercive interrogation by looking to whether, under all of\n\nthe circumstances, the interrogation reasonably tends to interfere\n\nwith, restrain, or coerce the exercise of rights guaranteed by the\n\nAct.     Rossmore House, 269 N.L.R.B. 1176, 1177 (1984), aff'd sub\n\nnom. Hotel Employees & Rest. Employees Union, Local 11 v. NLRB, 760\n\nF.2d 1006 (9th Cir. 1985); accord 3-E Co., 26 F.3d at 3.                              \"It is\n\nthe coercive tendency of employer statements, not their actual\n\neffect, that constitutes a violation of the Act.\"                           Horizons Hotel\n\nCorp.,    49    F.3d     at    804     (alteration     omitted)          (emphasis    added)\n\n(quoting NLRB v. Marine Optical, Inc., 671 F.2d 11, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                       The Board's finding of\n\n\"coercive      tendency\"        will    not    be   disturbed       if    the    finding   is\n\nreasonable,       even    if    the     evidence     is    also     susceptible       to   an\n\nalternative interpretation.               Id.\n\n               Like section 8(a)(1) of the Act, section 8(a)(3) defines\n\nan unfair labor practice.                29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3).                 An employer\n\nviolates       section        8(a)(3),    as    well       as     section       8(a)(1),   by\n\n\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\fdischarging an employee for engaging in union activities.1                Holsum\n\nde   P.R.,    Inc.   v.   NLRB,   456   F.3d   265,   269   (1st   Cir.   2006).\n\nResolving an alleged section 8(a)(3) violation thus requires an\n\ninquiry into the employer's motives.             In NLRB v. Transportation\n\nManagement Corp., 462 U.S. 393 (1983), the Supreme Court set forth\n\nthe test for determining whether an employer has an unlawful\n\nmotive.      Id. at 395, 404.       The Transportation Management Court\n\nadopted the test announced by the Board in Wright Line, 251\n\nN.L.R.B. 1083, 1089 (1980), enforced on other grounds, 662 F.2d 899\n\n(1st Cir. 1981).      Under the Wright Line test, the Board's General\n\nCounsel must first demonstrate that \"the employee's protected\n\nconduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse\n\naction.\"     Transp. Mgmt., 462 U.S. at 401; accord Holsum, 456 F.3d\n\nat 269.      The General Counsel is not required to demonstrate that\n\nthe employee's protected union activity was the sole factor for the\n\ndischarge.      Holsum, 456 F.3d at 269; accord NLRB v. Hosp. San\n\nPablo, Inc., 207 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             Once the General Counsel has made the showing that union\n\nanimus was a motivating factor in the adverse employment action,\n\n\n\n      1\n          Section 8(a)(3) of the Act makes it an unfair labor\npractice for an employer to discriminate \"in regard to hire or\ntenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to\n. . . discourage membership in any labor organization.\" 29 U.S.C.\n§ 158(a)(3). A violation of section 8(a)(3) of the Act necessarily\ninterferes with the exercise of statutory rights, and therefore\nderivatively violates section 8(a)(1) of the Act.       See Metro.\nEdison Co. v. NLRB, 460 U.S. 693, 698 n.4 (1983).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fthe employer must prove, as an affirmative defense, that it would\n\nhave taken the same action even in the absence of the employee's\n\nprotected activity. Transp. Mgmt., 462 U.S. at 400-03; Holsum, 456\n\nF.3d at 269.    Even if the employer proffers a \"seemingly plausible\n\nexplanation,\" the Board need not accept such an explanation at face\n\nvalue.     E.C. Waste, Inc. v. NLRB, 359 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nRather, \"[i]f the Board supportably finds that the reasons advanced\n\nby   the   employer    are   either   insufficient   or    pretextual,   the\n\nviolation is deemed proven.\" Holsum, 456 F.3d at 269 (quoting E.C.\n\nWaste, 359 F.3d at 42) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord\n\nSociedad Española de Auxilio Mutuo y Beneficiencia de P.R. v. NLRB,\n\n414 F.3d 158, 161 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             Because    an     employer     rarely        admits   unlawful\n\ndiscrimination, the Board may determine motive by relying on\n\ncircumstantial evidence and inferences reasonably drawn from the\n\ntotality of the evidence.        E.C. Waste, 359 F.3d at 42; see also\n\nNLRB v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584, 602 (1941).          Among the factors\n\nthe Board often considers in assessing the unlawfulness of an\n\nemployer's motive are the timing of the adverse action in relation\n\nto the union activity, the employer's hostility toward union\n\nactivity, and the employer's reliance on pretextual justifications.\n\nSee, e.g., E.C. Waste, 359 F.3d at 42 (timing); id. at 43 (deep-\n\nseated hostility toward union activity); Hosp. San Pablo, 207 F.3d\n\nat 73-74 (pretext).\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f              The    Board's       factual    findings,       including   findings    of\n\nunlawful motive and inferences from the facts, are binding on this\n\ncourt if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered\n\nas a whole.         29 U.S.C. § 160(e)-(f); E.C. Waste, 359 F.3d at 42;\n\nMcGaw of P.R., Inc. v. NLRB, 135 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997); see\n\nalso NLRB v. S.E. Nichols, Inc., 862 F.2d 952, 956 (2d Cir. 1988)\n\n(\"[I]n cases where difficult issues regarding employer motivation\n\nare of primary concern, the Act vests primary responsibility in the\n\nBoard    to   resolve       these    critical        issues    of   fact.\").      \"[T]he\n\npossibility     of       drawing     two    inconsistent      conclusions      from   the\n\nevidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from\n\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\"                      Hosp. San Pablo, 207\n\nF.3d at 70 (alteration in original) (quoting Am. Textile Mfrs.\n\nInst.,   Inc.       v.    Donovan,    452     U.S.    490,    523   (1981))    (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n              We turn to the question of whether the Hospital has met\n\nits   burden    of       showing    that     the   Board's     conclusions     that   the\n\nHospital engaged in unfair labor practices are not supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence on the record as a whole.                      In that context we\n\ndescribe the pertinent facts.\n\n                                             II.\n\n              The Board sustained the ALJ's findings that the Hospital\n\nhad threatened and disciplined Garcia for his union activities.\n\nHosp. Cristo Redentor, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 1.                              There is\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fadequate support in the record for those findings and conclusions.\n\nWe summarize the record; more details are to be found in the\n\nBoard's decision, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65.\n\n            Garcia started working as a registered nurse at the\n\nHospital in February 1995.2            After a 1998 election, the Board\n\ncertified a union to be the exclusive bargaining representative for\n\na   unit   of   registered   nurses.         Negotiations   for   a   collective\n\nbargaining agreement started in November 1998.               In January 1999,\n\nGarcia became the union delegate for the unit employees in the\n\nemergency room.       In the meantime, the relationship between the\n\nHospital and the union grew fractious.             The union filed an unfair\n\nlabor practice charge in April 1999. Over the next fifteen months,\n\nthe union filed several additional unfair labor practice charges\n\nagainst the Hospital.        The General Counsel issued a number of\n\ncomplaints.\n\n            After Garcia became a delegate, he received, for the\n\nfirst time, a written warning from his supervisor, Osvaldo Rivera\n\nDavid (\"Rivera\").      It warned Garcia that he needed to improve his\n\nattitude.       Thereafter, Garcia received a series of disciplinary\n\nwarnings about his attitude.      In a letter to Garcia, Rivera stated\n\nthat Garcia's \"attitude problems\" consisted of Garcia's expressing\n\n\n\n      2\n          Garcia began work at the Guayama Area Hospital. In June\n1998, the Hospital was privatized and became the Hospital Cristo\nRedentor, Inc.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fdissatisfaction with some hospital working conditions and policies\n\nand   making    complaints    about       inequitable     shift    allotments     and\n\nfavoritism by management in front of patients and visitors.\n\n            On July 7, 2000, Human Resources Director Ivette Lacot\n\nRamos   (\"Lacot\")     and    others        met   with     Garcia    and    a    union\n\nrepresentative about Garcia's \"attitude problems.\"                    On July 27,\n\n2000,   Lacot    issued     Garcia    a    written      warning.     The       warning\n\nacknowledged Garcia's \"competence as a professional\" but warned him\n\nto stop making complaints about working conditions in front of co-\n\nworkers, patients, and visitors, particularly because he acted as\n\na \"leader.\"\n\n            After a disagreement in March 2001 about whether Garcia\n\nhad failed to comply with medical records protocols when he wrote\n\nin a correction over a mistake on a patient's chart, Rivera again\n\nissued a warning to Garcia about his attitude problems. Management\n\nmet with Garcia and various union representatives on March 29 to\n\ndiscuss the incident.\n\n            After accusations of other alleged improprieties, which\n\nwere denied by Garcia, Lacot issued Garcia a \"formal admonishment,\"\n\nwhich purported to memorialize the March 29 meeting, noted the\n\nsubsequent alleged incidents, and again requested that Garcia\n\n\"improve [his] attitude.\"             The admonishment acknowledged that\n\nGarcia had said he was feeling persecuted because he was a union\n\ndelegate.\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f           Eventually Garcia was suspended on May 11, 2001 for\n\nalleged misconduct on April 23.          On April 23, Garcia had been\n\nresponsible for the key to the emergency room narcotics cabinet,\n\nwhich was kept locked at all times.             The emergency room was\n\nunderstaffed, and when no nurses were available to take patient\n\nsamples to the laboratory for analysis, Garcia twice left the\n\nemergency room, with the narcotics key, to take samples to the lab.\n\n During both of Garcia's trips to the lab, a patient began\n\nconvulsing in the emergency room; both times, Garcia's absence\n\ncaused a delay in administering a drug to the patient.              Later\n\nduring the same shift, Garcia used the emergency room loudspeaker\n\nto call on his coworkers to assist him.        The Hospital alleged that\n\nGarcia had announced over the loudspeaker that \"there [was] a lot\n\nof work, that [he was] the only one who was working[,] and [that]\n\nnobody was helping [him].\"      Garcia disputed that he had insulted\n\nhis coworkers.\n\n           Garcia was discharged from employment on October 19,\n\n2001.   The discharge came after an incident on October 6 in which\n\nGarcia had left the Hospital to attend to a medical emergency of a\n\nfamily member.    The Hospital claimed that Garcia had not received\n\nhis supervisor's permission before leaving.           The Hospital also\n\nalleged   that   on   October   18,   Garcia   had   made   inappropriate\n\nstatements suggesting a suicide attempt to a mother when her\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fdaughter was admitted to the emergency room after having taken five\n\nPanadol PM tablets and fainted at school.\n\n                                  III.\n\nA.        Substantial Evidence Analysis\n\n          1.   Whether the General Counsel Met His Burden\n\n          On petition for review, the Hospital appears to argue\n\nthat the General Counsel failed to meet his burden under Wright\n\nLine on the alleged violations.3         The record makes it easy to\n\nconclude that the burden was met.      There were several smoking guns\n\nindicating that the Hospital both had anti-union animus and had\n\nretaliated against Garcia for his role in the union.\n\n          Indeed,   there   was   an   explicit   conversation   between\n\nmanagement and Garcia in which Garcia was told that his lot in life\n\nwould improve if he abandoned his union activities.        The general\n\nsupervisor of nursing services, Ausberto Felix Ortiz (\"Felix\"),\n\npoint-blank asked Garcia if he was going to engage in union protest\n\nactivity on August 6, 2001.       When Garcia said that he was, Felix\n\nreplied that that was why Garcia would never be a supervisor and\n\nwhy he was \"always in trouble.\"     After a pregnant pause, Felix then\n\nmade a comment associating the union -- and Garcia by implication\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          The Board expressly noted that the Hospital had not\ncontested the ALJ's determination that Garcia's union activity was\na motivating factor in the suspension decision.      Hosp. Cristo\nRedentor, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 4.      We read the Hospital's\npleadings to the Board somewhat more charitably.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f-- with a Satanic sect.      The ALJ found Felix's denial of the\n\nconversation not credible.\n\n            The Hospital argues that the ALJ improperly based his\n\ncredibility determination on the plausibility of Felix's assertion\n\nthat he had no interest in union affairs.   The ALJ noted that Felix\n\n\"carried significant responsibility for providing adequate nursing\n\nstaff during union picketing,\" and that Felix conceded that he\n\nundertook necessary preparations before each union strike.    Hosp.\n\nCristo Redentor, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 17.    This court will set\n\naside an ALJ's credibility finding \"only when [the ALJ] oversteps\n\nthe bounds of reason.\"   Holyoke Visiting Nurses Ass'n v. NLRB, 11\n\nF.3d 302, 308 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting NLRB v. Am. Spring Bed Mfg.\n\nCo., 670 F.2d 1236, 1242 (1st Cir. 1982)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     It was certainly not unreasonable for the ALJ to\n\nconclude that a supervisor charged with ensuring adequate nursing\n\ncoverage during union strikes would have at least some interest in\n\nthat union activity, and that Felix's denial of any such interest\n\nwas not credible.

Credibility\n\nassessments by the ALJ, in particular, are entitled to great\n\nweight, \"since he heard and saw the witnesses testify.\" McGaw, 135\n\nF.3d at 7 (quoting Holyoke Visiting Nurses Ass'n, 11 F.3d at 308)\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted); accord Hosp. San Pablo, 207\n\nF.3d at 70.\n\n              There was additional evidence of anti-union animus.         In\n\nSeptember 2001, Garcia was called in for a disciplinary meeting;\n\nthe Hospital had apparently prepared a letter dismissing Garcia for\n\na supposed incident on a particular date.                The Hospital had\n\nneglected to look at its own records, which, when produced at the\n\nunion's insistence, showed that Garcia had not been on duty on the\n\nday of the alleged incident.          Management's trumping up charges to\n\ndismiss a union representative is hardly evidence of neutrality.\n\n              Further, Ingrid Vega Méndez, a union representative who\n\nattended the September meeting, testified that Lacot, the human\n\nresources director, said after the meeting that Garcia's attitude\n\ncould not be tolerated \"and that [it] could bring about his\n\ndismissal, and, even more so, when he was the delegate.\"            Lacot's\n\ncomment directly ties management's actions to Garcia's role as a\n\nunion delegate.      The Board thus had unusually strong evidence that\n\nGarcia's union activity was a \"substantial or motivating factor\" in\n\nthe actions taken against him.\n\n              2.   Whether the Hospital Met Its Burden\n\n              The Hospital also argues that even if the General Counsel\n\nmet his burden under Wright Line, substantial evidence does not\n\nsupport the Board's conclusion that the Hospital had not met its\n\nburden   of    showing   it   would   have   suspended   Garcia   and   later\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fterminated his employment in the absence of his union activity.4\n\nThe Hospital argued to the Board that two incidents would have led\n\nto the suspension even if Garcia had not been a union delegate:\n\nGarcia's absence from the emergency room with the narcotics key and\n\nGarcia's         making   an   announcement         deemed     inappropriate    by   the\n\nHospital over the emergency room loudspeaker.\n\n                 The Board justifiably found that the Hospital had not met\n\nits burden and that the true reason for suspending Garcia was\n\nGarcia's union activity.5              As the Board noted, the Human Resources\n\nDirector herself referred to the narcotics-key incident as a \"minor\n\noffense\" and testified that she had not disciplined Garcia for it.\n\nHosp. Cristo Redentor, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 4.                      There also was\n\nevidence that other employees had similarly left the emergency room\n\nwith       the   narcotics     key,    but   no     evidence    that   they    had   been\n\nsimilarly disciplined.                As both the ALJ and the Board stated,\n\nGarcia was faced with a Hobson's choice among several undesirable\n\nalternatives when he left with the key in order to take patient\n\n\n       4\n          The Hospital's arguments are primarily focused on\nGarcia's dismissal. Giving the Hospital the benefit of the doubt,\nwe also review the Board's finding that Garcia's suspension also\nconstituted an unfair labor practice. To the extent the Hospital\nchallenges the Board's finding that Garcia was interrogated and\nthreatened because of his union membership, Felix's remarks to\nGarcia more than adequately support the finding of an unfair labor\npractice.\n       5\n          One member of the Board would have revised the ALJ's\nfinding on the suspension, but joined in adopting the findings of\nviolations as to the interrogation, threats, and discharge. Hosp.\nCristo Redentor, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 6.\n\n                                             -14-\n\fsamples to the lab when no one else was able to do so.             Id. at 4,\n\n23.\n\n            The Hospital contends that Garcia should have left the\n\nnarcotics key in the emergency room when he went to the lab.               That\n\nmay be so, and it may even have been reasonable for the Hospital to\n\ntreat the incident as a serious one.              But the evidence in the\n\nrecord indicates that the Hospital did not treat such incidents as\n\nserious infractions.        The issue is not whether Garcia should have\n\nhandled the situation differently.\n\n            As for the loudspeaker episode, the ALJ characterized the\n\nannouncement as a brief outburst by a frustrated Garcia, who was\n\nusing undiplomatic means to get more staffing assistance in a\n\nseverely understaffed emergency room.         Id. at 22-23.       As the ALJ\n\nand the Board indicated, the record is devoid of evidence, save for\n\nthe    suspension    letter     itself,    that    Garcia   actually       made\n\nobjectionable remarks over the loudspeaker.           Id. at 5, 23.        Even\n\nassuming that the Hospital's characterization of the episode is\n\ncorrect, the record does not show that Garcia would have been\n\nsuspended absent his union activities. The suspension letter notes\n\nthat the loudspeaker incident was the third time that there had\n\nbeen   a   problem   with   Garcia's   attitude,    and   that   because    the\n\n\"available corrective measures\" had been exhausted, Garcia was\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fbeing suspended.6     However, at least one of the prior two incidents\n\ninvolved union-related activities. The Board's conclusion that the\n\nHospital   would    not    have       suspended    Garcia   save   for     his   union\n\nactivities is thus supported by substantial evidence.\n\n           The Board also supportably found that the Hospital had\n\nnot met its burden of showing it would have terminated Garcia's\n\nemployment   regardless          of     union     activity.        The    Hospital's\n\ntermination letter gave three reasons for discharging Garcia: the\n\nOctober 6 incident in which he left the hospital to attend to a\n\nfamily emergency, the incidents resulting in his suspension, and\n\nthe improper diagnosis of a patient on October 18.                       Our earlier\n\nholding that substantial evidence supports the Board's findings as\n\nto the incidents resulting in Garcia's suspension eliminate them as\n\na legitimate basis for termination.\n\n           As the ALJ recognized, the evidence indicates that Garcia\n\nspoke with his supervisor before leaving the Hospital on October 6.\n\nId. at 15-16.        The supervisor's testimony indicated that she\n\nunderstood that Garcia had an emergency and needed to leave the\n\nHospital, and that after she was unable to find the appropriate\n\nauthorization      form,   she    accepted        instead   a   note     from    Garcia\n\nexplaining his reason for leaving.\n\n     6\n          The letter also noted a problem with absenteeism for\nwhich Garcia was reprimanded in April 1999. The letter indicated,\nhowever, that Garcia had \"corrected\" this problem.      Under the\nHospital's policy, then, it was not a valid basis for the\nsuspension.\n\n                                         -16-\n\f           Likewise, the ALJ's finding that the October 18 incident\n\ndid not warrant dismissal is supported by the record.       On October\n\n18, 2001, a young girl arrived at the emergency room after having\n\nfainted.   The Hospital claims that Garcia told the girl's mother\n\nthat the girl likely had tried to commit suicide.         In fact, the\n\ngirl had taken several Panadol tablets for a headache from having\n\nnot eaten and had then fainted because she had not had enough to\n\neat.   In the termination letter, this episode was characterized as\n\na breach of the Hospital's privacy and confidentiality policy.       As\n\nthe ALJ indicated, there is no evidence that Garcia revealed\n\nconfidential information.   Id. at 23.\n\n           The Hospital has now recharacterized the violation as\n\nmore general \"improper handling of patient care.\"       Regardless, the\n\nonly evidence in the record is that Garcia assumed based on the\n\ninformation provided to him that the girl had attempted to commit\n\nsuicide, and that in informing the mother of the procedures that\n\nher daughter would undergo, Garcia indicated that if necessary the\n\ndaughter would be subject to the protocol for dealing with cases of\n\nattempted suicide.   There is no evidence to support the Hospital's\n\nsuggestion that Garcia diagnosed the patient, and in fact Garcia\n\ndirectly denied having done so and indicated that he had told the\n\nmother that the physician would be the one to make the diagnosis.\n\n           The   Hospital   also       presents   an     after-the-fact\n\njustification for the suspension and discharge.        It now says that\n\n                                -17-\n\fthe suspension and discharge were justified by an admitted medical\n\nrecords mistake by Garcia.         On March 12, 2001, Garcia made a\n\nmistake recording a medication dosage onto a patient's chart. When\n\nhe corrected the mistake, he deviated from Hospital protocol, which\n\nrequired him to strike through the erroneous order, write \"Omit,\"\n\nand initial and date the strike-through before noting the correct\n\norder.    Instead, Garcia simply wrote the correct order on top of\n\nthe incorrect order.\n\n             The Hospital characterizes the episode as an attempt to\n\nevade responsibility for a medical mistake, in which the incorrect\n\ndosage actually was administered to the patient.7          The record does\n\nnot support such an argument.      As the ALJ noted, the correct dosage\n\nwas written over the incorrect dosage without any apparent attempt\n\nto conceal the change. Moreover, this error in correcting a record\n\nwas not a reason proffered by the Hospital in either the suspension\n\nletter or the termination letter. The Hospital's volte face on the\n\ngrounds for suspension and termination undermines its argument.\n\nSee   E.C.   Waste,   359   F.3d   at   44   (\"[A]n   employer's   shifting\n\nexplanations for discharging an employee may themselves serve\n\neither to ground or to reinforce a finding of pretext.\"); see also\n\nSantiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 56\n\n\n      7\n           Although  Garcia   denied   that   any  medication   was\nincorrectly administered, the ALJ found that such an error had been\nmade by a trainee nurse for whom Garcia ultimately was responsible.\nHosp. Cristo Redentor, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 13.\n\n                                    -18-\n\f(1st Cir. 2000).      The ALJ was justified in finding that the\n\nrecording error was at most a minor records protocol error that did\n\nnot justify suspension or dismissal.\n\n            The sum, it is true, may be greater than the total of its\n\nparts.     A series of incidents none of which individually would\n\nwarrant dismissal in total may nonetheless justify it.             But that\n\nargument cannot plausibly be made by the Hospital here. The after-\n\nthe-fact    justification   offered   by   the   Hospital   only    further\n\nsupports the Board's conclusion that the Hospital's proffered\n\nreasons for the suspension and discharge were pretext.\n\n            The Board's finding that the Hospital engaged in unfair\n\nlabor practices is supported by substantial evidence.\n\nB.          Puerto Rico Law 80\n\n            The Hospital argues, from its view of the facts, that it\n\nhad \"just cause\" under Puerto Rico Law 80 to dismiss Garcia for\n\nflagrant offenses, and so it cannot have violated the NLRA.             The\n\nHospital urges us to look to Law 80 in determining whether an\n\nemployer suspended or discharged an employee \"for cause,\"8 29\n\nU.S.C. § 160(c), and argues that its supposed compliance with Law\n\n80 satisfies its burden under Wright Line.       The Hospital made this\n\nargument to the Board, but the Board did not discuss it, presumably\n\n\n     8\n          Because the Hospital expressly concedes that federal law\ngoverns, we do not discuss the NLRA's preemption of inconsistent\nstate law. See, e.g., Building & Constr. Trades Council v. Assoc.\nBuilders & Contractors of Mass./R.I., Inc., 507 U.S. 218, 224\n(1993).\n\n                                 -19-\n\fbecause it found that Garcia was suspended and discharged because\n\nof his union activities.\n\n             We   discuss   the   issue   simply     to    emphasize   that   any\n\nemployer argument that a Board order may not be enforced because\n\nthe employer has arguably complied with Law 80 necessarily fails\n\nfor a series of reasons. The Hospital misperceives both the effect\n\nof local law and the limited role of judicial review of Board\n\ndecisions.\n\n             Section 10(c) of the NLRA states, in relevant part: \"No\n\norder   of   the   Board    shall   require    the    reinstatement      of   any\n\nindividual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or\n\nthe payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was\n\nsuspended or discharged for cause.\"           29 U.S.C. § 160(c).       There is\n\nno reason whatsoever to think that Congress, in setting uniform\n\nnational      standards     governing       labor         relations,   intended\n\nsection 10(c) to incorporate laws such as Puerto Rico Law 80.                 Cf.\n\nNLRB v. E. Mass. St. Ry. Co., 235 F.2d 700, 709 (1st Cir. 1956)\n\n(noting the development by the Board of a section 10(c) \"for cause\"\n\nbody of case law).\n\n             Indeed,   we   have    consistently      held      that   purported\n\ncompliance with Law 80 does not preclude a finding of an unfair\n\nlabor practice.      We have rejected claims that Law 80 requires (or\n\nat least permits) layoffs on the basis of seniority, and that this\n\nprovides a defense to an allegation of an unfair labor practice.\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fSee, e.g., McGaw, 135 F.3d at 9-11.               In E.C. Waste, we rejected a\n\nclaim based on the effect of Law 80 on a period of probation.                          359\n\nF.3d at 43-44.\n\n               Nor, as a matter of Puerto Rico law, is Law 80 itself\n\nintended to serve as a defense to an unfair labor practice charge.\n\nAs we noted in Rodriguez v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 816 F.2d 24\n\n(1st Cir. 1987), Law 80 \"was intended to increase protection for\n\ndismissed      workers.\"       Id.   at    27.       The    Guidelines          for    the\n\nInterpretation       and     Application     of     Law     80    (May        30,   1976)\n\n(\"Guidelines\"), promulgated by the Puerto Rico Department of Labor\n\nand    Human    Resources,    indicate     that    Law     80    was    not    meant    to\n\ninterfere with the enforcement of the NLRA.                      The Guidelines are\n\nclear that \"if [a] dismissal of an employee turns out to be an\n\nillegal work practice, the applicable law is the Puerto Rico Labor\n\nRelations Act or the National Labor Relations Act, as the case may\n\nbe.\"    McGaw, 135 F.3d at 10-11 (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nGuidelines at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).                          Moreover,\n\nthe Hospital's argument requires an inversion of logic. As we said\n\nin McGaw, it \"would be perverse indeed to allow [the employer] now\n\nto invoke a statute enacted for the protection of workers as a\n\njustification for its unlawful labor practices.\"                       Id. at 10.\n\n               The Hospital also misunderstands a basic principle of\n\njudicial review in invoking Law 80 as a defense to enforcement of\n\nthe Board's order.         It is the ALJ and the Board who are the finders\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fof fact; Law 80 does not change that.    The ALJ's and the Board's\n\nfactual determinations must be upheld if based on substantial\n\nevidence.    E.g., E.C. Waste, 359 F.3d at 42.      The Board has\n\nsupportably found that Garcia was suspended and discharged because\n\nof his union activities, not because of any deficiency in his\n\nperformance of his duties. Hosp. Cristo Redentor, 347 N.L.R.B. No.\n\n65, at 1.\n\n            We deny the Hospital's petition for review and grant\n\nenforcement of the Board's order.   Costs are awarded to the Board.\n\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f",

Transportation Management Corp.,</i> 462 U.S. 393, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983), the Supreme Court set forth the test for determining whether an employer has an unlawful motive. <i>Id.</i> at 395, 404, 103 S.Ct. 2469. The <i>Transportation Management</i> Court adopted the test announced by the Board in <i>Wright Line,</i> 251 N.L.R.B. 1083, 1089 (1980), <i>enforced on other grounds,</i> 662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir.1981). Under the <i>Wright Line</i> test, the Board's General Counsel must first demonstrate that \"the employee's protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action.\" <i>Transp. Mgmt.,</i> 462 U.S. at 401, 103 S.Ct. 2469; <i>accord Holsum,</i> 456 F.3d at 269. The General Counsel is not required to demonstrate that the employee's protected union activity was the sole factor for the discharge. <i>Holsum,</i> 456 F.3d at 269; <i>accord NLRB v. Hosp. San Pablo, Inc.,</i> 207 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the General Counsel has made the showing that union animus was a motivating factor in the adverse employment action, the employer must prove, as an affirmative defense, that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the employee's protected activity. <i>Transp. Mgmt.,</i> 462 U.S. at 400-03, 103 S.Ct. 2469; <i>Holsum,</i> 456 F.3d at 269. Even if the employer proffers a \"seemingly plausible explanation,\" the Board need not accept such an explanation at face value. <i>E.C. Waste, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 359 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.2004). Rather, \"[i]f the Board supportably finds that the reasons advanced by the employer are either insufficient or pretextual, the violation is deemed proven.\" <i>Holsum,</i> 456 F.3d at 269 (quoting <i>E.C.

Among the factors the Board often considers in assessing the unlawfulness of an employer's motive are the timing of the adverse action in relation to the union activity, the employer's hostility toward union activity, and the employer's reliance on pretextual justifications. <i>See, e.g., E.C.

Cristo Redentor,</i> 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 1. There is adequate support in the record for those findings and conclusions. We summarize the record; more details are to be found in the Board's decision, 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia started working as a registered nurse at the Hospital in February 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> After a 1998 election, the Board certified a union to be the exclusive bargaining representative for a unit of registered nurses. Negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement started in November 1998. In January 1999, Garcia became the union delegate for the unit employees in the emergency room. In the meantime, the relationship between the Hospital and the union grew fractious. The union filed an unfair labor practice charge in April 1999. Over the next fifteen months, the union filed several additional unfair labor practice charges against the Hospital. The General Counsel issued a number of complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Garcia became a delegate, he received, for the first time, a written warning from his supervisor, Osvaldo Rivera David (\"Rivera\"). It warned Garcia that he needed to improve his attitude. Thereafter, Garcia received a series of disciplinary warnings about his attitude. In a letter to Garcia, Rivera stated that Garcia's \"attitude problems\" consisted of Garcia's expressing dissatisfaction with some hospital working conditions and policies and making complaints about inequitable shift allotments and favoritism by management in front of patients and visitors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 2000, Human Resources Director Ivette Lacot Ramos (\"Lacot\") and others met with Garcia and a union representative about Garcia's \"attitude problems.\" On July 27, 2000, Lacot issued Garcia a written warning. The warning acknowledged Garcia's \"competence as a professional\" but warned him to stop making complaints about working conditions in front of co-workers, patients, and visitors, particularly because he acted as a \"leader.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a disagreement in March 2001 about whether Garcia had failed to comply with medical records protocols when he wrote in a correction over a mistake on a patient's chart, Rivera again issued a warning to Garcia about his attitude problems. Management met with Garcia and various union representatives on March 29 to discuss the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After accusations of other alleged improprieties, which were denied by Garcia, Lacot issued Garcia a \"formal admonishment,\" which purported to memorialize the March 29 meeting, noted the subsequent alleged incidents, and again requested that Garcia \"improve [his] attitude.\" The admonishment acknowledged that Garcia had said he was feeling persecuted because he was a union delegate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually Garcia was suspended on May 11, 2001 for alleged misconduct on April 23. On April 23, Garcia had been responsible for the key to the emergency room narcotics cabinet, which was kept locked at all times. The emergency room was understaffed, and when no nurses were available to take patient samples to the laboratory for analysis, Garcia twice left the emergency room, with the narcotics key, to take samples to the lab. During both of Garcia's trips to the lab, a patient began convulsing in the emergency room; both times, Garcia's absence caused a delay in administering a drug to the patient. Later during the same shift, Garcia used the emergency room loudspeaker to call on his coworkers to assist him. The Hospital alleged that Garcia had announced over the loudspeaker that \"there [was] a lot of work, that [he was] the only one who was working[,] and [that] nobody was helping [him].\" Garcia disputed that he had insulted his coworkers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia was discharged from employment on October 19, 2001. The discharge came after an incident on October 6 in which Garcia had left the Hospital to attend to a medical emergency of a family member. The Hospital claimed that Garcia had not received his supervisor's permission before leaving. The Hospital also alleged that on October 18, Garcia had made inappropriate statements suggesting a suicide attempt to a mother when her daughter was admitted to the emergency room after having taken five Panadol PM tablets and fainted at school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Substantial Evidence Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Whether the General Counsel Met His Burden</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On petition for review, the Hospital appears to argue that the General Counsel failed to meet his burden under <i>Wright Line</i> on the alleged violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The record makes it easy to conclude that the burden was met. There were several smoking guns indicating that the Hospital both had anti-union animus and had retaliated against Garcia for his role in the union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, there was an explicit conversation between management and Garcia in which Garcia was told that his lot in life would improve if he abandoned his union activities. The general supervisor of nursing services, Ausberto Felix Ortiz (\"Felix\"), point-blank asked Garcia if he was going to engage in union protest activity on August 6, 2001. When Garcia said that he was, Felix replied that that was why Garcia would never be a supervisor and why he was \"always in trouble.\" After a pregnant pause, Felix then made a comment associating the union &#8212; and Garcia by implication &#8212; with a Satanic sect. The ALJ found Felix's denial of the conversation not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital argues that the ALJ improperly based his credibility determination on the plausibility of Felix's assertion that he had no interest in union affairs. The ALJ noted that Felix \"carried significant responsibility for providing adequate nursing staff during union picketing,\" and that Felix conceded that he undertook necessary preparations before each union strike. <i>Hosp. Cristo Redentor,</i> 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 17. This court will set aside an ALJ's credibility finding \"only when [the ALJ] oversteps the bounds of reason.\" <i>Holyoke Visiting Nurses Ass'n v. NLRB,</i> 11 F.3d 302, 308 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting <i>NLRB v. Am. Spring Bed Mfg. Co.,</i> 670 F.2d 1236, 1242 (1st Cir.1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted). It was certainly not unreasonable for the ALJ to conclude that a supervisor charged with ensuring adequate nursing coverage during union strikes would have at least some interest in that union activity, and that Felix's denial of any such interest was not credible. Moreover, the ALJ buttressed his conclusion with his observation of \"Felix's haughty demeanor on the witness stand.\" <i>Hosp. Cristo Redentor,</i> 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 18. Credibility assessments by the ALJ, in particular, are entitled to great weight, \"since he heard and saw the witnesses testify.\" <i>McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 7 (quoting <i>Holyoke Visiting Nurses Ass'n,</i> 11 F.3d at 308) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord Hosp. San Pablo,</i> 207 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was additional evidence of anti-union animus. In September 2001, Garcia was called in for a disciplinary meeting; the Hospital had apparently prepared a letter dismissing Garcia for a supposed incident on a particular date. The Hospital had neglected to look at its own records, which, when produced at the union's insistence, showed that Garcia had not been on duty on the day of the alleged incident. Management's trumping up charges to dismiss a union representative is hardly evidence of neutrality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Ingrid Vega M&#233;ndez, a union representative who attended the September meeting, testified that Lacot, the human resources director, said after the meeting that Garcia's attitude could not be tolerated \"and that [it] could bring about his dismissal, and, even more so, when he was the delegate.\" Lacot's comment directly ties management's actions to Garcia's role as a union delegate. The Board thus had unusually strong evidence that Garcia's union activity was a \"substantial or motivating factor\" in the actions taken against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Whether the Hospital Met Its Burden</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital also argues that even if the General Counsel met his burden under <i>Wright Line,</i> substantial evidence does not support the Board's conclusion that the Hospital had not met its burden of showing it would have suspended Garcia and later terminated his employment in the absence of his union activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Hospital argued to the Board that two incidents would have led to the suspension even if Garcia had not been a union delegate: Garcia's absence from the emergency room with the narcotics key and Garcia's making an announcement deemed inappropriate by the Hospital over the emergency room loudspeaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board justifiably found that the Hospital had not met its burden and that the true reason for suspending Garcia was Garcia's union activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As the Board noted, the Human Resources Director herself referred to the narcotics-key incident as a \"minor offense\" and testified that she had not disciplined Garcia for it. <i>Hosp. Cristo Redentor,</i> 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 4. There also was evidence that other employees had similarly left the emergency room with the narcotics key, but no evidence that they had been similarly disciplined. As both the ALJ and the Board stated, Garcia was faced with a Hobson's choice among several undesirable alternatives when he left with the key in order to take patient samples to the lab when no one else was able to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 4, 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital contends that Garcia should have left the narcotics key in the emergency room when he went to the lab. That may be so, and it may even have been reasonable for the Hospital to treat the incident as a serious one. But the evidence in the record indicates that the Hospital <i>did not</i> treat such incidents as serious infractions. The issue is not whether Garcia should have handled the situation differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the loudspeaker episode, the ALJ characterized the announcement as a brief outburst by a frustrated Garcia, who was using undiplomatic means to get more staffing assistance in a severely understaffed emergency room. <i>Id.</i> at 22-23. As the ALJ and the Board indicated, the record is devoid of evidence, save for the suspension letter itself, that Garcia actually made objectionable remarks over the loudspeaker. <i>Id.</i> at 5, 23. Even assuming that the Hospital's characterization of the episode is correct, the record does not show that Garcia would have been suspended absent his union activities. The suspension letter notes that the loudspeaker incident was the third time that there had been a problem with Garcia's attitude, and that because the \"available corrective measures\" had been exhausted, Garcia was being suspended.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> However, at least one of the prior two incidents involved union-related activities. The Board's conclusion that the Hospital would not have suspended Garcia save for his union activities is thus supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board also supportably found that the Hospital had not met its burden of showing it would have terminated Garcia's employment regardless of union activity. The Hospital's termination letter gave three reasons for discharging Garcia: the October 6 incident in which he left the hospital to attend to a family emergency, the incidents resulting in his suspension, and the improper diagnosis of a patient on October 18. Our earlier holding that substantial evidence supports the Board's findings as to the incidents resulting in Garcia's suspension eliminate them as a legitimate basis for termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the ALJ recognized, the evidence indicates that Garcia spoke with his supervisor before leaving the Hospital on October 6. <i>Id.</i> at 15-16. The supervisor's testimony indicated that she understood that Garcia had an emergency and needed to leave the Hospital, and that after she was unable to find the appropriate authorization form, she accepted instead a note from Garcia explaining his reason for leaving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, the ALJ's finding that the October 18 incident did not warrant dismissal is supported by the record. On October 18, 2001, a young girl arrived at the emergency room after having fainted. The Hospital claims that Garcia told the girl's mother that the girl likely had tried to commit suicide. In fact, the girl had taken several Panadol tablets for a headache from having not eaten and had then fainted because she had not had enough to eat. In the termination letter, this episode was characterized as a breach of the Hospital's privacy and confidentiality policy. As the ALJ indicated, there is no evidence that Garcia revealed confidential information. <i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital has now recharacterized the violation as more general \"improper handling of patient care.\" Regardless, the only evidence in the record is that Garcia assumed based on the information provided to him that the girl had attempted to commit suicide, and that in informing the mother of the procedures that her daughter would undergo, Garcia indicated that if necessary the daughter would be subject to the protocol for dealing with cases of attempted suicide. There is no evidence to support the Hospital's suggestion that Garcia diagnosed the patient, and in fact Garcia directly denied having done so and indicated that he had told the mother that the physician would be the one to make the diagnosis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital also presents an after-the-fact justification for the suspension and discharge. It now says that the suspension and discharge were justified by an admitted medical records mistake by Garcia. On March 12, 2001, Garcia made a mistake recording a medication dosage onto a patient's chart. When he corrected the mistake, he deviated from Hospital protocol, which required him to strike through the erroneous order, write \"Omit,\" and initial and date the strike-through before noting the correct order. Instead, Garcia simply wrote the correct order on top of the incorrect order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital characterizes the episode as an attempt to evade responsibility for a <i>medical</i> mistake, in which the incorrect dosage actually was administered to the patient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The record does not support such an argument. As the ALJ noted, the correct dosage was written over the incorrect dosage without any apparent attempt to conceal the change. Moreover, this error in correcting a record was not a reason proffered by the Hospital in either the suspension letter or the termination letter. The Hospital's volte face on the grounds for suspension and termination undermines its argument. <i>See E.C. Waste,</i> 359 F.3d at 44 (\"[A]n employer's shifting explanations for discharging an employee may themselves serve either to ground or to reinforce a finding of pretext.\"); <i>see also Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> 217 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 2000). The ALJ was justified in finding that the recording error was at most a minor records protocol error that did not justify suspension or dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sum, it is true, may be greater than the total of its parts. A series of incidents none of which individually would warrant dismissal in total may nonetheless justify it. But that argument cannot plausibly be made by the Hospital here. The after-the-fact justification offered by the Hospital only further supports the Board's conclusion that the Hospital's proffered reasons for the suspension and discharge were pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's finding that the Hospital engaged in unfair labor practices is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Puerto Rico Law 80</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital argues, from its view of the facts, that it had \"just cause\" under Puerto Rico Law 80 to dismiss Garcia for flagrant offenses, and so it cannot have violated the NLRA. The Hospital urges us to look to Law 80 in determining whether an employer suspended or discharged an employee \"for cause,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(c), and argues that its supposed compliance with Law 80 satisfies its burden under <i>Wright Line.</i> The Hospital made this argument to the Board, but the Board did not discuss it, presumably because it found that Garcia was suspended and discharged because of his union activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss the issue simply to emphasize that any employer argument that a Board order may not be enforced because the employer has arguably complied with Law 80 necessarily fails for a series of reasons. The Hospital misperceives both the effect of local law and the limited role of judicial review of Board decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 10(c) of the NLRA states, in relevant part: \"No order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(c). There is no reason whatsoever to think that Congress, in setting uniform national standards governing labor relations, intended section 10(c) to incorporate laws such as Puerto Rico Law 80. <i>Cf. NLRB v. E. Mass. St. Ry. Co.,</i> 235 F.2d 700, 709 (1st Cir.1956) (noting the development by the Board of a section 10(c) \"for cause\" body of case law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, we have consistently held that purported compliance with Law 80 does not preclude a finding of an unfair labor practice. We have rejected claims that Law 80 requires (or at least permits) layoffs on the basis of seniority, and that this provides a defense to an allegation of an unfair labor practice. <i>See, e.g., McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 9-11. In <i>E.C. Waste,</i> we rejected a claim based on the effect of Law 80 on a period of probation. 359 F.3d at 43-44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor, as a matter of Puerto Rico law, is Law 80 itself intended to serve as a defense to an unfair labor practice charge. As we noted in <i>Rodriguez v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 816 F.2d 24 (1st Cir.1987), Law 80 \"was intended to increase protection for dismissed workers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. The Guidelines for the Interpretation and Application of Law 80 (May 30, 1976) (\"Guidelines\"), promulgated by the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources, indicate that Law 80 was not meant to interfere with the enforcement of the NLRA. The Guidelines are clear that \"if [a] dismissal of an employee turns out to be an illegal work practice, the applicable law is the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Act or the National Labor Relations Act, as the case may be.\" <i>McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 10-11 (alteration in original) (quoting Guidelines at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the Hospital's argument requires an inversion of logic. As we said in <i>McGaw,</i> it \"would be perverse indeed to allow [the employer] now to invoke a statute enacted for the protection of workers as a justification for its unlawful labor practices.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital also misunderstands a basic principle of judicial review in invoking Law 80 as a defense to enforcement of the Board's order. It is the ALJ and the Board who are the finders of fact; Law 80 does not change that. The ALJ's and the Board's factual determinations must be upheld if based on substantial evidence. <i>E.g., E.C. Waste,</i> 359 F.3d at 42.

Negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement started in November 1998. In January 1999, Garcia became the union delegate for the unit employees in the emergency room. In the meantime, the relationship between the Hospital and the union grew fractious. The union filed an unfair labor practice charge in April 1999. Over the next fifteen months, the union filed several additional unfair labor practice charges against the Hospital.

It warned Garcia that he needed to improve his attitude. Thereafter, Garcia received a series of disciplinary warnings about his attitude. In a letter to Garcia, Rivera stated that Garcia's \"attitude problems\" consisted of Garcia's expressing dissatisfaction with some hospital working conditions and policies and making complaints about inequitable shift allotments and favoritism by management in front of patients and visitors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 2000, Human Resources Director Ivette Lacot Ramos (\"Lacot\") and others met with Garcia and a union representative about Garcia's \"attitude problems.\" On July 27, 2000, Lacot issued Garcia a written warning.

The emergency room was understaffed, and when no nurses were available to take patient samples to the laboratory for analysis, Garcia twice left the emergency room, with the narcotics key, to take samples to the lab. During both of Garcia's trips to the lab, a patient began convulsing in the emergency room; both times, Garcia's absence caused a delay in administering a drug to the patient. Later during the same shift, Garcia used the emergency room loudspeaker to call on his coworkers to assist him. The Hospital alleged that Garcia had announced over the loudspeaker that \"there [was] a lot of work, that [he was] the only one who was working[,] and [that] nobody was helping [him].\" Garcia disputed that he had insulted his coworkers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garcia was discharged from employment on October 19, 2001.

The Hospital claimed that Garcia had not received his supervisor's permission before leaving. The Hospital also alleged that on October 18, Garcia had made inappropriate statements suggesting a suicide attempt to a mother when her daughter was admitted to the emergency room after having taken five Panadol PM tablets and fainted at school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Substantial Evidence Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Whether the General Counsel Met His Burden</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On petition for review, the Hospital appears to argue that the General Counsel failed to meet his burden under <i>Wright Line</i> on the alleged violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The record makes it easy to conclude that the burden was met. There were several smoking guns indicating that the Hospital both had anti-union animus and had retaliated against Garcia for his role in the union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, there was an explicit conversation between management and Garcia in which Garcia was told that his lot in life would improve if he abandoned his union activities. The general supervisor of nursing services, Ausberto Felix Ortiz (\"Felix\"), point-blank asked Garcia if he was going to engage in union protest activity on August 6, 2001. When Garcia said that he was, Felix replied that that was why Garcia would never be a supervisor and why he was \"always in trouble.\" After a pregnant pause, Felix then made a comment associating the union &#8212; and Garcia by implication &#8212; with a Satanic sect. The ALJ found Felix's denial of the conversation not credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital argues that the ALJ improperly based his credibility determination on the plausibility of Felix's assertion that he had no interest in union affairs. The ALJ noted that Felix \"carried significant responsibility for providing adequate nursing staff during union picketing,\" and that Felix conceded that he undertook necessary preparations before each union strike. <i>Hosp. Cristo Redentor,</i> 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 17. This court will set aside an ALJ's credibility finding \"only when [the ALJ] oversteps the bounds of reason.\" <i>Holyoke Visiting Nurses Ass'n v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658543\"><a href=\"/opinion/658543/holyoke-visiting-nurses-association-and-oconnell-professional-nurse/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 308 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting <i>NLRB v. Am. Spring Bed Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399422\"><a href=\"/opinion/399422/national-labor-relations-board-v-american-spring-bed-manufacturing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></a></span>, 1242 (1st Cir.1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted). It was certainly not unreasonable for the ALJ to conclude that a supervisor charged with ensuring adequate nursing coverage during union strikes would have at least some interest in that union activity, and that Felix's denial of any such interest was not credible. Moreover, the ALJ buttressed his conclusion with his observation of \"Felix's haughty demeanor on the witness stand.\" <i>Hosp. Cristo Redentor,</i> 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 18. Credibility assessments by the ALJ, in particular, are entitled to great weight, \"since he heard and saw the witnesses testify.\" <i>McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 7 (quoting <i>Holyoke Visiting Nurses Ass'n,</i> 11 F.3d at 308) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord Hosp. San Pablo,</i> 207 F.3d at 70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was additional evidence of anti-union animus. In September 2001, Garcia was called in for a disciplinary meeting; the Hospital had apparently prepared a letter dismissing Garcia for a supposed incident on a particular date. The Hospital had neglected to look at its own records, which, when produced at the union's insistence, showed that Garcia had not been on duty on the day of the alleged incident. Management's trumping up charges to dismiss a union representative is hardly evidence of neutrality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Ingrid Vega M&#233;ndez, a union representative who attended the September meeting, testified that Lacot, the human resources director, said after the meeting that Garcia's attitude could not be tolerated \"and that [it] could bring about his dismissal, and, even more so, when he was the delegate.\" Lacot's comment directly ties management's actions to Garcia's role as a union delegate. The Board thus had unusually strong evidence that Garcia's union activity was a \"substantial or motivating factor\" in the actions taken against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Whether the Hospital Met Its Burden</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital also argues that even if the General Counsel met his burden under <i>Wright Line,</i> substantial evidence does not support the Board's conclusion that the Hospital had not met its burden of showing it would have suspended Garcia and later terminated his employment in the absence of his union activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Hospital argued to the Board that two incidents would have led to the suspension even if Garcia had not been a union delegate: Garcia's absence from the emergency room with the narcotics key and Garcia's making an announcement deemed inappropriate by the Hospital over the emergency room loudspeaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board justifiably found that the Hospital had not met its burden and that the true reason for suspending Garcia was Garcia's union activity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As the Board noted, the Human Resources Director herself referred to the narcotics-key incident as a \"minor offense\" and testified that she had not disciplined Garcia for it. <i>Hosp. Cristo Redentor,</i> 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 4. There also was evidence that other employees had similarly left the emergency room with the narcotics key, but no evidence that they had been similarly disciplined. As both the ALJ and the Board stated, Garcia was faced with a Hobson's choice among several undesirable alternatives when he left with the key in order to take patient samples to the lab when no one else was able to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 4, 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital contends that Garcia should have left the narcotics key in the emergency room when he went to the lab. That may be so, and it may even have been reasonable for the Hospital to treat the incident as a serious one. But the evidence in the record indicates that the Hospital <i>did not</i> treat such incidents as serious infractions. The issue is not whether Garcia should have handled the situation differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the loudspeaker episode, the ALJ characterized the announcement as a brief outburst by a frustrated Garcia, who was using undiplomatic means to get more staffing assistance in a severely understaffed emergency room. <i>Id.</i> at 22-23. As the ALJ and the Board indicated, the record is devoid of evidence, save for the suspension letter itself, that Garcia actually made objectionable remarks over the loudspeaker. <i>Id.</i> at 5, 23. Even assuming that the Hospital's characterization of the episode is correct, the record does not show that Garcia would have been suspended absent his union activities. The suspension letter notes that the loudspeaker incident was the third time that there had been a problem with Garcia's attitude, and that because the \"available corrective measures\" had been exhausted, Garcia was being suspended.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> However, at least one of the prior two incidents involved union-related activities. The Board's conclusion that the Hospital would not have suspended Garcia save for his union activities is thus supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board also supportably found that the Hospital had not met its burden of showing it would have terminated Garcia's employment regardless of union activity. The Hospital's termination letter gave three reasons for discharging Garcia: the October 6 incident in which he left the hospital to attend to a family emergency, the incidents resulting in his suspension, and the improper diagnosis of a patient on October 18. Our earlier holding that substantial evidence supports the Board's findings as to the incidents resulting in Garcia's suspension eliminate them as a legitimate basis for termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the ALJ recognized, the evidence indicates that Garcia spoke with his supervisor before leaving the Hospital on October 6. <i>Id.</i> at 15-16. The supervisor's testimony indicated that she understood that Garcia had an emergency and needed to leave the Hospital, and that after she was unable to find the appropriate authorization form, she accepted instead a note from Garcia explaining his reason for leaving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, the ALJ's finding that the October 18 incident did not warrant dismissal is supported by the record. On October 18, 2001, a young girl arrived at the emergency room after having fainted. The Hospital claims that Garcia told the girl's mother that the girl likely had tried to commit suicide. In fact, the girl had taken several Panadol tablets for a headache from having not eaten and had then fainted because she had not had enough to eat. In the termination letter, this episode was characterized as a breach of the Hospital's privacy and confidentiality policy. As the ALJ indicated, there is no evidence that Garcia revealed confidential information. <i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital has now recharacterized the violation as more general \"improper handling of patient care.\" Regardless, the only evidence in the record is that Garcia assumed based on the information provided to him that the girl had attempted to commit suicide, and that in informing the mother of the procedures that her daughter would undergo, Garcia indicated that if necessary the daughter would be subject to the protocol for dealing with cases of attempted suicide. There is no evidence to support the Hospital's suggestion that Garcia diagnosed the patient, and in fact Garcia directly denied having done so and indicated that he had told the mother that the physician would be the one to make the diagnosis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital also presents an after-the-fact justification for the suspension and discharge. It now says that the suspension and discharge were justified by an admitted medical records mistake by Garcia. On March 12, 2001, Garcia made a mistake recording a medication dosage onto a patient's chart. When he corrected the mistake, he deviated from Hospital protocol, which required him to strike through the erroneous order, write \"Omit,\" and initial and date the strike-through before noting the correct order. Instead, Garcia simply wrote the correct order on top of the incorrect order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital characterizes the episode as an attempt to evade responsibility for a <i>medical</i> mistake, in which the incorrect dosage actually was administered to the patient.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The record does not support such an argument. As the ALJ noted, the correct dosage was written over the incorrect dosage without any apparent attempt to conceal the change. Moreover, this error in correcting a record was not a reason proffered by the Hospital in either the suspension letter or the termination letter. The Hospital's volte face on the grounds for suspension and termination undermines its argument. <i>See E.C. Waste,</i> 359 F.3d at 44 (\"[A]n employer's shifting explanations for discharging an employee may themselves serve either to ground or to reinforce a finding of pretext.\"); <i>see also Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198991\"><a href=\"/opinion/198991/santiago-ramos-v-centennial-pr-wire/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir. 2000). The ALJ was justified in finding that the recording error was at most a minor records protocol error that did not justify suspension or dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sum, it is true, may be greater than the total of its parts. A series of incidents none of which individually would warrant dismissal in total may nonetheless justify it. But that argument cannot plausibly be made by the Hospital here. The after-the-fact justification offered by the Hospital only further supports the Board's conclusion that the Hospital's proffered reasons for the suspension and discharge were pretext.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's finding that the Hospital engaged in unfair labor practices is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Puerto Rico Law 80</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital argues, from its view of the facts, that it had \"just cause\" under Puerto Rico Law 80 to dismiss Garcia for flagrant offenses, and so it cannot have violated the NLRA. The Hospital urges us to look to Law 80 in determining whether an employer suspended or discharged an employee \"for cause,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(c), and argues that its supposed compliance with Law 80 satisfies its burden under <i>Wright Line.</i> The Hospital made this argument to the Board, but the Board did not discuss it, presumably because it found that Garcia was suspended and discharged because of his union activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss the issue simply to emphasize that any employer argument that a Board order may not be enforced because the employer has arguably complied with Law 80 necessarily fails for a series of reasons. The Hospital misperceives both the effect of local law and the limited role of judicial review of Board decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 10(c) of the NLRA states, in relevant part: \"No order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(c). There is no reason whatsoever to think that Congress, in setting uniform national standards governing labor relations, intended section 10(c) to incorporate laws such as Puerto Rico Law 80. <i>Cf. NLRB v. E. Mass. St. Ry. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"240056\"><a href=\"/opinion/240056/national-labor-relations-board-v-eastern-massachusetts-street-railway/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span>, 709 (1st Cir.1956) (noting the development by the Board of a section 10(c) \"for cause\" body of case law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, we have consistently held that purported compliance with Law 80 does not preclude a finding of an unfair labor practice. We have rejected claims that Law 80 requires (or at least permits) layoffs on the basis of seniority, and that this provides a defense to an allegation of an unfair labor practice. <i>See, e.g., McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 9-11. In <i>E.C. Waste,</i> we rejected a claim based on the effect of Law 80 on a period of probation. 359 F.3d at 43-44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor, as a matter of Puerto Rico law, is Law 80 itself intended to serve as a defense to an unfair labor practice charge. As we noted in <i>Rodriguez v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486540\"><a href=\"/opinion/486540/manuel-rodriguez-v-eastern-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1987), Law 80 \"was intended to increase protection for dismissed workers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. The Guidelines for the Interpretation and Application of Law 80 (May 30, 1976) (\"Guidelines\"), promulgated by the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources, indicate that Law 80 was not meant to interfere with the enforcement of the NLRA. The Guidelines are clear that \"if [a] dismissal of an employee turns out to be an illegal work practice, the applicable law is the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Act or the National Labor Relations Act, as the case may be.\" <i>McGaw,</i> 135 F.3d at 10-11 (alteration in original) (quoting Guidelines at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the Hospital's argument requires an inversion of logic. As we said in <i>McGaw,</i> it \"would be perverse indeed to allow [the employer] now to invoke a statute enacted for the protection of workers as a justification for its unlawful labor practices.\" <i>Id.</i> at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hospital also misunderstands a basic principle of judicial review in invoking Law 80 as a defense to enforcement of the Board's order. It is the ALJ and the Board who are the finders of fact; Law 80 does not change that. The ALJ's and the Board's factual determinations must be upheld if based on substantial evidence. <i>E.g., E.C. Waste,</i> 359 F.3d at 42. The Board has supportably found that Garcia was suspended and discharged because of his union activities, not because of any deficiency in his performance of his duties. <i>Hosp. Cristo Redentor,</i> 347 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>deny</i> the Hospital's petition for review and <i>grant</i> enforcement of the Board's order.
