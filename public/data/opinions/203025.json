William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Lloyd Matthews on brief pro se.\n     Stephen G. Dietrick, Deputy General Counsel, and Nancy Ankers\nWhite, Special Assistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees,\nEfrain Vargas, Gilbert Lemon, II, Lucien Mandeville, John Faulkner,\nBrian Gomes, John Marshall, John McGonagle, John Jones, and Richard\nPicard.\n     David A. Hilton, Lisa R. Wichter and Morrison Mahoney LLP, on\nbrief for appellees, Khalid Khan, M.D., Carla Cesario, Kristen\nCurry, Maureen Quinty, and Denise MacKinnon.\n\n\n                           November 20, 2007\n\f            Per   Curiam.     Lloyd    Matthews       sued   numerous    prison\n\ncorrectional and medical officials who, he alleged, inflicted\n\nunlawful injury and provided inadequate medical care to him.                The\n\nmedical   defendants   were   granted       summary    judgment.        Matthews\n\nproceeded to a jury trial against the remaining correctional\n\ndefendants, two of whom, Officers Vargas and Lemon, countersued\n\nMatthews for their own injuries.        At the conclusion of the trial,\n\nthe claims against certain of these correctional defendants were\n\ndismissed.    As to those who remained, the jury verdict was mixed.\n\nThe jury found in favor of the defendants on most of Matthews'\n\nclaims.   The jury, however, did find in favor of Matthews against\n\nLieutenant Picard, awarding Matthews compensatory damages in the\n\namount of $1.00.    The jury rejected Officer Lemon's counterclaim.\n\nIt found in favor of Officer Vargas on his counterclaim and awarded\n\n$1.00 in compensatory damages against Matthews.                 Matthews has\n\nappealed.    We affirm.\n\n1. Discovery and the appointment of counsel\n\n            Matthews' primary complaint on appeal which underlies and\n\ninfects all of his claims is his contention that he was denied\n\ndiscovery.   We reject that contention.        We have carefully reviewed\n\nthe extensive record and it is clear that, rather than moving his\n\ncase forward, Matthews spent an inordinate amount of time filing\n\nrepetitive motions resisting the court's rulings which, contrary to\n\nMatthews' continued assertions, did not deny him all discovery but\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fsimply refused Matthews' request to conduct deposition discovery in\n\nthe manner which he had requested.       This waste of time included at\n\nleast three attempts at seeking mandamus relief from our court.\n\nMatthews did obtain some documentary discovery and could have\n\nobtained, but did not, deposition discovery by written questions.\n\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in its handling of\n\nthe discovery issues in this case.           See Bogosian v. Woloohojian\n\nRealty Corp., 323 F.3d 55, 64 n.7 (1st Cir. 2003) (reciting the\n\nabuse of discretion standard for discovery rulings).               After more\n\nthan six years and 260 separate docket entries, there was no abuse\n\nof discretion in setting this case for trial. Similarly, there was\n\nno abuse of discretion in the district court's denial of Matthews'\n\nrepeated motions for appointment of counsel.            See DesRosiers v.\n\nMoran, 949 F.2d 15, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1991) (reciting the district\n\ncourt    standard   for   appointment   of   counsel   and   the    appellate\n\nstandard of review).\n\n2. Summary judgment in favor of the medical defendants\n\n            The district court did not err in granting summary\n\njudgment in favor of the medical defendants.        As he conceded at the\n\npretrial conference, Matthews lacked evidence, whether through\n\nexpert testimony or otherwise, as to the proper level of care and\n\nhow the medical defendants had deliberately fallen below that\n\nlevel.    The district court correctly concluded that, accordingly,\n\nno jury could find that the medical defendants displayed deliberate\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\findifference. See Ruiz-Rosa v. Rullan, 485 F.3d 150, 156 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (reliance primarily on the allegations in complaint to oppose\n\nsummary judgment on a claim of deliberate indifference does not\n\nsatisfy Rule 56 standard); Acosta v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 445 F.3d\n\n509,   514   (1st   Cir.   2006)   (court   is   not   required    to   credit\n\nplaintiff's bare and conclusory assertion that defendants were\n\ndeliberately indifferent to serious medical need).                For reasons\n\nalready noted, we reject Matthews' contention that he was prevented\n\nfrom seeking expert testimony to support his claims.\n\n3. Denial of trial witnesses\n\n             The district court did not err in declining to issue\n\nwitness subpoenas because Matthews had not provided the appropriate\n\nwitness fees, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(b)(1), explaining that the\n\ncourt was not permitted to expend public funds on behalf of a\n\nprivate litigant in a civil action.         On appeal, Matthews cites no\n\ncounter authority.     Nor did the court err or abuse its discretion\n\nin refusing to issue writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum to\n\ninmates.     Matthews did not specify the contents of any expected\n\ntestimony, explaining that he had \"no idea what his witnesses will\n\nrecall of the events at issue.\"        In any event, none of Matthews'\n\nproposed inmate witnesses were eyewitnesses to the incidents at\n\nissue.   And, the detail which Matthews now provides on appeal as to\n\nthe expected testimony of all of his proposed witnesses suggests\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthat the testimony would not have been relevant or, if relevant,\n\nwould have been cumulative, at best.\n\n4. Claims of harassment and excessive force\n\n           Assuming, without deciding, that Matthews properly raised\n\nand preserved an objection to the district court's refusal to send\n\nhis allegations of harassment as a separate claim to the jury,\n\nthere was no error.    These claims did not rise to the level of a\n\nconstitutional violation. See Skinner v. Cunningham, 430 F.3d 483,\n\n489 (1st Cir. 2005) (slamming cell door, threats, discourtesies,\n\nepithets, and false charges on petty matters do not amount to an\n\nEighth Amendment violation).    Nor did the court err in refusing to\n\nput to the jury Matthews' complaint about the enforcement of the\n\nprison's strip search policy.\n\n           Matthews' suggestion that he sufficiently raised and\n\npreserved a claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 12, ยง 11, (\"MCRA\") fares no better.               \"The MCRA\n\ncreates   no   substantive   civil    rights;   rather,   it   provides   a\n\nmechanism for obtaining relief from the interference, or attempted\n\ninterference, with rights conferred by Federal or Massachusetts\n\nlaw.\"   Howcroft v. City of Peabody, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 573, 593, 747\n\nN.E.2d 729, 745 (2001). Matthews' allegations of harassment do not\n\nrise to the level of a constitutional violation and, on appeal, he\n\nhas not identified any other right secured by federal or state law\n\nfor which the MCRA might provide legal redress.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f            Similarly, there was no error in the district court's\n\nrefusal   to   issue   a   separate   jury   instruction    on   the    use    of\n\nexcessive force, concluding that it was satisfied that the charge\n\ngiven covered it.          Matthews does not point to any particular\n\ndeficiency in the charge given.              And, we reject his garbled\n\ncontention that the standard of proof for a claim of excessive\n\nforce is somehow different from that of an Eighth Amendment claim.\n\nSee Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 327 (1986) (\"We think the\n\nEighth    Amendment,   which    is    specifically   concerned      with      the\n\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain in penal institutions,\n\nserves as the primary source of substantive protection to convicted\n\nprisoners ... where the deliberate use of force is challenged as\n\nexcessive and unjustified.\").\n\n5. Claim of retaliation\n\n            Matthews opined that Officers Vargas and Lemon had filed\n\ntheir counterclaims in retaliation for his own claims against them.\n\nHe sought to question these officers as to whether either had ever\n\nbeen assaulted by other inmates but had failed to sue them for\n\ntheir    injuries.     The   district   court   precluded    this      line    of\n\nquestioning and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.               Torres-\n\nArroyo v. Rullan, 436 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2006) (a decision to\n\nexclude evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion).                 Citizens\n\nhave the right to file counterclaims that, as was the case here,\n\nhave an arguable basis.       The court acted within its discretion to\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fconfine the questioning to the particular incidents at issue here\n\nand to refuse Matthews' desire to explore the possible existence of\n\npotential, but unpursued, claims against other inmates.                  We note\n\nthat Matthews was permitted to argue in his closing that Vargas and\n\nLemon had brought their counterclaims only as an unsuccessful\n\nattempt to intimidate him into dropping his suit.\n\n6. Directed verdicts\n\n                Matthews claims error in the directed verdicts entered in\n\nfavor      of    three   defendants,     who   Matthews    had   sued   in   their\n\nsupervisory capacity.           Since summary judgment was properly granted\n\nin favor of the medical defendants, there was no error in granting\n\ndirected verdicts in favor of Lieutenant Gomes and Superintendent\n\nMarshall.        Similarly, since the jury found against Matthews with\n\nrespect to his claims concerning the incidents of October 7, 1997,\n\nthere was no error in the directed verdict in favor of Captain\n\nMcGonagle.        With no finding of a constitutional violation, there\n\ncan   be    no    supervisory     liability.      See     Hatfield-Bermudez    v.\n\nAldanondo-Rivera, 496 F.3d 51, 63 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n7. Evidentiary rulings\n\n                Finally, we have considered Matthews' myriad complaints\n\nabout various of the district court's evidentiary rulings. Many of\n\nthese      complaints     are    terse    recitations     without   substantive\n\nsupporting legal argument.               We have considered them all, but\n\ndecline to respond point by point.             We reject them all.\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f          The judgment of the district court dated November 9, 2004\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Albers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111610\"><a href=\"/opinion/111610/whitley-v-albers/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327 (1986) (\"We think the\n\nEighth    Amendment,   which    is    specifically   concerned      with      the\n\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain in penal institutions,\n\nserves as the primary source of substantive protection to convicted\n\nprisoners ... where the deliberate use of force is challenged as\n\nexcessive and unjustified.\").\n\n5. Claim of retaliation\n\n            Matthews opined that Officers Vargas and Lemon had filed\n\ntheir counterclaims in retaliation for his own claims against them.\n\nHe sought to question these officers as to whether either had ever\n\nbeen assaulted by other inmates but had failed to sue them for\n\ntheir    injuries.     The   district   court   precluded    this      line    of\n\nquestioning and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.               Torres-\n\nArroyo v. Rullan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202017\"><a href=\"/opinion/202017/torres-arroyo-v-rullan/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2006) (a decision to\n\nexclude evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion).                 Citizens\n\nhave the right to file counterclaims that, as was the case here,\n\nhave an arguable basis.       The court acted within its discretion to\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fconfine the questioning to the particular incidents at issue here\n\nand to refuse Matthews' desire to explore the possible existence of\n\npotential, but unpursued, claims against other inmates.                  We note\n\nthat Matthews was permitted to argue in his closing that Vargas and\n\nLemon had brought their counterclaims only as an unsuccessful\n\nattempt to intimidate him into dropping his suit.\n\n6. Directed verdicts\n\n                Matthews claims error in the directed verdicts entered in\n\nfavor      of    three   defendants,     who   Matthews    had   sued   in   their\n\nsupervisory capacity.           Since summary judgment was properly granted\n\nin favor of the medical defendants, there was no error in granting\n\ndirected verdicts in favor of Lieutenant Gomes and Superintendent\n\nMarshall.        Similarly, since the jury found against Matthews with\n\nrespect to his claims concerning the incidents of October 7, 1997,\n\nthere was no error in the directed verdict in favor of Captain\n\nMcGonagle.        With no finding of a constitutional violation, there\n\ncan   be    no    supervisory     liability.      See     Hatfield-Bermudez    v.\n\nAldanondo-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454041\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454041/hatfield-bermudez-v-aldanondo-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n7. Evidentiary rulings\n\n                Finally, we have considered Matthews' myriad complaints\n\nabout various of the district court's evidentiary rulings. Many of\n\nthese      complaints     are    terse    recitations     without   substantive\n\nsupporting legal argument.               We have considered them all, but\n\ndecline to respond point by point.             We reject them all.\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f          The judgment of the district court dated November 9, 2004\n\nis affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f</pre>",
