Appellants initiated proceedings to gain\n\ntitle to a property fifty-three years after the United States\n\ncondemned it and nearly forty years after the federal government\n\ntransferred title to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.        Their\n\nprocedural vehicle for this relief is Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).\n\nAgreeing with the district court that the appellants' request for\n\nrelief is too late, we affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           We provide a brief overview of the historical facts,\n\nwhich are not materially in dispute. The United States created the\n\nParker   River   National   Wildlife   Refuge   in   Essex   County,\n\nMassachusetts in 1945 by acquiring property through eminent domain.\n\nSee United States v. 12,367.47 Acres of Land More or Less Situated\n\nin Essex County, Massachusetts, Civil No. 7010 (D. Mass. Jan. 2,\n\n1945).   Before the government could finish compensating all of the\n\nlandowners whose property had been taken, Congress passed the 1948\n\n\"Exclusion Act,\" Pub. L. No. 80-579, 62 Stat. 293, to reduce the\n\nsize of the wildlife refuge.       The Exclusion Act directed the\n\nSecretary of the Interior to \"dispose of all of the interests of\n\nthe United States\" in certain identified plots of land that had\n\nbeen acquired through the earlier condemnation proceedings. If the\n\nprevious owners had already been paid for the property, Section\n\n2(a) of the Act entitled them to regain ownership by returning the\n\nfunds to the United States.      If the owners had not been paid,\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fSection 2(b) directed the Attorney General to return title to the\n\nformer owners within ninety days or \"within such additional period\n\nas the court in such proceeding may determine to be necessary to\n\neffectuate the purposes of [the] Act.\" If the government could not\n\nlocate the former owners or if title could not be returned under\n\nSections 2(a) or 2(b) for any other reason, Section 2(c) mandated\n\nthat the property \"be disposed of in such manner and at such prices\n\nas the Secretary of the Interior may deem to be in the best\n\ninterests of the United States.\"         The United States Attorney's\n\noffice developed a plan, with the district court's approval, for\n\nimplementing the Exclusion Act.        This plan was designed to return\n\nproperty   to   any   former   owner   who   filed   a   \"stipulation   for\n\nexclusion,\" to pay just compensation--as determined by the court--\n\nto the former owners who preferred money instead of their property,\n\nand to provide sufficient time to locate the owners whom the\n\ngovernment was not able to contact.\n\n           The district court, upon motion by the United States\n\nAttorney, extended four times (on September 2, 1948; March 1, 1949;\n\nSeptember 26, 1949; and March 15, 1956) the deadlines by which\n\nformer landowners could elect to exclude their property from the\n\ntaking.    On June 4, 1959, the United States Department of the\n\nInterior, exercising its authority under Section 2(c) of the\n\nExclusion Act, sold all of the property covered by the Act but not\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fexcluded by former owners to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\n\nDivision of Fisheries and Game.\n\n           The property at issue in this case, a 23 acre plot\n\nlocated in Groveland, Massachusetts and referred to by the parties\n\nas \"Lot 95,\" was owned by the estate of the late William Merrill\n\nprior to the taking by the United States in 1945.                  The federal\n\ngovernment had not compensated Merrill when Congress passed the\n\nExclusion Act in 1948, and the U.S. Attorney had not received an\n\nelection from the Merrill estate pursuant to the Exclusion Act\n\nprior to the June 4, 1959 sale.              Therefore, Lot 95 was included\n\nwith the unclaimed properties that the United States transferred to\n\nthe Commonwealth in 1959.         That land is now included within a\n\nwildlife management area operated by the Commonwealth.\n\n           In June 1949, more than four years after the United\n\nStates   had   acquired   title   to    Lot    95,   the   Town   of   Groveland\n\nattempted to take title to Lot 95 from the Merrill Estate by\n\npurportedly foreclosing a preexisting tax lien on the lot. On June\n\n30, 1949, the town transferred at auction the putative title to the\n\nlot to Ralph A. Esty,1 a town selectman, a life long resident of\n\nGroveland, and the owner of the Ralph A. Esty and Sons lumber\n\ncompany.   Esty sold the property to his sons, the appellants, in\n\n1953.    Although the sons paid taxes on the property for a few\n\n\n     1\n      Esty had experience with the federal taking and the related\nexclusion process since, as a town official, he had participated in\nproceedings to exclude another lot under the Exclusion Act.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fyears, they stopped paying taxes approximately forty-four years\n\nago.\n\n              The appellants failed to object to either the federal\n\ntaking or the transfer of Lot 95 to the Commonwealth until 1998,\n\nfifty-three years after the district court issued its judgment of\n\ntaking and nearly forty years after the United States transferred\n\ntitle to the Commonwealth.            Nevertheless, in 1998, the appellants\n\nfiled a \"Motion to Exclude Lot 95 or to Vacate Judgment Regarding\n\nLot 95\" in the district court.                 The United States, apparently\n\nbelieving that it still owned the property, stipulated to the\n\nexclusion without notifying the Commonwealth, and the court issued\n\na Judgment of Exclusion on February 17, 1999.\n\n              The Commonwealth subsequently objected to this judgment\n\nin a November 8, 1999 letter, stating that it had not received any\n\nnotice of either the stipulation or the district court action.                  On\n\nMay 1, 2001, the United States moved to vacate the Judgment of\n\nExclusion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), and it entered a joint\n\nmotion    with    the    Commonwealth      to    allow   the    Commonwealth    to\n\nintervene.       The court granted both motions on August 1, 2001.              On\n\nApril    9,   2003,     the   court    granted    summary      judgment   \"to   the\n\nCommonwealth against the claim of the Estys (as set forth in the\n\nEstys' 'Motion to Exclude Lot 95 or to Vacate Judgment Regarding\n\nLot 95').\"       In the body of its opinion, the district court ruled\n\nthat \"[b]ecause the Estys did not have an interest in Lot 95 at the\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\ftime of the taking, they may not invoke the Exclusion Act to void\n\nthe sale of Lot 95 to the Commonwealth.       Moreover, I find the\n\nperiod of Exclusion was properly terminated by [the district court]\n\nin 1959.\"    In footnote 1 of its opinion, the district court set\n\nforth an alternative ground for its ruling:\n\n            Given (a) the length of the Estys' delay, (b)\n            the lack of justification, and (c) the\n            prejudicial disruption of the Commonwealth\n            conservation efforts at the locus for the past\n            more than 40 years, I find no extraordinary\n            circumstances justifying invocation of Rule\n            60(b)   in  this   setting   to   divest   the\n            Commonwealth of its title in Lot 95.\n\nAlthough we agree with the district court's analysis of the merits\n\nof the Estys' claim in its summary judgment ruling, we choose to\n\nfocus our brief comments of affirmance on the court's ruling under\n\nRule 60(b).2\n\n                                 II.\n\n            Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) allows a court \"[o]n motion and\n\nupon such terms as are just, [to] relieve a party . . . from a\n\nfinal judgment.\"    Pursuant to the subsections of Rule 60(b) not\n\n\n\n     2\n      The United States also relied on Rule 60(b) to vacate the\nJudgment of Exclusion that had been entered before the Commonwealth\nbecame involved in these proceedings. The appellants claim that\nthe district court abused its discretion by considering this\nmotion. Since they only dedicated a paragraph to this claim in\ntheir appellate brief and failed to develop any argument, we\nconsider this claim to be waived. See United States v. Bongiorno,\n106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We have steadfastly deemed\nwaived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not\naccompanied by developed argumentation.\").\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\flimited by the requirement of filing \"not more than one year after\n\nthe judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken,\" the motion\n\nmust be made within a \"reasonable time.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4)-\n\n(6).       \"What is 'reasonable' depends upon the circumstances of the\n\nparticular case.       The circumstances to be considered include the\n\nlength of the delay, the justification for it, and the prejudice\n\n(if any) associated with the granting of relief.\" Farm Credit Bank\n\nv. Ferrera-Goitia, 316 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation\n\nomitted). The appellants waited thirty-nine years after the United\n\nStates transferred title to the Commonwealth to file their motion.\n\nBy any measure, that is an exceptionally long delay.         When the\n\nappellants finally chose to file their Rule 60 motion, they neither\n\nclaimed that they were unaware of the Commonwealth's claim of\n\nownership nor that their ability to file this motion in a more\n\ntimely fashion was impeded in some way.       In fact, they failed to\n\nprovide any explanation or excuse for their long delay.3          The\n\n\n       3\n      The appellants try to avoid the need to explain their delay\nby invoking a specious subject matter jurisdiction argument,\napparently on the theory that subject matter jurisdiction can be\nraised at any time.     Subject matter jurisdiction concerns the\n\"'power [of the court] to declare the law'\" in the dispute before\nit. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83,\n94 (1998) (quoting Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1868)).\nThe appellants argue that the 1948 Exclusion Act stripped the\nfederal district court of the \"power to do anything with Lot 95\nexcept exclude it from the taking.\"      This argument does not\nimplicate the district court's subject matter jurisdiction in the\n1950s in dealing with Lot 95; it is an ordinary and misguided\nstatutory interpretation argument addressed to the merits of the\ncourt's decision.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fprejudice to the Commonwealth if it were divested of title to Lot\n\n95 is clear.   It has relied on the title that it acquired from the\n\nUnited States for the past forty-five years, through its operation\n\nof a wildlife management area.         In sum, we have seldom seen a\n\nweaker claim for 60(b) relief.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

This plan was designed to return\n\nproperty   to   any   former   owner   who   filed   a   \"stipulation   for\n\nexclusion,\" to pay just compensation--as determined by the court--\n\nto the former owners who preferred money instead of their property,\n\nand to provide sufficient time to locate the owners whom the\n\ngovernment was not able to contact.\n\n           The district court, upon motion by the United States\n\nAttorney, extended four times (on September 2, 1948; March 1, 1949;\n\nSeptember 26, 1949; and March 15, 1956) the deadlines by which\n\nformer landowners could elect to exclude their property from the\n\ntaking.    On June 4, 1959, the United States Department of the\n\nInterior, exercising its authority under Section 2(c) of the\n\nExclusion Act, sold all of the property covered by the Act but not\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fexcluded by former owners to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\n\nDivision of Fisheries and Game.\n\n           The property at issue in this case, a 23 acre plot\n\nlocated in Groveland, Massachusetts and referred to by the parties\n\nas \"Lot 95,\" was owned by the estate of the late William Merrill\n\nprior to the taking by the United States in 1945.                  The federal\n\ngovernment had not compensated Merrill when Congress passed the\n\nExclusion Act in 1948, and the U.S. Attorney had not received an\n\nelection from the Merrill estate pursuant to the Exclusion Act\n\nprior to the June 4, 1959 sale.              Therefore, Lot 95 was included\n\nwith the unclaimed properties that the United States transferred to\n\nthe Commonwealth in 1959.         That land is now included within a\n\nwildlife management area operated by the Commonwealth.\n\n           In June 1949, more than four years after the United\n\nStates   had   acquired   title   to    Lot    95,   the   Town   of   Groveland\n\nattempted to take title to Lot 95 from the Merrill Estate by\n\npurportedly foreclosing a preexisting tax lien on the lot.

On\n\nMay 1, 2001, the United States moved to vacate the Judgment of\n\nExclusion under Fed. R. Civ.

Moreover, I find the\n\nperiod of Exclusion was properly terminated by [the district court]\n\nin 1959.\"    In footnote 1 of its opinion, the district court set\n\nforth an alternative ground for its ruling:\n\n            Given (a) the length of the Estys' delay, (b)\n            the lack of justification, and (c) the\n            prejudicial disruption of the Commonwealth\n            conservation efforts at the locus for the past\n            more than 40 years, I find no extraordinary\n            circumstances justifying invocation of Rule\n            60(b)   in  this   setting   to   divest   the\n            Commonwealth of its title in Lot 95.\n\nAlthough we agree with the district court's analysis of the merits\n\nof the Estys' claim in its summary judgment ruling, we choose to\n\nfocus our brief comments of affirmance on the court's ruling under\n\nRule 60(b).2\n\n                                 II.\n\n            Fed.
