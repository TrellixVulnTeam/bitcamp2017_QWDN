MEDINA,\n                     Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                 v.\n\n        ANABELLE RODRIGUEZ, Secretary of Justice of the\n                  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\n                      Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n        ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Jay A. Garcia-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n              Lynch, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n          Juan R. Marchand Quintero on brief for appellant.\n\n          Roberto J. Sanchez Ramos, Solicitor General, Camelia\nFernandez Romeu, Assistant Solicitor General, and Kenneth Pamias\nVelasquez, Deputy Solicitor General, on brief for Appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         September 2, 2004\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.            This appeal arises from the\n\naftermath of our decision in Mangual v. Rotger-Sabat, 317 F.3d 45\n\n(1st Cir. 2003), which resolved some but not all of the claims\n\nagainst the constitutionality of Puerto Rico's criminal libel\n\nstatute presented by the plaintiffs in the initial litigation.\n\n           The district court construed our remand order and mandate\n\nto preclude it from considering additional legal claims of the\n\noriginal plaintiff, Tomas de Jesus-Mangual, and the intervenor\n\nJorge Medina that the statute is also unconstitutional as applied\n\nin a different context.      As a result, it refused to consider de\n\nJesus-Mangual's and Medina's claims, presented initially in the\n\nearlier action and pressed later by a post-remand motion for\n\nsummary judgment, that the Puerto Rico criminal libel statutes are\n\nalso   unconstitutional    under    the     First    Amendment   in   criminal\n\nprosecutions of claims that the reporter had libeled private\n\nindividuals in reporting matters of public concern.\n\n           In   Mangual,   this    court,    inter    alia,   instructed   the\n\ndistrict court on remand to enjoin the Puerto Rico criminal libel\n\nstatute, 33 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 4101-4104, as unconstitutional under\n\nthe First Amendment \"as applied to statements regarding public\n\nofficials or figures.\"       Mangual, 317 F.3d at 69.             The record\n\npermitted us to resolve the public official or figure issues, but\n\nnot the claims articulated in plaintiff's September 1999 summary\n\njudgment motion about private figures in matters of public concern.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fWe also held that the district court erred in dismissing the case\n\nfor lack of standing and in denying intervention to Jorge Medina,\n\nand allowed his intervention.       Id.    Further, we noted that on the\n\nevidence,\n\n            \"[the threats] to which the plaintiffs point\n            all involve statements regarding either public\n            officials, such as police officers, or public\n            figures such as political candidates. Thus,\n            we have no occasion to consider whether the\n            Puerto   Rico   criminal  libel   statute   is\n            unconstitutional as applied to statements\n            about private figures on matters of public\n            concern.\"\n\nId. at 66 n.8.      Plaintiffs de Jesus-Mangual and Medina filed a\n\npetition    for   reconsideration   with    this   court,   asking   us   to\n\nreconsider and reach this issue.      We declined to do so.     As of that\n\ntime, as plaintiffs admit in their brief here, the issue of\n\napplication of the statute to claims that private individuals were\n\nlibeled on matters of public concern was not fully developed, there\n\nhaving been no evidence presented on that claim, unlike the public\n\nofficial claim.\n\n            Mandate issued from this court on February 20, 2003.          It\n\nremanded the case to the district court with instructions to issue\n\na declaratory judgment and injunctive relief consistent with the\n\nJanuary 21, 2003 opinion, which stated:\n\n            We hold that the Puerto Rico criminal libel\n            statute incorporates constitutionally invalid\n            standards in the context of statements about\n            public officials or public figures. We hold\n            that Puerto Rico's criminal libel statute, 33\n            P.R.    Laws    Ann.   §§    4101-4104,    is\n\n                             -3-\n\f            unconstitutional under the First Amendment as\n            applied   to   statements   regarding  public\n            officials or figures. We reverse the denial\n            of Medina's motion to intervene and grant\n            intervention to Medina, reverse the dismissal\n            of the case on jurisdictional grounds, and\n            remand the case with instructions that the\n            district court enter a declaratory judgment\n            and injunctive relief consistent with this\n            opinion.   So ordered.   Costs are awarded to\n            Mangual and Medina.\n\nId. at 69.\n\n             The next day the plaintiff and plaintiff-intervenor filed\n\na motion for summary judgment on the portion of their earlier\n\nclaims that the criminal libel statute is unconstitutional as\n\napplied to publications about private individuals in matters of\n\npublic concern.       Each plaintiff filed a supporting affidavit.\n\n             De Jesus-Mangual's affidavit said that his job as a\n\nreporter required him to cover private as well as public persons on\n\nmatters of public concern.          He said he was chilled in pursuing and\n\npublishing certain stories and had suppressed names of private\n\npersons out of fear of criminal prosecution.                  His fears were\n\nexacerbated by the fact that the statute appeared to put the burden\n\non   the   reporter    to   prove   the   truth   of   the   statements   made.\n\nFurther, this chilling effect was particularly strong because,\n\nunlike for civil libel claims, he was not able to obtain insurance\n\nagainst a criminal libel claim, and thus would have to shoulder the\n\nexpense of litigating such a claim himself.             He acknowledged that\n\nhe was not at that time under any threat of prosecution for stories\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fabout private persons in matters of public concern.            But the\n\naffidavit said that such prosecutions were still being brought.\n\nReferring    to   the   prosecution   of   television   producer   Kobbo\n\nSantarrosa, he averred that the Justice Department was continuing\n\nto prosecute journalists under the statute.\n\n            The affidavit of the intervenor plaintiff, Medina, made\n\nsimilar statements.      He stated that a substantial part of his\n\njournalistic work included covering matters of public concern which\n\noften involved individuals who would not be considered public\n\nofficials or figures.      In addition, he said that there have been\n\nnumerous instances in which he has refrained from naming private\n\nindividuals in a story for fear that he would be prosecuted under\n\nthe statute. He further said that the Justice Department was still\n\nprosecuting individuals under the criminal libel statute, and that\n\nthis fact has contributed to the chilling effect resulting from the\n\nstatute.    He too stressed the importance of the lack of available\n\ninsurance as a large deterrent from his publishing legitimately\n\nnewsworthy articles that could possibly fall under the reach of the\n\nstatute.\n\n            No opposition was ever filed to the plaintiff's February\n\n21, 2003 summary judgment motion.1         Indeed, it might have been\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          Pursuant to District of Puerto Rico Local Rule 7.1,\ndefendants were required to reply to the motion within ten days of\nbeing properly served.\n\n                                  -5-\n\ftaken that the Secretary was declining to defend the statute\n\nagainst this challenge.\n\n           On   March    13,   2003,      the   district   court     issued    a\n\ndeclaratory judgment and injunction in conformity with this court's\n\nopinion.   It did not act on the new summary judgment motion.\n\n           The plaintiffs twice asked the court to act on their\n\nsummary judgment motion: on April 29 and June 2, 2003.               The court\n\ndid not act on the motion until October 31, 2003, when it denied\n\nthe motion for summary judgment, stating that it had no power to\n\nact on plaintiff's claim as it was foreclosed by our mandate.                 The\n\nresult of the order was to foreclose all other issues and thus,\n\neffectively, close the case.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           We deal first with an issue not addressed by the parties.\n\nThe record shows that no final judgment was entered by the district\n\ncourt on a separate document, as required by Rule 58.             Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.   58.   However,     because   the    district   court's      order   clearly\n\nindicated that it intended to dispose of the case finally, and the\n\ndefendant Secretary of Justice Rodriguez has not objected to the\n\nappeal but rather has briefed the case as a final, appealable\n\norder, we may appropriately exercise jurisdiction.\n\n           Under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, the \"courts of appeals . . .\n\nshall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the\n\ndistrict courts of the United States . . . .\"              Id.    Generally, a\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdistrict court decision becomes \"final\" when judgment is set forth\n\nin a separate document as required by Rule 58.\n\n           Nonetheless, a decision of a district court may be a\n\n\"final decision\" for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction under\n\n§ 1291 despite the lack of a judgment entered in a separate\n\ndocument under Rule 58.     Banker's Trust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U.S. 381\n\n(1978).    In Banker's Trust, the Supreme Court noted that Rule 58\n\nwas passed in order to make clear precisely when the clock began to\n\nrun for the purposes of appealing a final judgment.          Id. at 384.\n\nHere there is no question but that the appeal is timely, and so the\n\npurposes   of   Rule   58   are   not    served   by   hinging   appellate\n\njurisdiction on the existence of a separate judgment.             Banker's\n\nTrust held that where the district court had clearly evidenced its\n\nintent that the appealed-from opinion and order represent the final\n\ndecision in the case, a judgment of dismissal was recorded in the\n\ndocket, and respondent did not object to the appeal in the absence\n\nof a separate judgment, the requirements of Rule 58 were deemed\n\nwaived and jurisdiction under § 1291 was proper.          Id. at 387-88;\n\nsee also United States v. Hoyts Cinemas Corp., Nos. 03-1646, 03-\n\n1787, 03-1808, slip op. at 9-10 (1st Cir. Aug. 20, 2004) (\"Both\n\nparties treat [summary judgment order] as a final judgment and . .\n\n. so do we\"); Mullane v. Chambers, 333 F.3d 322, 337 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f            Similarly, in this case the district court evidenced a\n\nfinality to its order, the appeal is timely, and the Secretary has\n\nnot only waived the lack of a Rule 58 final judgment but has asked\n\nus to decide the appeal. The district court's memorandum and order\n\nstates   unequivocally     that    the   plaintiff's   claim    was   properly\n\ndisposed of by our earlier decision and mandate, and that as a\n\nresult it was without jurisdiction to hear anything more.               While,\n\nunlike in Banker's Trust, a judgment of dismissal has not been\n\nrecorded    in   the   docket,    \"nothing   but   delay   would   flow   from\n\nrequiring the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal.                     Upon\n\ndismissal, the district court would simply file and enter the\n\nseparate judgment, from which a timely appeal would then be taken.\n\nWheels would spin for no practical purpose.\"           Banker's Trust, 425\n\nU.S. at 385; see also Kersey v. Dennison Mfg. Co., 3 F.3d 482, 485\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (\"[A] pro forma remand, followed by a new notice of\n\nappeal, would advance neither the interests of the parties nor\n\nsound judicial administration . . . .\").\n\n                                     II.\n\n            We start by noting that summary judgment was denied on\n\ngrounds never raised by any party.            The district court gave no\n\nnotice that it thought the motion was barred by the mandate\n\ndoctrine and plaintiffs were given no opportunity to brief the\n\nissue.     That alone would be a basis for reversal.           See Douglas v.\n\nYork County, 360 F.3d 286, 290-91 (1st Cir. 2004) (finding an abuse\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fof discretion where district court injected new issue into the case\n\nwithout   giving   parties   notice     and   opportunity   to   respond).\n\nFurthermore, had the district court notified the parties of its\n\nconcern about the meaning of the mandate, the parties could easily\n\nhave sought clarification about the mandate from this court.             See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Melvin, 27 F.3d 710, 711-13 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(after reversing district court's opinion and remanding for further\n\nproceedings, court of appeals granted motion to reconsider based on\n\nconfusion as to mandate); In re Dedham Water Co., 901 F.2d 3 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n           Turning to the merits, we disagree with the district\n\ncourt's   interpretation     of   the     mandate.   The    issue   of   the\n\napplication of the statute to asserted libel of private persons was\n\nraised in the complaint.          Further, in the motion for summary\n\njudgment submitted along with the verified complaint, Mangual\n\nincluded among the constitutional defects of the statute that \"when\n\nthe complainant is a private individual or a public figure (not a\n\npublic official), the accused must equally shoulder the burden of\n\nproving the truth of his expressions and further, that the matter\n\nrelating to his publications is of 'public concern.'\" (emphasis\n\nadded).   This put both the defendant and the court on notice that\n\nMangual intended to challenge the constitutionality of the statute\n\nas applied to publications about private persons as well as public\n\nofficials.    Because the case was dismissed on standing grounds,\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthere was no opportunity for discovery.               Without waiving this\n\nissue,     plaintiffs   produced   evidence     of    actual   prosecutions\n\ninvolving statements about public officials in order to assert\n\nstanding. Nothing in this court's prior opinion resolved the issue\n\nof application of the criminal statute to claimed defamation of\n\nprivate individuals in publications on matters of public concern.\n\nIn the posture in which the case came to us, the issue was not yet\n\nfully developed, and we were explicit that we were not reaching it.\n\nNothing in our mandate instructed the court to dismiss the entire\n\ncase or its remaining claims upon entry of the required injunctive\n\nand declaratory relief.       Nothing in our mandate precluded the\n\nplaintiffs    from   attempting    to   raise   the    issue   and   provide\n\nsupporting evidence.     The district court was not deprived of power\n\nto entertain the motion.\n\n            Under this circuit's \"law of the case\" doctrine, the\n\nmandate rule, \"with only a few exceptions, forbids, among other\n\nthings, a lower court from relitigating issues that were decided by\n\na higher court, whether explicitly or by reasonable implication, at\n\nan earlier stage of the same case.\"        Municipality of San Juan v.\n\nRullan, 318 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 2003).        It is equally clear that\n\nissues that were not decided by the appellate court and that are\n\nthus outside the scope of the mandate are not affected by the\n\nmandate.     In Biggins v. Hazen Paper, 111 F.3d 205, 209 (1st Cir.\n\n1997), this court stated that \"mandates require respect for what\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fthe higher court decided, not for what it did not decide.\"\n\nBiggins cited multiple cases that hold that \"absent a contrary\n\ndirection, a district court on remand can permit the plaintiff to\n\n'file additional pleadings, [or] vary or expand the issues . . .\n\n.'\"   Id. (quoting Rogers v. Hill, 289 U.S. 582, 587-88 (1933)).\n\n           In ruling on the constitutionality of one category of as-\n\napplied cases, this court reached only the issues for which there\n\nwas an adequate evidentiary record.      Because the initial case was\n\ndismissed by the district court on procedural grounds prior to any\n\nsignificant discovery, plaintiffs were not given the opportunity to\n\ndevelop the evidentiary record with respect to their constitutional\n\nchallenge to the statute as applied to publications about private\n\nindividuals in matters of public concern.\n\n           The Secretary was on notice from the complaint and\n\nsimultaneously filed summary judgment motion that plaintiff was\n\nchallenging the statute's applicability to private individuals as\n\nwell.   It is true that plaintiff and plaintiff intervenor had not,\n\nat the time of the appeal from the dismissal of the case, raised in\n\ntheir affidavits evidence of the sort they raised post-mandate\n\nabout prosecutions arising from publications about private persons\n\nin matters of public concern.    It was up to the defendant Secretary\n\nto raise an objection if she felt prejudiced by the post-mandate\n\nfiling that   raised   the   issue   again.   Whatever   arguments   the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fdefendant had to the timing of the raising of the claim post-\n\nmandate have been forfeited.\n\n            Indeed the Secretary of Justice did not respond to the\n\nsummary    judgment   motion   until    this   appeal.    On   appeal,   the\n\nSecretary asserts that we should affirm the District Court's ruling\n\nbased alternatively on the law of the case doctrine and the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata.        These two arguments, in addition to\n\nbeing forfeited by not being raised in the trial court, are\n\ninapposite.       Had   this    court     decided   the   issue    of    the\n\nconstitutionality of the statute as to prosecutions for defamation\n\nof private persons in matters of public concern, the law of the\n\ncase doctrine would be relevant. Further, had we decided the issue\n\nin a different case than this, the doctrine of res judicata would\n\nbe relevant.     The Mangual opinion is perfectly clear that the\n\nprivate-person issue was not decided.\n\n            As a result, we remand for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.      Normally, we would hold that the defendant\n\nSecretary, having failed in her obligation to oppose summary\n\njudgment, was bound, as a result thereby, to take the plaintiffs'\n\nstatement of facts as given and was not permitted to introduce her\n\nown evidence.    However, what is at stake is the constitutionality\n\nof a statute as applied to a category of cases; we are loathe to\n\nhave a determination made on such a question in such a default\n\ncontext.\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f           On remand, the Secretary of Justice should notify the\n\ndistrict   court   whether   the   government   intends   to   defend   the\n\nstatute.   The district court should then proceed accordingly.          So\n\nordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\f",

He said he was chilled in pursuing and publishing certain stories and had suppressed names of private persons out of fear of criminal prosecution. His fears were exacerbated by the fact that the statute appeared to put the burden on the reporter to prove the truth of the statements made. Further, this chilling effect was particularly strong because, unlike for civil libel claims, he was not able to obtain insurance against a criminal libel claim, and thus would have to shoulder the expense of litigating such a claim himself. He acknowledged that he was not at that time under any threat of prosecution for stories about private persons in matters of public concern. But the affidavit said that such prosecutions were still being brought. Referring to the prosecution of television producer Kobbo Santarrosa, he averred that the Justice Department was continuing to prosecute journalists under the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit of the intervenor plaintiff, Medina, made similar statements. He stated that a substantial part of his journalistic work included covering matters of public concern which often involved individuals who would not be considered public officials or figures. In addition, he said that there have been numerous instances in which he has refrained from naming private individuals in a story for fear that he would be prosecuted under the statute. He further said that the Justice Department was still prosecuting individuals under the criminal libel statute, and that this fact has contributed to the chilling effect resulting from the statute. He too stressed the importance of the lack of available insurance as a large deterrent from his publishing legitimately newsworthy articles that could possibly fall under the reach of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No opposition was ever filed to the plaintiff's February 21, 2003 summary judgment motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Indeed, it might have been taken that the Secretary was declining to defend the statute against this challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 13, 2003, the district court issued a declaratory judgment and injunction in conformity with this court's opinion.

The court did not act on the motion until October 31, 2003, when it denied the motion for summary judgment, stating that it had no power to act on plaintiff's claim as it was foreclosed by our mandate. The result of the order was to foreclose all other issues and thus, effectively, close the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal first with an issue not addressed by the parties. The record shows that no final judgment was entered by the district court on a separate document, as required by Rule 58. Fed.R.Civ.P. 58. However, because the district court's order clearly indicated that it intended to dispose of the case finally, and the defendant Secretary of Justice Rodriguez has not objected to the appeal but rather has briefed the case as a final, appealable order, we may appropriately exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, the \"courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States....\" <i>Id.</i> Generally, a district court decision becomes \"final\" when judgment is set forth in a separate document as required by Rule 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, a decision of a district court may be a \"final decision\" for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction under &#167; 1291 despite the lack of a judgment entered in a separate document under Rule 58. <i>Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis,</i> 435 U.S. 381, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978). In <i>Bankers Trust,</i> the Supreme Court noted that Rule 58 was passed in order to make clear precisely when the clock began to run for the purposes of appealing a final judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 384, 98 S.Ct. 1117. Here there is no question but that the appeal is timely, and so the purposes of Rule 58 are not served by hinging appellate jurisdiction on the existence of a separate judgment. <i>Bankers Trust</i> held that where the district court had clearly evidenced its intent that the appealed-from opinion and order represent the final decision in the case, a judgment of dismissal was recorded in the docket, and respondent did not object to the appeal in the absence of a separate judgment, the requirements of Rule 58 were deemed waived and jurisdiction under &#167; 1291 was proper. <i>Id.</i> at 387-88, 98 S.Ct. 1117; <i>see also United States v. Hoyts Cinemas Corp.,</i> Nos. 03-1646, 03-1787, 03-1808, slip op. at 9-10 (1st Cir. Aug. 20, 2004) (\"Both parties treat [summary judgment order] as a final judgment and ... so do we\"); <i>Mullane v. Chambers,</i> 333 F.3d 322, 337 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in this case the district court evidenced a finality to its order, the appeal is timely, and the Secretary has not only waived the lack of a Rule 58 final judgment but has asked us to decide the appeal. The district court's memorandum and order states unequivocally that the plaintiff's claim was properly disposed of by our earlier decision and mandate, and that as a result it was without jurisdiction to hear anything more. While, unlike in <i>Bankers Trust,</i> a judgment of dismissal has not been recorded in the docket, \"nothing but delay would flow from requiring the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal. Upon dismissal, the district court would simply file and enter the separate judgment, from which a timely appeal would then be taken. Wheels would spin for no practical purpose.\" <i>Bankers Trust,</i> 435 U.S. at 385, 98 S.Ct. 1117; <i>see also Kersey v. Dennison Mfg. Co.,</i> 3 F.3d 482, 485 (1st Cir.1993) (\"[A] <i>pro forma</i> remand, followed by a new notice of appeal, would advance neither the interests of the parties nor sound judicial administration....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by noting that summary judgment was denied on grounds never raised by any party. The district court gave no notice that it thought the motion was barred by the mandate doctrine and plaintiffs were given no opportunity to brief the issue. That alone would be a basis for reversal. <i>See Douglas v. York County,</i> 360 F.3d 286, 290-91 (1st Cir.2004) (finding an abuse of discretion where district court injected new issue into the case without giving parties notice and opportunity to respond). Furthermore, had the district court notified the parties of its concern about the meaning of the mandate, the parties could easily have sought clarification about the mandate from this court. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Melvin,</i> 27 F.3d 710, 711-13 (1st Cir.1994) (after reversing district court's opinion and remanding for further proceedings, court of appeals granted motion to reconsider based on confusion as to mandate); <i>In re Dedham Water Co.,</i> 901 F.2d 3 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, we disagree with the district court's interpretation of the mandate. The issue of the application of the statute to asserted libel of private persons was raised in the complaint. Further, in the motion for summary judgment submitted along with the verified complaint, Mangual included among the constitutional defects of the statute that \"when the complainant is a <i>private individual</i> or a public figure (not a public official), the accused must equally shoulder the burden of proving the truth of his expressions and further, that the matter relating to his publications is of `public concern.'\" (emphasis added). This put both the defendant and the court on notice that Mangual intended to challenge the constitutionality of the statute as applied to publications about private persons as well as public officials. Because the case was dismissed on standing grounds, there was no opportunity for discovery. Without waiving this issue, plaintiffs produced evidence of actual prosecutions involving statements about <i>public officials</i> in order to assert standing. Nothing in this court's prior opinion resolved the issue of application of the criminal statute to claimed defamation of private individuals in publications on matters of public concern. In the posture in which the case came to us, the issue was not yet fully developed, and we were explicit that we were not reaching it. Nothing in our mandate instructed the court to dismiss the entire case or its remaining claims upon entry of the required injunctive and declaratory relief. Nothing in our mandate precluded the plaintiffs from attempting to raise the issue and provide supporting evidence. The district court was not deprived of power to entertain the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this circuit's \"law of the case\" doctrine, the mandate rule, \"with only a few exceptions, forbids, among other things, a lower court from relitigating issues that were decided by a higher court, whether explicitly or by reasonable implication, at an earlier stage of the same case.\" <i>Municipality of San Juan v. Rullan,</i> 318 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir.2003). It is equally clear that issues that were not decided by the appellate court and that are thus outside the scope of the mandate are not affected by the mandate. In <i>Biggins v. Hazen Paper,</i> 111 F.3d 205, 209 (1st Cir.1997), this court stated that \"mandates require respect for what the higher court decided, not for what it did not decide.\" <i>Biggins</i> cited multiple cases that hold that \"absent a contrary direction, a district court on remand can permit the plaintiff to `file additional pleadings, [or] vary or expand the issues ....'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Rogers v. Hill,</i> 289 U.S. 582, 587-88, 53 S.Ct. 731, 77 L.Ed. 1385 (1933)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on the constitutionality of one category of as-applied cases, this court reached only the issues for which there was an adequate evidentiary record. Because the initial case was dismissed by the district court on procedural grounds prior to any significant discovery, plaintiffs were not given the opportunity to develop the evidentiary record with respect to their constitutional challenge to the statute as applied to publications about private individuals in matters of public concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary was on notice from the complaint and simultaneously filed summary judgment motion that plaintiff was challenging the statute's applicability to private individuals as well. It is true that plaintiff and plaintiff intervenor had not, at the time of the appeal from the dismissal of the case, raised in their affidavits evidence of the sort they raised post-mandate about prosecutions arising from publications about private persons in matters of public concern. It was up to the defendant Secretary to raise an objection if she felt prejudiced by the post-mandate filing that raised the issue again. Whatever arguments the defendant had to the timing of the raising of the claim post-mandate have been forfeited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed the Secretary of Justice did not respond to the summary judgment motion until this appeal. On appeal, the Secretary asserts that we should affirm the District Court's ruling based alternatively on the law of the case doctrine and the doctrine of res judicata. These two arguments, in addition to being forfeited by not being raised in the trial court, are inapposite. Had this court decided the issue of the constitutionality of the statute as to prosecutions for defamation of private persons in matters of public concern, the law of the case doctrine would be relevant. Further, had we decided the issue in a different case than this, the doctrine of res judicata would be relevant. The <i>Mangual</i> opinion is perfectly clear that the private-person issue was <i>not</i> decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Normally, we would hold that the defendant Secretary, having failed in her obligation to oppose summary judgment, was bound, as a result thereby, to take the plaintiffs' statement of facts as given and was not permitted to introduce her own evidence. However, what is at stake is the constitutionality of a statute as applied to a category of cases; we are loathe to have a determination made on such a question in such a default context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the Secretary of Justice should notify the district court whether the government intends to defend the statute. The district court should then proceed accordingly. So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pursuant to District of Puerto Rico Local Rule 7.1, defendants were required to reply to the motion within ten days of being properly served</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

However, because the district court's order clearly indicated that it intended to dispose of the case finally, and the defendant Secretary of Justice Rodriguez has not objected to the appeal but rather has briefed the case as a final, appealable order, we may appropriately exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, the \"courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States....\" <i>Id.</i> Generally, a district court decision becomes \"final\" when judgment is set forth in a separate document as required by Rule 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, a decision of a district court may be a \"final decision\" for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction under &#167; 1291 despite the lack of a judgment entered in a separate document under Rule 58. <i>Bankers Trust Co. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span> (1978). In <i>Bankers Trust,</i> the Supreme Court noted that Rule 58 was passed in order to make clear precisely when the clock began to run for the purposes of appealing a final judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 384, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109822\"><a href=\"/opinion/109822/bankers-trust-co-v-mallis/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>. Here there is no question but that the appeal is timely, and so the purposes of Rule 58 are not served by hinging appellate jurisdiction on the existence of a separate judgment. <i>Bankers Trust</i> held that where the district court had clearly evidenced its intent that the appealed-from opinion and order represent the final decision in the case, a judgment of dismissal was recorded in the docket, and respondent did not object to the appeal in the absence of a separate judgment, the requirements of Rule 58 were deemed waived and jurisdiction under &#167; 1291 was proper. <i>Id.</i> at 387-88, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109822\"><a href=\"/opinion/109822/bankers-trust-co-v-mallis/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court's memorandum and order states unequivocally that the plaintiff's claim was properly disposed of by our earlier decision and mandate, and that as a result it was without jurisdiction to hear anything more. While, unlike in <i>Bankers Trust,</i> a judgment of dismissal has not been recorded in the docket, \"nothing but delay would flow from requiring the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal. Upon dismissal, the district court would simply file and enter the separate judgment, from which a timely appeal would then be taken. Wheels would spin for no practical purpose.\" <i>Bankers Trust,</i> 435 U.S. at 385, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109822\"><a href=\"/opinion/109822/bankers-trust-co-v-mallis/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court gave no notice that it thought the motion was barred by the mandate doctrine and plaintiffs were given no opportunity to brief the issue. That alone would be a basis for reversal. <i>See Douglas v. York County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200901\"><a href=\"/opinion/200901/douglas-v-york-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span>, 290-91 (1st Cir.2004) (finding an abuse of discretion where district court injected new issue into the case without giving parties notice and opportunity to respond). Furthermore, had the district court notified the parties of its concern about the meaning of the mandate, the parties could easily have sought clarification about the mandate from this court. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Melvin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195440\"><a href=\"/opinion/195440/united-states-v-melvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>, 711-13 (1st Cir.1994) (after reversing district court's opinion and remanding for further proceedings, court of appeals granted motion to reconsider based on confusion as to mandate); <i>In re Dedham Water Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539956\"><a href=\"/opinion/539956/in-re-dedham-water-company-and-dedham-westwood-water-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, we disagree with the district court's interpretation of the mandate. The issue of the application of the statute to asserted libel of private persons was raised in the complaint. Further, in the motion for summary judgment submitted along with the verified complaint, Mangual included among the constitutional defects of the statute that \"when the complainant is a <i>private individual</i> or a public figure (not a public official), the accused must equally shoulder the burden of proving the truth of his expressions and further, that the matter relating to his publications is of `public concern.'\" (emphasis added). This put both the defendant and the court on notice that Mangual intended to challenge the constitutionality of the statute as applied to publications about private persons as well as public officials. Because the case was dismissed on standing grounds, there was no opportunity for discovery. Without waiving this issue, plaintiffs produced evidence of actual prosecutions involving statements about <i>public officials</i> in order to assert standing. Nothing in this court's prior opinion resolved the issue of application of the criminal statute to claimed defamation of private individuals in publications on matters of public concern. In the posture in which the case came to us, the issue was not yet fully developed, and we were explicit that we were not reaching it. Nothing in our mandate instructed the court to dismiss the entire case or its remaining claims upon entry of the required injunctive and declaratory relief. Nothing in our mandate precluded the plaintiffs from attempting to raise the issue and provide supporting evidence. The district court was not deprived of power to entertain the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this circuit's \"law of the case\" doctrine, the mandate rule, \"with only a few exceptions, forbids, among other things, a lower court from relitigating issues that were decided by a higher court, whether explicitly or by reasonable implication, at an earlier stage of the same case.\" <i>Municipality of San Juan v. Rullan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200302\"><a href=\"/opinion/200302/municipality-of-san-v-rullan/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2003). It is equally clear that issues that were not decided by the appellate court and that are thus outside the scope of the mandate are not affected by the mandate. In <i>Biggins v. Hazen Paper,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197311\"><a href=\"/opinion/197311/biggins-v-the-hazen-paper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 209 (1st Cir.1997), this court stated that \"mandates require respect for what the higher court decided, not for what it did not decide.\" <i>Biggins</i> cited multiple cases that hold that \"absent a contrary direction, a district court on remand can permit the plaintiff to `file additional pleadings, [or] vary or expand the issues ....'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Rogers v. Hill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102113\"><a href=\"/opinion/102113/rogers-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span>, 587-88, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1385</span></span> (1933)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on the constitutionality of one category of as-applied cases, this court reached only the issues for which there was an adequate evidentiary record. Because the initial case was dismissed by the district court on procedural grounds prior to any significant discovery, plaintiffs were not given the opportunity to develop the evidentiary record with respect to their constitutional challenge to the statute as applied to publications about private individuals in matters of public concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary was on notice from the complaint and simultaneously filed summary judgment motion that plaintiff was challenging the statute's applicability to private individuals as well. It is true that plaintiff and plaintiff intervenor had not, at the time of the appeal from the dismissal of the case, raised in their affidavits evidence of the sort they raised post-mandate about prosecutions arising from publications about private persons in matters of public concern. It was up to the defendant Secretary to raise an objection if she felt prejudiced by the post-mandate filing that raised the issue again. Whatever arguments the defendant had to the timing of the raising of the claim post-mandate have been forfeited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed the Secretary of Justice did not respond to the summary judgment motion until this appeal. On appeal, the Secretary asserts that we should affirm the District Court's ruling based alternatively on the law of the case doctrine and the doctrine of res judicata. These two arguments, in addition to being forfeited by not being raised in the trial court, are inapposite. Had this court decided the issue of the constitutionality of the statute as to prosecutions for defamation of private persons in matters of public concern, the law of the case doctrine would be relevant. Further, had we decided the issue in a different case than this, the doctrine of res judicata would be relevant. The <i>Mangual</i> opinion is perfectly clear that the private-person issue was <i>not</i> decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Normally, we would hold that the defendant Secretary, having failed in her obligation to oppose summary judgment, was bound, as a result thereby, to take the plaintiffs' statement of facts as given and was not permitted to introduce her own evidence. However, what is at stake is the constitutionality of a statute as applied to a category of cases; we are loathe to have a determination made on such a question in such a default context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the Secretary of Justice should notify the district court whether the government intends to defend the statute. The district court should then proceed accordingly. So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pursuant to District of Puerto Rico Local Rule 7.1, defendants were required to reply to the motion within ten days of being properly served</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
