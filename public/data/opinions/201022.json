In this employment discrimination case the\n\nplaintiff,    a   black   man   who   formerly   worked   as   a   sales\n\nrepresentative and team leader for the defendant (a provider of\n\nbroad-band and wireless communications services), charges a failure\n\nto promote him based on his race in violation of, inter alia, 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1981, 2000e(2)(a)(1), and various provisions of Puerto\n\nRico law.     After pretrial discovery had run its course, the\n\ndefendant moved for summary judgment.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.   The\n\ndistrict court rejected the plaintiff's vigorous opposition, wrote\n\na well-reasoned opinion, and granted the motion.      Bermudez-Vazquez\n\nv. Centennial de P.R., 278 F. Supp. 2d 174, 185 (D.P.R. 2003).      The\n\nplaintiff now appeals.\n\n            Our case law teaches \"that when a trial court accurately\n\nsizes up a case, applies the law faultlessly to the discerned\n\nfacts, decides the matter, and articulates a convincing rationale\n\nfor the decision, there is no need for a reviewing court to wax\n\nlongiloquent.\"    Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc., ___ F.3d\n\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 03-2225, slip op. at 2].         Time and\n\ntime again, we have followed this admonition in appropriate cases.\n\nSee, e.g., Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381, 383 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220\n\n(1st Cir. 1996); Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas, Local 901, 74 F.3d\n\n344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); Holders Capital Corp. v. Cal. Union Ins.\n\nCo. (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.), 989 F.2d 36,\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f38 (1st Cir. 1993).          The case at hand fits neatly within these\n\ndoctrinal confines.           Hence, we affirm the judgment below for\n\nsubstantially       the    reasons    elucidated      in       the    district      court's\n\nthoughtful rescript.\n\n            We add only a brief comment relative to the appellant's\n\nmost bruited argument on appeal.                He complains with particular\n\nvehemence that Centennial passed him over for promotion to a\n\nmanagement    position      left     vacant    by   the    firing       of    his      former\n\nsupervisor, Wilfredo Lugo.            In justifying the decision to choose\n\nsomeone else for the post, Centennial explains that Lugo and the\n\nappellant had an acrimonious relationship in which the appellant\n\nacquitted himself poorly.            From Centennial's point of view, this\n\nmilitated against promoting the appellant to fill the vacancy not\n\nonly   because      it    demonstrated    a    lack       of    fitness      for       senior\n\nmanagement responsibility, but also because it would have sent an\n\ninfelicitous signal to other employees.\n\n             The    appellant      decries     this   explanation            as    a    sham,\n\npointing to his generally favorable performance reviews and the\n\nfact that Centennial cashiered Lugo, not him.                        If Centennial were\n\ngenuinely    dissatisfied       with    his    conduct         and     concerned        about\n\nexacerbating a division within the sales force, the appellant\n\nsuggests, the logical response would have been to discharge him.\n\nOn   this   view,    his    retention    undermines        Centennial's           facially\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for refusing to promote him to fill Lugo's\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fshoes.      Consequently,   he   has   met   his   third-stage   burden   of\n\nproducing sufficient evidence that his employer's stated rationale\n\nwas pretextual with respect to this promotion decision.           See Texas\n\nDep't of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981).\n\n            The appellant's thesis is unavailing. For one thing, the\n\nargument was not made in the district court.            It is, therefore,\n\nreviewable here only for plain error.         See, e.g., Teamsters Union\n\nv. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"If any\n\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\n\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in\n\nthe lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\").\n\nThere is nothing sufficiently compelling about this case to warrant\n\nretreat from so prudential a rule.\n\n            In all events, the differential treatment of Lugo and the\n\nappellant in no way signifies that Centennial's explanation is a\n\nsham.    The appellant conveniently overlooks that Centennial's\n\ndecision to terminate Lugo was, according to the record, a product\n\nof other, unrelated misbehavior.         Moreover, Lugo outranked the\n\nappellant,    and   Centennial's   policy    of    holding   higher-echelon\n\nmanagers to a more exacting level of culpability is entirely\n\nrational.    Even if one might debate the wisdom of such a policy,\n\nthe appellant has adduced no evidence to call its existence into\n\nquestion.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f              Having rebuffed this challenge, we are left with a\n\nclassic dispute over competing qualifications.              When an employer\n\npromotes one person over another based on its assessment of their\n\ncomparative qualifications, the question is not which applicant was\n\nbetter qualified, but, rather, whether the employer's avowed reason\n\nfor the decision was pretextual.           Rathbun v. AutoZone, Inc., 361\n\nF.3d 62, 74 (1st Cir. 2004).        \"Qualifications are notoriously hard\n\nto judge and, in a disparate treatment case, more must be shown\n\nthan that the employer made an unwise personnel decision . . . .\"\n\nId.; see also Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (\"Courts may not sit as super personnel departments,\n\nassessing the merits — or even the rationality — of employers'\n\nnondiscriminatory business decisions.\").\n\n              In this case, the employer offered a plausible account of\n\nits deliberations:      it studied the appellant's qualifications in\n\nlight of the Lugo debacle and decided that sufficient doubt existed\n\nabout   his    management     capabilities    that   it   should   bestow   the\n\nposition on another (less controversial) applicant. There has been\n\nno   showing    that   this    decision,     right   or   wrong,   was   either\n\npretextual or undertaken in bad faith.\n\n              We need go no further.       Having perused the record with\n\ncare, we, like the district court, find no significantly probative\n\nevidence sufficient to create a trialworthy dispute as to pretext\n\n(and, thus, as to the ultimate issue of discrimination).                    The\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fdefendant was, as the district court ruled, entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
