The   outcome   of    this\n\nemployment   discrimination    case   hinges     largely   on   two    basic\n\nrequirements of litigating a Title VII claim in federal court,\n\ntimeliness and the submission of documents in the English language.\n\nWe affirm the district court's dismissal of plaintiff's Title VII\n\ndiscrimination and hostile work environment claims for failure to\n\ntimely file within the statutory period.            Plaintiff bases his\n\nassertion of timeliness on a document submitted to the court in the\n\nSpanish language, without an accompanying English translation,\n\ndespite ample time and opportunity to provide such a translation.\n\nWe cannot consider that document's impact on the question of the\n\ntimeliness of his claim. We also affirm the district court's grant\n\nof summary judgment as to plaintiff's Title VII retaliation claim\n\nand Puerto Rico Law 426 claim.\n\n          Plaintiff   Edmond    Frederique-Alexandre       (\"Frederique\")\n\nbrought a variety of discrimination claims against his former\n\nemployer, the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources of\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (DNER), and other defendants.1           The\n\ndistrict court granted defendants' motion for partial summary\n\njudgment and dismissed the action in its entirety.              Frederique\n\nappeals the district court's grant of summary judgment as to: (1)\n\n\n\n     1\n      The other defendants in this action are Puerto Rico's Natural\nResources Administration, Luis Rodríguez-Rivera, and Francis\nNieves.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fthe Title VII discrimination and hostile work environment claims;\n\n(2) the Title VII retaliation claim; and (3) the Puerto Rico Law\n\n426 claim.2           Because Frederique appeals from the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment, we employ a de novo review, drawing all\n\nreasonable factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\n\nSee Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt & Colman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 42 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\nA. The Discrimination and Hostile Workplace Claims\n\n                 Frederique, a native of Haiti and an agronomist by\n\ntraining, began his employment with the DNER in 1992.                    He alleges\n\nthat       his   former    supervisor,      José   González-Liboy    (\"González\"),\n\nrepeatedly        harassed     and   belittled     him    and   denied   him   career\n\nadvancement based on his national origin, in violation of Title VII\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.3\n\n                 In    1996,   Frederique    filed   an    administrative      charge\n\n(\"First Charge\") with the Anti-Discrimination Unit (ADU) of the\n\nPuerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources and the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging national origin\n\n\n       2\n      Frederique has not appealed the dismissal of his civil rights\nclaims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, or his constitutional\nclaims regarding due process, equal protection, and free\nexpression, and thus the issues are waived.\n       3\n      Frederique's complaint alleges that González:       (1) gave\nFrederique only insignificant tasks, despite Frederique's request\nfor substantive assignments; (2) made derogatory comments and jokes\nabout Frederique's language, accent, culture, and country of\norigin; (3) gave Frederique undeserved negative evaluations; and\n(4) did not consider Frederique for raises or promotions.\n\n                                            -3-\n\fdiscrimination. Frederique subsequently withdrew the First Charge,\n\nallegedly because González pressured him to do so and promised to\n\nimprove his conduct.       However, Frederique alleges that after he\n\nwithdrew   the   First   Charge,   González's       discriminatory   behavior\n\ncontinued,   resulting     in   his   filing    a    second   administrative\n\ncomplaint (\"Second Charge\") with the EEOC on October 31, 2000.             As\n\nto this claim, the EEOC issued a favorable determination on the\n\nmerits and issued a right-to-sue letter in 2003.                 Frederique\n\nsubsequently brought this action in United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Puerto Rico.\n\n           In his complaint filed in this action, Frederique stated\n\nthat González's discriminatory behavior \"continued until the year\n\n1999 when González Liboy left the agency.\"              Frederique repeated\n\nthis 1999 date in the plaintiff's version of the facts contained in\n\nthe Supplemental Joint Case Management Memorandum and in his\n\nopposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment.               The 1999\n\ndate is critical for our timeliness analysis.\n\n           Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1), a Title VII plaintiff is\n\nrequired to file an administrative charge with the EEOC within\n\neither 180 or 300 days after the \"alleged unlawful employment\n\npractice occurred.\"      Because Puerto Rico is a so-called \"deferral\"\n\njurisdiction, the administrative charge must be filed within 300\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdays of the alleged unlawful conduct.4     See Rivera v. Puerto Rico\n\nAqueduct and Sewers Auth., 331 F.3d 183, 188 (1st Cir. 2003).       In\n\nhis complaint, Frederique alleged that the harassment against him\n\nended when González left the agency, sometime in 1999.            Even\n\nassuming that the last act of alleged discrimination occurred on\n\nDecember 31, 1999, Frederique would only have had until October 26,\n\n2000 to file his administrative charge with the EEOC.        He missed\n\nthis mark by five days, filing on October 31, 2000.\n\n           The   Supreme   Court   has   said   that   the   timeliness\n\nrequirement under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1) is \"mandatory,\" and\n\nfailure to file within the time period means a potential plaintiff\n\n\"lose[s] the ability to recover for [the alleged discrimination].\"\n\nNat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 109, 110\n\n(2002).   We see no recognized equitable basis for tolling the 300-\n\nday period in this case, nor does Frederique suggest that such a\n\nbasis exists.    See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, 455 U.S. 385, 393\n\n(1982) (\"[F]iling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC\n\n. . . is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\");\n\nJones v. City of Somerville, 735 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"In the\n\n\n\n     4\n      Under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(1), a plaintiff may not recover\n\"for discrete acts of discrimination or retaliation that occur\noutside the statutory time period,\" but in the case of a hostile\nwork environment claim, the court may properly consider the entire\nscope of the claim, \"including behavior alleged outside the\nstatutory time period . . . so long as an act contributing to that\nhostile environment takes place within the statutory time period.\"\nNat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 105 (2002).\n\n                                   -5-\n\fabsence of a recognized equitable consideration, the limitation\n\nperiod cannot be extended by even one day.\").\n\n            On this appeal, in an attempt at salvaging the timeliness\n\nof his claims, Frederique now points to the document he submitted\n\nto the district court in April 2004, in response to defendants'\n\nmotion to dismiss, and which he also appended to his response to\n\ndefendants'     motion   for    summary       judgment.      The    document   is   a\n\npreprinted EEOC form entitled \"Charge of Discrimination,\" which\n\nFrederique submitted to the EEOC on October 31, 2000, when he filed\n\nhis Second Charge.       The form's preprinted language appears in both\n\nEnglish and Spanish.          However, all of Frederique's responses are\n\nwritten in Spanish alone.             In the box entitled \"FECHA DE ULTIMO\n\nACTO DISCRIMINATORIO/Date most recent or continuous discrimination\n\ntook place,\" Frederique entered \"Septiembre 14, 2000.\"                   Frederique\n\nargues   that     the    form       establishes     that     the    last    act     of\n\ndiscrimination occurred on September 14, 2000, which he alleges is\n\nthe true date that González left the DNER.                 He further avers that\n\nthe 1999 date for González's departure, which he relied upon in his\n\ncomplaint and repeated in two later court filings, was merely a\n\n\"clerical   error\"      and    that    his    submission    of     the   \"Charge    of\n\nDiscrimination\"      form      to     the     district    court     constituted      a\n\n\"constructive amendment\" of his complaint under Rule 15(b) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.                 Thus, Frederique concludes,\n\nthere was only a one-and-a-half-month gap between the last act of\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fdiscrimination and his filing of the Second Charge, well within the\n\n300-day requirement.\n\n            However, Frederique argues to no avail. In this circuit,\n\nwe   have    repeatedly   reminded     litigants   that   \"[t]he   law\n\nincontrovertibly demands that federal litigation in Puerto Rico be\n\nconducted in English,\" and that untranslated documents are not part\n\nof the record on appeal.    Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N.\n\nAm., 359 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2004); see also 48 U.S.C. § 864 (\"All\n\npleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English\n\nlanguage.\"). We have also confirmed that this rule applies equally\n\nto trial and pre-trial proceedings.     See Estades-Negroni, 359 F.3d\n\nat 2.   While ignorance of this rule would not excuse a failure to\n\ntranslate documents, in this case it appears that Frederique was\n\nwell aware of this requirement because he filed, along with his\n\nopposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment, a motion\n\nrequesting leave to file Spanish language documents and time to\n\nobtain certified English translations.      Six months passed between\n\nthe plaintiff's motion to submit the translations and the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of his claims for failure to timely file. During\n\nthose six months, plaintiff did not submit translations of any\n\ndocuments, including the \"Charge of Discrimination\" form.     In sum,\n\nbecause Frederique failed to submit an English-language version of\n\nthe \"Charge of Discrimination\" form, the date he entered in Spanish\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fon that form is not part of the record and does not impact our\n\nabove analysis of the timeliness of his claims.\n\n            In an attempt to avoid the statutory time bar, which was\n\nimplicated by the 1999 date clearly set forth in his own filings\n\n(the complaint, the case management memorandum, and the opposition\n\nto the motion for summary judgment), Frederique makes one final,\n\nabbreviated   argument.         He   contends    that      he   suffered   \"unfair\n\nsurprise\"    because    the   district       court   did    not    give   him   \"the\n\nopportunity to be heard on [the] 'fact' issue regarding the filing\n\nof   the   administrative     charge.\"         The   \"fact\"       issue   to    which\n\nFrederique refers is a purported typographical error by counsel\n\nwhich stated that the final act of discrimination occurred in 1999,\n\nrather than 2000 as Frederique now avers.\n\n            At first glance, Frederique's argument appears to have\n\nsome attraction.        DNER moved for summary judgment only on the\n\nconstitutional claims, the Title VII retaliation claim, individual\n\nliability for the first Title VII claim, and the Puerto Rican law\n\nclaim. Notably, DNER did not move for summary judgment on official\n\nliability   for   the   first    Title   VII    claim.          Nevertheless,    the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment on all of Frederique's\n\nclaims, including a sua sponte grant as to official liability on\n\nthe first Title VII claim.           We have said before that \"[t]hough a\n\ndistrict court may enter summary judgment sua sponte at, or in\n\nconsequence of, a pretrial conference, the court must ensure that\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fthe   targeted     party    has    an   adequate   opportunity    to    dodge   the\n\nbullet.\"     Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).      Thus, Berkovitz imposes two conditions on a grant of\n\nsummary judgment.          First, \"a district court ordinarily may order\n\nsummary judgment on its own initiative only when discovery is\n\nsufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable\n\nopportunity to glean the material facts.\"                Id.     Berkovitz also\n\nrequires that \"the court may enter summary judgment sua sponte only\n\nif it first gives the targeted party appropriate notice and a\n\nchance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the\n\nclaim or defense.\"         Id.\n\n             Here, the first Berkovitz requirement is quite clearly\n\nsatisfied; discovery had proceeded to the point where DNER was able\n\nto    move   for   partial        summary    judgment.    As     to    the   second\n\nrequirement, however, Frederique now claims that he did not have\n\nnotice as to the grounds on which the court granted summary\n\njudgment, and that as a result he had no chance to present evidence\n\non the timeliness issue.\n\n             In a way, Frederique's claims seem odd; he had more than\n\nample opportunity to be heard on the issue of when the last act of\n\ndiscrimination occurred.           It was he who submitted the 1999 date to\n\nthe court in three separate filings, the last of which was his\n\nresponse to defendants' motion for summary judgment; and it was he\n\nwho had the opportunity to seek to amend his complaint at various\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fjunctures, either as of right or later by leave of the court.                 In\n\naddition, Frederique had abundant notice that timeliness was an\n\nissue; in fact, DNER had moved to dismiss the case in the first\n\ninstance on just these grounds.         Nevertheless, the district court\n\ndid grant summary judgment without giving Frederique additional\n\nnotice that timeliness was an issue, and therefore Frederique did\n\nnot have a further opportunity to present his opposition.                 It is\n\nnot clear here whether additional notice and opportunity were\n\nrequired because of the significant prior notice that Frederique\n\nhad in fact received on the issue.           Importantly, this case differs\n\nfrom Berkovitz in that Frederique does not complain that he lacked\n\nthe opportunity to raise a genuine issue of material fact as\n\nbetween himself and the defendants, but only that he allegedly\n\nmisstated, on several occasions, an essential element of his claim.\n\n            Frederique's only basis for claiming that his first three\n\npleadings    contained    a    typographical    error    is    the   unsupported\n\nassertion of counsel.         Frederique points to untranslated documents\n\nin the record as evidence of the error, but as we have often\n\nstated, litigation in federal courts must be conducted in English.\n\nEstades-Negroni, 359 F.3d at 2.         Because Frederique forfeited his\n\nopportunity to amend the pleadings despite receiving notice that\n\ntimeliness    was   at   issue,    because    all   of   his    formal   filings\n\ncontained the 1999 date, and because he has not pointed to anything\n\nin the record that supports his allegation that the last date of\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fdiscrimination occurred in 2000, we will not reverse the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment on this claim.\n\nB. The Retaliation Claim\n\n            Frederique also appeals the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment as to his retaliation claim, brought under Title\n\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.           Frederique\n\nalleges that the DNER and various individual employees retaliated\n\nagainst him for filing the Second Charge with the EEOC by not\n\nhiring him for a Forest Service Director position. On December 18,\n\n2003, Frederique filed a third complaint with the EEOC (\"Third\n\nCharge\") detailing this retaliation allegation.           Although he had\n\nnot yet received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Frederique\n\nbrought a Title VII retaliation claim against defendants as part of\n\nthis action.       The district court granted summary judgment as to\n\nthis claim because it was brought prematurely, before issuance of\n\nthe right-to-sue letter.      We agree, for substantially the reasons\n\noutlined by the district court.\n\n            A plaintiff must exhaust his administrative remedies,\n\nincluding EEOC procedures, before proceeding under Title VII in\n\nfederal court.      See Lebrón-Ríos v. U.S. Marshal Serv., 341 F.3d 7,\n\n13   (1st   Cir.   2003).    While    Frederique   is   correct    that   the\n\nexhaustion requirement is not a jurisdictional prerequisite, but\n\nrather is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling, see\n\nZipes, 455 U.S. at 393 (1982), he makes no persuasive argument that\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthe facts or equities favor a waiver in this case.                   He only\n\nsuggests that no purpose would be served by permitting the EEOC to\n\nconduct a conciliation process regarding his Third Charge because\n\nprior efforts to resolve Frederique's other complaints have been\n\n\"futile.\"    This circuit has taken a \"'narrow view' of equitable\n\nexceptions to Title VII\" exhaustion requirements, Mack v. Great\n\nAtl. and Pac. Tea Co., Inc., 871 F.2d 179, 185 (1st Cir. 1989)\n\n(quoting Earnhardt v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 691 F.2d 69, 71\n\n(1st Cir. 1982)), and Frederique's proffered reason -- alleged\n\nfutility -- is not sufficient to \"bring [his claim] within that\n\ntiny sphere,\" Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc., 194 F.3d 275,\n\n279 (1st Cir. 1999).     Therefore, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment without prejudice as to this claim.\n\nC. Law 426 Claim\n\n            Frederique also brought a supplemental claim against\n\ndefendants under Puerto Rico Law 426, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, § 601\n\n(2000).     The district court granted summary judgment as to this\n\nclaim, concluding that Law 426 is meant to protect whistleblowers\n\nwho report acts of public corruption, whereas Frederique failed to\n\nidentify    any   information   he    had    disclosed   regarding    public\n\nfinancial malfeasance.     We agree.        Though Frederique attempts to\n\nbroaden the statute to include public employees who \"denounce\n\nunlawful acts,\" the statute does not permit such a far-ranging\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\finterpretation.     The statute's statement of purpose reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n           The purpose of this chapter is to adopt\n           measures for the protection of the rights of\n           public employees and officials who disclose\n           information or testify on alleged improper or\n           illegal acts regarding the use of public\n           property or funds that due to their nature\n           constitute acts of government corruption, or\n           that fall within the ethical conduct regulated\n           by our legal system.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, § 601 (2000) (emphasis added).           The record\n\nshows   that   Frederique   has   only   alleged   facts   related   to   the\n\ndiscrimination and harassment he allegedly suffered based on his\n\nnational origin.    He makes no allegation that he ever witnessed or\n\nreported the misuse of public property or funds.             Therefore his\n\nclaim under Law 426 lacks any factual foundation and was properly\n\ndispatched by the district court.\n\nD.

We affirm the district court's dismissal of plaintiff's Title VII discrimination and hostile work environment claims for failure to timely file within the statutory period. Plaintiff bases his assertion of timeliness on a document submitted to the court in the Spanish language, without an accompanying English translation, despite ample time and opportunity to provide such a translation. We cannot consider that document's impact on the question of the timeliness of his claim.

Frederique appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment as to: (1) the Title VII discrimination and hostile work environment claims; (2) the Title VII retaliation claim; and (3) the Puerto Rico Law 426 claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Because Frederique appeals from the district court's grant of summary judgment, we employ a <i>de novo</i> review, drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>See Zapata-Matos v.

The Discrimination and Hostile Workplace Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frederique, a native of Haiti and an agronomist by training, began his employment with the DNER in 1992. He alleges that his former supervisor, Jos&#233; Gonz&#225;lez-Liboy (\"Gonz&#225;lez\"), repeatedly harassed and belittled him and denied him career advancement based on his national origin, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Frederique filed an administrative charge (\"First Charge\") with the Anti-Discrimination Unit (ADU) of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging national origin discrimination. Frederique subsequently withdrew the First Charge, allegedly because Gonz&#225;lez pressured him to do so and promised to improve his conduct. However, Frederique alleges that after he withdrew the First Charge, Gonz&#225;lez's discriminatory behavior continued, resulting in his filing a second administrative complaint (\"Second Charge\") with the EEOC on October 31, 2000. As to this claim, the EEOC issued a favorable determination on the merits and issued a right-to-sue letter in 2003. Frederique subsequently brought this action in United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint filed in this action, Frederique stated that Gonz&#225;lez's discriminatory behavior \"continued until the year 1999 when Gonz&#225;lez Liboy left the agency.\" Frederique repeated this 1999 date in the plaintiff's version of the facts contained in the Supplemental Joint Case Management Memorandum and in his opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment. The 1999 date is critical for our timeliness analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1), a Title VII plaintiff is required to file an administrative charge with the EEOC within either 180 or 300 days after the \"alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" Because Puerto Rico is a so-called \"deferral\" jurisdiction, the administrative charge must be filed within 300 days of the alleged unlawful conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Rivera v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewers Auth.,</i> 331 F.3d 183, 188 (1st Cir.2003). In his complaint, Frederique alleged that the harassment against him ended when Gonz&#225;lez left the agency, sometime in 1999. Even assuming that the last act of alleged discrimination occurred on December 31, 1999, Frederique would only have had until October 26, 2000 to file his administrative charge with the EEOC. He missed this mark by five days, filing on October 31, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has said that the timeliness requirement under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1) is \"mandatory,\" and failure to file within the time period means a potential plaintiff \"lose[s] the ability to recover for [the alleged discrimination].\" <i>Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</i> 536 U.S. 101, 109, 110, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002). We see no recognized equitable basis for tolling the 300-day period in this case, nor does Frederique suggest that such a basis exists. <i>See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,</i> 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982) (\"[F]iling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC . . . is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\"); <i>Jones v. City of Somerville,</i> 735 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1984) (\"In the absence of a recognized equitable consideration, the limitation period cannot be extended by even one day.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, in an attempt at salvaging the timeliness of his claims, Frederique now points to the document he submitted to the district court in April 2004, in response to defendants' motion to dismiss, and which he also appended to his response to defendants' motion for summary judgment. The document is a preprinted EEOC form entitled \"Charge of Discrimination,\" which Frederique submitted to the EEOC on October 31, 2000, when he filed his Second Charge. The form's preprinted language appears in both English and Spanish. However, all of Frederique's responses are written in Spanish alone. In the box entitled \"FECHA DE ULTIMO ACTO DISCRIMINATORIO/Date most recent or continuous discrimination took place,\" Frederique entered \"Septiembre 14, 2000.\" Frederique argues that the form establishes that the last act of discrimination occurred on September 14, 2000, which he alleges is the true date that Gonz&#225;lez left the DNER. He further avers that the 1999 date for Gonz&#225;lez's departure, which he relied upon in his complaint and repeated in two later court filings, was merely a \"clerical error\" and that his submission of the \"Charge of Discrimination\" form to the district court constituted a \"constructive amendment\" of his complaint under Rule 15(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, Frederique concludes, there was only a one-and-a-half-month gap between the last act of discrimination and his filing of the Second Charge, well within the 300-day requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Frederique argues to no avail. In this circuit, we have repeatedly reminded litigants that \"[t]he law incontrovertibly demands that federal litigation in Puerto Rico be conducted in English,\" and that untranslated documents are not part of the record on appeal. <i>Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am.,</i> 359 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also</i> 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864 (\"All pleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English language.\"). We have also confirmed that this rule applies equally to trial and pre-trial proceedings. <i>See Estades-Negroni,</i> 359 F.3d at 2. While ignorance of this rule would not excuse a failure to translate documents, in this case it appears that Frederique was well aware of this requirement because he filed, along with his opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment, a motion requesting leave to file Spanish language documents and time to obtain certified English translations. Six months passed between the plaintiff's motion to submit the translations and the district court's dismissal of his claims for failure to timely file. During those six months, plaintiff did not submit translations of any documents, including the \"Charge of Discrimination\" form. In sum, because Frederique failed to submit an English-language version of the \"Charge of Discrimination\" form, the date he entered in Spanish on that form is not part of the record and does not impact our above analysis of the timeliness of his claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to avoid the statutory time bar, which was implicated by the 1999 date clearly set forth in his own filings (the complaint, the case management memorandum, and the opposition to the motion for summary judgment), Frederique makes one final, abbreviated argument. He contends that he suffered \"unfair surprise\" because the district court did not give him \"the opportunity to be heard on [the] `fact' issue regarding the filing of the administrative charge.\" The \"fact\" issue to which Frederique refers is a purported typographical error by counsel which stated that the final act of discrimination occurred in 1999, rather than 2000 as Frederique now avers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first glance, Frederique's argument appears to have some attraction. DNER moved for summary judgment only on the constitutional claims, the Title VII retaliation claim, individual liability for the first Title VII claim, and the Puerto Rican law claim. Notably, DNER did not move for summary judgment on official liability for the first Title VII claim. Nevertheless, the district court granted summary judgment on all of Frederique's claims, including a sua sponte grant as to official liability on the first Title VII claim. We have said before that \"[t]hough a district court may enter summary judgment sua sponte at, or in consequence of, a pretrial conference, the court must ensure that the targeted party has an adequate opportunity to dodge the bullet.\" <i>Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1996). Thus, <i>Berkovitz</i> imposes two conditions on a grant of summary judgment. First, \"a district court ordinarily may order summary judgment on its own initiative only when discovery is sufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.\" <i>Id. Berkovitz</i> also requires that \"the court may enter summary judgment sua sponte only if it first gives the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the first <i>Berkovitz</i> requirement is quite clearly satisfied; discovery had proceeded to the point where DNER was able to move for partial summary judgment. As to the second requirement, however, Frederique now claims that he did not have notice as to the grounds on which the court granted summary judgment, and that as a result he had no chance to present evidence on the timeliness issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a way, Frederique's claims seem odd; he had more than ample opportunity to be heard on the issue of when the last act of discrimination occurred. It was he who submitted the 1999 date to the court in three separate filings, the last of which was his response to defendants' motion for summary judgment; and it was he who had the opportunity to seek to amend his complaint at various junctures, either as of right or later by leave of the court. In addition, Frederique had abundant notice that timeliness was an issue; in fact, DNER had moved to dismiss the case in the first instance on just these grounds. Nevertheless, the district court did grant summary judgment without giving Frederique additional notice that timeliness was an issue, and therefore Frederique did not have a further opportunity to present his opposition. It is not clear here whether additional notice and opportunity were required because of the significant prior notice that Frederique had in fact received on the issue. Importantly, this case differs from <i>Berkovitz</i> in that Frederique does not complain that he lacked the opportunity to raise a genuine issue of material fact as between himself and the defendants, but only that he allegedly misstated, on several occasions, an essential element of his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frederique's only basis for claiming that his first three pleadings contained a typographical error is the unsupported assertion of counsel. Frederique points to untranslated documents in the record as evidence of the error, but as we have often stated, litigation in federal courts must be conducted in English. <i>Estades-Negroni,</i> 359 F.3d at 2. Because Frederique forfeited his opportunity to amend the pleadings despite receiving notice that timeliness was at issue, because all of his formal filings contained the 1999 date, and because he has not pointed to anything in the record that supports his allegation that the last date of discrimination occurred in 2000, we will not reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Retaliation Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frederique also appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment as to his retaliation claim, brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e. Frederique alleges that the DNER and various individual employees retaliated against him for filing the Second Charge with the EEOC by not hiring him for a Forest Service Director position. On December 18, 2003, Frederique filed a third complaint with the EEOC (\"Third Charge\") detailing this retaliation allegation. Although he had not yet received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Frederique brought a Title VII retaliation claim against defendants as part of this action. The district court granted summary judgment as to this claim because it was brought prematurely, before issuance of the right-to-sue letter. We agree, for substantially the reasons outlined by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff must exhaust his administrative remedies, including EEOC procedures, before proceeding under. Title VII in federal court. <i>See Lebr&#243;n-R&#237;os v. U.S. Marshal Serv.,</i> 341 F.3d 7, 13 (1st Cir.2003). While Frederique is correct that the exhaustion requirement is not a jurisdictional prerequisite, but rather is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling, <i>see Zipes,</i> 455 U.S. at 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127 (1982), he makes no persuasive argument that the facts or equities favor a waiver in this case. He only suggests that no purpose would be served by permitting the EEOC to conduct a conciliation process regarding his Third Charge because prior efforts to resolve Frederique's other complaints have been \"futile.\" This circuit has taken a \"`narrow view' of equitable exceptions to Title VII\" exhaustion requirements, <i>Mack v. Great Atl. and Pac. Tea Co., Inc.,</i> 871 F.2d 179, 185 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting <i>Earnhardt v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,</i> 691 F.2d 69, 71 (1st Cir.1982)), and Frederique's proffered reason&#8212;alleged futility&#8212;is not sufficient to \"bring [his claim] within that tiny sphere,\" <i>Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 275, 279 (1st Cir.1999). Therefore, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment without prejudice as to this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Law 426 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frederique also brought a supplemental claim against defendants under Puerto Rico Law 426, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167; 601 (2000). The district court granted summary judgment as to this claim, concluding that Law 426 is meant to protect whistleblowers who report acts of public corruption, whereas Frederique failed to identify any information he had disclosed regarding public financial malfeasance. We agree. Though Frederique attempts to broaden the statute to include public employees who \"denounce unlawful acts,\" the statute does not permit such a farranging interpretation. The statute's statement of purpose reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of this chapter is to adopt measures for the protection of the rights of public employees and officials who disclose information or testify on alleged improper or illegal acts <i>regarding the use of public property or funds</i> that due to their nature constitute acts of <i>government corruption,</i> or that fall within the ethical conduct regulated by our legal system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167; 601 (2000) (emphasis added). The record shows that Frederique has only alleged facts related to the discrimination and harassment he allegedly suffered based on his national origin. He makes no allegation that he ever witnessed or reported the misuse of public property or funds. Therefore his claim under Law 426 lacks any factual foundation and was properly dispatched by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.

Frederique subsequently brought this action in United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his complaint filed in this action, Frederique stated that Gonz&#225;lez's discriminatory behavior \"continued until the year 1999 when Gonz&#225;lez Liboy left the agency.\" Frederique repeated this 1999 date in the plaintiff's version of the facts contained in the Supplemental Joint Case Management Memorandum and in his opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment. The 1999 date is critical for our timeliness analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1), a Title VII plaintiff is required to file an administrative charge with the EEOC within either 180 or 300 days after the \"alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" Because Puerto Rico is a so-called \"deferral\" jurisdiction, the administrative charge must be filed within 300 days of the alleged unlawful conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Rivera v.

In his complaint, Frederique alleged that the harassment against him ended when Gonz&#225;lez left the agency, sometime in 1999. Even assuming that the last act of alleged discrimination occurred on December 31, 1999, Frederique would only have had until October 26, 2000 to file his administrative charge with the EEOC. He missed this mark by five days, filing on October 31, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has said that the timeliness requirement under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1) is \"mandatory,\" and failure to file within the time period means a potential plaintiff \"lose[s] the ability to recover for [the alleged discrimination].\" <i>Nat'l R.R.

The document is a preprinted EEOC form entitled \"Charge of Discrimination,\" which Frederique submitted to the EEOC on October 31, 2000, when he filed his Second Charge. The form's preprinted language appears in both English and Spanish. However, all of Frederique's responses are written in Spanish alone. In the box entitled \"FECHA DE ULTIMO ACTO DISCRIMINATORIO/Date most recent or continuous discrimination took place,\" Frederique entered \"Septiembre 14, 2000.\" Frederique argues that the form establishes that the last act of discrimination occurred on September 14, 2000, which he alleges is the true date that Gonz&#225;lez left the DNER. He further avers that the 1999 date for Gonz&#225;lez's departure, which he relied upon in his complaint and repeated in two later court filings, was merely a \"clerical error\" and that his submission of the \"Charge of Discrimination\" form to the district court constituted a \"constructive amendment\" of his complaint under Rule 15(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, Frederique concludes, there was only a one-and-a-half-month gap between the last act of discrimination and his filing of the Second Charge, well within the 300-day requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Frederique argues to no avail. In this circuit, we have repeatedly reminded litigants that \"[t]he law incontrovertibly demands that federal litigation in Puerto Rico be conducted in English,\" and that untranslated documents are not part of the record on appeal. <i>Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785190\"><a href=\"/opinion/785190/nydia-estades-negroni-v-the-associates-corporation-of-north-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also</i> 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864 (\"All pleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English language.\"). We have also confirmed that this rule applies equally to trial and pre-trial proceedings. <i>See Estades-Negroni,</i> 359 F.3d at 2. While ignorance of this rule would not excuse a failure to translate documents, in this case it appears that Frederique was well aware of this requirement because he filed, along with his opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment, a motion requesting leave to file Spanish language documents and time to obtain certified English translations. Six months passed between the plaintiff's motion to submit the translations and the district court's dismissal of his claims for failure to timely file. During those six months, plaintiff did not submit translations of any documents, including the \"Charge of Discrimination\" form. In sum, because Frederique failed to submit an English-language version of the \"Charge of Discrimination\" form, the date he entered in Spanish on that form is not part of the record and does not impact our above analysis of the timeliness of his claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to avoid the statutory time bar, which was implicated by the 1999 date clearly set forth in his own filings (the complaint, the case management memorandum, and the opposition to the motion for summary judgment), Frederique makes one final, abbreviated argument. He contends that he suffered \"unfair surprise\" because the district court did not give him \"the opportunity to be heard on [the] `fact' issue regarding the filing of the administrative charge.\" The \"fact\" issue to which Frederique refers is a purported typographical error by counsel which stated that the final act of discrimination occurred in 1999, rather than 2000 as Frederique now avers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first glance, Frederique's argument appears to have some attraction. DNER moved for summary judgment only on the constitutional claims, the Title VII retaliation claim, individual liability for the first Title VII claim, and the Puerto Rican law claim. Notably, DNER did not move for summary judgment on official liability for the first Title VII claim. Nevertheless, the district court granted summary judgment on all of Frederique's claims, including a sua sponte grant as to official liability on the first Title VII claim. We have said before that \"[t]hough a district court may enter summary judgment sua sponte at, or in consequence of, a pretrial conference, the court must ensure that the targeted party has an adequate opportunity to dodge the bullet.\" <i>Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196881\"><a href=\"/opinion/196881/berkovitz-v-home-box-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1996). Thus, <i>Berkovitz</i> imposes two conditions on a grant of summary judgment. First, \"a district court ordinarily may order summary judgment on its own initiative only when discovery is sufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.\" <i>Id. Berkovitz</i> also requires that \"the court may enter summary judgment sua sponte only if it first gives the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the first <i>Berkovitz</i> requirement is quite clearly satisfied; discovery had proceeded to the point where DNER was able to move for partial summary judgment. As to the second requirement, however, Frederique now claims that he did not have notice as to the grounds on which the court granted summary judgment, and that as a result he had no chance to present evidence on the timeliness issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a way, Frederique's claims seem odd; he had more than ample opportunity to be heard on the issue of when the last act of discrimination occurred. It was he who submitted the 1999 date to the court in three separate filings, the last of which was his response to defendants' motion for summary judgment; and it was he who had the opportunity to seek to amend his complaint at various junctures, either as of right or later by leave of the court. In addition, Frederique had abundant notice that timeliness was an issue; in fact, DNER had moved to dismiss the case in the first instance on just these grounds. Nevertheless, the district court did grant summary judgment without giving Frederique additional notice that timeliness was an issue, and therefore Frederique did not have a further opportunity to present his opposition. It is not clear here whether additional notice and opportunity were required because of the significant prior notice that Frederique had in fact received on the issue. Importantly, this case differs from <i>Berkovitz</i> in that Frederique does not complain that he lacked the opportunity to raise a genuine issue of material fact as between himself and the defendants, but only that he allegedly misstated, on several occasions, an essential element of his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frederique's only basis for claiming that his first three pleadings contained a typographical error is the unsupported assertion of counsel. Frederique points to untranslated documents in the record as evidence of the error, but as we have often stated, litigation in federal courts must be conducted in English. <i>Estades-Negroni,</i> 359 F.3d at 2. Because Frederique forfeited his opportunity to amend the pleadings despite receiving notice that timeliness was at issue, because all of his formal filings contained the 1999 date, and because he has not pointed to anything in the record that supports his allegation that the last date of discrimination occurred in 2000, we will not reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Retaliation Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frederique also appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment as to his retaliation claim, brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e. Frederique alleges that the DNER and various individual employees retaliated against him for filing the Second Charge with the EEOC by not hiring him for a Forest Service Director position. On December 18, 2003, Frederique filed a third complaint with the EEOC (\"Third Charge\") detailing this retaliation allegation. Although he had not yet received a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, Frederique brought a Title VII retaliation claim against defendants as part of this action. The district court granted summary judgment as to this claim because it was brought prematurely, before issuance of the right-to-sue letter. We agree, for substantially the reasons outlined by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff must exhaust his administrative remedies, including EEOC procedures, before proceeding under. Title VII in federal court. <i>See Lebr&#243;n-R&#237;os v. U.S. Marshal Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200596\"><a href=\"/opinion/200596/lebron-rios-v-us-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2003). While Frederique is correct that the exhaustion requirement is not a jurisdictional prerequisite, but rather is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling, <i>see Zipes,</i> 455 U.S. at 393, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110655\"><a href=\"/opinion/110655/zipes-v-trans-world-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></a></span> (1982), he makes no persuasive argument that the facts or equities favor a waiver in this case. He only suggests that no purpose would be served by permitting the EEOC to conduct a conciliation process regarding his Third Charge because prior efforts to resolve Frederique's other complaints have been \"futile.\" This circuit has taken a \"`narrow view' of equitable exceptions to Title VII\" exhaustion requirements, <i>Mack v. Great Atl. and Pac. Tea Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520577\"><a href=\"/opinion/520577/thomasina-mack-v-the-great-atlantic-and-pacific-tea-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 185 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting <i>Earnhardt v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409643\"><a href=\"/opinion/409643/30-fair-emplpraccas-65-30-empl-prac-dec-p-33117-kent-earnhardt/\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir.1982)), and Frederique's proffered reason&#8212;alleged futility&#8212;is not sufficient to \"bring [his claim] within that tiny sphere,\" <i>Bonilla v. Muebles J.J. Alvarez, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198699\"><a href=\"/opinion/198699/bonilla-v-muebles/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 279 (1st Cir.1999). Therefore, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment without prejudice as to this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Law 426 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Frederique also brought a supplemental claim against defendants under Puerto Rico Law 426, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167; 601 (2000). The district court granted summary judgment as to this claim, concluding that Law 426 is meant to protect whistleblowers who report acts of public corruption, whereas Frederique failed to identify any information he had disclosed regarding public financial malfeasance. We agree. Though Frederique attempts to broaden the statute to include public employees who \"denounce unlawful acts,\" the statute does not permit such a farranging interpretation. The statute's statement of purpose reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of this chapter is to adopt measures for the protection of the rights of public employees and officials who disclose information or testify on alleged improper or illegal acts <i>regarding the use of public property or funds</i> that due to their nature constitute acts of <i>government corruption,</i> or that fall within the ethical conduct regulated by our legal system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 1, &#167; 601 (2000) (emphasis added). The record shows that Frederique has only alleged facts related to the discrimination and harassment he allegedly suffered based on his national origin. He makes no allegation that he ever witnessed or reported the misuse of public property or funds. Therefore his claim under Law 426 lacks any factual foundation and was properly dispatched by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D.
