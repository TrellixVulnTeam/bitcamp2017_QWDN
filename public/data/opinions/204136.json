José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                       Lipez, Hansen * and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rafael F. Castro Lang for appellant.\n     German A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa E. Rodriguez Velez, United States Attorney and Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            January 13, 2010\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              HOWARD,    Circuit     Judge.     In   this    opinion,   we    address\n\nseveral issues with respect to the conviction and sentence of Felix\n\nGonzalez-Melendez for aiding and abetting a carjacking in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 2219(1) and (2).            Previously, we remanded a portion\n\nof   this    case   to   the   district    court     (we    did,   however,    retain\n\njurisdiction), so that it could determine whether certain prior\n\nout-of-court statements made by Lawrence Evans, the supervisor of\n\nboth   the    victim     of    the   carjacking      and    the    appellant,    were\n\ndiscoverable under the Jencks Act.              See United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez (Gonzalez-Melendez I), 570 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(per curiam).       In addition, we asked the district court, on remand,\n\nto augment the record with respect to its handling of a jury note.\n\nThis note had requested copies of the indictment and the court's\n\ninstructions of law, as well as an explanation of an unspecified\n\nissue.      See id. at 3.\n\n              Now that the district court has provided the information\n\nwe sought, we proceed to decide the totality of Gonzalez-Melendez's\n\nappeal.      Although the trial leading to the appellant's conviction\n\nwas not free from infirmity, it did not suffer from a crippling\n\nmalaise.      Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.                The same cannot\n\nbe said about the sentence:             as the government concedes in its\n\nbrief, the appellant was not afforded the opportunity to allocute\n\nbefore the district court pronounced sentence.                     Consequently, we\n\nvacate the sentence and remand for re-sentencing.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f                                          I.    Facts\n\n             This case began when the appellant, 1 who was a long-time\n\nemployee    of    Essroc         San   Juan,       a   cement    manufacturer,        who    had\n\nascended from his position as control room operator to process\n\nengineer,       was   passed       over      for       promotion      to    the   position    of\n\nproduction       manager.         As   the     appellant        was    the    only   qualified\n\napplicant within the San Juan plant who applied for the position,\n\nmanagement       conducted         a   broader         search    and       settled   on   Kevin\n\nGrotheer, who was previously employed at one of Essroc's plants in\n\nCanada,    to    fill       the    production          manager     position.         Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez,    who      had    a    history      of       difficult      relations     with    his\n\ncolleagues, was displeased with this personnel                               action, and his\n\nrelationship with Grotheer was strained from the beginning.\n\n             At one point, the appellant expressed his anger at and\n\nfrustration with Grotheer to three acquaintances.                                 He concluded\n\nthis conversation by expressing his wish that someone physically\n\nassault    Grotheer.          There     was    further       testimony        that   Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez met with these three acquaintances to develop a plan to\n\ncarjack Grotheer in the hope of frightening Grotheer so thoroughly\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the\nevidence, and the facts are largely not in dispute.       We thus\nprovide a truncated background narrative.    See United States v.\nSantiago, 566 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir. 2009).     We supplement this\ndescription with additional details as necessary to resolve issues\nraised in this appeal.\n\n                                               -3-\n\fthat he would leave Puerto Rico, thereby clearing the way for the\n\nappellant to ascend to the production manager position.\n\n              A plan to effectuate this goal was eventually hatched.\n\nAs agreed, Gonzalez-Melendez called to inform his accomplices when\n\nGrotheer left the plant one evening in November 2006.                      Consistent\n\nwith   their        plan,    Gonzalez-Melendez's       accomplices       successfully\n\ncarjacked      Grotheer       using    several    firearms,    and    robbed   him     of\n\napproximately $700.             In addition, the accomplices left Grotheer\n\nunharmed on the side of the road, and drove off in the company-\n\nowned Jeep that Grotheer had been driving.\n\n              The next morning, Grotheer received a threatening voice\n\nmessage      from    an     unidentified    caller,    which   he    relayed   to     the\n\ngeneral manager of Essroc San Juan, Lawrence Evans.                    As a result of\n\nreceiving     this     message,       Grotheer    relocated    to    another   part    of\n\nPuerto Rico.         Even after this move Grotheer continued to fear for\n\nhis safety, and in January 2007 he left Puerto Rico due to these\n\nsafety concerns.\n\n              The police commenced an investigation of the carjacking,\n\nand in connection therewith interviewed Gonzalez-Melendez.                      In the\n\ninterview, Gonzalez-Melendez implicated his accomplices and made no\n\nsecret of his anger and resentment that Grotheer was selected to\n\nfill   the    production       manager     position.     In    the    course   of   this\n\ndialogue, Gonzalez-Melendez admitted that he hoped that Grotheer\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fwould suffer physical harm, which would induce him to leave Puerto\n\nRico.\n\n             In due course, a grand jury indicted the appellant on one\n\ncount of aiding and abetting a carjacking in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2119 (1) and (2), and one count of using a firearm during and in\n\nrelation   to      a    carjacking    (which      is   a   crime      of   violence),   in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).\n\n             The       case   proceeded     to    trial,    during     which    Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez   lodged        challenges    to    several       of   the   district    court's\n\nrulings, including a challenge to the court's                          conduct of jury\n\nselection.      In addition, the defendant challenged the district\n\ncourt's evidentiary rulings with respect to certain out-of-court\n\nstatements testified to by both Grotheer and Evans.                            Relatedly,\n\nGonzalez-Melendez asserted that he was entitled to discovery of\n\ncertain prior out-of-court statements that Evans had made to the\n\nFBI, which were allegedly recorded on an FD-302 Form.                       Finally, the\n\nappellant objected to the district court's handling of the first of\n\nseveral notes the jury sent the judge.                      Specifically, Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez contended that no attempt was made to inform him of this\n\nnote, and that, in violation of Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure he was given no opportunity to argue for a\n\nproposed response.\n\n             The jury convicted Gonzalez-Melendez as to the carjacking\n\ncount, but      acquitted him as to the firearms count.                        After the\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fpreparation     of   a   pre-sentence       report   and   the    submission    of\n\nsentencing memoranda and supporting documents, the district court\n\nimposed a sentence of 121 months, which was the lowest sentence\n\nwithin the Guidelines range, along with a term of three years'\n\nsupervised release.      During the course of sentencing, the appellant\n\nwas   not afforded an opportunity to allocute or a functionally\n\nequivalent opportunity to address the court directly and advocate\n\nfor an appropriate sentence.\n\n              This   timely     appeal      followed.       In     our    initial\n\nconsideration of the case, we noted that the government conceded\n\nthat the district court had not conducted an independent review of\n\nthe FD-302 Form, and we remanded the case to permit the district\n\ncourt to conduct such a review.            See Gonzalez-Melendez I, 570 F.3d\n\nat 2-3.   Since a remand was already required to resolve the Jencks\n\nAct issue, we also invited the district court to augment the record\n\nwith regard to its handling of the first jury note.                See id. at 3.\n\n              On remand, the district court ordered the FD-302 Form\n\ndisclosed to appellant's trial and appellate counsel.               In addition,\n\nthe   court    clarified      that   its    recollection    was    that   it   had\n\nindependently reviewed the 302 Form and concluded that the 302 Form\n\nwas not a discoverable \"statement,\" within                 the meaning of the\n\nJencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500.              In response to a request from the\n\ndefendant, on August 7, 2009, the district court held a hearing at\n\nwhich the FBI agent who prepared the 302 Form at issue testified\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthat he did not record or transcribe Evans's statement, nor did\n\nEvans sign or adopt either the agent's notes or the 302.                       Based on\n\nthis       testimony   and     its    own    recollection,        the   district   court\n\nconcluded that the 302 Form was not Jencks material.\n\n               In addition, in its July 7, 2009 submission to us, the\n\ndistrict court explained its recollection of its handling of the\n\nfirst jury note. 2       According to the district court, consistent with\n\nits routine practice, as well as the contemporaneously-produced\n\nMinutes of Proceedings, it discussed the jury note with counsel and\n\nprovided the jury with copies of the indictment and the charge.\n\n                       II.     Challenge to Jury Selection\n\n               With these additions to the record, we now address all\n\nremaining       issues    in    the     appeal,       beginning      with   appellant's\n\nchallenges to the conduct of jury selection.\n\n               In this case, the district court employed the so-called\n\n\"blind strike\" method of jury selection.                       Under this method, both\n\nparties       simultaneously,         rather       than   in     alternating   strikes,\n\nexercise their peremptory challenges and thus do not know which\n\njurors the other has struck.                E.g., United States v. Bermudez, 529\n\nF.3d 158, 163-64 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 956\n\n(2009).       The Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that ordinarily a\n\n\n\n       2\n      In this note, the jury requested copies of the indictment and\nthe court's instructions of law, as well as an explanation of an\nunspecified issue from the district court. See Gonzalez-Melendez\nI, 570 F.3d at 3.\n\n                                             -7-\n\fdefendant     in   a    non-capital   felony       case       is    entitled    to   ten\n\nperemptory challenges, and the prosecution is entitled to six.                       Id.\n\nat 164 (citing Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(b)(2)); see also United States\n\nv. Brown,       510 F.3d 57, 72 n.12 (1st Cir. 2007).                        Should the\n\ndistrict court choose to seat any alternate jurors, see Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 24(c)(1), the rules require that each party be given\n\nadditional     peremptory     challenges.         Fed.   R.    Crim.    P.    24(c)(4).\n\nThese additional peremptory challenges may only be exercised on\n\nalternate jurors.         Id.; United States v. Brown, 510 F.3d 57, 72\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).        To ensure this, the district court is required to\n\ndesignate the alternate jurors at voir dire.                       Brown, 510 F.3d at\n\n72.\n\n              Here, the district court chose to seat two alternate\n\njurors.   Consistent with Rule 24(c)(4)(A), it awarded each party an\n\nadditional peremptory challenge.               See Rule 24(c)(4)(A) (providing\n\nthat   each     party    is   entitled     to     \"One    Additional         peremptory\n\nchallenge\" when the court empanels two alternates).                     This gave the\n\ndefense a total of eleven peremptory challenges (ten from Rule\n\n24(b)(2) and one from Rule 24(c)(4)(A)), and the government seven\n\n(six from Rule 24(b)(2) and one from Rule 24(c)(4)(A)).\n\n              At voir dire, however, the court did not designate which\n\njurors would be alternates.              Instead, it allowed each side to\n\nexercise their peremptory strikes against an undesignated pool of\n\njurors.     The defendant argues that this jury selection procedure\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fviolated       Rule   24(c)'s    explicit       command    that    the     additional\n\nperemptory challenge conferred by that Rule be used only to strike\n\nalternate jurors, and consequently, impaired his exercise of his\n\nperemptory challenges.           Our review of this argument, preserved\n\nbelow, is de novo, see United States v. Gonzalez-Velez, 466 F.3d\n\n27, 39 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n               The district court erred when it failed to designate the\n\nalternate jurors at voir dire.            \"The mandate in Rule 24(c)(4) that\n\n'additional challenges may be used only to remove alternate jurors'\n\nimplies that these alternates must be designated at voir dire, when\n\nthe parties still have the opportunity to use peremptory challenges\n\nto remove potential jurors . . . .\"              Brown, 510 F.3d at 72; United\n\nStates v. Flaherty, 668 F.2d 566, 601 (1st Cir. 1981); see also\n\nUnited States v. Brewer, 199 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2000);\n\nUnited States v. Love, 134 F.3d 595, 601 (4th Cir. 1998).\n\n               Gonzalez-Melendez        argues    that    this     error     requires\n\nautomatic reversal.          He relies upon our decision in United States\n\nv. Vargas, in which we said that \"[t]he denial or impairment of the\n\nright    [to    exercise     peremptory    challenges]      is    reversible    error\n\nwithout a showing or prejudice.\"            606 F.2d 341, 346 (1st Cir. 1979)\n\n(quoting Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 219 (1965)).                       In recent\n\nyears,    however,     the    Supreme    Court    has    disavowed    the    sort   of\n\nreasoning used in Vargas and has indicated that mistaken denials of\n\nperemptory challenges do not ordinarily warrant automatic reversal.\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fSee Rivera v. Illinois, 129 S. Ct. 1446, 1455 (2009); United States\n\nv. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 317 n.4 (2000).                            Instead, we\n\nmust    ask       whether    the    Rule     24(c)(4)     error    affected      Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez's substantial rights.                Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a).           Under that\n\napproach, we deem non-constitutional errors to be harmless when \"it\n\nis highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\"\n\nUnited States v. Pakala, 568 F.3d 47, 52 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. García-Morales, 382 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n              On two previous occasions, we have held that a violation\n\nof Rule 24(c) did not affect the defendant's substantial rights.\n\nBrown, 510 F.3d at 72; Flaherty, 668 F.2d at 601.                     In both of these\n\ndecisions, we expressed skepticism about the prejudicial impact of\n\na Rule 24(c) violation.             Brown, 510 F.3d at 73 (\"[W]hile we regret\n\nthe district court's failure to follow the rule, we cannot imagine\n\nhow     Brown's          substantial       rights    could       possibly       have    been\n\nprejudiced.\");           Flaherty,     510    F.3d   at    73     (\"Despite     the    clear\n\ntransgression of the rule, we do not perceive how defendants'\n\nexercise of their peremptory challenges was curtailed in any way.\n\n.   .   We   do    not    think    that    combining    the     regular   and    alternate\n\nchallenges amounts to a violation of defendants' substantial rights\n\n. . . .\").          Gonzalez-Melendez, however, distinguishes Brown and\n\nFlaherty.          Unlike in those cases, he observes, in this case an\n\nalternate juror was actually seated.                 Thus, he claims, prejudice is\n\nreadily apparent in his case.\n\n\n                                             -10-\n\f            We do not see how that conclusion follows.             It is not\n\nevident that the composition of the jury would have differed had\n\nthe district court adhered to Rule 24(c)(4).            Moreover, even if a\n\ndifferent venire member would have been selected as the alternate\n\njuror, there is no basis in the record for concluding that the\n\nalteration in jury composition had an injurious influence on the\n\nverdict.     Therefore,    we   conclude   that   the    court's   error   was\n\nharmless.\n\n                    III.    Evidentiary Objections\n\n            We turn next to the appellant's evidentiary objections.\n\nSpecifically, he argues that the testimony of Evans and Grotheer\n\nregarding a threatening voice message Grotheer received should have\n\nbeen excluded as hearsay or as unduly prejudicial given its limited\n\nprobative value under Rule 403.        A district court's evidentiary\n\nrulings, particularly those made pursuant to Rule 403, are due\n\nconsiderable deference.     United States v. Wyatt, 561 F.3d 49, 53 &\n\nn.3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2818 (2009) (citation\n\nomitted); Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Can., 210 F.3d 1,\n\n7-8 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            We begin with the hearsay argument.         In a single sentence\n\nof his brief, Gonzalez-Melendez asserts that \"[t]he testimony of\n\nLawrence Evans concerning the phone calls made to Kevin [Grotheer]\n\noutside of his presence was not only hearsay but objectionable\n\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 403 since their probative value was outweighed\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fby the improper prejudice caused.\"                 Aside from this, the appellant\n\nmakes       no    further   argument   about       hearsay;   he   does    not    explain\n\nwhether Evan's testimony was offered for its truth, offered to show\n\nits effect on the speaker, or was subject to any of the exceptions\n\nor exclusions to the hearsay rule.                 Indeed, Gonzalez-Melendez does\n\nnot so much as cite to the relevant Rule of Evidence.                            In these\n\ncircumstances, the appellant's hearsay argument, which does not\n\nexplain          why   Evans's   testimony     was    hearsay,     lacks    sufficient\n\ndeveloped argumentation and is therefore waived.                    United States v.\n\nCruz-Rodriguez, 541 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 129\n\nS. Ct. 1017 (2009) (citing United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n                  The appellant's remaining evidentiary argument is that the\n\ntestimony about the voice mail was unduly prejudicial in light of\n\nits limited probative value.               When testifying about the voice mail,\n\nneither Evans nor Grotheer identified who left the voice mail.\n\nAccordingly, the appellant now claims that this testimony left the\n\njury to speculate that the appellant was somehow responsible for the\n\nthreatening voice mail.\n\n                  Even   assuming   that    the    court   erred   in     admitting   the\n\ntestimony, any error was harmless.                   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a). 3\n\n\n        3\n       Although we are treating the appellant's 403 argument as\npreserved, a strong argument could be made that it was not.     A\nreview of the record indicates that appellant's counsel did not\nobject to either of the witness' testimony on 403 grounds.    See\nUnited States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92, 102 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"If\n\n                                            -12-\n\fThe government presented ample evidence regarding the appellant's\n\nanimus towards Grotheer.         The jury heard testimony that Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez resented Grotheer's selection as production manager, that\n\nhe had a hostile relationship with Grotheer and other co-workers,\n\nthat he had expressed a desire to harm Grotheer, and that he hatched\n\na   plan   to    carjack   Grotheer    with   his accomplices.   Under   these\n\ncircumstances, we do not believe that evidence of this voice mail\n\naffected the outcome of the trial, and therefore any error was\n\nharmless.       See United States v. Adams, 375 F.3d 108, 113 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (\"Even if we found a violation of Rule 403, we would regard\n\nany error as harmless because the evidentiary ruling could not have\n\naffected the outcome.\"); see also United States v. Mangual-Santiago,\n\n562 F.3d 411, 426 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n                           IV.   Jencks Act Violation\n\n                On remand, the district court ordered that the appellant's\n\ntrial and appellate counsel be furnished with copies of the FD-302\n\nForm that contained alleged \"statements\" of Lawrence Evans, which\n\npurportedly should have been disclosed pursuant to the Jencks Act,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3500.          The district court directed the defendant's\n\ncounsel to \"specify docket entries or trial transcripts relevant to\n\nthe [Jencks Act] issue.\"              Gonzalez-Melendez   identified relevant\n\ntestimony, but declined to argue the matter because we retained\n\n\na new basis for objection is raised for the first time on appeal,\nthe ground is not subject to harmless error review, and may only be\nreviewed for plain error.\").\n\n                                         -13-\n\fappellate jurisdiction over the case.                         Based on the information\n\nbefore it, the district court concluded that no Jencks Act violation\n\noccurred.       In    response     to       the   appellant's             objection      to   this\n\nconclusion, the district court held a hearing to examine this issue\n\nin greater detail.\n\n              At the hearing, the district court heard testimony from\n\nSpecial Agent Rubén A. Marchand-Morales, the FBI agent who prepared\n\nthe FD-302 Form, as we had suggested in our remand order.                                Morales\n\ntestified      that     he   did   not      record       or   transcribe          Evans's     oral\n\nstatement.      Rather, Morales testified that he took notes on small\n\nscraps of paper, on which he relied to create the FD-302 Form.\n\nMorales further clarified that Evans neither signed nor adopted\n\neither the 302 or the notes.                Based on this testimony, the district\n\ncourt reaffirmed its conclusion that the FD-302 form was not a\n\n\"written statement of a witness,\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3500(e)(1),       and      further       found       that       the     302    was    not     a\n\n\"substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by a\n\nwitness,\"      within    the    meaning      of     18   U.S.C.       §    3500(e)(2).          See\n\nGonzalez-Melendez I, 570 F.3d at 3-4.\n\n              Review of a district court's Jencks Act determination\n\ntypically is considered to be for abuse of discretion.                              See United\n\nStates v. Femia, 57 F.3d 43, 45 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing United\n\nStates   v.    Foley,    871    F.2d     235,     239    (1st       Cir.    1989)).       When    a\n\ndistrict      court's    decision      is    reviewed         for   abuse     of   discretion,\n\n\n                                             -14-\n\funderlying legal conclusions are reviewed de novo and findings of\n\nfact for clear error.            See, e.g., United States v. Aviles-Sierra,\n\n531 F.3d 123, 126 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v. Guerrier, 428\n\nF.3d 76, 79 n.1 (1st Cir. 2005).                     We will not find clear error\n\nunless, after reviewing all of the evidence, we are \"left with the\n\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n\nUnited States v. Arbour, 559 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n              We cannot say that the district court's conclusion is\n\nclearly erroneous.           To begin, there are questions as to whether the\n\nFD-302   form    was     a    \"substantially         verbatim   recital    of    an   oral\n\nstatement made by a witness\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3500(e)(2).           Although       the   appellant      points   out    that    Morales\n\nacknowledged that the FD-302 form was a \"detailed report\" that\n\ncontained 99% of what Evans told him, Morales specifically denied\n\nthat the FD-302 was a substantially verbatim recital of Evans's oral\n\nstatement       and     instead        called        it   a   summary.          Morales's\n\ncharacterization        of    the     FD-302    is    buttressed   by    the   manner   of\n\ntranscription he employed when interviewing Evans.                        Morales took\n\nnotes on small scraps of paper, relying on those scraps to compile\n\nthe FD-302 form.         This somewhat scattered manner of transcription\n\nputs   into   further        doubt    whether    Evans's      statement   was    captured\n\n\"substantially verbatim.\"\n\n              And it is even more unclear whether the FD-302 form is\n\ndiscoverable under subsection (e)(1) of 18 U.S.C. § 3500.                         For the\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\fform to be discoverable under this subsection, Evans would have\n\nneeded to \"adopt\" or \"approve\" the statement he gave to Morales.\n\nAlthough Morales testified that he \"repeated some of the points of\n\nthe interview to [Evans],\" there is nothing in the record that\n\nsuggests    that   Evans        then    adopted      or   approved     of    these      points.\n\nGoldberg v. United States, 425 U.S. 94, 110 (1976) (noting, when\n\nremanding the case to the district court for a determination under\n\nthe Jencks Act, that \"it will be necessary to determine whether the\n\nprosecutors' notes were actually read back to Newman and whether he\n\nadopted    or   approved        them.\")      (emphasis     added));        see   also    United\n\nStates v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 776 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"A\n\nwritten summary of a witness is not a statement unless the evidence\n\nshows that the witness adopted the notes, a phenomenon that would\n\noccur, for example, if 'the interviewer read the statement back to\n\nthe   witness    and   .    .    .     the   witness      approved    the    statement.'\")\n\n(quoting United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez, 825 F.2d 572, 586 (1st\n\nCir. 1987)).       Gonzalez-Melendez has not argued that Evans adopted\n\nthe   notes,    and,   on       this    record,      we   cannot     say    with   requisite\n\ncertainty that the district court erred when finding that the 302\n\nForm fell outside the scope of the Jencks Act.                             As a result, we\n\naffirm the district court's conclusion. 4\n\n\n      4\n      Because we affirm the district court's conclusion that the\nForm was not discoverable under the Jencks Act, we have no reason\nto apply the especially rigorous form of harmless error review that\nis required when Jencks Act material was not disclosed.         See\nGonzalez-Melendez I, 570 F.3d at 5 (citing Goldberg, 425 U.S. at\n\n                                              -16-\n\f                                V.    Jury Note\n\n              The final trial-related challenge advanced by Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez relates to the district court's handling of the jury's\n\nfirst note.      This note requested copies of the indictment and the\n\ninstructions     and     concluded   with        the   ambiguous   phrase   \"please\n\nexplain.\"      On appeal, the defendant asserted, and the government\n\nconceded, that the district court never informed the parties of this\n\nnote and its response to it.\n\n              Although we would not do so in the ordinary course, we\n\ninvited the district court to augment the record with respect to the\n\nfirst jury note because a remand was required in any event for a\n\ndetermination of the Jencks Act issue.                  Gonzalez-Melendez I, 570\n\nF.3d at 3.     On remand, the district court explained that its routine\n\npractice is to provide the jury with copies of the indictment and\n\ninstructions, and cited to contemporaneously-produced Minutes of\n\nProceedings, which suggested that the first jury note was discussed\n\nwith counsel for both sides.\n\n              We have previously held that \"[a] district court's failure\n\nto attempt to inform defense counsel about the existence of a jury\n\nnote,   and    further    failure    to    solicit      defense    council's   input\n\nregarding any response to such a note, violates Rule 43 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\"              Gonzalez-Melendez I, 570 F.3d\n\nat 3 (citing United States v. Ofray-Campos, 534 F.3d 1, 17 (1st\n\n\n111 n.21).\n\n                                          -17-\n\fCir.), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 588 (2008)).           Here, although the\n\nrecord contains contradictory indications, and the district court's\n\nhandling of the note did not comport with the preferred practice we\n\nhave articulated for handling notes from the jury, see Ofray-Campos,\n\n534 F.3d at 18 (citing United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 525\n\n(1st Cir. 1991)), it appears likely that the defendant was informed\n\nof the note, and the district court's response to the note was\n\nproper. Cf. Cipes v. Mikasa, Inc., 439 F.3d 52, 56-57 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (explaining that judicial proceedings enjoy a presumption of\n\nregularity and dismissing claim that district court misrepresented\n\ncontents of jury note) (citing Oulette v. United States, 852 F.2d\n\n371, 374 (1st Cir. 1988))).       Withal, any error the district court\n\nmay have made with respect to the first jury note was harmless. 5\n\nSee Cipes, 439 F.3d at 56 (noting that district court's failure to\n\nfollow   prescribed   procedure    for    handling   jury   note   engenders\n\nharmless error review); Maraj, 947 F.2d at 526.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      We can be sure of the harmlessness of this error because the\nnote, received at the beginning of deliberations, did not suggest\nthat the jury suffered from substantial confusion or needed\nexplanation of any specific topic. Moreover, the jury continued to\ndeliberate and request additional materials and clarification.\nIndeed, the jury sent the judge two more notes before eventually\nreaching a verdict. Thus, it is likely that the jury's need for an\nexplanation, and any consequent jury confusion, dissipated before\nit rendered a verdict.      Therefore, the appellant suffered no\nprejudice.\n\n                                   -18-\n\f                           VI.     Cumulative Error\n\n            Before we will affirm the conviction in this case, we must\n\nbe satisfied that the combination of the asserted errors, none of\n\nwhich   individually    requires         reversal,    did   not    disfigure   the\n\nproceedings so significantly as to undermine our confidence that the\n\ndefendant received a fair trial.            See United States v. Sepulveda,\n\n15   F.3d   1161,   1195-96      (1st    Cir.   1993)    (\"Individual       errors,\n\ninsufficient in themselves to necessitate a new trial, may in the\n\naggregate have a more debilitating effect.\") (citations omitted).\n\nIn considering a claim of cumulative error, we look to the impact\n\nof a number of variables, such as the nature and number of the\n\nerrors, their interrelationship, if any, how the district court\n\ndealt with the errors as they arose, the length of the trial, and\n\nthe strength of the government's case.               Id. at 1196.\n\n            Here, although the district court allegedly committed\n\nseveral errors with respect to jury selection, its handling of\n\nevidentiary objections, and its handling of the jury note, these\n\nalleged errors were all relatively benign.               Moreover, the alleged\n\nerrors were generally not related to one another, which tends to\n\nlessen our concern that the effect of any error was compounded.\n\n            Accordingly,      we   are    satisfied     that      the   appellant's\n\nconviction need not be disturbed based on any of the individual\n\nerrors that he has assigned, and that these errors cumulatively do\n\nnot compel a different outcome.\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f                                VII.   Sentencing Challenge\n\n                  Having satisfied ourselves that the appellant's conviction\n\nis    sound,       we    turn   to   the   sentence.    Here,     we   find   no   similar\n\ncomfort.          The appellant's primary contention on appeal is that he\n\nwas denied his opportunity to address the court directly and be\n\nheard       prior       to    sentencing.      The   Rules   of   Criminal     Procedure\n\nguarantee this right, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii), 6 which\n\nhas long been accorded special importance at common law.                      See United\n\nStates v. Behrens, 375 U.S. 162, 165 (1963) (recognizing right of\n\nallocution as \"ancient in law\" and codified in Rule 32); United\n\nSates v. De Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 1994).                           Though\n\nsuch circumstances will be \"few and far between,\" with \"doubts\n\nresolved          in    the   defendant's    favor,\"   where    the    totality    of   the\n\ncircumstances \"clearly and convincingly\" show that the defendant was\n\nafforded the right address the court on any subject of his choosing\n\nprior to the imposition of his sentence, a sentence will stand even\n\nin the absence of specific compliance with the imperative of Rule\n\n32.         Id.   (citing Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 301, 304-05\n\n(1961)); see also United States v. Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d 1, 11 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n        6\n      The text of Rule 32 provides in pertinent part that \"[b]efore\nimposing sentence, the court must: . . . address the defendant\npersonally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any\ninformation to mitigate the sentence.\"          Fed. R. Crim. P.\n32(i)(4)(A)(ii).\n\n                                              -20-\n\f            In the present case, the district court transgressed the\n\nspecific    provision   of   Rule   32(i)(4)(A)(ii)      by   not    inviting    the\n\ndefendant    to   speak.     The    appellant   argues    that      although     the\n\ntranscript reveals that his counsel was permitted to address the\n\ncourt, there is no indication -- let alone the powerful indication\n\nrequired under our precedent -- that he was afforded the functional\n\nequivalent of allocution.          The government agrees.\n\n            Where a defendant has been denied the right to allocute,\n\nthis error can almost never be regarded as harmless.                De Alba Pagan,\n\n33 F.3d at 129-30 (\"[W]e cannot dismiss the error as harmless.                    As\n\nearly as 1689, the common law acknowledged that a court's failure\n\nto invite a defendant to speak before sentencing required reversal\n\n. . . . It is settled that a failure to comply with the mandate of\n\nRule 32[(i)(4)(A)(ii)] ordinarily requires vacation of the sentence\n\nimposed without a concomitant inquiry into prejudice.\").                 Instead,\n\nthis error irremediably poisons the sentence and requires that the\n\nproceedings be held afresh.         See Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d at 11.           When\n\nthe sentencing guidelines were still mandatory, some courts held\n\nthat a failure to permit allocution could be considered harmless\n\nwhere the defendant's sentence was \"already as short as it could\n\npossibly be under the [Sentencing] Guidelines,\" United States v.\n\nCarper, 24 F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir. 1994).                   Post-Booker, this\n\nsuggestion has less force because the defendant's presentation may\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fconvince the court to craft a non-guidelines sentence.      Accordingly,\n\nwe remand this case for re-sentencing. 7\n\n                           VIII.   Conclusion\n\n          Because   we   are   satisfied   that   appellant's    conviction\n\nsuffered from no prejudicial errors, it is affirmed.            But because\n\nGonzales-Melendez was not afforded his right of allocution, his\n\nsentence is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Because we remand this case for re-sentencing, we           need not\ntake up the appellant's remaining sentencing arguments,           and note\nthat he is not precluded from seeking a non-guidelines            sentence\nduring re-sentencing. See De Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d at 130           n.6.\n\n                                   -22-\n\f",

In   this    opinion,   we    address\n\nseveral issues with respect to the conviction and sentence of Felix\n\nGonzalez-Melendez for aiding and abetting a carjacking in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 2219(1) and (2).            Previously, we remanded a portion\n\nof   this    case   to   the   district    court     (we    did,   however,    retain\n\njurisdiction), so that it could determine whether certain prior\n\nout-of-court statements made by Lawrence Evans, the supervisor of\n\nboth   the    victim     of    the   carjacking      and    the    appellant,    were\n\ndiscoverable under the Jencks Act.

In addition, we asked the district court, on remand,\n\nto augment the record with respect to its handling of a jury note.\n\nThis note had requested copies of the indictment and the court's\n\ninstructions of law, as well as an explanation of an unspecified\n\nissue.      See id. at 3.\n\n              Now that the district court has provided the information\n\nwe sought, we proceed to decide the totality of Gonzalez-Melendez's\n\nappeal.      Although the trial leading to the appellant's conviction\n\nwas not free from infirmity, it did not suffer from a crippling\n\nmalaise.      Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.                The same cannot\n\nbe said about the sentence:             as the government concedes in its\n\nbrief, the appellant was not afforded the opportunity to allocute\n\nbefore the district court pronounced sentence.                     Consequently, we\n\nvacate the sentence and remand for re-sentencing.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f                                          I.    Facts\n\n             This case began when the appellant, 1 who was a long-time\n\nemployee    of    Essroc         San   Juan,       a   cement    manufacturer,        who    had\n\nascended from his position as control room operator to process\n\nengineer,       was   passed       over      for       promotion      to    the   position    of\n\nproduction       manager.         As   the     appellant        was    the    only   qualified\n\napplicant within the San Juan plant who applied for the position,\n\nmanagement       conducted         a   broader         search    and       settled   on   Kevin\n\nGrotheer, who was previously employed at one of Essroc's plants in\n\nCanada,    to    fill       the    production          manager     position.         Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez,    who      had    a    history      of       difficult      relations     with    his\n\ncolleagues, was displeased with this personnel                               action, and his\n\nrelationship with Grotheer was strained from the beginning.\n\n             At one point, the appellant expressed his anger at and\n\nfrustration with Grotheer to three acquaintances.                                 He concluded\n\nthis conversation by expressing his wish that someone physically\n\nassault    Grotheer.          There     was    further       testimony        that   Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez met with these three acquaintances to develop a plan to\n\ncarjack Grotheer in the hope of frightening Grotheer so thoroughly\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the\nevidence, and the facts are largely not in dispute.       We thus\nprovide a truncated background narrative.    See United States v.\nSantiago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203832\"><a href=\"/opinion/203832/united-states-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1st Cir. 2009).     We supplement this\ndescription with additional details as necessary to resolve issues\nraised in this appeal.\n\n                                               -3-\n\fthat he would leave Puerto Rico, thereby clearing the way for the\n\nappellant to ascend to the production manager position.\n\n              A plan to effectuate this goal was eventually hatched.\n\nAs agreed, Gonzalez-Melendez called to inform his accomplices when\n\nGrotheer left the plant one evening in November 2006.                      Consistent\n\nwith   their        plan,    Gonzalez-Melendez's       accomplices       successfully\n\ncarjacked      Grotheer       using    several    firearms,    and    robbed   him     of\n\napproximately $700.             In addition, the accomplices left Grotheer\n\nunharmed on the side of the road, and drove off in the company-\n\nowned Jeep that Grotheer had been driving.\n\n              The next morning, Grotheer received a threatening voice\n\nmessage      from    an     unidentified    caller,    which   he    relayed   to     the\n\ngeneral manager of Essroc San Juan, Lawrence Evans.                    As a result of\n\nreceiving     this     message,       Grotheer    relocated    to    another   part    of\n\nPuerto Rico.         Even after this move Grotheer continued to fear for\n\nhis safety, and in January 2007 he left Puerto Rico due to these\n\nsafety concerns.\n\n              The police commenced an investigation of the carjacking,\n\nand in connection therewith interviewed Gonzalez-Melendez.                      In the\n\ninterview, Gonzalez-Melendez implicated his accomplices and made no\n\nsecret of his anger and resentment that Grotheer was selected to\n\nfill   the    production       manager     position.     In    the    course   of   this\n\ndialogue, Gonzalez-Melendez admitted that he hoped that Grotheer\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fwould suffer physical harm, which would induce him to leave Puerto\n\nRico.\n\n             In due course, a grand jury indicted the appellant on one\n\ncount of aiding and abetting a carjacking in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2119 (1) and (2), and one count of using a firearm during and in\n\nrelation   to      a    carjacking    (which      is   a   crime      of   violence),   in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).\n\n             The       case   proceeded     to    trial,    during     which    Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez   lodged        challenges    to    several       of   the   district    court's\n\nrulings, including a challenge to the court's                          conduct of jury\n\nselection.      In addition, the defendant challenged the district\n\ncourt's evidentiary rulings with respect to certain out-of-court\n\nstatements testified to by both Grotheer and Evans.                            Relatedly,\n\nGonzalez-Melendez asserted that he was entitled to discovery of\n\ncertain prior out-of-court statements that Evans had made to the\n\nFBI, which were allegedly recorded on an FD-302 Form.                       Finally, the\n\nappellant objected to the district court's handling of the first of\n\nseveral notes the jury sent the judge.                      Specifically, Gonzalez-\n\nMelendez contended that no attempt was made to inform him of this\n\nnote, and that, in violation of Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure he was given no opportunity to argue for a\n\nproposed response.\n\n             The jury convicted Gonzalez-Melendez as to the carjacking\n\ncount, but      acquitted him as to the firearms count.                        After the\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fpreparation     of   a   pre-sentence       report   and   the    submission    of\n\nsentencing memoranda and supporting documents, the district court\n\nimposed a sentence of 121 months, which was the lowest sentence\n\nwithin the Guidelines range, along with a term of three years'\n\nsupervised release.      During the course of sentencing, the appellant\n\nwas   not afforded an opportunity to allocute or a functionally\n\nequivalent opportunity to address the court directly and advocate\n\nfor an appropriate sentence.\n\n              This   timely     appeal      followed.       In     our    initial\n\nconsideration of the case, we noted that the government conceded\n\nthat the district court had not conducted an independent review of\n\nthe FD-302 Form, and we remanded the case to permit the district\n\ncourt to conduct such a review.            See Gonzalez-Melendez I, 570 F.3d\n\nat 2-3.   Since a remand was already required to resolve the Jencks\n\nAct issue, we also invited the district court to augment the record\n\nwith regard to its handling of the first jury note.                See id. at 3.\n\n              On remand, the district court ordered the FD-302 Form\n\ndisclosed to appellant's trial and appellate counsel.               In addition,\n\nthe   court    clarified      that   its    recollection    was    that   it   had\n\nindependently reviewed the 302 Form and concluded that the 302 Form\n\nwas not a discoverable \"statement,\" within                 the meaning of the\n\nJencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500.              In response to a request from the\n\ndefendant, on August 7, 2009, the district court held a hearing at\n\nwhich the FBI agent who prepared the 302 Form at issue testified\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fthat he did not record or transcribe Evans's statement, nor did\n\nEvans sign or adopt either the agent's notes or the 302.                       Based on\n\nthis       testimony   and     its    own    recollection,        the   district   court\n\nconcluded that the 302 Form was not Jencks material.\n\n               In addition, in its July 7, 2009 submission to us, the\n\ndistrict court explained its recollection of its handling of the\n\nfirst jury note. 2       According to the district court, consistent with\n\nits routine practice, as well as the contemporaneously-produced\n\nMinutes of Proceedings, it discussed the jury note with counsel and\n\nprovided the jury with copies of the indictment and the charge.\n\n                       II.     Challenge to Jury Selection\n\n               With these additions to the record, we now address all\n\nremaining       issues    in    the     appeal,       beginning      with   appellant's\n\nchallenges to the conduct of jury selection.\n\n               In this case, the district court employed the so-called\n\n\"blind strike\" method of jury selection.                       Under this method, both\n\nparties       simultaneously,         rather       than   in     alternating   strikes,\n\nexercise their peremptory challenges and thus do not know which\n\njurors the other has struck.

Fed.   R.    Crim.    P.    24(c)(4).\n\nThese additional peremptory challenges may only be exercised on\n\nalternate jurors.         Id.; United States v.

To ensure this, the district court is required to\n\ndesignate the alternate jurors at voir dire.                       Brown, 510 F.3d at\n\n72.\n\n              Here, the district court chose to seat two alternate\n\njurors.   Consistent with Rule 24(c)(4)(A), it awarded each party an\n\nadditional peremptory challenge.               See Rule 24(c)(4)(A) (providing\n\nthat   each     party    is   entitled     to     \"One    Additional         peremptory\n\nchallenge\" when the court empanels two alternates).                     This gave the\n\ndefense a total of eleven peremptory challenges (ten from Rule\n\n24(b)(2) and one from Rule 24(c)(4)(A)), and the government seven\n\n(six from Rule 24(b)(2) and one from Rule 24(c)(4)(A)).\n\n              At voir dire, however, the court did not designate which\n\njurors would be alternates.              Instead, it allowed each side to\n\nexercise their peremptory strikes against an undesignated pool of\n\njurors.     The defendant argues that this jury selection procedure\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fviolated       Rule   24(c)'s    explicit       command    that    the     additional\n\nperemptory challenge conferred by that Rule be used only to strike\n\nalternate jurors, and consequently, impaired his exercise of his\n\nperemptory challenges.

In these\n\ncircumstances, the appellant's hearsay argument, which does not\n\nexplain          why   Evans's   testimony     was    hearsay,     lacks    sufficient\n\ndeveloped argumentation and is therefore waived.

When testifying about the voice mail,\n\nneither Evans nor Grotheer identified who left the voice mail.\n\nAccordingly, the appellant now claims that this testimony left the\n\njury to speculate that the appellant was somehow responsible for the\n\nthreatening voice mail.\n\n                  Even   assuming   that    the    court   erred   in     admitting   the\n\ntestimony, any error was harmless.

In    response     to       the   appellant's             objection      to   this\n\nconclusion, the district court held a hearing to examine this issue\n\nin greater detail.\n\n              At the hearing, the district court heard testimony from\n\nSpecial Agent Rubén A. Marchand-Morales, the FBI agent who prepared\n\nthe FD-302 Form, as we had suggested in our remand order.                                Morales\n\ntestified      that     he   did   not      record       or   transcribe          Evans's     oral\n\nstatement.      Rather, Morales testified that he took notes on small\n\nscraps of paper, on which he relied to create the FD-302 Form.\n\nMorales further clarified that Evans neither signed nor adopted\n\neither the 302 or the notes.                Based on this testimony, the district\n\ncourt reaffirmed its conclusion that the FD-302 form was not a\n\n\"written statement of a witness,\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   3500(e)(1),       and      further       found       that       the     302    was    not     a\n\n\"substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by a\n\nwitness,\"      within    the    meaning      of     18   U.S.C.       §    3500(e)(2).

To begin, there are questions as to whether the\n\nFD-302   form    was     a    \"substantially         verbatim   recital    of    an   oral\n\nstatement made by a witness\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3500(e)(2).           Although       the   appellant      points   out    that    Morales\n\nacknowledged that the FD-302 form was a \"detailed report\" that\n\ncontained 99% of what Evans told him, Morales specifically denied\n\nthat the FD-302 was a substantially verbatim recital of Evans's oral\n\nstatement       and     instead        called        it   a   summary.          Morales's\n\ncharacterization        of    the     FD-302    is    buttressed   by    the   manner   of\n\ntranscription he employed when interviewing Evans.                        Morales took\n\nnotes on small scraps of paper, relying on those scraps to compile\n\nthe FD-302 form.         This somewhat scattered manner of transcription\n\nputs   into   further        doubt    whether    Evans's      statement   was    captured\n\n\"substantially verbatim.\"\n\n              And it is even more unclear whether the FD-302 form is\n\ndiscoverable under subsection (e)(1) of 18 U.S.C. § 3500.

Thus, it is likely that the jury's need for an\nexplanation, and any consequent jury confusion, dissipated before\nit rendered a verdict.      Therefore, the appellant suffered no\nprejudice.\n\n                                   -18-\n\f                           VI.     Cumulative Error\n\n            Before we will affirm the conviction in this case, we must\n\nbe satisfied that the combination of the asserted errors, none of\n\nwhich   individually    requires         reversal,    did   not    disfigure   the\n\nproceedings so significantly as to undermine our confidence that the\n\ndefendant received a fair trial.

Sepulveda,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   1195-96      (1st    Cir.   1993)    (\"Individual       errors,\n\ninsufficient in themselves to necessitate a new trial, may in the\n\naggregate have a more debilitating effect.\") (citations omitted).\n\nIn considering a claim of cumulative error, we look to the impact\n\nof a number of variables, such as the nature and number of the\n\nerrors, their interrelationship, if any, how the district court\n\ndealt with the errors as they arose, the length of the trial, and\n\nthe strength of the government's case.               Id. at 1196.\n\n            Here, although the district court allegedly committed\n\nseveral errors with respect to jury selection, its handling of\n\nevidentiary objections, and its handling of the jury note, these\n\nalleged errors were all relatively benign.               Moreover, the alleged\n\nerrors were generally not related to one another, which tends to\n\nlessen our concern that the effect of any error was compounded.\n\n            Accordingly,      we   are    satisfied     that      the   appellant's\n\nconviction need not be disturbed based on any of the individual\n\nerrors that he has assigned, and that these errors cumulatively do\n\nnot compel a different outcome.\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f                                VII.   Sentencing Challenge\n\n                  Having satisfied ourselves that the appellant's conviction\n\nis    sound,       we    turn   to   the   sentence.    Here,     we   find   no   similar\n\ncomfort.          The appellant's primary contention on appeal is that he\n\nwas denied his opportunity to address the court directly and be\n\nheard       prior       to    sentencing.      The   Rules   of   Criminal     Procedure\n\nguarantee this right, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii), 6 which\n\nhas long been accorded special importance at common law.

R. Crim. P.\n32(i)(4)(A)(ii).\n\n                                              -20-\n\f            In the present case, the district court transgressed the\n\nspecific    provision   of   Rule   32(i)(4)(A)(ii)      by   not    inviting    the\n\ndefendant    to   speak.     The    appellant   argues    that      although     the\n\ntranscript reveals that his counsel was permitted to address the\n\ncourt, there is no indication -- let alone the powerful indication\n\nrequired under our precedent -- that he was afforded the functional\n\nequivalent of allocution.          The government agrees.\n\n            Where a defendant has been denied the right to allocute,\n\nthis error can almost never be regarded as harmless.                De Alba Pagan,\n\n33 F.3d at 129-30 (\"[W]e cannot dismiss the error as harmless.                    As\n\nearly as 1689, the common law acknowledged that a court's failure\n\nto invite a defendant to speak before sentencing required reversal\n\n. . . . It is settled that a failure to comply with the mandate of\n\nRule 32[(i)(4)(A)(ii)] ordinarily requires vacation of the sentence\n\nimposed without a concomitant inquiry into prejudice.\").                 Instead,\n\nthis error irremediably poisons the sentence and requires that the\n\nproceedings be held afresh.         See Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d at 11.           When\n\nthe sentencing guidelines were still mandatory, some courts held\n\nthat a failure to permit allocution could be considered harmless\n\nwhere the defendant's sentence was \"already as short as it could\n\npossibly be under the [Sentencing] Guidelines,\" United States v.\n\nCarper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670607\"><a href=\"/opinion/670607/united-states-v-larry-wayne-carper-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1162 (9th Cir. 1994).                   Post-Booker, this\n\nsuggestion has less force because the defendant's presentation may\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\fconvince the court to craft a non-guidelines sentence.      Accordingly,\n\nwe remand this case for re-sentencing. 7\n\n                           VIII.   Conclusion\n\n          Because   we   are   satisfied   that   appellant's    conviction\n\nsuffered from no prejudicial errors, it is affirmed.            But because\n\nGonzales-Melendez was not afforded his right of allocution, his\n\nsentence is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Because we remand this case for re-sentencing, we           need not\ntake up the appellant's remaining sentencing arguments,           and note\nthat he is not precluded from seeking a non-guidelines            sentence\nduring re-sentencing. See De Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d at 130           n.6.\n\n                                   -22-\n\f</pre>",
