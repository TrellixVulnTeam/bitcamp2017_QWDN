The remaining two panelists therefore issued that opinion\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง46(d). This per curiam opinion is issued\non the same basis.\n\f            PER CURIAM. This appeal arose from a medical malpractice\n\nlawsuit alleging negligent prenatal care and injuries sustained by\n\nAaron Nett during his delivery on April 2, 1992.     The Netts filed\n\nsuit against the obstetrician, Mitchell Bellucci, M.D., on April\n\n30, 1996.     When the Netts discovered that the problems during\n\ndelivery may have stemmed in part from an allegedly erroneous\n\nreading of an ultrasound by radiologist Peter Gross, M.D. on March\n\n26, 1992, they filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint to\n\ninclude him as a defendant on March 10, 1999.        In filing their\n\nmotion to amend, the Netts failed to comply with Massachusetts\nDistrict Court Local Rule 15.1(b), which requires the service of\n\n\"the motion to amend upon the proposed new party at least ten (10)\ndays in advance of filing the motion.\" Local Rule 15.1(b). Despite\nthis failure, the clerk of court accepted their initial filing on\n\nMarch 10, 1999.     However, after discovering their omission, the\nNetts, of their own accord, served Dr. Gross with the motion for\nleave to amend their complaint, as well as a motion to extend time,\n\non March 19, 1999.      In compliance with the local rule, these\nmotions were then refiled with the court on March 29, 1999.       The\nNetts filed their amended complaint on April 26, 1999.\n\n            On March 26, 1999, after the initial filing of the motion\nto amend but before the second filing of the motion to amend and\nthe filing of the amended complaint, the time during which the\n\nNetts   could   commence   an   action   against   Dr.   Gross   under\nMassachusetts' seven-year statutes of repose expired. The district\n\ncourt dismissed their claim against Dr. Gross on that basis.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f            In considering the appeal filed by the Netts from the\n\ndecision by the district court, we concluded that it was unclear\n\nunder Massachusetts law whether the filing of a motion for leave to\namend constitutes the commencement of the action for the purpose of\n\nthe statute of repose, or, as the district court held, the amended\n\ncomplaint itself must be filed within the statutory period.                     See\n\nNett v. Bellucci, 269 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001).                    Therefore, we\n\ncertified    two    questions     to   the     Supreme     Judicial     Court   of\n\nMassachusetts:      (1) Is the operative date for commencement of an\n\naction for purposes of the Massachusetts statutes of repose the\n\ndate of filing of a motion and supporting memorandum for leave to\n\namend a complaint to add a party (assuming timely service), or is\n\nthe operative date the date the amended complaint is filed after\nleave of court is granted, when leave of court is required by the\n\nRules of Civil Procedure to file an amended complaint?                 (2) If the\n\nanswer to Question No. 1 is that the operative date is the date of\nfiling of the motion for leave to amend, do the policies underlying\n\nthe statutes of repose require that such filings be in compliance\n\nwith the local rules of court applicable to the filing of such\n\nmotions, or do those policies permit the court in its discretion to\n\nexcuse non-compliance with the local rules?\n\n            In     an   opinion   filed       on     September   4,    2002,    the\n\nMassachusetts      Supreme   Judicial        Court    answered   the    certified\n\nquestions as follows:\n\n     (1) The operative date for commencement of an action for\n     purposes of a statute of repose is the date of filing of\n     a motion for leave to amend a complaint to add a party;\n     and (2) the policies underlying the statute of repose do\n\n                                       -3-\n\f    not require that the motion for leave to amend comply\n    with the local rules, as long as the motion itself is\n    accepted for filing within the period provided by the\n    statute of repose. Nett v. Bellucci, 437 Mass. 630, 630-\n    31 (2002).\nIn accordance with these answers, we vacate the decision of the\n\ndistrict court and remand for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthe decision of the Supreme Judicial Court.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
