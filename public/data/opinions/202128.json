Plaintiffs are former employees\n\nof    Crowley   Towing    and   Transportation   Company   (\"Crowley\")   who\n\nbrought a \"hybrid\" Section 301/unfair representation action under\n\nthe Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185, against\n\ndefendants Crowley and Seafarers International Union of North\n\nAmerica (\"Union\").1 Plaintiffs claimed that the layoff methodology\n\nnegotiated for the shutdown of Crowley's Puerto Rico operation\n\nviolated the seniority provisions of their collective bargaining\n\nagreement (CBA).         On appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district\n\ncourt's denials of their motions to amend their complaint and for\n\nadditional discovery to respond to defendants' successful motions\n\nfor summary judgment.2\n\n            Crowley notified the Union in December 1996 of its\n\nintention to close permanently its operations in Puerto Rico.            The\n\nUnion and Crowley met to negotiate various aspects of the shutdown,\n\nincluding which employees would be retained for residual work after\n\nthe    shutdown   and    various   benefits   issues.      Some   employees,\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Although the notice of appeal was apparently filed on behalf of\nall plaintiffs who brought this action, four of the eight settled\ntheir cases and dismissed their claims and are therefore not\nparties to this appeal.\n2\n  Plaintiffs also make passing suggestions that the court erred in\ngranting defendants' summary judgment motions but have failed to\ndevelop any such argument sufficiently to put the correctness of\nthe summary judgment rulings in dispute (other than as premised on\nthe denials of the motions to amend and for additional discovery).\nSee United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fincluding a number of the plaintiffs, attended the negotiation\n\nsessions.\n\n            On    March    1,    1997,   Crowley   shut   down    most   of   its\n\noperations and laid off most of its employees.             On March 6, 1997,\n\na letter agreement between Crowley and the Union was posted in the\n\nunion hall.      The agreement listed all the employees laid off as of\n\nMarch 1, and also those employees who would be temporarily retained\n\nto   complete     Crowley's      residual   contractual   obligations.        The\n\nimmediately terminated employees received their last paychecks on\n\nMarch 7, 1997.       On April 17, 1997, the parties reached a second\n\nagreement,       known    as    \"the   stipulation,\"   which     addressed    the\n\n\"effects\" of the shutdown by resolving outstanding benefits issues.\n\n            The present case was initiated by six plaintiffs, who\n\nfiled a putative class action in the Southern District of Florida\n\non August 27, 1997, claiming that Crowley and the Union had\n\nviolated the CBA's seniority provisions in selecting the employees\n\nwho would be retained after the shutdown. The case was transferred\n\nto the District of Puerto Rico and consolidated with a related case\n\nbrought in that court by two of the six Florida plaintiffs.\n\nProcedural tangles, discovery disputes, and delays followed.                  For\n\nour purposes, only the following are of consequence.\n\n            The district court denied plaintiffs' motion to certify\n\na class action on December 29, 1998.           On January 28, 1999, one day\n\nbefore the court's deadline for dispositive motions, plaintiffs\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\ffiled a motion to amend their complaint to add 96 additional\n\nplaintiffs.   The following day both Crowley and the Union filed\n\nmotions for summary judgment.      Thereafter, Crowley and the Union\n\nfiled oppositions to the motion to amend, arguing that amendment\n\nwas futile because the new plaintiffs' claims were untimely and\n\nfiled in bad faith.\n\n           At a discovery conference in May 1999, the court ordered\n\nthe parties to brief their positions on the timeliness of the\n\nproposed   amended   complaint   and   directed   defendants   to   answer\n\noutstanding interrogatories by June 4, 1999. The court also stated\n\nit would \"take under advisement whether the motion for summary\n\n[judgment] filed by defendants should be stayed until discovery was\n\ncompleted.\"   The parties duly filed their briefs on the timeliness\n\nissue.   Both sides included evidentiary material in their filings,\n\nmuch of which duplicated the summary judgment materials.\n\n           On June 21, 2000, plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the\n\ndepositions of the two affiants who figured prominently in the\n\ndefendants' motions for summary judgment.          See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(f).   On December 11, 2000, the district court denied the motion\n\nto amend as to 94 of the 96 new plaintiffs, concluding that their\n\nclaims were time-barred.    The district court did, however, permit\n\nthe addition of two other plaintiffs whose claims were not time-\n\nbarred because they had filed grievances with the Union about the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\flay-off, thus tolling the statute of limitations. This brought the\n\ntotal number of plaintiffs to eight.\n\n           The case languished for over three years and was then\n\ntransferred to a different district judge.                    On June 28, 2004, the\n\nnew judge denied the motion for additional discovery as untimely\n\nand unsupported by the affidavit required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\nPlaintiffs then filed their response to the pending motions for\n\nsummary judgment.           On September 30, 2004, the district court\n\ngranted   partial         summary   judgment      to    the    Union    and    Crowley,\n\ndismissing     four   of     the    plaintiffs     on    the    ground     that   their\n\nseniority rights were not violated in the shutdown.                           The court\n\ndenied summary judgment with respect to the other four plaintiffs;\n\nthose remaining plaintiffs eventually settled their claims.\n\n           The       94     prospective       plaintiffs        (\"the    prospective\n\nplaintiffs\") whose claims the district court found to have been\n\ntime-barred appeal from the court's December 11, 2000 order denying\n\nthe   motion    to    amend.        The   four    plaintiffs       (\"the      dismissed\n\nplaintiffs\")     whose      claims     were     dismissed      appeal    the    court's\n\nSeptember 30, 2004 order partially granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the defendants.            As to this issue, they do not attack the\n\nmerits of the summary judgment decision, but rather argue that the\n\ncourt should have allowed them to conduct additional discovery\n\nbefore issuing a summary judgment ruling.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f           We start with the prospective plaintiffs' challenge to\n\nthe denial of their motion to amend.          This issue turns on whether\n\nthe prospective plaintiffs had timely claims (putting aside the\n\ntolling that occurred while the class action issue was pending).\n\nThis question, in turn, turns on when the cause of action accrued.\n\nThe district court found, considering the evidence, that the\n\naccrual date was in early March of 1997.          The court held that the\n\nmotion to amend would be futile for 94 of the 96 prospective\n\nplaintiffs, since their claims were time-barred.\n\n           On appeal, the prospective plaintiffs argue that the\n\naccrual date was later than that found by the district court.\n\nPointing out that motions to amend are to be \"freely granted,\" the\n\nprospective plaintiffs contend that their motion should have been\n\nassessed under the liberal Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) standard based\n\nentirely on the \"four corners\" of the tendered complaint, and that\n\nthe   district    court    erred   in    considering   outside   evidentiary\n\nmaterials without notice that it was going to do so.             Building on\n\nthis position, the prospective plaintiffs further contend that the\n\ncourt was bound by their allegation that the layoffs did not take\n\nplace   until    April    1,   1997.      Alternatively,   the   prospective\n\nplaintiffs posit that they did not know of their injury until they\n\nlearned that defendants had actually violated the CBA's seniority\n\nprovisions, and the evidence suggests that did not occur until the\n\nprospective plaintiffs eventually received a copy of the operative\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fCBA in July 1997, or, at the earliest, the date of the stipulation\n\n(April 17, 1997).\n\n          We review denials of motions to amend pleadings for abuse\n\nof discretion.   See Interstate Litho Corp. v. Brown, 255 F.3d 19,\n\n25 (1st Cir. 2001); see also    Charles Bank Equity Fund II v. Blinds\n\nto Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151, 158 (1st Cir. 2004)(\"An error of law is,\n\nof course, always an abuse of discretion.\").           Consent to file\n\namended pleadings \"shall be freely given when justice so requires,\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), unless the amendment would be futile or\n\nreward undue delay, see Steir v. Girl Scouts of the USA, 383 F.3d\n\n7, 12 (1st Cir. 2004);     Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold, 30 F.3d\n\n251, 253 (1st Cir. 1994).       In assessing futility, the district\n\ncourt must apply the standard which applies to motions to dismiss\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).         See Glassman v. Computervision\n\nCorp., 90 F.3d 617, 623 (1st Cir. 1996).       The bar for a plaintiff\n\ntendering an amended complaint is higher after a motion for summary\n\njudgment has been filed, as the plaintiff must demonstrate \"that\n\nthe   proposed   amendments    were   supported   by   substantial   and\n\nconvincing evidence.\"    Gold, 30 F.3d at 253 (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted);     see also Girl Scouts, 383 F.3d at 12.3\n\n\n3\n  The prospective plaintiffs' motion to amend was actually filed\none day before the defendants' motions for summary judgment, which\nwere filed on the deadline for dispositive motions established by\nthe court. However, all the motions were entered on the electronic\ndocket the same day, and the district court considered them\ntogether.   At bottom, the motion to amend was tendered at the\n\"eleventh hour to fend off summary judgment,\" and a court \"need not\n\n                                  -7-\n\f          We begin on common ground.   Both sides agree that a six-\n\nmonth statute of limitations applies to \"hybrid\" actions, and that\n\nthe clock started ticking when the prospective plaintiffs knew, or\n\nreasonably should have known, of the alleged wrongful acts.    See\n\nArriaga-Zayas   v. Int'l Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, 835 F.2d\n\n11, 13 (1st Cir. 1987).    The parties also agree, and we accept\n\narguendo, that the running of the statute was tolled during the\n\npendency of the motion for class certification.      See generally\n\nBasch v. Ground Round, Inc., 139 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nBecause the prospective plaintiffs did not move to amend the\n\ncomplaint until January 28, 1999, 30 days after the denial of class\n\ncertification, the action is only timely if the case accrued fewer\n\nthan five months before the filing of the original class action\n\ncomplaint on August 27, 1997.   The prospective plaintiffs assert\n\nthat the accrual date was no earlier than April 1, 1997, rendering\n\nthe action timely.\n\n\n\n\ntiptoe through empty formalities to reach foreordained results.\"\nGold, 30 F.3d at 254 (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Also, and in any event, the district court did not err\nin assessing the motion under the summary judgment standard. The\nprospective plaintiffs were on notice of the possible conversion\nwhen defendants presented evidentiary materials with their briefs,\nand the prospective plaintiffs effectively invited the conversion\nwhen they responded in kind, and without objection to defendants'\nsubmissions. See, e.g., Gulf Coast Bank & Trust Co. v. Reder, 355\nF.3d 35, 38-39 (1st Cir. 2004); Boateng v. Interamerican\nUniversity, Inc., 210 F.3d 56, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2000); Collier v.\nCity of Chicopee, 158 F.3d 601, 602-604 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                -8-\n\f            The district court correctly concluded that the action\n\naccrued in early March of 1997.           The prospective plaintiffs knew,\n\nor had reason to know, of the claimed wrong no later than March 7,\n\n1997,   when   they      received   their     final   paychecks    and   had   the\n\nopportunity to review the letter agreement detailing which workers\n\nwere released and which were retained.            The prospective plaintiffs\n\nobviously knew that they had been terminated, each knew his or her\n\nindividual seniority status, and would have realized that less-\n\nsenior employees were retained upon reviewing the letter agreement.\n\nTherefore, the putative amended complaint would have been untimely.\n\n            The    prospective      plaintiffs'       contrary    arguments    are\n\nunpersuasive. With respect to the operative seniority provision in\n\nthe   CBA   that   the    prospective    plaintiffs      allege   they   did   not\n\nactually    receive      until   four   months    after    the    lay-offs,    the\n\nprospective plaintiffs have not contested defendants' assertions\n\nthat the provision had been the same for many years and that the\n\nworkers were aware of it.           The April 17 stipulation is similarly\n\nunhelpful to the prospective plaintiffs, as it deals with the\n\n\"effects\" of the closing and specifically acknowledges that most of\n\nthe workforce was laid off on March 1, 1997.              At bottom, the April\n\n1, 1997 layoff date alleged in the complaint is a bare allegation\n\nwith no evidentiary support.4           See Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town\n\n\n4\n  Indeed, the prospective plaintiffs' actual allegation, as quoted\nin their brief, states that the discharges took place from \"on or\nabout February 28th, 1997 to April 1st, 1997.\" This allegation\n\n                                        -9-\n\fof Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1995)(\"[W]e need not credit\n\npurely conclusory allegations, indulge rank speculation, or draw\n\nimprobable inferences.\").\n\n            We turn now to the dismissed plaintiffs' argument that\n\nthe district court erred in denying their motion for additional\n\ndiscovery. The dismissed plaintiffs complain that they were misled\n\nby the court's statement that it would take \"under advisement\" the\n\nquestion of whether defendants' motions for summary judgment should\n\nbe stayed until discovery was completed.                  The dismissed plaintiffs\n\nalso assert that no formal affidavit was required because they\n\nsubstantially complied with Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), and that Rule\n\n56(f)   only    fully   comes   into   play        when    an   adequate   time   for\n\ndiscovery      has   passed.    Central       to    the     dismissed   plaintiffs'\n\nargument on this point is their fundamental assertion that deposing\n\nthe defendants' affiants was essential to determine the zealousness\n\nof the Union's bargaining tactics.\n\n            We review a district court's denial of a Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(f) motion for abuse of discretion.               See Resolution Trust Corp.\n\nv. North Bridge Assocs., Inc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nWhile we do not require slavish adherence to Rule 56(f)'s formal\n\nrequirements, when additional discovery is sought, such a motion\n\nmust (1) be presented in a timely manner; (2) show good cause for\n\n\n\nitself implies that some, if not most, of the new claims would be\nuntimely.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fthe failure to discover the necessary facts sooner; (3) set forth\n\na plausible basis for believing that the necessary facts probably\n\nexist and can be learned in a reasonable time; and (4) establish\n\nthat the sought facts, if found, will \"influence the outcome of the\n\npending motion for summary judgment.\"               Id.; see also Velez v.\n\nAwning   Windows,     Inc.,    375     F.3d   35,   39-40    (1st   Cir.   2004)\n\n(functionally equivalent statement may substitute for the affidavit\n\nrequired by Rule 56(f)).\n\n            There   is    a   fatal    disconnect    between    the   dismissed\n\nplaintiffs' arguments and the district court's summary judgment\n\ndecision.   The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendants on the ground that the dismissed plaintiffs' seniority\n\nrights   were   not      violated     in   the   shutdown.      The   dismissed\n\nplaintiffs' contentions thus fail to address, let alone cast doubt\n\nupon, the court's rationale on the dispositive issue, see In re\n\nMiles, 436 F.3d 291, 294 (1st Cir. 2006), and disregard Rule\n\n56(f)'s requirement that the requested discovery be capable of\n\ninfluencing the outcome of the motion for summary judgment, see\n\nVelez, 375 F.3d at 40; Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc., 368\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2004)(the sought \"facts, if obtained, would\n\nhelp defeat pending motion\").\n\n            Moreover, the dismissed plaintiffs failed to file their\n\nmotion for additional discovery until fifteen months after the\n\nmotions for summary judgment were filed.            This was far too long a\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fdelay.    See Guzman-Ruiz v. Hernandez-Colon, 406 F.3d 31, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (three-month delay excessive); Vargas-Ruiz, 368 F.3d at\n\n4 (Rule 56(f) motion should be filed \"promptly upon service of\n\ndefendant's dispositive motion\").           That the district court took\n\n\"under advisement\" the request to stay the summary judgment motions\n\nuntil     completion      of   the    then-outstanding    discovery   --\n\ninterrogatories that defendants were directed to answer by June 4,\n\n1999 -- cannot reasonably be interpreted to give the dismissed\n\nplaintiffs carte blanche to ignore pending dispositive motions and\n\ndiscovery deadlines and then propound new discovery requests over\n\na year later.\n\n            It is regrettable that this case languished for years in\n\nthe district court.    But in the end, the judge to whom the case was\n\nlater assigned acted within her discretion in denying the motions\n\nto amend the complaint and for additional discovery.        Accordingly,\n\nwe affirm the judgments entered on behalf of the defendants in this\n\nmatter.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

This issue turns on whether the prospective plaintiffs had timely claims (putting aside the tolling that occurred while the class action issue was pending). This question, in turn, turns on when the cause of action accrued. The district court found, considering the evidence, that the accrual date was in early March of 1997. The court held that the motion to amend would be futile for 94 of the 96 prospective plaintiffs, since their claims were time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the prospective plaintiffs argue that the accrual date was later than that found by the district court. Pointing out that motions to amend are to be \"freely granted,\" the prospective plaintiffs contend that their motion should have been assessed under the liberal Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) standard based entirely on the \"four corners\" of the tendered complaint, and that the district court erred in considering outside evidentiary materials without notice that it was going to do so. Building on this position, the prospective plaintiffs further contend that the court was bound by their allegation that the layoffs did not take place until April 1, 1997. Alternatively, the prospective plaintiffs posit that they did not know of their injury until they learned that defendants had actually violated the CBA's seniority provisions, and the evidence suggests that did not occur until the prospective plaintiffs eventually received a copy of the operative CBA in July 1997, or, at the earliest, the date of the stipulation (April 17, 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review denials of motions to amend pleadings for abuse of discretion. <i>See Interstate Litho Corp. v. Brown,</i> 255 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.2001); <i>see also Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds to Go, Inc.,</i> 370 F.3d 151, 158 (1st Cir.2004) (\"An error of law is, of course, always an abuse of discretion.\"). Consent to file amended pleadings \"shall be freely given when justice so requires,\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), unless the amendment would be futile or reward undue delay, <i>see Steir v. Girl Scouts of the USA,</i> 383 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gold,</i> 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir.1994). In assessing futility, the district court must apply the standard which applies to motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>See Glassman v. Computervision Corp.,</i> 90 F.3d 617, 623 (1st Cir.1996). The bar for a plaintiff tendering an amended complaint is higher after a motion for summary judgment has been filed, as the plaintiff must demonstrate \"that the proposed amendments were supported by substantial and convincing evidence.\" <i>Gold,</i> 30 F.3d at 253 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Girl Scouts,</i> 383 F.3d at 12.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin on common ground. Both sides agree that a six-month statute of limitations applies to \"hybrid\" actions, and that the clock started ticking when the prospective plaintiffs knew, or reasonably should have known, of the alleged wrongful acts. <i>See Arriaga-Zayas v. Int'l Ladies' Garment Workers' Union,</i> 835 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1987). The parties also agree, and we accept arguendo, that the running of the statute was tolled during the pendency of the motion for class certification. <i>See generally Basch v. Ground Round, Inc.,</i> 139 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1998). Because the prospective plaintiffs did not move to amend the complaint until January 28, 1999, 30 days after the denial of class certification, the action is only timely if the case accrued fewer than five months before the filing of the original class action complaint on August 27, 1997. The prospective plaintiffs assert that the accrual date was no earlier than April 1, 1997, rendering the action timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly concluded that the action accrued in early March of 1997. The prospective plaintiffs knew, or had reason to know, of the claimed wrong no later than March 7, 1997, when they received their final paychecks and had the opportunity to review the letter agreement detailing which workers were released and which were retained. The prospective plaintiffs obviously knew that they had been terminated, each knew his or her individual seniority status, and would have realized that less-senior employees were retained upon reviewing the letter agreement. Therefore, the putative amended complaint would have been untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prospective plaintiffs' contrary arguments are unpersuasive. With respect to the operative seniority provision in the CBA that the prospective plaintiffs allege they did not actually receive until four months after the lay-offs, the prospective plaintiffs have not contested defendants' assertions that the provision had been the same for many years and that the workers were aware of it. The April 17 stipulation is similarly unhelpful to the prospective plaintiffs, as it deals with the \"effects\" of the closing and specifically acknowledges that most of the workforce was laid off on March 1, 1997. At bottom, the April 1, 1997 layoff date alleged in the complaint is a bare allegation with no evidentiary support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,</i> 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[W]e need not credit purely conclusory allegations, indulge rank speculation, or draw improbable inferences.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the dismissed plaintiffs' argument that the district court erred in denying their motion for additional discovery. The dismissed plaintiffs complain that they were misled by the court's statement that it would take \"under advisement\" the question of whether defendants' motions for summary judgment should be stayed until discovery was completed. The dismissed plaintiffs also assert that no formal affidavit was required because they substantially complied with Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), and that Rule 56(f) only fully comes into play when an adequate time for discovery has passed. Central to the dismissed plaintiffs' argument on this point is their fundamental assertion that deposing the defendants' affiants was essential to determine the zealousness of the Union's bargaining tactics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) motion for abuse of discretion. <i>See Resolution Trust Corp. v. North Bridge Assocs., Inc.,</i> 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir.1994). While we do not require slavish adherence to Rule 56(f)'s formal requirements, when additional discovery is sought, such a motion must (1) be presented in a timely manner; (2) show good cause for the failure to discover the necessary facts sooner; (3) set forth a plausible basis for believing that the necessary facts probably exist and can be learned in a reasonable time; and (4) establish that the sought facts, if found, will \"influence the outcome of the pending motion for summary judgment.\" <i>Id.; see also Velez v. Awning Windows, Inc.,</i> 375 F.3d 35, 39-40 (1st Cir.2004) (functionally equivalent statement may substitute for the affidavit required by Rule 56(f)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a fatal disconnect between the dismissed plaintiffs' arguments and the district court's summary judgment decision. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the ground that the dismissed plaintiffs' seniority rights were not violated in the shutdown. The dismissed plaintiffs' contentions thus fail to address, let alone cast doubt upon, the court's rationale on the dispositive issue, <i>see In re Miles,</i> 436 F.3d 291, 294 (1st Cir.2006), and disregard Rule 56(f)'s requirement that the requested discovery be capable of influencing the outcome of the motion for summary judgment, <i>see Velez,</i> 375 F.3d at 40; <i>Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc.,</i> 368 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2004) (the sought \"facts, if obtained, would help defeat pending motion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the dismissed plaintiffs failed to file their motion for additional discovery until fifteen months after the motions for summary judgment were filed. This was far too long a delay. <i>See Guzman-Ruiz v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> 406 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.2005) (three-month delay excessive); <i>Vargas-Ruiz,</i> 368 F.3d at 4 (Rule 56(f) motion should be filed \"promptly upon service of defendant's dispositive motion\"). That the district court took \"under advisement\" the request to stay the summary judgment motions until completion of the then-outstanding discovery&#8212; interrogatories that defendants were directed to answer by June 4, 1999&#8212;cannot reasonably be interpreted to give the dismissed plaintiffs carte blanche to ignore pending dispositive motions and discovery deadlines and then propound new discovery requests over a year later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is regrettable that this case languished for years in the district court. But in the end, the judge to whom the case was later assigned acted within her discretion in denying the motions to amend the complaint and for additional discovery. Accordingly, we <i>affirm</i> the judgments entered on behalf of the defendants in this matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the notice of appeal was apparently filed on behalf of all plaintiffs who brought this action, four of the eight settled their cases and dismissed their claims and are therefore not parties to this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also make passing suggestions that the court erred in granting defendants' summary judgment motions but have failed to develop any such argument sufficiently to put the correctness of the summary judgment rulings in dispute (other than as premised on the denials of the motions to amend and for additional discovery)<i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The prospective plaintiffs' motion to amend was actually filed one day before the defendants' motions for summary judgment, which were filed on the deadline for dispositive motions established by the court. However, all the motions were entered on the electronic docket the same day, and the district court considered them together. At bottom, the motion to amend was tendered at the \"eleventh hour to fend off summary judgment,\" and a court \"need not tiptoe through empty formalities to reach foreordained results.\"<i>Gold,</i> 30 F.3d at 254 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Also, and in any event, the district court did not err in assessing the motion under the summary judgment standard. The prospective plaintiffs were on notice of the possible conversion when defendants presented evidentiary materials with their briefs, and the prospective plaintiffs effectively invited the conversion when they responded in kind, and without objection to defendants' submissions. <i>See, e.g., Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Reder,</i> 355 F.3d 35, 38-39 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Boateng v. InterAmerican University, Inc.,</i> 210 F.3d 56, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2000); <i>Collier v.

Alternatively, the prospective plaintiffs posit that they did not know of their injury until they learned that defendants had actually violated the CBA's seniority provisions, and the evidence suggests that did not occur until the prospective plaintiffs eventually received a copy of the operative CBA in July 1997, or, at the earliest, the date of the stipulation (April 17, 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review denials of motions to amend pleadings for abuse of discretion. <i>See Interstate Litho Corp. v.

In assessing futility, the district court must apply the standard which applies to motions to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>See Glassman v. Computervision Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196899\"><a href=\"/opinion/196899/glassman-v-computervision/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 623 (1st Cir.1996). The bar for a plaintiff tendering an amended complaint is higher after a motion for summary judgment has been filed, as the plaintiff must demonstrate \"that the proposed amendments were supported by substantial and convincing evidence.\" <i>Gold,</i> 30 F.3d at 253 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also Girl Scouts,</i> 383 F.3d at 12.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin on common ground. Both sides agree that a six-month statute of limitations applies to \"hybrid\" actions, and that the clock started ticking when the prospective plaintiffs knew, or reasonably should have known, of the alleged wrongful acts. <i>See Arriaga-Zayas v. Int'l Ladies' Garment Workers' Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498436\"><a href=\"/opinion/498436/norma-arriaga-zayas-v-international-ladies-garment-workers-union-puerto/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.1987). The parties also agree, and we accept arguendo, that the running of the statute was tolled during the pendency of the motion for class certification. <i>See generally Basch v. Ground Round, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197850\"><a href=\"/opinion/197850/basch-v-ground-round-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1998). Because the prospective plaintiffs did not move to amend the complaint until January 28, 1999, 30 days after the denial of class certification, the action is only timely if the case accrued fewer than five months before the filing of the original class action complaint on August 27, 1997. The prospective plaintiffs assert that the accrual date was no earlier than April 1, 1997, rendering the action timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly concluded that the action accrued in early March of 1997. The prospective plaintiffs knew, or had reason to know, of the claimed wrong no later than March 7, 1997, when they received their final paychecks and had the opportunity to review the letter agreement detailing which workers were released and which were retained. The prospective plaintiffs obviously knew that they had been terminated, each knew his or her individual seniority status, and would have realized that less-senior employees were retained upon reviewing the letter agreement. Therefore, the putative amended complaint would have been untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prospective plaintiffs' contrary arguments are unpersuasive. With respect to the operative seniority provision in the CBA that the prospective plaintiffs allege they did not actually receive until four months after the lay-offs, the prospective plaintiffs have not contested defendants' assertions that the provision had been the same for many years and that the workers were aware of it. The April 17 stipulation is similarly unhelpful to the prospective plaintiffs, as it deals with the \"effects\" of the closing and specifically acknowledges that most of the workforce was laid off on March 1, 1997. At bottom, the April 1, 1997 layoff date alleged in the complaint is a bare allegation with no evidentiary support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195818\"><a href=\"/opinion/195818/national-amusements-v-town-of-dedham/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 735 (1st Cir.1995) (\"[W]e need not credit purely conclusory allegations, indulge rank speculation, or draw improbable inferences.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the dismissed plaintiffs' argument that the district court erred in denying their motion for additional discovery. The dismissed plaintiffs complain that they were misled by the court's statement that it would take \"under advisement\" the question of whether defendants' motions for summary judgment should be stayed until discovery was completed. The dismissed plaintiffs also assert that no formal affidavit was required because they substantially complied with Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), and that Rule 56(f) only fully comes into play when an adequate time for discovery has passed. Central to the dismissed plaintiffs' argument on this point is their fundamental assertion that deposing the defendants' affiants was essential to determine the zealousness of the Union's bargaining tactics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) motion for abuse of discretion. <i>See Resolution Trust Corp. v. North Bridge Assocs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669068\"><a href=\"/opinion/669068/resolution-trust-corporation-v-north-bridge-associates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span>, 1203 (1st Cir.1994). While we do not require slavish adherence to Rule 56(f)'s formal requirements, when additional discovery is sought, such a motion must (1) be presented in a timely manner; (2) show good cause for the failure to discover the necessary facts sooner; (3) set forth a plausible basis for believing that the necessary facts probably exist and can be learned in a reasonable time; and (4) establish that the sought facts, if found, will \"influence the outcome of the pending motion for summary judgment.\" <i>Id.; see also Velez v. Awning Windows, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201113\"><a href=\"/opinion/201113/velez-cortes-v-awning-windows-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 39-40 (1st Cir.2004) (functionally equivalent statement may substitute for the affidavit required by Rule 56(f)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a fatal disconnect between the dismissed plaintiffs' arguments and the district court's summary judgment decision. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on the ground that the dismissed plaintiffs' seniority rights were not violated in the shutdown. The dismissed plaintiffs' contentions thus fail to address, let alone cast doubt upon, the court's rationale on the dispositive issue, <i>see In re Miles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202049\"><a href=\"/opinion/202049/miles-v-beneficial/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 294 (1st Cir.2006), and disregard Rule 56(f)'s requirement that the requested discovery be capable of influencing the outcome of the motion for summary judgment, <i>see Velez,</i> 375 F.3d at 40; <i>Vargas-Ruiz v. Golden Arch Dev., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201001\"><a href=\"/opinion/201001/vargas-ruiz-v-golden-arch/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2004) (the sought \"facts, if obtained, would help defeat pending motion\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the dismissed plaintiffs failed to file their motion for additional discovery until fifteen months after the motions for summary judgment were filed. This was far too long a delay. <i>See Guzman-Ruiz v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201558\"><a href=\"/opinion/201558/guzman-ruiz-v-hernandez-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2005) (three-month delay excessive); <i>Vargas-Ruiz,</i> 368 F.3d at 4 (Rule 56(f) motion should be filed \"promptly upon service of defendant's dispositive motion\"). That the district court took \"under advisement\" the request to stay the summary judgment motions until completion of the then-outstanding discovery&#8212; interrogatories that defendants were directed to answer by June 4, 1999&#8212;cannot reasonably be interpreted to give the dismissed plaintiffs carte blanche to ignore pending dispositive motions and discovery deadlines and then propound new discovery requests over a year later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is regrettable that this case languished for years in the district court. But in the end, the judge to whom the case was later assigned acted within her discretion in denying the motions to amend the complaint and for additional discovery. Accordingly, we <i>affirm</i> the judgments entered on behalf of the defendants in this matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the notice of appeal was apparently filed on behalf of all plaintiffs who brought this action, four of the eight settled their cases and dismissed their claims and are therefore not parties to this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs also make passing suggestions that the court erred in granting defendants' summary judgment motions but have failed to develop any such argument sufficiently to put the correctness of the summary judgment rulings in dispute (other than as premised on the denials of the motions to amend and for additional discovery)<i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The prospective plaintiffs' motion to amend was actually filed one day before the defendants' motions for summary judgment, which were filed on the deadline for dispositive motions established by the court. However, all the motions were entered on the electronic docket the same day, and the district court considered them together. At bottom, the motion to amend was tendered at the \"eleventh hour to fend off summary judgment,\" and a court \"need not tiptoe through empty formalities to reach foreordained results.\"<i>Gold,</i> 30 F.3d at 254 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Also, and in any event, the district court did not err in assessing the motion under the summary judgment standard. The prospective plaintiffs were on notice of the possible conversion when defendants presented evidentiary materials with their briefs, and the prospective plaintiffs effectively invited the conversion when they responded in kind, and without objection to defendants' submissions. <i>See, e.g., Gulf Coast Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.
