Petitioner Paulo Rocha Pereira Da\n\nSilva, a Brazilian national, seeks review of a final order of the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) rejecting his request for\n\nwithholding of removal. Discerning no error, we deny the petition.\n\n                                      I.\n\n                                 Background\n\n            In   November   of   1997,      the   petitioner,   previously   a\n\ndomiciliary of Campos, Brazil, entered the United States on a six-\n\nmonth tourist visa.     He took up residence in the Boston area and\n\noverstayed his visa.        A year later, he was joined by his wife,\n\nRegina Celia Gomes De Lima Silva, and his minor daughter, Paola\n\nLima Rocha Pereira.    They also arrived as tourists and stayed past\n\ntheir respective visa expiration dates.\n\n            In September of 2000, the petitioner requested asylum on\n\nbehalf of himself, his wife, and his daughter. The Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS) responded by serving a notice to\n\nappear.1    That notice directed the trio to answer charges that\n\ntheir    continued   presence    in   the    United   States    violated   the\n\nprovisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).               See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).      At a hearing before an immigration judge\n\n(IJ), the family members admitted through an attorney that they had\n\n\n     1\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, § 471,\n116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)),\nabolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of\nHomeland Security. See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 13 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2004).\n\n                                      -2-\n\foverstayed,         acknowledged      removability,          conceded     that    the\n\napplication for asylum was time-barred, and sought withholding of\n\nremoval on the ground that the petitioner had a well-founded fear\n\nof   future       persecution    in   his     native    Brazil     because   of   his\n\nmembership in a particular social group, that is, his status as a\n\n\"member of society [who] refused to perform illegal tasks simply\n\nbecause of pressure from his immediate supervisors at work.\"\n\n                 In support of his application for withholding of removal,\n\nthe petitioner testified that he had been employed as a part-time\n\naccountant for a government-funded drug rehabilitation center in\n\nCampos. While carrying out his bookkeeping duties, he learned that\n\nthe chief executive officer of the center, Fred Luis Mauricio, was\n\nembezzling         funds.       The   petitioner       aided      and   abetted   the\n\nembezzlement by creating phony invoices to account for the missing\n\nmoney. When at long last the Brazilian federal government launched\n\nan inquiry into the center's operations, Mauricio threatened to\n\nkill       the   petitioner   and     his    family    if    he   spoke   about   the\n\ncorruption.\n\n                 Despite the threat, the petitioner gave a statement\n\nimplicating Mauricio to the investigators.                  Subsequently, his wife\n\nwas threatened and his apartment ransacked.                       He reported these\n\nincidents to the local office of the military police,2 who declined\n\n\n       2\n      According to the United States Department of State Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices — Brazil (2001), entered into the\nadministrative record, Brazil's police forces consist of a small,\n\n                                            -3-\n\fto afford him special protection because he did not know whether\n\nMauricio was responsible for what had transpired.          The petitioner\n\ntook this refusal as a sign that Mauricio and the local police were\n\nconspiring   against   him   and   that   further   requests   for   police\n\nassistance would be an exercise in futility.\n\n           Concerned about his safety and that of his family, the\n\npetitioner borrowed money from relatives and fled to the United\n\nStates.   His wife and daughter stayed in Brazil, but moved to his\n\nbrother's house ninety miles from Campos.           A year passed without\n\nany untoward incidents.      At that point, the petitioner's wife and\n\ndaughter joined him in the United States.\n\n          After listening to the petitioner's tale, the IJ found\n\ncredible those portions of his testimony that recounted facts\n\nwithin his personal knowledge, e.g., that his work situation was\n\ncorrupt; that he had initially participated in the corruption but\n\nlater cooperated with the authorities to root it out; that by\n\nproviding information to the federal police, he had acted as a\n\nwhistleblower,   albeit      one   with   \"lesser    status\"   since    his\n\nwhistleblowing began only when it became apparent that he could be\n\nprosecuted for his complicity in the ongoing embezzlement; and that\n\nMauricio had threatened him.       The IJ explicitly declined to make a\n\n\n\n\nprimarily investigative federal force and several state police\nforces (the uniformed members of which are colloquially known as\n\"military police\").\n\n                                    -4-\n\ffinding that   Mauricio     was   responsible    for    the   threat   to   the\n\npetitioner's wife or for the break-in at the petitioner's home.\n\n          Despite     her   acceptance    of   much    of   the   petitioner's\n\ntestimony, the IJ refused to embrace many of the conclusions that\n\nthe petitioner sought to draw from the underlying facts, calling\n\nthem \"mere speculation.\"      Specifically, she refused to credit the\n\npetitioner's self-serving accusation that the local police were in\n\nleague with Mauricio, observing that no hard evidence of such a tie\n\nhad been proffered.    She also noted that the petitioner had made no\n\neffort to enlist the help of any police department outside of the\n\nlocal area in which Mauricio might have had political influence,\n\nthus further weakening his broad-brush claim of police bias.                She\n\nthen rejected as a matter of law the petitioner's contention that\n\nhis whistleblower status made him a member of a targeted social\n\ngroup within the purview of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). Finally, she\n\ndenied his prayer for withholding of removal.3\n\n          The petitioner appealed.             The BIA adopted the IJ's\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, adding an independent\n\nfinding that the feared harm related to what was \"essentially a\n\n\n\n     3\n      The IJ also held that the petitioner had not established a\nbasis for relief under Article III of the Convention Against\nTorture. Inasmuch as the petitioner did not include this claim in\nhis appeal to the BIA, he has effectively abandoned it.        See\nMakhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004) (stating that\n\"theories not advanced before the BIA may not be surfaced for the\nfirst time in a petition for judicial review of the BIA's final\norder\").\n\n                                    -5-\n\fpersonal dispute\" between Mauricio and the petitioner.            For that\n\nreason, any threats that had been made against the petitioner and\n\nhis family were insufficient to establish a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n             After the BIA affirmed the IJ's order, this petition for\n\njudicial review eventuated.4       See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1), (b).\n\n                                    II.\n\n                                  Analysis\n\n            Under the INA, an otherwise deportable alien may avoid\n\nremoval if the Attorney General determines that \"the alien's life\n\nor freedom would be threatened in [the destination] country because\n\nof   the   alien's    race,   religion,    nationality,   membership    in   a\n\nparticular     social    group,    or     political   opinion.\"        Id.   §\n\n1231(b)(3)(A).       The applicant must carry the devoir of persuasion\n\nto show either that (i) he has suffered past persecution on account\n\nof one of these five protected grounds (thus creating a rebuttable\n\npresumption that he may suffer future persecution), or (ii) it is\n\nmore likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of a\n\nprotected ground upon his return to his native land.5         See 8 C.F.R.\n\n\n      4\n      The petitioner's wife and minor daughter appear as co-\npetitioners. Since their claims are purely derivative, we do not\ndwell on them. It suffices to say that our denial of the head of\nthe household's claim, see text infra, necessitates the denial of\ntheir derivative claims as well.\n      5\n      The threshold of eligibility for withholding of removal is\nhigher than the threshold of eligibility for asylum. Mekhoukh v.\nAshcroft, 358 F.3d 118, 130 (1st Cir. 2004); Ipina v. INS, 868 F.2d\n\n                                    -6-\n\f§ 208.16(b); see also INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 429-30 (1984).\n\nA showing of a well-founded fear of future persecution involves\n\nboth objective and subjective elements.           See Laurent v. Ashcroft,\n\n359 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 2004).        To perfect that showing, an alien\n\nmust establish not only that he harbors a subjectively genuine fear\n\nof future persecution but also that an objectively reasonable basis\n\nfor that fear exists.        Id.\n\n            The     Attorney   General's      authority      to       make    these\n\ndeterminations has been delegated to the BIA.                See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1003.1(a)(1).      We review the BIA's findings of fact, including its\n\ncredibility determinations, pursuant to the substantial evidence\n\nstandard.    Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 2002).                Under\n\nthat regime, a reviewing court will accept the BIA's findings as\n\nlong   as   they   are    \"supported   by    reasonable,    substantial,        and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"                     INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).              This means, in effect,\n\nthat we will set aside the BIA's findings only if, and to the\n\nextent   that,     \"the   record   evidence    would    compel    a    reasonable\n\nfactfinder to make a contrary determination.\"               Aguilar-Solis v.\n\nINS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999).          A recent amendment to the\n\nINA has codified this deferential standard.                  See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n\n511, 515 (1st Cir. 1989). In this instance, the IJ ruled that the\npetitioner's application for asylum was time-barred, and the\npetitioner has not challenged that ruling. Thus, the petitioner\nmust satisfy the higher eligibility standard for withholding of\nremoval.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f1252(b)(4)(B) (ordaining that the BIA's findings of fact shall be\n\nupheld \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to\n\nconclude to the contrary\").\n\n               Rulings of law command our attention under a somewhat\n\ndifferent framework.         We afford de novo review to the BIA's legal\n\nconclusions, but cede some deference to its interpretations of the\n\nINA.       See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 425 (1999); Lattab\n\nv. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir. 2004); see also Chevron\n\nU.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-\n\n43 (1984).\n\n               In this case, the petitioner focuses on the fourth of the\n\nfive protected grounds:        membership in a particular social group.\n\nHe variously defines that social group as comprising those who\n\n\"refused      to   perform   illegal   tasks   because   of   pressure\"   from\n\nworkplace supervisors or \"trapped\" employees forced to acquiesce to\n\nthe demands of corrupt employers.6           To make matters more nebulous,\n\nthe IJ synthesized his argument as being that the particular social\n\ngroup consisted of \"whistleblowers,\" and the petitioner has not\n\n\n\n       6\n      We flatly reject the petitioner's belated suggestion that his\nsocial group consists of either public employees or business\nprofessionals. No such argument was made to the BIA, and it is too\nlate to make new arguments here. See Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 376 F.3d\n75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004); Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 761 (1st\nCir. 1992). In all events, by the petitioner's own account, the\nthreats supposedly directed against him and his family emanated\nsolely from his participation in the government investigation into\nalleged corruption and only peripherally involved his particular\noccupation and place of business.\n\n                                       -8-\n\fdisavowed that nomenclature.          The petitioner urges that the BIA\n\nerred in concluding that he failed to prove a cognizable threat of\n\nfuture persecution on account of that membership, however defined.\n\nHis argument is unpersuasive.\n\n             In determining what constitutes persecution on account of\n\nmembership in a particular social group, the key is whether the\n\nclaimed persecution is aimed at an individual because of his or her\n\naffiliation with a group of persons, all of whom share a common,\n\nimmutable characteristic.         See Gebremichael v. INS, 10 F.3d 28, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 1993); Ananeh-Firempong v. INS, 766 F.2d 621, 626 (1st\n\nCir. 1985); see also In re Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA\n\n1985), overruled in part by In re Mogharrabi, 19 I. & N. Dec. 439\n\n(BIA 1987). Because the most obvious groups meeting these criteria\n\n— such as racial or ethnic groups — are independently covered under\n\nthe withholding of removal statute, stand-alone social group claims\n\nare rather rare.     See Gebremichael, 10 F.3d at 35 n.20.          When such\n\nclaims are proffered, they usually are based on discrete classes\n\nsuch as gender, e.g., Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.\n\n1993), kinship units such as clans, e.g., In re H-, 21 I. & N. Dec.\n\n337,   337   (BIA   1996),   or    individual   family   membership,    e.g.,\n\nGebremichael, 10 F.3d at 36.\n\n             To be sure, the common characteristic also may reflect a\n\nshared experience,      such   as    past   membership   in   a   military   or\n\nparamilitary force.     See, e.g., Mediouni, 314 F.3d at 28.          Whether\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fthe common characteristic is innate or experiential, \"it must be\n\none that the members of the group either cannot change, or should\n\nnot be required to change because it is fundamental to their\n\nindividual identities or consciences.\"             Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. at\n\n233.\n\n             At first blush, none of the labels used by the petitioner\n\nor    the   IJ    seems   to   fit   comfortably    with   the   concept   of   a\n\n\"recognizable and discrete\" social group. Gebremichael, 10 F.3d at\n\n36.    One telltale is the difficulty that the petitioner has in\n\ndelineating his particular social group; he defines it in various\n\nways at various times, without much in the way of precise line-\n\ndrawing.         Yet, notwithstanding this imprecision, we are keenly\n\naware that refugees' situations vary widely.               Thus, we have been\n\nreluctant to exclude characteristics categorically from the \"social\n\ngroup\" definition.        Cf. Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 396 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (cautioning that the term \"particular social group,\" as\n\nused in the INA, is not \"free from ambiguity\").                  The taxonomic\n\nproblem is exacerbated here because whistleblowers generally have\n\nbeen recognized as political, rather than social, refugees, see,\n\ne.g., Reyes-Guerrero v. INS, 192 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir. 1999);\n\nMarquez v. INS, 105 F.3d 374, 381 (7th Cir. 1997), yet the\n\npetitioner explicitly relinquished this ground before the IJ and\n\ndoes not attempt to resurrect it here.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f           Even so, characteristics relating to current or former\n\nemployment status can, at least theoretically, form the linchpin\n\nfor assembling a protected social group.            See, e.g., Meguenine v.\n\nINS, 139 F.3d 25, 27 n.2 (1st Cir. 1998) (stating that a health\n\ncare worker who refuses to violate her profession's code of ethics\n\nmight have a \"trait which a member of that group should not, in\n\ngood conscience, be required to change\"); see also Alvarez-Flores\n\nv. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding \"strained,\" but\n\naccepting arguendo, a petitioner's contention that he was a member\n\nof a social group of cheesemakers subject to persecution for having\n\nsupplied    food     to   guerilla       groups).      The   petitioner     here\n\nalternatively       self-identifies        as   a   \"trapped\"      or    harried\n\ngovernmental employee, and at least one court has been willing to\n\nrecognize a social group of \"former government employees who\n\nrefused to    comply      with   their    employer's   demands.\"        Marku v.\n\nAshcroft, 380 F.3d 982, 987 n.8 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n           In the last analysis, we find it unnecessary to decide\n\nwhether    former    employees     or     whistleblowers     can   comprise    a\n\ncognizable social group.         Assuming, for argument's sake, that the\n\n\"social group\" requirement has been met, the petitioner nonetheless\n\nhas failed to show persecution based on his claimed membership in\n\nsuch a group:      the evidence in this case does not compel a finding,\n\nmore likely than not, that he was persecuted on account of his\n\nstatus as a member of that group.          That defect is, in itself, fatal\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fto his claim for withholding of removal.                See Aguilar-Solis, 168\n\nF.3d at 570 (explaining that there must be a nexus between the\n\nalleged acts of persecution and the statutorily protected ground);\n\nsee also 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b).          We explain briefly.\n\n            The BIA found that the petitioner did not forge the\n\nnecessary   connection    between       the    claimed    persecution   and    the\n\nclaimed social group membership.              The record amply supports this\n\nfinding. The most obvious justification is the BIA's determination\n\nthat the petitioner and Mauricio had became ensnared in what was\n\n\"essentially a personal dispute.\"             This determination represents a\n\nfair inference from the record and, therefore, is supported by\n\nsubstantial   evidence.     See     8    U.S.C.     §    1252(b)(4)(B).       That\n\ndetermination   contradicts    any       claim     that   the   petitioner    was\n\npersecuted on account of his membership in any particular social\n\ngroup.   See Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"The INA is not intended to protect aliens from violence based on\n\npersonal animosity.\"); Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572 (similar);\n\nsee also Mogharrabi, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 447.\n\n            The finding of a lack of connection between the claimed\n\npersecution and the claimed social group membership is sustainable\n\non another ground as well.          In the prototypical case, a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution arises when an alien faces the prospect\n\nof severe mistreatment at the hands of his own government should he\n\nbe returned to his native land.          See Ananeh-Firempong, 766 F.2d at\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f622-23. Action by non-governmental actors can undergird a claim of\n\npersecution        only    if     there    is    some   showing     that    the       alleged\n\npersecutors        are     in     league   with     the    government       or    are      not\n\ncontrollable by the government.                   See Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at\n\n573; see also de la Llana-Castellon v. United States, 16 F.3d 1093,\n\n1097 (9th      Cir.       1994)    (explaining      that     installation        of    a   new\n\nNicaraguan government did not necessarily quell petitioner's fears\n\nof persecution at the hands of the Sandinistas).\n\n              By like token, an alien who asserts a fear of future\n\npersecution by local functionaries ordinarily must show that those\n\nfunctionaries have more than a localized reach.                            The rationale\n\nbehind this requirement is that if a potentially troublesome state\n\nof   affairs       is     sufficiently          localized,    an    alien       can     avoid\n\npersecution by the simple expedient of relocating within his own\n\ncountry instead of fleeing to foreign soil.                           See Lukwago v.\n\nAshcroft, 329 F.3d 157, 181 (3d Cir. 2003); Singh v. Moschorak, 53\n\nF.3d 1031, 1034 (9th Cir. 1995) (collecting cases); In re C-A-L-,\n\n21   I.   &   N.    Dec.    754,     757   (BIA     1997);    see   also    8     C.F.R.     §\n\n208.16(b)(2) (stating that an alien seeking withholding of removal\n\ncannot show that it is more likely than not that he will suffer\n\nfuture persecution if he \"could avoid a future threat to his or her\n\nlife or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed\n\ncountry of removal and, under all the circumstances, it would be\n\nreasonable to expect the applicant to do so\").\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\f          Viewed in this light, the BIA had adequate justification,\n\nbased on the record, for finding no cognizable persecution.    The\n\npetitioner did not present a shred of evidence that Mauricio posed\n\nany danger beyond the municipal boundaries of Campos.    Moreover,\n\nthe fact that the petitioner's wife and daughter lived in Brazil\n\nwithout incident during the year that they spent at a relative's\n\nhouse outside the city limits speaks volumes about the localized\n\nnature of any such peril.\n\n          To cinch matters, the record contains no evidence that\n\nthe federal government lacked either the will or the wherewithal to\n\ndiscipline Mauricio and those loyal to him.   Indeed, the very fact\n\nthat federal investigators shut down Mauricio's corrupt boondoggle\n\nundercuts the petitioner's wholly conclusory claim that his boss\n\nenjoyed special protection outside the local purlieus in which he\n\noperated. This lack of proof that the federal authorities would be\n\nunable or unwilling to do their duty, and thus safeguard the\n\npetitioner and his family, is telling. See Lopez-Soto v. Ashcroft,\n\n383 F.3d 228, 234 n.9 (4th Cir. 2004) (noting that persecution\n\nrequires either state action or a demonstrated inability of the\n\nstate to protect victims from non-state actors); Aguilar-Solis, 168\n\nF.3d at 573 (similar).\n\n          Let us be perfectly clear.   If the state is the putative\n\npersecutor, internal relocation will almost always be a moot point.\n\nSee Singh, 53 F.3d at 1034 (\"it has never been thought that there\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fare safe places within a nation when it is the nation's government\n\nthat has engaged in the acts . . . that have driven the victim to\n\nleave the country\").        Even if the putative persecutor is a local\n\nofficial or other non-state actor, an alien need not show that he\n\nwill be unsafe anywhere in the country in order to avoid automatic\n\ndisqualification from withholding of removal.               Where, for example,\n\nthe non-state actor's reach is countrywide, the inefficacy of\n\ninternal relocation will be apparent.             See Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty.\n\nGen., 378 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir. 2004) (finding that IJ erred\n\nby holding that persecution could be avoided by relocating within\n\nColombia, given uncontradicted evidence that \"guerillas exercise\n\ninfluence throughout [the country]\").             The touchstone is whether,\n\nunder     all    the   circumstances    of    a   particular   case,   internal\n\nrelocation is a reasonable solution.\n\n                In this instance, even if the petitioner had shown that\n\nhe would be subject to persecution based on his alleged social\n\ngroup membership, the putative persecutor is an individual whose\n\nsphere of influence apparently encompasses only one municipality in\n\na   large   country.       Moreover,    there     is   no   evidence   that   the\n\ngovernment cannot or will not protect the petitioner should he\n\nreturn.     Here, then, relocation within the country is a feasible\n\ncourse of action.7        Given that reality, the BIA was not compelled\n\n\n      7\n      The petitioner's claim that he made reasonable efforts to\nrelocate within Brazil is unavailing. He couches this claim in\nsweeping generalities and never explains why the funds that he\n\n                                       -15-\n\fto find that the petitioner had a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.\n\n                               III.\n\n                            Conclusion\n\n          We need go no further. While we leave the \"social group\"\n\nquestion open, we nonetheless uphold both the BIA's determination\n\nthat the petitioner failed to establish a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution and its rejection of the petitioner's claim for\n\nwithholding of removal.\n\n\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\nborrowed to bring himself and his family to the United States could\nnot have been expended to establish a new Brazilian domicile away\nfrom Campos.\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

Discerning no error, we deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1997, the petitioner, previously a domiciliary of Campos, Brazil, entered the United States on a six-month tourist visa. He took up residence in the Boston area and overstayed his visa. A year later, he was joined by his wife, Regina Celia Gomes De Lima Silva, and his minor daughter, Paola Lima Rocha Pereira. They also arrived as tourists and stayed past their respective visa expiration dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 2000, the petitioner requested asylum on behalf of himself, his wife, and his daughter. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) responded by serving a notice to appear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> That notice directed the trio to answer charges that their continued presence in the United States violated the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B). At a hearing before an immigration judge (IJ), the family members admitted through an attorney that they had overstayed, acknowledged removability, conceded that the application for asylum was time-barred, and sought withholding of removal on the ground that the petitioner had a well-founded fear of future persecution in his native Brazil because of his membership in a particular social group, that is, his status as a \"member of society [who] refused to perform illegal tasks simply because of pressure from his immediate supervisors at work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his application for withholding of removal, the petitioner testified that he had been employed as a part-time accountant for a government-funded drug rehabilitation center in Campos. While carrying out his bookkeeping duties, he learned that the chief executive officer of the center, Fred Luis Mauricio, was embezzling funds. The petitioner aided and abetted the embezzlement by creating phony invoices to account for the missing money. When at long last the Brazilian federal government launched an inquiry into the center's operations, Mauricio threatened to kill the petitioner and his family if he spoke about the corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the threat, the petitioner gave a statement implicating Mauricio to the investigators. Subsequently, his wife was threatened and his apartment ransacked. He reported these incidents to the local office of the military police,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> who declined to afford him special protection because he did not know whether Mauricio was responsible for what had transpired. The petitioner took this refusal as a sign that Mauricio and the local police were conspiring against him and that further requests for police assistance would be an exercise in futility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned about his safety and that of his family, the petitioner borrowed money from relatives and fled to the United States. His wife and daughter stayed in Brazil, but moved to his brother's house ninety miles from Campos. A year passed without any untoward incidents. At that point, the petitioner's wife and daughter joined him in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening to the petitioner's tale, the IJ found credible those portions of his testimony that recounted facts within his personal knowledge, e.g., that his work situation was corrupt; that he had initially participated in the corruption but later cooperated with the authorities to root it out; that by providing information to the federal police, he had acted as a whistleblower, albeit one with \"lesser status\" since his whistleblowing began only when it became apparent that he could be prosecuted for his complicity in the ongoing embezzlement; and that Mauricio had threatened him. The IJ explicitly declined to make a finding that Mauricio was responsible for the threat to the petitioner's wife or for the break-in at the petitioner's home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite her acceptance of much of the petitioner's testimony, the IJ refused to embrace many of the conclusions that the petitioner sought to draw from the underlying facts, calling them \"mere speculation.\" Specifically, she refused to credit the petitioner's self-serving accusation that the local police were in league with Mauricio, observing that no hard evidence of such a tie had been proffered. She also noted that the petitioner had made no effort to enlist the help of any police department outside of the local area in which Mauricio might have had political influence, thus further weakening his broad-brush claim of police bias. She then rejected as a matter of law the petitioner's contention that his whistleblower status made him a member of a targeted social group within the purview of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3)(A). Finally, she denied his prayer for withholding of removal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed. The BIA adopted the IJ's findings of fact and conclusions of law, adding an independent finding that the feared harm related to what was \"essentially a personal dispute\" between Mauricio and the petitioner. For that reason, any threats that had been made against the petitioner and his family were insufficient to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the BIA affirmed the IJ's order, this petition for judicial review eventuated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(1), (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Analysis</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the INA, an otherwise deportable alien may avoid removal if the Attorney General determines that \"the alien's life or freedom would be threatened in [the destination] country because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(A). The applicant must carry the devoir of persuasion to show either that (i) he has suffered past persecution on account of one of these five protected grounds (thus creating a rebuttable presumption that he may suffer future persecution), or (ii) it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground upon his return to his native land.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(b); <i>see also INS v. Stevic,</i> 467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). A showing of a well-founded fear of future persecution involves both objective and subjective elements. <i>See Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> 359 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir.2004). To perfect that showing, an alien must establish not only that he harbors a subjectively genuine fear of future persecution but also that an objectively reasonable basis for that fear exists. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Attorney General's authority to make these determinations has been delegated to the BIA. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(1). We review the BIA's findings of fact, including its credibility determinations, pursuant to the substantial evidence standard. <i>Mediouni v. INS,</i> 314 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir.2002). Under that regime, a reviewing court will accept the BIA's findings as long as they are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). This means, in effect, that we will set aside the BIA's findings only if, and to the extent that, \"the record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\" <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.1999). A recent amendment to the INA has codified this deferential standard. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B) (ordaining that the BIA's findings of fact shall be upheld \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rulings of law command our attention under a somewhat different framework. We afford de novo review to the BIA's legal conclusions, but cede some deference to its interpretations of the INA. <i>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. 415, 425, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999); <i>Lattab v. Ashcroft,</i> 384 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the petitioner focuses on the fourth of the five protected grounds: membership in a particular social group. He variously defines that social group as comprising those who \"refused to perform illegal tasks because of pressure\" from workplace supervisors or \"trapped\" employees forced to acquiesce to the demands of corrupt employers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> To make matters more nebulous, the IJ synthesized his argument as being that the particular social group consisted of \"whistleblowers,\" and the petitioner has not disavowed that nomenclature. The petitioner urges that the BIA erred in concluding that he failed to prove a cognizable threat of future persecution on account of that membership, however defined. His argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining what constitutes persecution on account of membership in a particular social group, the key is whether the claimed persecution is aimed at an individual because of his or her affiliation with a group of persons, all of whom share a common, immutable characteristic. <i>See Gebremichael v. INS,</i> 10 F.3d 28, 36 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Ananeh-Firempong v. INS,</i> 766 F.2d 621, 626 (1st Cir.1985); <i>see also In re Acosta,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233, 1985 WL 56042 (BIA 1985), <i>overruled in part by In re Mogharrabi,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439, 1987 WL 108943 (BIA 1987). Because the most obvious groups meeting these criteria &#8212; such as racial or ethnic groups-are independently covered under the withholding of removal statute, stand &#8212; alone social group claims are rather rare. <i>See Gebremichael,</i> 10 F.3d at 35 n. 20. When such claims are proffered, they usually are based on discrete classes such as gender, <i>e.g., Fatin v. INS,</i> 12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993), kinship units such as clans, <i>e.g., In re H-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 337, 337, 1996 WL 291910 (BIA 1996), or individual family membership, <i>e.g., Gebremichael,</i> 10 F.3d at 36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the common characteristic also may reflect a shared experience, such as past membership in a military or paramilitary force. <i>See, e.g., Mediouni,</i> 314 F.3d at 28. Whether the common characteristic is innate or experiential, \"it must be one that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\" <i>Acosta,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 233.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, none of the labels used by the petitioner or the IJ seems to fit comfortably with the concept of a \"recognizable and discrete\" social group. <i>Gebremichael,</i> 10 F.3d at 36. One telltale is the difficulty that the petitioner has in delineating his particular social group; he defines it in various ways at various times, without much in the way of precise line-drawing. Yet, notwithstanding this imprecision, we are keenly aware that refugees' situations vary widely. Thus, we have been reluctant to exclude characteristics categorically from the \"social group\" definition. <i>Cf. Elien v. Ashcroft,</i> 364 F.3d 392, 396 (1st Cir.2004) (cautioning that the term \"particular social group,\" as used in the INA, is not \"free from ambiguity\"). The taxonomic problem is exacerbated here because whistleblowers generally have been recognized as political, rather than social, refugees, <i>see, e.g., Reyes-Guerrero v. INS,</i> 192 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.1999); <i>Marquez v. INS,</i> 105 F.3d 374, 381 (7th Cir.1997), yet the petitioner explicitly relinquished this ground before the IJ and does not attempt to resurrect it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, characteristics relating to current or former employment status can, at least theoretically, form the linchpin for assembling a protected social group. <i>See, e.g., Meguenine v. INS,</i> 139 F.3d 25, 27 n. 2 (1st Cir.1998) (stating that a health care worker who refuses to violate her profession's code of ethics might have a \"trait which a member of that group should not, in good conscience, be required to change\"); <i>see also Alvarez-Flores v. INS,</i> 909 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1990) (finding \"strained,\" but accepting arguendo, a petitioner's contention that he was a member of a social group of cheesemakers subject to persecution for having supplied food to guerilla groups). The petitioner here alternatively self-identifies as a \"trapped\" or harried governmental employee, and at least one court has been willing to recognize a social group of \"former government employees who refused to comply with their employer's demands.\" <i>Marku v. Ashcroft,</i> 380 F.3d 982, 987 n. 8 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, we find it unnecessary to decide whether former employees or whistleblowers can comprise a cognizable social group. Assuming, for argument's sake, that the \"social group\" requirement has been met, the petitioner nonetheless has failed to show persecution based on his claimed membership in such a group: the evidence in this case does not compel a finding, more likely than not, that he was persecuted <i>on account of</i> his status as a member of that group. That defect is, in itself, fatal to his claim for withholding of removal. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 570 (explaining that there must be a nexus between the alleged acts of persecution and the statutorily protected ground); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(b). We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA found that the petitioner did not forge the necessary connection between the claimed persecution and the claimed social group membership. The record amply supports this finding. The most obvious justification is the BIA's determination that the petitioner and Mauricio had became ensnared in what was \"essentially a personal dispute.\" This determination represents a fair inference from the record and, therefore, is supported by substantial evidence. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B). That determination contradicts any claim that the petitioner was persecuted on account of his membership in any particular social group. <i>See Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> 385 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004) (\"The INA is not intended to protect aliens from violence based on personal animosity.\"); <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572 (similar); <i>see also Mogharrabi,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 447.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The finding of a lack of connection between the claimed persecution and the claimed social group membership is sustainable on another ground as well. In the prototypical case, a well-founded fear of persecution arises when an alien faces the prospect of severe mistreatment at the hands of his own government should he be returned to his native land. <i>See Ananeh-Firempong,</i> 766 F.2d at 622-23. Action by non-governmental actors can undergird a claim of persecution only if there is some showing that the alleged persecutors are in league with the government or are not controllable by the government. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573; <i>see also de la de la Llana-Castellon v. I.N.S.,</i> 16 F.3d 1093, 1097 (9th Cir.1994) (explaining that installation of a new Nicaraguan government did not necessarily quell petitioner's fears of persecution at the hands of the Sandinistas).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, an alien who asserts a fear of future persecution by local functionaries ordinarily must show that those functionaries have more than a localized reach. The rationale behind this requirement is that if a potentially troublesome state of affairs is sufficiently localized, an alien can avoid persecution by the simple expedient of relocating within his own country instead of fleeing to foreign soil. <i>See Lukwago v. Ashcroft,</i> 329 F.3d 157, 181 (3d Cir.2003); <i>Singh v. Moschorak,</i> 53 F.3d 1031, 1034 (9th Cir.1995) (collecting cases); <i>In re C-A-L-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 754, 757, 1997 WL 80985 (BIA 1997); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(b)(2) (stating that an alien seeking withholding of removal cannot show that it is more likely than not that he will suffer future persecution if he \"could avoid a future threat to his or her life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal and, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, the BIA had adequate justification, based on the record, for finding no cognizable persecution. The petitioner did not present a shred of evidence that Mauricio posed any danger beyond the municipal boundaries of Campos. Moreover, the fact that the petitioner's wife and daughter lived in Brazil without incident during the year that they spent at a relative's house outside the city limits speaks volumes about the localized nature of any such peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the record contains no evidence that the federal government lacked either the will or the wherewithal to discipline Mauricio and those loyal to him. Indeed, the very fact that federal investigators shut down Mauricio's corrupt boondoggle undercuts the petitioner's wholly conclusory claim that his boss enjoyed special protection outside the local purlieus in which he operated. This lack of proof that the federal authorities would be unable or unwilling to do their duty, and thus safeguard the petitioner and his family, is telling. <i>See Lopez-Soto v. Ashcroft,</i> 383 F.3d 228, 234 n. 9 (4th Cir.2004) (noting that persecution requires either state action or a demonstrated inability of the state to protect victims from non-state actors); <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. If the state is the putative persecutor, internal relocation will almost always be a moot point. <i>See Singh,</i> 53 F.3d at 1034 (\"it has never been thought that there are safe places within a nation when it is the nation's government that has engaged in the acts ... that have driven the victim to leave the country\"). Even if the putative persecutor is a local official or other non-state actor, an alien need not show that he will be unsafe <i>anywhere</i> in the country in order to avoid automatic disqualification from withholding of removal. Where, for example, the non-state actor's reach is countrywide, the inefficacy of internal relocation will be apparent. <i>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen.,</i> 378 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir.2004) (finding that IJ erred by holding that persecution could be avoided by relocating within Colombia, given uncontradicted evidence that \"guerillas exercise influence throughout [the country]\"). The touchstone is whether, under all the circumstances of a particular case, internal relocation is a reasonable solution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, even if the petitioner had shown that he would be subject to persecution based on his alleged social group membership, the putative persecutor is an individual whose sphere of influence apparently encompasses only one municipality in a large country. Moreover, there is no evidence that the government cannot or will not protect the petitioner should he return. Here, then, relocation within the country is a feasible course of action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Given that reality, the BIA was not compelled to find that the petitioner had a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Discerning no error, we deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1997, the petitioner, previously a domiciliary of Campos, Brazil, entered the United States on a six-month tourist visa. He took up residence in the Boston area and overstayed his visa. A year later, he was joined by his wife, Regina Celia Gomes De Lima Silva, and his minor daughter, Paola Lima Rocha Pereira. They also arrived as tourists and stayed past their respective visa expiration dates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September of 2000, the petitioner requested asylum on behalf of himself, his wife, and his daughter. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) responded by serving a notice to appear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> That notice directed the trio to answer charges that their continued presence in the United States violated the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(1)(B). At a hearing before an immigration judge (IJ), the family members admitted through an attorney that they had overstayed, acknowledged removability, conceded that the application for asylum was time-barred, and sought withholding of removal on the ground that the petitioner had a well-founded fear of future persecution in his native Brazil because of his membership in a particular social group, that is, his status as a \"member of society [who] refused to perform illegal tasks simply because of pressure from his immediate supervisors at work.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his application for withholding of removal, the petitioner testified that he had been employed as a part-time accountant for a government-funded drug rehabilitation center in Campos. While carrying out his bookkeeping duties, he learned that the chief executive officer of the center, Fred Luis Mauricio, was embezzling funds. The petitioner aided and abetted the embezzlement by creating phony invoices to account for the missing money. When at long last the Brazilian federal government launched an inquiry into the center's operations, Mauricio threatened to kill the petitioner and his family if he spoke about the corruption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the threat, the petitioner gave a statement implicating Mauricio to the investigators. Subsequently, his wife was threatened and his apartment ransacked. He reported these incidents to the local office of the military police,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> who declined to afford him special protection because he did not know whether Mauricio was responsible for what had transpired. The petitioner took this refusal as a sign that Mauricio and the local police were conspiring against him and that further requests for police assistance would be an exercise in futility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned about his safety and that of his family, the petitioner borrowed money from relatives and fled to the United States. His wife and daughter stayed in Brazil, but moved to his brother's house ninety miles from Campos. A year passed without any untoward incidents. At that point, the petitioner's wife and daughter joined him in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening to the petitioner's tale, the IJ found credible those portions of his testimony that recounted facts within his personal knowledge, e.g., that his work situation was corrupt; that he had initially participated in the corruption but later cooperated with the authorities to root it out; that by providing information to the federal police, he had acted as a whistleblower, albeit one with \"lesser status\" since his whistleblowing began only when it became apparent that he could be prosecuted for his complicity in the ongoing embezzlement; and that Mauricio had threatened him. The IJ explicitly declined to make a finding that Mauricio was responsible for the threat to the petitioner's wife or for the break-in at the petitioner's home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite her acceptance of much of the petitioner's testimony, the IJ refused to embrace many of the conclusions that the petitioner sought to draw from the underlying facts, calling them \"mere speculation.\" Specifically, she refused to credit the petitioner's self-serving accusation that the local police were in league with Mauricio, observing that no hard evidence of such a tie had been proffered. She also noted that the petitioner had made no effort to enlist the help of any police department outside of the local area in which Mauricio might have had political influence, thus further weakening his broad-brush claim of police bias. She then rejected as a matter of law the petitioner's contention that his whistleblower status made him a member of a targeted social group within the purview of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(b)(3)(A). Finally, she denied his prayer for withholding of removal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed. The BIA adopted the IJ's findings of fact and conclusions of law, adding an independent finding that the feared harm related to what was \"essentially a personal dispute\" between Mauricio and the petitioner. For that reason, any threats that had been made against the petitioner and his family were insufficient to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the BIA affirmed the IJ's order, this petition for judicial review eventuated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(1), (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Analysis</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the INA, an otherwise deportable alien may avoid removal if the Attorney General determines that \"the alien's life or freedom would be threatened in [the destination] country because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(A).

Because the most obvious groups meeting these criteria &#8212; such as racial or ethnic groups-are independently covered under the withholding of removal statute, stand &#8212; alone social group claims are rather rare. <i>See Gebremichael,</i> 10 F.3d at 35 n. 20. When such claims are proffered, they usually are based on discrete classes such as gender, <i>e.g., Fatin v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"659860\"><a href=\"/opinion/659860/parastoo-fatin-v-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1233</span></a></span>, 1240 (3d Cir.1993), kinship units such as clans, <i>e.g., In re H-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N.

Whether the common characteristic is innate or experiential, \"it must be one that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\" <i>Acosta,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 233.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, none of the labels used by the petitioner or the IJ seems to fit comfortably with the concept of a \"recognizable and discrete\" social group. <i>Gebremichael,</i> 10 F.3d at 36. One telltale is the difficulty that the petitioner has in delineating his particular social group; he defines it in various ways at various times, without much in the way of precise line-drawing. Yet, notwithstanding this imprecision, we are keenly aware that refugees' situations vary widely. Thus, we have been reluctant to exclude characteristics categorically from the \"social group\" definition. <i>Cf. Elien v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200971\"><a href=\"/opinion/200971/elien-v-john-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 396 (1st Cir.2004) (cautioning that the term \"particular social group,\" as used in the INA, is not \"free from ambiguity\"). The taxonomic problem is exacerbated here because whistleblowers generally have been recognized as political, rather than social, refugees, <i>see, e.g., Reyes-Guerrero v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766331\"><a href=\"/opinion/766331/carlos-e-reyes-guerrero-graciela-i-jimenez-de-reyes-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></a></span>, 1245 (9th Cir.1999); <i>Marquez v.

INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197852\"><a href=\"/opinion/197852/meguenine-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27 n. 2 (1st Cir.1998) (stating that a health care worker who refuses to violate her profession's code of ethics might have a \"trait which a member of that group should not, in good conscience, be required to change\"); <i>see also Alvarez-Flores v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545202\"><a href=\"/opinion/545202/william-alexander-alvarez-flores-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1990) (finding \"strained,\" but accepting arguendo, a petitioner's contention that he was a member of a social group of cheesemakers subject to persecution for having supplied food to guerilla groups). The petitioner here alternatively self-identifies as a \"trapped\" or harried governmental employee, and at least one court has been willing to recognize a social group of \"former government employees who refused to comply with their employer's demands.\" <i>Marku v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787458\"><a href=\"/opinion/787458/liri-norek-marku-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">982</span></a></span>, 987 n. 8 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, we find it unnecessary to decide whether former employees or whistleblowers can comprise a cognizable social group. Assuming, for argument's sake, that the \"social group\" requirement has been met, the petitioner nonetheless has failed to show persecution based on his claimed membership in such a group: the evidence in this case does not compel a finding, more likely than not, that he was persecuted <i>on account of</i> his status as a member of that group. That defect is, in itself, fatal to his claim for withholding of removal. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 570 (explaining that there must be a nexus between the alleged acts of persecution and the statutorily protected ground); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(b). We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA found that the petitioner did not forge the necessary connection between the claimed persecution and the claimed social group membership. The record amply supports this finding. The most obvious justification is the BIA's determination that the petitioner and Mauricio had became ensnared in what was \"essentially a personal dispute.\" This determination represents a fair inference from the record and, therefore, is supported by substantial evidence. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B). That determination contradicts any claim that the petitioner was persecuted on account of his membership in any particular social group. <i>See Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201241\"><a href=\"/opinion/201241/romilus-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.2004) (\"The INA is not intended to protect aliens from violence based on personal animosity.\"); <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572 (similar); <i>see also Mogharrabi,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 447.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The finding of a lack of connection between the claimed persecution and the claimed social group membership is sustainable on another ground as well. In the prototypical case, a well-founded fear of persecution arises when an alien faces the prospect of severe mistreatment at the hands of his own government should he be returned to his native land. <i>See Ananeh-Firempong,</i> 766 F.2d at 622-23. Action by non-governmental actors can undergird a claim of persecution only if there is some showing that the alleged persecutors are in league with the government or are not controllable by the government. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573; <i>see also de la de la Llana-Castellon v. I.N.S.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663166\"><a href=\"/opinion/663166/orlando-de-la-llana-castellon-ana-aracely-de-la-llana-pasquier-orlando/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1093</span></a></span>, 1097 (9th Cir.1994) (explaining that installation of a new Nicaraguan government did not necessarily quell petitioner's fears of persecution at the hands of the Sandinistas).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, an alien who asserts a fear of future persecution by local functionaries ordinarily must show that those functionaries have more than a localized reach. The rationale behind this requirement is that if a potentially troublesome state of affairs is sufficiently localized, an alien can avoid persecution by the simple expedient of relocating within his own country instead of fleeing to foreign soil. <i>See Lukwago v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781978\"><a href=\"/opinion/781978/bernard-lukwago-aka-melvin-haft-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span>, 181 (3d Cir.2003); <i>Singh v. Moschorak,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695232\"><a href=\"/opinion/695232/hardev-singh-v-robert-moschorak-district-director-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span>, 1034 (9th Cir.1995) (collecting cases); <i>In re C-A-L-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 754, 757, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">80985</span></span> (BIA 1997); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(b)(2) (stating that an alien seeking withholding of removal cannot show that it is more likely than not that he will suffer future persecution if he \"could avoid a future threat to his or her life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal and, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, the BIA had adequate justification, based on the record, for finding no cognizable persecution. The petitioner did not present a shred of evidence that Mauricio posed any danger beyond the municipal boundaries of Campos. Moreover, the fact that the petitioner's wife and daughter lived in Brazil without incident during the year that they spent at a relative's house outside the city limits speaks volumes about the localized nature of any such peril.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the record contains no evidence that the federal government lacked either the will or the wherewithal to discipline Mauricio and those loyal to him. Indeed, the very fact that federal investigators shut down Mauricio's corrupt boondoggle undercuts the petitioner's wholly conclusory claim that his boss enjoyed special protection outside the local purlieus in which he operated. This lack of proof that the federal authorities would be unable or unwilling to do their duty, and thus safeguard the petitioner and his family, is telling. <i>See Lopez-Soto v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787695\"><a href=\"/opinion/787695/rutilio-lopez-soto-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 234 n. 9 (4th Cir.2004) (noting that persecution requires either state action or a demonstrated inability of the state to protect victims from non-state actors); <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573 (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. If the state is the putative persecutor, internal relocation will almost always be a moot point. <i>See Singh,</i> 53 F.3d at 1034 (\"it has never been thought that there are safe places within a nation when it is the nation's government that has engaged in the acts ... that have driven the victim to leave the country\"). Even if the putative persecutor is a local official or other non-state actor, an alien need not show that he will be unsafe <i>anywhere</i> in the country in order to avoid automatic disqualification from withholding of removal. Where, for example, the non-state actor's reach is countrywide, the inefficacy of internal relocation will be apparent. <i>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1260</span></span>, 1265 (11th Cir.2004) (finding that IJ erred by holding that persecution could be avoided by relocating within Colombia, given uncontradicted evidence that \"guerillas exercise influence throughout [the country]\"). The touchstone is whether, under all the circumstances of a particular case, internal relocation is a reasonable solution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, even if the petitioner had shown that he would be subject to persecution based on his alleged social group membership, the putative persecutor is an individual whose sphere of influence apparently encompasses only one municipality in a large country. Moreover, there is no evidence that the government cannot or will not protect the petitioner should he return. Here, then, relocation within the country is a feasible course of action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Given that reality, the BIA was not compelled to find that the petitioner had a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. While we leave the \"social group\" question open, we nonetheless uphold both the BIA's determination that the petitioner failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution and its rejection of the petitioner's claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-296, &#167; 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. &#167; 291(a)), abolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of Homeland Security<i>See Lattab v.
