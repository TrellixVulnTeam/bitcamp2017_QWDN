Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Alcides Garcia-Marcucci on brief pro se.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney and Nelson Perez-Sosa,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              July 5, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam.       Appellant, Alcides Garcia-Marcucci,               pled\n\nguilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute one hundred fifty\n\nkilograms or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 846 and\n\none count of laundering monetary instruments in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.    1956(a)(1).      He     now    appeals   both    his   conviction      and\n\nsentence.\n\n            Appellant first argues we should vacate his conviction\n\nbecause    his    guilty   plea       was   rendered   involuntary      when     the\n\ngovernment breached its agreement to recommend the bottom of the\n\nguideline range of 188-235 months and to refrain from \"us[ing] any\n\ninformation      concerning     his     alleged   leadership     to   enhance    the\n\nsentence.\"       He further argues that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to bring about the disclosure of the terms of the agreement\n\nduring the change of plea hearing.\n\n            As appellant is unable to establish there was a plea\n\nagreement, both of these arguments fail.                  See United States v.\n\nRiggs, 287 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir. 2002); see also United States v.\n\nSaxena, 229 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000).                 Appellant concedes he\n\nnever entered into a written plea agreement with the government,\n\nand the rules of the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico require that such agreements be in writing.                       See\n\nD.P.R. R. 418 (2002).           Moreover, the record evidence does not\n\nsupport the existence of such an agreement.                The record supports\n\nonly that the government stipulated that it would seek an offense\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\flevel of 38 and a criminal history category of I, would withdraw\n\nits   851   notice,   and   would   \"not   seek   any   enhancement   for   a\n\nsupervisory role or leadership capacity.\"           These stipulations do\n\nnot resemble the terms of the alleged plea agreement, and the\n\ngovernment complied with each of them.             To be sure, appellant\n\nprovides an affidavit in which he claims that his counsel promised\n\nhim that he would \"receive at least the bottom of the guideline\n\nrange of 188 to 235 months\" if he pled guilty.              As he did not\n\nproperly raise this factual claim before the district court,\n\nhowever, he has forfeited any right to appeal on this ground.1          See\n\nUnited States v. Argentine, 814 F.2d 783, 790 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n            Appellant further argues that even if there was no plea\n\nagreement, his plea was involuntary because it was based upon his\n\ncounsel's false assurances that the government would recommend a\n\nsentence at the lower end of the Guidelines range.              This claim\n\nrequires proof of facts outside the present record, as it centers\n\non alleged intimate discussions between him and his counsel.\n\nAccordingly, it is not appropriate for direct appeal and will not\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      While appellant raised a somewhat similar issue in his\nmotion to set aside and/or withdraw guilty plea that he filed in\nthe district court, the district court never considered it,\nchoosing to hold the motion in abeyance while it determined whether\nthe defense counsel that filed the motion should be disqualified\ndue to conflict of interest. Ultimately, the court disqualified\nthe counsel, and subsequent defense counsel withdrew the motion at\nthe sentencing hearing.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fbe considered.         See, e.g, United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                 Lastly,     in     response     to   our   invitation        to   file\n\nsupplemental briefing on the subject, appellant raises a claim of\n\nBooker error.         Appellant did not preserve this claim below, so we\n\nreview for plain error.2             See United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399\n\nF.3d       68,   77   (1st   Cir.    2005).      Appellant's   claim     is    largely\n\nidentical to his involuntary plea claim and, therefore, fails for\n\nthe above stated reasons. Thus, he is unable to establish that the\n\nBooker error affected his substantial rights.                  See id. at 78.\n\n                 Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        While appellant argued that the district court violated\nApprendi in connection with his erstwhile motion to withdraw his\nplea, this does not suffice to preserve his Booker claim because he\nlater withdrew the motion.\n\n                                           -4-\n\f",
