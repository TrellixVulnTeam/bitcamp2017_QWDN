José Antonio Fusté,           U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Rafael Colon Flores and Colon Flores Law Firm on brief for\nappellant.\n     Robert J.

Raul De Jesus appeals from the district court's\n\ndetermination that the decision of the Commissioner of Social\n\nSecurity to deny         his request for Social Security disability\n\nbenefits was supported by substantial evidence.                 We have reviewed\n\nthe record, the issues the parties raised in their briefs, and the\n\napplicable law, and we discern no reversible error.\n\n     The district court did not err in its determination that the\n\nCommissioner's     disability   decision      --    that   De    Jesus       was   not\n\ndisabled under the Social Security Act for the insured period\n\nbecause he retained the residual functional capacity to perform the\n\nfull range of jobs in the medium exertional range -- was supported\n\nby   substantial    evidence    and    was    the    result      of    the    proper\n\napplication   of   the    correct     legal   standards.         See    Seavey      v.\n\nBarnhart, 276 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2001).              The submitted medical\n\nevidence did not establish that De Jesus was disabled within the\n\nmeaning of the Act during the covered period.              Specifically,           the\n\nCommissioner did not err in the determination that, although                        De\n\nJesus was not capable of returning to his past work as a stock\n\nclerk, the Medical-Vocational Grids identified other jobs in the\n\nnational economy which De Jesus could perform.                    Concerning De\n\nJesus's request that he be allowed to introduce new evidence not\n\nsubmitted before the ALJ, we note that De Jesus has at no point\n\neven produced the medical records on which he seeks a reevaluation\n\nof his disability claim.        There is thus no reason to remand the\n\n\n                                       2\n\fcase for consideration of \"evidence\" which does not exist in the\n\nrecord.
