Rya W. Zobel,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Selya, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     David M.

Thompson and Thompson & Thompson, P.C., on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           January 24, 2008\n\f             SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.               Applicants for habeas\n\ncorpus relief often present an array of claims, some of which yield\n\nbroader redress than others.              The king of habeas remedies is an\n\norder for unconditional release with prejudice to reprosecution.\n\nIf the fact of the petitioner's prosecution (or any reprosecution\n\nupon   the     vacation        of   his   conviction)     would   violate    the\n\nConstitution, that relief will follow.            A paradigmatic example of\n\nthis phenomenon is when jeopardy has attached and the evidence\n\nadduced   at    trial     is    found,    upon   collateral   review,   to    be\n\nconstitutionally insufficient to sustain the conviction. See Burks\n\nv. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 18 (1978) (holding that \"the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause precludes a second trial once the reviewing court\n\nhas found the evidence legally insufficient\"); Fagan v. Washington,\n\n942 F.2d 1155, 1157, 1160 (7th Cir. 1991) (granting unconditional\n\nrelease because the evidence at trial was insufficient and, thus,\n\nthe Constitution barred a retrial).\n\n             A lesser (though still potent) habeas remedy is the\n\nvacation of the conviction and conditional release; this remedy\n\nrequires the State to retry the petitioner, this time in a manner\n\nconsistent with the Constitution, or else to release him.                   See,\n\ne.g., Dugas v. Coplan, 428 F.3d 317, 342 n.37 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nOuber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 35 (1st Cir. 2002).                 This appeal\n\nillustrates why a district court ordinarily should not bypass a\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fhabeas claim for unconditional release simply because it has\n\nconcluded that a new trial is warranted.\n\n             The background facts may be summarized succinctly.                    In\n\n1992,    a   Massachusetts    jury    convicted      the       petitioner,   Robert\n\nFoxworth, on a charge of second-degree murder.                   The Massachusetts\n\nAppeals Court affirmed his conviction in an unpublished opinion and\n\nthe Supreme Judicial Court denied further review.\n\n             The petitioner then repaired to the federal district\n\ncourt.       His habeas petition, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254, raised three\n\nproperly exhausted claims: (i) a claim that the admission at trial\n\nof a nontestifying codefendant's incriminatory statement violated\n\nhis Sixth Amendment rights, see Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S.\n\n123, 126 (1968); (ii) a claim that the use of an unreliable\n\neyewitness     identification    violated      due    process,       see   Neil    v.\n\nBiggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972); and (iii) a claim that, even\n\nwith the eyewitness identification in the mix, the evidence was\n\nconstitutionally     insufficient      to   support        the    conviction,     see\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979).                   If well-founded,\n\nthe insufficiency claim promised to yield relief broader than--and\n\nindeed inconsistent with--conditional release.\n\n             The   district   court    found   that        a    Bruton   error    had\n\ncompromised the verdict.        It dispatched the petition with this\n\nbottom line:       \"Because petitioner is entitled to relief on the\n\nbasis of his Bruton claim, it is unnecessary to consider his\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fadditional     claims     concerning    eyewitness          identification      and\n\nsufficiency    of   the   evidence.\"         The    court    then    granted    the\n\npetitioner's     habeas     corpus     application          and     directed    the\n\nCommonwealth \"to retry [the] petitioner within sixty days or\n\nrelease him from custody.\"\n\n              The Commonwealth filed a timely notice of appeal, and\n\n the district court stayed its order pending resolution of this\n\n appeal.     The petitioner moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground\n\n that the district court's order, which decided only the Bruton\n\n claim and left the other two claims open for future disposition,\n\n was not final and appealable.           In this regard, the petitioner\n\n noted that the district court did not expressly direct the entry\n\n of a final judgment as to fewer than all of the claims asserted.\n\n See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\n\n              Although the petitioner has now withdrawn his motion to\n\n dismiss, we nevertheless test the jurisdictional hypothesis. See\n\n Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds to Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151,\n\n 155-56 (1st Cir. 2004) (explaining that \"[w]hen a colorable\n\n question exists, an appellate court has an unflagging obligation\n\n to inquire sua sponte into its own jurisdiction\").                       A final\n\n judgment ends the matter in dispute, leaving nothing to be done\n\n but the execution of the judgment.                See Alstom Caribe, Inc. v.\n\n Geo. P. Reintjes Co., 484 F.3d 106, 111 (1st Cir. 2007).                      Here,\n\n all indications are that the district court considered its work\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f completed;       it     did    not   purport     to     release    the    petitioner\n\n conditionally          while   it    mulled     other    matters       but,    rather,\n\n effectively returned the petitioner's case to the state court\n\n system, implicitly disposing of his two remaining claims as moot.\n\n Because that was a final judgment, we need not decide whether and\n\n how Rule 54(b) might apply in a habeas proceeding.1\n\n               This determination does no more than mark the launch of\n\n our odyssey: the question remains whether we need to address the\n\n implicit disposition of the due process and insufficiency claims.\n\n In    part,    this     question     is   easily      answered;   in     the   present\n\n posture, the petitioner may be able to defend the granting of his\n\n habeas petition on the alternative ground that the admission of\n\n the       eyewitness     identification       violated     due     process.        See\n\n Beauchamp v. Murphy, 37 F.3d 700, 706 (1st Cir. 1994); see also\n\n InterGen N.V. v. Grina, 344 F.3d 134, 141 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting\n\n that \"we sometimes affirm a district court's judgment even though\n\n we disavow its reasoning\").\n\n               The insufficiency claim is cut from different cloth--\n\n and that claim presents something of a conundrum.                        Ordinarily,\n\n\n       1\n      That question is not free from doubt. At least two of our\nsister circuits have applied Rule 54(b) in the habeas corpus\ncontext. See Clisby v. Jones, 960 F.2d 925, 936, 938 n.17 (11th\nCir. 1992) (en banc); Stewart v. Bishop, 403 F.2d 674, 676-80 (8th\nCir. 1968). Other courts of appeals have been less sanguine about\nthe proposition. See, e.g., Sprosty v. Buchler, 79 F.3d 635, 645\n(7th Cir. 1996); Blazak v. Ricketts, 971 F.2d 1408, 1411-12 (9th\nCir. 1992); Young v. Herring, 777 F.2d 198, 201-02 (5th Cir. 1985).\nWe leave the question for another day.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fsuch a claim--which inherently calls for broader relief than was\n\ngranted by the district court--would require a cross-appeal. See\n\nYoung v. Herring, 777 F.2d 198, 200-01, 204-05 (5th Cir. 1985);\n\nsee also 15B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure ยง 3918.9, at 593-94 (1992) (\"Upon appeal\n\nby the custodians, the prisoner should be allowed to cross-appeal\n\nto press a demand for greater relief.\").        But the petitioner has\n\nneither filed a notice of appeal nor requested a certificate of\n\nappealability,    28   U.S.C.   ยง    2253(c),   as   to    the   implicit\n\ndisposition of his insufficiency claim.\n\n            Even without a cross-appeal, interests of fairness and\n\njudicial economy counsel in favor of taking some action at this\n\njuncture.    It would make little sense for us to pass upon the\n\npropriety of the ordered relief--a retrial--when broader relief,\n\nif granted, would obviate any need for doing so.          Here, moreover,\n\nthe district court has not explained why a decision on the merits\n\nof the insufficiency claim was \"unnecessary.\"         If it meant that\n\nthe grant of a new trial gave the petitioner complete relief, we\n\ndisagree; no habeas petitioner would willingly accept half a loaf\n\n(a retrial) if he were entitled to a full loaf (unconditional\n\nrelease).   All in all, it would seem that the proper course is to\n\nremand the matter so that the district court can consider the\n\ninsufficiency claim in the first instance.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           We   are    fortified     in    this      conclusion   by     the\n\nCommonwealth's prayer for relief in its opening brief, which--\n\nalthough suggesting that this be done later--acknowledges the\n\nneed to remand the cause to the district court for a decision on\n\nthe remaining grounds of the petition.            The need for a remand\n\nbeing patent, we think that it is both fairer and more prudent to\n\nremand for further proceedings now rather than wait until the\n\nconclusion of this appeal (as the Commonwealth proposes).                We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n           If   the   district    court   reverses    the   conviction   on\n\ninsufficiency grounds, a retrial may prove unnecessary.                  See\n\nBurks, 437 U.S. at 18.           Given this possibility, the better\n\npractice is to err (if at all) on the side of preventing an\n\nunnecessary retrial.     Cf. United States v. Gonzรกlez-Sรกnchez, 825\n\nF.2d 572, 588 (1st Cir. 1987) (proceeding to review a challenge\n\nto the sufficiency of the evidence although having previously\n\nfound other grounds for reversal of the conviction).           This is the\n\ncourse of prudence, and it is the course that most courts follow.\n\nSee 5 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure ยง 25.4(c), at\n\n682-83 (1999); Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure,\n\nsupra ยง 3918.7, at 561.\n\n           To be sure, the courts have differed as to whether this\n\ncourse represents a policy choice or a matter of constitutional\n\ncommand.   Compare, e.g., United States v. Bobo, 419 F.3d 1264,\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f1268 (11th Cir. 2005) (\"prudential rule\"), with, e.g., Vogel v.\n\nPennsylvania, 790 F.2d 368, 376 (3d Cir. 1986) (\"double jeopardy\n\nrights\").   We think it represents sound policy and, so, we adopt\n\nas a prudential rule the policy of requiring district courts in\n\nhabeas cases to address preserved challenges to evidentiary\n\nsufficiency even though the conviction must be reversed in all\n\nevents for trial error.       Cf. United States v. Miller, 952 F.2d\n\n866, 874 (5th Cir. 1992) (explaining that it is \"clearly the\n\nbetter practice for the appellate court on an initial appeal to\n\ndispose of any claim properly presented to it that the evidence\n\nat trial was legally insufficient\"); United States v. Douglas,\n\n874 F.2d 1145, 1150 (7th Cir. 1989) (noting policy of \"routinely\n\naddressing evidentiary sufficiency in criminal cases\" even if the\n\nconviction must be reversed for trial error).\n\n            Let us be perfectly clear.         Although we do not hold\n\nthat the Double Jeopardy Clause compels the review of a properly\n\npreserved insufficiency claim before the petitioner is retried,\n\nsee, e.g., Vogel, 790 F.2d at 376, we do hold that, as a\n\nprudential matter, such claims (or, for that matter, other habeas\n\nclaims for unconditional release with prejudice to reprosecution)\n\nordinarily should be decided in a timely manner.\n\n            For   the   reasons   elucidated   above,   this   matter   is\n\nremanded for further proceedings on the insufficiency claim. The\n\ndistrict court is encouraged to consider the due process claim as\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fwell.   When it has concluded its further proceedings, the court\n\nshould enter a single omnibus judgment encompassing both its\n\nexisting ruling on the Bruton claim and its new ruling(s).           The\n\npetitioner is, of course, free to abandon any of his remaining\n\nclaims at any time.\n\n          There is one final point.        The petitioner recently has\n\nmoved for admission to bail. We shall not entertain the request,\n\nbut it may be renewed before the district court on remand.          Given\n\nhis favorable prospects for at least partial success and the\n\nlength of time that his habeas petition has been pending, we\n\nthink that the district court should give the request prompt and\n\nserious consideration, subject, of course, to the traditional mix\n\nof factors involved in such decisions, see, e.g., Hilton v.\n\nBraunskill,   481   U.S.   770,   774-77    (1987),   and   to   whatever\n\narguments the Commonwealth may muster.\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

The king of habeas remedies is an order for unconditional release with prejudice to reprosecution. If the fact of the petitioner's prosecution (or any reprosecution upon the vacation of his conviction) would violate the Constitution, that relief will follow. A paradigmatic example of this phenomenon is when jeopardy has attached and the evidence adduced at trial is found, upon collateral review, to be constitutionally insufficient to sustain the conviction. <i>See </i><i>Burks v. United States,</i> 437 U.S. 1, 18, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978) (holding that \"the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial once the reviewing court has found the evidence legally insufficient\"); <i>Fagan v. Washington,</i> 942 F.2d 1155, 1157, 1160 (7th Cir.1991) (granting unconditional release because the evidence at trial was insufficient and, thus, the Constitution barred a retrial).</p>\n<p>A lesser (though still potent) habeas remedy is the vacation of the conviction and conditional release; this remedy requires the State to retry the petitioner, this time in a manner consistent with the Constitution, or else to release him. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dugas v. Coplan,</i> 428 F.3d 317, 342 n. 37 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Ouber v. Guarino,</i> 293 F.3d 19, 35 (1st Cir.2002). This appeal illustrates why a district court ordinarily should not bypass a habeas claim for unconditional release simply because it has concluded that a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p>The background facts may be summarized succinctly. In 1992, a Massachusetts jury convicted the petitioner, Robert Foxworth, on a charge of second-degree murder. The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed his conviction in an unpublished opinion and the Supreme Judicial Court denied further review.</p>\n<p>The petitioner then repaired to the federal district court. His habeas petition, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254, raised three properly exhausted claims: (i) a claim that the admission at trial of a nontestifying codefendant's incriminatory statement violated his Sixth Amendment rights, <i>see </i><i>Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968); (ii) a claim that the use of an unreliable eyewitness identification violated due process, <i>see </i><i>Neil v. Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. 188, 198, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972); and (iii) a claim that, even with the eyewitness identification in the mix, the evidence was constitutionally insufficient to support the conviction, <i>see </i><i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). If well-founded, the insufficiency claim promised to yield relief broader thanยand indeed inconsistent withยconditional release.</p>\n<p>The district court found that a <i>Bruton</i> error had compromised the verdict. It dispatched the petition with this bottom line: \"Because petitioner is entitled to relief on the basis of his <i>Bruton</i> claim, it is unnecessary to consider his additional claims concerning eyewitness identification and sufficiency of the evidence.\" The court then granted the petitioner's habeas corpus application and directed the Commonwealth \"to retry [the] petitioner within sixty days or release him from custody.\"</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth filed a timely notice of appeal, and the district court stayed its order pending resolution of this appeal. The petitioner moved to dismiss <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> the appeal on the ground that the district court's order, which decided only the <i>Braton claim</i> and left the other two claims open for future disposition, was not final and appealable. In this regard, the petitioner noted that the district court did not expressly direct the entry of a final judgment as to fewer than all of the claims asserted. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n<p>Although the petitioner has now withdrawn his motion to dismiss, we nevertheless test the jurisdictional hypothesis. <i>See </i><i>Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds to Go, Inc.,</i> 370 F.3d 151, 155-56 (1st Cir. 2004) (explaining that \"[w]hen a colorable question exists, an appellate court has an unflagging obligation to inquire sua sponte into its own jurisdiction\").

Here, all indications are that the district court considered its work completed; it did not purport to release the petitioner conditionally while it mulled other matters but, rather, effectively returned the petitioner's case to the state court system, implicitly disposing of his two remaining claims as moot. Because that was a final judgment, we need not decide whether and how Rule 54(b) might apply in a habeas proceeding.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>This determination does no more than mark the launch of our odyssey: the question remains whether we need to address the implicit disposition of the due process and insufficiency claims. In part, this question is easily answered; in the present posture, the petitioner may be able to defend the granting of his habeas petition on the alternative ground that the admission of the eyewitness identification violated due process. <i>See </i><i>Beauchamp v.

Thompson and Thompson &amp; Thompson, P.C., on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, CAMPBELL and SELYA, Senior Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Applicants for habeas corpus relief often present an array of claims, some of which yield broader redress than others. The king of habeas remedies is an order for unconditional release with prejudice to reprosecution. If the fact of the petitioner's prosecution (or any reprosecution upon the vacation of his conviction) would violate the Constitution, that relief will follow. A paradigmatic example of this phenomenon is when jeopardy has attached and the evidence adduced at trial is found, upon collateral review, to be constitutionally insufficient to sustain the conviction. <i>See </i><i>Burks v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109891\"><a href=\"/opinion/109891/burks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109891\"><a href=\"/opinion/109891/burks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1978) (holding that \"the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial once the reviewing court has found the evidence legally insufficient\"); <i>Fagan v.

Coplan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201898\"><a href=\"/opinion/201898/dugas-v-coplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 342 n. 37 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Ouber v.

This appeal illustrates why a district court ordinarily should not bypass a habeas claim for unconditional release simply because it has concluded that a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p>The background facts may be summarized succinctly. In 1992, a Massachusetts jury convicted the petitioner, Robert Foxworth, on a charge of second-degree murder. The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed his conviction in an unpublished opinion and the Supreme Judicial Court denied further review.</p>\n<p>The petitioner then repaired to the federal district court. His habeas petition, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254, raised three properly exhausted claims: (i) a claim that the admission at trial of a nontestifying codefendant's incriminatory statement violated his Sixth Amendment rights, <i>see </i><i>Bruton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 126, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span> (1968); (ii) a claim that the use of an unreliable eyewitness identification violated due process, <i>see </i><i>Neil v. Biggers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 198, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span> (1972); and (iii) a claim that, even with the eyewitness identification in the mix, the evidence was constitutionally insufficient to support the conviction, <i>see </i><i>Jackson v. Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110138\"><a href=\"/opinion/110138/jackson-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span> (1979). If well-founded, the insufficiency claim promised to yield relief broader thanยand indeed inconsistent withยconditional release.</p>\n<p>The district court found that a <i>Bruton</i> error had compromised the verdict. It dispatched the petition with this bottom line: \"Because petitioner is entitled to relief on the basis of his <i>Bruton</i> claim, it is unnecessary to consider his additional claims concerning eyewitness identification and sufficiency of the evidence.\" The court then granted the petitioner's habeas corpus application and directed the Commonwealth \"to retry [the] petitioner within sixty days or release him from custody.\"</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth filed a timely notice of appeal, and the district court stayed its order pending resolution of this appeal. The petitioner moved to dismiss <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> the appeal on the ground that the district court's order, which decided only the <i>Braton claim</i> and left the other two claims open for future disposition, was not final and appealable. In this regard, the petitioner noted that the district court did not expressly direct the entry of a final judgment as to fewer than all of the claims asserted. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n<p>Although the petitioner has now withdrawn his motion to dismiss, we nevertheless test the jurisdictional hypothesis. <i>See </i><i>Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds to Go, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201049\"><a href=\"/opinion/201049/charlesbank-v-blinds-to-go-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 155-56 (1st Cir. 2004) (explaining that \"[w]hen a colorable question exists, an appellate court has an unflagging obligation to inquire sua sponte into its own jurisdiction\"). A final judgment ends the matter in dispute, leaving nothing to be done but the execution of the judgment. <i>See </i><i>Alstom Caribe, v. Geo. P. Reintjes Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202711\"><a href=\"/opinion/202711/alstom-caribe-inc-v-geo-p-reintjes-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.2007). Here, all indications are that the district court considered its work completed; it did not purport to release the petitioner conditionally while it mulled other matters but, rather, effectively returned the petitioner's case to the state court system, implicitly disposing of his two remaining claims as moot. Because that was a final judgment, we need not decide whether and how Rule 54(b) might apply in a habeas proceeding.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>This determination does no more than mark the launch of our odyssey: the question remains whether we need to address the implicit disposition of the due process and insufficiency claims. In part, this question is easily answered; in the present posture, the petitioner may be able to defend the granting of his habeas petition on the alternative ground that the admission of the eyewitness identification violated due process. <i>See </i><i>Beauchamp v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679954\"><a href=\"/opinion/679954/robert-c-beauchamp-v-paul-murphy-the-superintendent-of-the-old-colony/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span>, 706 (1st Cir.1994); <i>see also </i><i>InterGen N.V. v.

Ordinarily, such a claimยwhich inherently calls for broader relief than was granted by the district courtยwould require a cross-appeal. <i>See </i><i>Young v. Herring,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461024\"><a href=\"/opinion/461024/jerry-lynn-young-v-robert-herring-lee-county-sheriff-and-donald-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span>, 200-01, 204-05 (5th Cir.1985); <i>see also</i> 15B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> ยง 3918.9, at 593-94 (1992) (\"Upon appeal by the custodians, the prisoner should be allowed to cross-appeal to press a demand for greater relief.\"). But the petitioner has neither filed a notice of appeal nor requested a certificate of appealability, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2253(c), as to the implicit disposition of his insufficiency claim.</p>\n<p>Even without a cross-appeal, interests of fairness and judicial economy counsel in favor of taking some action at this juncture. It would make little sense for us to pass upon the propriety of the ordered reliefยa retrialยwhen broader relief, if granted, would obviate any need for doing so. Here, moreover, the district court has not explained why a decision on the merits of the insufficiency claim was \"unnecessary.\" If it meant that the grant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> of a new trial gave the petitioner complete relief, we disagree; no habeas petitioner would willingly accept half a loaf (a retrial) if he were entitled to a full loaf (unconditional release).
