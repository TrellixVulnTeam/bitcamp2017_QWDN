R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 02-1823\n\n                     IVETTE GARCIA-FIGUEROA,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n              COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO, ET AL.,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n        [Hon. Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Angel L.

After a thorough review of the record and of\n\nthe parties' submissions, we affirm.    Because appellant failed to\n\nargue below that her Complaint did not include a claim under the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (\"ADA\"),\n\nthe argument is forfeited.    See Plumley v. Southern Container,\n\nInc., 303 F.3d 364, 372 n. 7 (1st Cir. 2002) (arguments raised for\n\nthe first time on appeal are forfeited).    Whether the complainant\n\ndid attempt to state an ADA claim was surely debatable, but the\n\ntime and place for that debate in the first instance was in the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n          In addition, appellant has failed adequately to argue\n\nthat she has a viable ADA claim.      Under the rule established in\n\nBoard of Trustees v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 373-74 (2001), no cause\n\nof action under the ADA for money damages can lie against the\n\nCommonwealth, the Department of Education, or appellee Fajardo in\n\nhis official capacity.   See 28 U.S.C. § 2111.   Finally, we do not\n\naddress whether a cause of action could lie against appellee\n\nFajardo in his individual capacity, as appellant has not argued the\n\nmatter and hence it has been forfeited.    See Plumley, 303 F.3d at\n\n372 n. 7 (argument not raised in appellate brief is forfeited).\n\nThis seems especially appropriate where the appellees addressed the\n\nissue in detail in their appellate brief, yet appellant chose not\n\nto file a reply brief.\n\n          Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f",
