Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                      Howard, Circuit Judge,\n                 Carter,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Gael Mahony, for appellant.\n     Jose A. Ruiz, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nH. S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Nelson Perez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                          April 22, 2005\n\n\n\n\n*\n Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.\n\f      CARTER,       Senior    District     Judge.       Defendant         Liborio       Ruben\n\nCaro-Muñiz (hereinafter “Caro”) appeals from a judgment of the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\nconvicting him, after a jury trial, of six counts of bribery, in\n\nviolation      of    18   U.S.C.    §    666(a)(1)(B),        one    count       of     money\n\nlaundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), and one\n\ncount     of    witness      tampering,     in   violation          of    18     U.S.C.     §\n\n1512(b)(1).         In this appeal, Caro makes two challenges to his\n\nconvictions and one challenge to his sentence.                      First, he asserts\n\nthat the federal bribery statute is unconstitutional as applied\n\nto the facts of this case.                Second, Caro assigns error to the\n\ndistrict court’s failure to conduct an in camera review of tape\nrecordings made by a government informant during the course of\n\nthe     federal     investigation.          Finally,     Caro       claims       that     the\n\ndistrict       court      erred     in     its   application             of     sentencing\n\nenhancements under the federal sentencing guidelines.1                             For the\n\nreasons set forth below, we will affirm Caro’s conviction on all\n\ncounts and remand the case for re-sentencing in light of the\n\ndistrict       court’s     error,       agreed   upon    by     both          parties,    in\n\ncalculating Caro’s Adjusted Total Offense Level.\n\n\n1\n Following oral argument, Caro filed a letter with the court\npursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 28j, in which he asks the court to\nexamine his sentence in light of the United States Supreme\nCourt’s decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n(2005). Because the parties agree that the district court erred\nin determining Caro’s sentence, and because we vacate his\nsentence and remand the case to the district court for re-\nsentencing, we do not reach any Booker related issues.\n\n                                           -2-\n\f                                            I.\n\n        Because     this    appeal    follows     a   conviction,       we    recite   the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to the verdict.                             See United\n\nStates    v.    Fazal-Ur-Raheman-Fazal,            355    F.3d   40,    42     (1st    Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n        During the years 1999 and 2000, Caro served as the mayor of\n\nthe Municipality of Rincón, Puerto Rico.                   Rincón received federal\n\nfunds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in excess of\n\n$10,000 during the calendar years 1999 and 2000.\n\n        In 1999, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter\n\n“FBI”)     commenced        an   investigation        relating     to    the    possible\n\nsolicitation        of     bribes    by   public      officials.        Caro     was    one\n\nofficial targeted by the investigation.                     In furtherance of its\n\ninvestigation, the FBI utilized a paid informant, José Calderón,\n\nwho was an engineer in the business of providing engineering\n\nservices to Puerto Rican municipalities.                    Calderón was equipped\n\nwith audio and video recording equipment, which he used to record\n\nconversations with municipal mayors.                   As a result of Calderón’s\n\nactivities as an informant, the FBI accumulated 140 tapes of\n\nconversations between Calderón and public officials -- including\n\nCaro.\n\n        Calderón and Caro met multiple times during 1999 and 2000 to\n\ndiscuss    municipal        construction     projects      in    Rincón.        At    these\n\nmeetings,      or    shortly     thereafter,       Caro    solicited         bribes    from\n\nCalderón       in   connection       with    awarding       government         contracts.\n\nSpecifically, Caro solicited bribes for the preparation of two of\n\n                                            -3-\n\ffour phases of a territorial allocation plan and the contract for\n\nthe design of a floodlight tower for a municipal sports complex.\n\nThe   record        does   not    support   a     finding     that   the   territorial\n\nallocation plan or the floodlight tower were funded with federal\n\nmonies.\n\n      At   an       August   18,    2000,   meeting      at    the   mayor’s   office,\n\nCalderón informed Caro that the cost of preparing the floodlight\n\ntowers would be $15,000.             Caro responded by requesting $5000 for\n\nawarding the contract.              Caro received this $5000 payment from\n\nCalderón on August 29, 2000.                    In early September 2002, Caro\n\nsolicited       a    bribe   in    the   amount     of   $3000   from      Calderón   in\n\nconnection with the contract for the territorial allocation plan.\n\nThis bribe was paid in cash.\n\n      Caro subsequently used $3000 of the bribe proceeds to pay an\n\ninvoice at a print shop related to his purchase of political\n\nmaterials for his reelection campaign.                   Caro also represented on\n\nhis Puerto Rico Elections Commission reports that the payments\n\nreceived from Calderón were political contributions to his 2000\n\nreelection campaign.\n\n      As a result of the FBI investigation, a federal grand jury\n\nreturned a ten count superseding indictment charging Caro with\n\nsolicitation of bribes (counts I-VI), extortion (counts VII and\n\nVIII), money laundering (count IX), and witness tampering (count\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\f    X).2    Following a twelve day trial, a jury convicted Caro of\n\ncounts I-VI, IX, and X.         The district court sentenced Caro to a\n\nterm of imprisonment totaling seventy-two months and a three-year\n\nterm of supervised release.       This appeal followed.\n                                     II.\n\n       Caro’s        first   challenge     on   appeal    concerns   the\n\nconstitutionality of the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n666.       The federal bribery statute provides in relevant part:\n\n       (a)   Whoever,  if   the   circumstance      described   in\n       subsection (b) of this section exists--\n\n               (1) being an agent of an organization, or of a\n               State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any\n               agency thereof--\n\n               ...\n\n                     (B) corruptly solicits or demands for the\n                     benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees\n                     to accept, anything of value from any person,\n                     intending to be influenced or rewarded in\n                     connection with any business, transaction, or\n                     series of transactions of such organization,\n\n\n2\n The witness tampering count arose from Caro’s false representations\nto the Elections Commission. 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b) provides that:\n       Whoever knowingly uses intimidation, threatens or corruptly\n       persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in\n       misleading conduct toward another person, with intent\n       to--\n\n               (1) influence, delay or prevent the testimony of any\n               person in an official proceeding;\n\n               ...\n\n       shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than\n       ten years, or both.\n\nId.\n\n                                  -5-\n\f                   government, or agency involving any thing of\n                   value of $5,000 or more;\n\n            ...\n\n      shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more\n      than ten years, or both.\n\n      (b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a) of\n      this section is that the organization, government, or\n      agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in\n      excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a\n      grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance,\n      or other form of Federal assistance.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 666.      Caro does not dispute that the Municipality of\n\nRincón received more than $10,000 in federal funds during the\n\nrelevant period, or that the value of the alleged bribery in this\n\ncase exceeded $5000.        Instead, Caro asserts that section 666\n\n“cannot    constitutionally   be    applied    in    his   case,   because   the\n\ncriminalization      of   alleged    bribery        transactions      that   are\n\nunconnected to federal funds or a federally funded program is not\n\na necessary or proper means of furthering Congress’s legitimate\n\ninterest in protecting federal funds.”              Brief for Appellant at\n\n10.\n\n      We review challenges to the constitutionality of a statute\n\nde novo.     See Planned Parenthood v. Heed, 390 F.3d 53, 57 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).       In Sabri v. United States, 124 S. Ct. 1941 (2004),\n\nthe United States Supreme Court held that section 666 was not an\n\nunconstitutional exercise of congressional authority under the\n\nSpending Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 1, or the Necessary\n\nand Proper Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 18.                Sabri, 124\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fS. Ct. at 1942-43.       Specifically, the Court stated:\n\n       It is true ... that not every bribe or kickback offered\n       or paid to agents of governments covered by § 666(b)\n       will be traceably skimmed from specific federal\n       payments, or show up in the guise of a quid pro quo for\n       some dereliction in spending a federal grant. But this\n       possibility portends no enforcement beyond the scope of\n       federal interest, for the reason that corruption does\n       not have to be that limited to affect the federal\n       interest.   Money is fungible, bribed officials are\n       untrustworthy stewards of federal funds, and corrupt\n       contractors do not deliver dollar-for-dollar value.\n       Liquidity is not a financial term for nothing; money\n       can be drained off here because a federal grant is\n       pouring in there. And officials are not any the less\n       threatening to the objects behind federal spending just\n       because they may accept general retainers.       It is\n       certainly enough that the statutes condition the\n       offense on a threshold amount of federal dollars\n       defining the federal interest, such as that provided\n       here, and on a bribe that goes well beyond liquor and\n       cigars.\n\nId. at 1946 (internal citations omitted).                       Caro suggests a narrow\n\nreading   of    Sabri,    whereby   we    would          view    the   Supreme     Court’s\n\ndecision as only standing for the proposition that section 666 is\n\nfacially valid.         Under this interpretation, Caro suggests that\n\nthis    court     may     entertain      as-applied              challenges       to        the\n\nconstitutionality        of   section    666        in    instances       where    it        is\nestablished     that     there   exists        no    direct        connection      between\n\ncharged bribery payments and federal funds.                            We decline this\n\ninvitation.\n\n       This    court    has   previously        rejected          a    challenge       to    a\n\nconviction under section 666 in which the defendants contended\n\nthat there was an insufficient connection between their conduct\n\nand federal funds received by a municipal police department.                                See\nUnited States v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71, 96 (1st Cir. 2004).                                   The\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fdistrict court in Cianci instructed the jury -- without objection\n\n-- that a connection between the alleged bribe and federal funds\n\nwas   necessary.      Id.    at   96-97.     On   appeal,    the    Cianci     panel\n\nconcluded that the application of United States v. Zanghi, 189\n\nF.3d 71 (1st Cir. 1999), requires the court to “disregard the\n\nnexus instruction upon which Corrente and Autiello base their\n\nsufficiency challenges to their joint federal bribery conspiracy\n\nconvictions.”      Cianci, 378 F.3d at 97.3        Because the Cianci panel\n\nconcluded that the nexus instruction was erroneous in light of\n\nSabri,   the    panel   affirmed      the    appellants’         convictions    and\n\nimplicitly     held   that    a   nexus    requirement      is    unnecessary    in\n\noffenses charged under section 666.\n\n      Caro argues that the Cianci panel misapplied Sabri insofar\n\nas the panel purportedly overlooked the fact that the Supreme\n\nCourt held in Sabri that section 666 was valid on its face, but\n\nsubject to as-applied challenges.             In support of his position\n\nthat an as-applied challenge to section 666 may be entertained on\n\nappeal, Caro cites United States v. Zwick, 199 F.3d 672 (3d Cir.\n1999), and United States v. Santopietro, 166 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.\n1999), both of which suggest a nexus between the charged bribery\n\nand specific federal funds received by a municipality must be\n\nestablished to support a conviction under section 666.                   However,\n\n\n3\n The Cianci panel stated that the rule of Zanghi was “an\nunchallenged jury instruction that is faithful to the indictment\nand ‘not patently incorrect or internally inconsistent’ becomes the\nstandard by which evidentiary sufficiency is to be measured.”\nCianci, 378 F.3d at 84 (quoting United States v. Gomes, 969 F.2d\n1290, 1294 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n                                      -8-\n\fboth Zwick and Santopietro predated the Supreme Court’s decision\n\nin     Sabri,    and     we   find       post-Sabri     decisions      to     be      more\n\ninstructive.\n\n       In addition to this court’s holding in Cianci, our sister\n\ncircuits have also held that after Sabri, section 666 does not\n\nrequire a nexus between the alleged bribery and the receipt of\n\nfederal funds.         See United States v. Spano, No. 03-1110, 2005 WL\n\n674838, at *3 (7th Cir. Mar. 24, 2005) (“although Sabri involved\n\na     facial    constitutional        challenge       only,    the     opinion        also\n\nforecloses      the     defendants’       as-applied      challenge      ....      [T]he\n\ndistrict court was correct in finding that a nexus between the\n\ntheft/bribe and the federal funds received by the Town of Cicero\n\nwas not an element of the crimes with which the defendants were\n\ncharged”);      United    States     v.   Kranovich,     No.    03-10226,      2005     WL\n\n665254,    at    *3    (9th   Cir.    Mar.      23,   2005)    (“we   ...     hold    the\n\ngovernment was not required to establish any connection between\n\nthe    embezzled      funds   and    a    federal     interest,      apart    from    the\n\nexpress requirement in section 666(b) that the County received\nfederal    benefits      in   excess       of    $10,000”);     United       States     v.\n\nMirikitani, 380 F.3d 1223, 1225 (9th Cir. 2004) (“the Supreme\n\nCourt [in Sabri] not only held that a federal nexus was not an\n\nelement of the crime, but it held that no federal nexus must be\n\nshown at all.”).4         We now extend the implicit holding of Cianci\n\n\n\n4\n Caro points to no decisions -- nor does the court find any --\nfollowing Sabri in which a court has required proof of a nexus in\nan offense charged under section 666.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fand join our sister circuits in holding that the government is\n\nnot required to prove a nexus between the bribery charged and the\n\nmunicipality’s receipt of federal funds.5\n                                 III.\n\n     We now turn to the second issue raised on appeal: whether the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to conduct an in camera review of\n\ntape recordings as requested by Caro.       Of the 140 tapes generated\n\nby José Calderón’s work as an informant, the government disclosed\n\nonly seventy-one of these tapes to Caro prior to trial.                 Caro\n\nmoved for the production of all previously undisclosed recordings\n\non the basis that they might contain exculpatory or impeachment\n\nevidence.6   The    district   court    referred   this   motion   to   the\n\nmagistrate judge.   In her order, the magistrate judge stated:\n\n     [T]he   defense   also  filed   a   “Motion   Requesting\n     Discovery” pursuing the disclosure of approximately 71\n     audio recordings, not yet provided in discovery.     The\n     defense argues these may reveal exculpatory evidence\n     and that the government should not be the party making\n     such [a] determination.   The government claims it has\n     disclosed all tapes where defendant appears talking to\n     José Calderón and that others are not exculpatory.\n\n\n\n\n5\n Caro’s challenge to his money laundering and witness tampering\nconvictions is based upon his claim that reversal of the bribery\nconvictions would eliminate an essential element of both the money\nlaundering and witness tampering convictions, thus requiring\nvacation of these convictions. Because we affirm Caro’s bribery\nconvictions, and there being no other independent basis upon which\nCaro challenges his money laundering and witness tampering\nconvictions, we affirm those convictions as well.\n6\n Although Caro did not specifically state the legal basis for his\ndiscovery request, the Court assumes his request was made pursuant\nto Fed. R. Crim. P. 16, Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and\nGiglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972).\n\n                               -10-\n\f       The government is instructed, unless it can argue that\n       disclosure will jeopardize the case, – an investigation\n       or life of others - to arrange for ways and means in\n       which the defense can examine those other related\n       recordings.   (i.e.   probably allowing for reading of\n       transcripts ...)\n\n\nOrder of August 9, 2001, at 2.                        Caro objected to the magistrate\n\njudge’s order and specifically moved in the district court for a\n\nvacation of this order.               In an order dated February 28, 2002, the\n\ndistrict court ruled as follows:\n\n       [T]he United States will submit an affidavit sworn by\n       F.B.I. Special Agent Paul Bingham in which he avers that\n       he has listened to and received each of the recordings\n       that had not been disclosed to defendant, that he\n       represents under oath that none of them are related\n       directly or indirectly to this case, that defendant\n       Caro-Muñiz’s voice is not heard in any of them and that\n       nor [sic] is he or anyone related to the facts of this\n       case mentioned in these recordings.\n\nOrder of February 28, 2001, at 1.                        Caro did not object to this\n\norder.    Special Agent Paul Bingham submitted an affidavit pursuant\n\nto the district court’s order and upon receipt of this affidavit,\n\nthe    district       court      required       the    government      to    disclose     three\n\nrecordings where Caro’s voice is heard, six additional recordings\nthat     were       directly       or        indirectly     related         to     the   Rincón\n\ninvestigation, and transcripts of eight recordings that were not\n\ndirectly or indirectly related to the Rincón investigation.                               Order\n\nof    April     25,    2002,     at     1.      Caro’s    request      for       the   remaining\n\nrecordings was denied.                Caro did not move for reconsideration of\n\nthis order, nor did he raise again the issue at trial.\n\n       Caro     now        challenges    the     district    court’s         denial      of   his\n\nrequest       for     an    in   camera       inquiry     into   the    contents         of   the\n\n                                                -11-\n\frecordings.          The government contends that Caro has waived his\n\nright to assert this claim on appeal because he failed to preserve\n\nthe issue at trial.          We do not agree.              The district court’s order\n\non Caro’s motion constituted a final resolution of the issue.\n\nCaro had no basis upon which to believe that raising this pretrial\n\ndiscovery issue again during the course of the trial proceedings\n\nwould be met with a more favorable result.                            Cf. Fusco v. Gen.\n\nMotors Corp., 11 F.3d 259, 262-63 (1st Cir. 1993) (“where the\n\npretrial       proffer      is     adequate          and         evidence     is     excluded\n\nunconditionally        by   a    pretrial         order,    then     we     think   that    the\n\nproponent      has    preserved       the    issue         for    appeal”).         The    same\n\nrationale applies here.               Because appellant properly raised the\n\nBrady discovery issue before the district court through pretrial\nmotions, we find that the issue is properly preserved for purposes\n\nof appellate review.             With that said, we turn to the merits of\n\nCaro’s challenge.\n\n       We review the district court’s determinations under Rule 16,\n\nBrady, and Giglio for abuse of discretion.                          See United States v.\nRosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d 48, 55 (1st Cir. 1999).                            At the outset,\n\nwe    note    that    methods    of   enforcing        disclosure           requirements    in\n\ncriminal trials are generally left to the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt.       See United States v. Valera, 845 F.2d 923, 927 (11th Cir.\n1988).\n\n       The United States Supreme Court’s holding in Brady requires\n\nthe    government      to   disclose        any    exculpatory        evidence      which   is\n\n“material either to guilt or to punishment.”                          Brady, 373 U.S. at\n\n                                             -12-\n\f87.     “Information is material if there is a reasonable probability\n\nthat, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result\n\nof the proceeding would have been different.\"                 Rosario-Peralta,\n\n175   F.3d    at    53    (internal    quotation   and   punctuation   omitted).\n\nHowever, “[a] defendant’s right to discover exculpatory evidence\n\ndoes not include the unsupervised authority to search through the\n\n[government's] files.”           Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 59\n\n(1987).      Similarly, Brady does not permit a defendant “to conduct\n\nan in camera fishing expedition through the government's files\n\n....”     United States v. Pou, 953 F.2d 363, 367 (8th Cir. 1992).\nIndeed, “[t]here is no general constitutional right to discovery\n\nin a criminal case, and Brady did not create one.”              Weatherford v.\n\nBursey,    429     U.S.   545,   559   (1977).     Instead,   “to   establish   a\n\nviolation of Brady, a defendant must provide the court with some\n\nindication that the materials to which he ... needs access contain\n\nmaterial and potentially exculpatory evidence.”               United States v.\n\nBrandon, 17 F.3d 409, 456 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n      In support of his position that the district court erred in\nfailing to conduct an in camera inspection of the tapes, Caro\nrelies on this court’s decision in Rosario-Peralta.                 In Rosario-\n\nParalta, we held that the district court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it refused to review central communication records and tapes\n\nrelated to the pursuit of defendants’ alleged drug-transporting\n\nvessel.      Rosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d at 54.            The defendants argued\n\nthat disclosure of these materials was essential to their theory\n\nthat their boat could not have traveled from the location where\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fbales of cocaine were dumped in the ocean to the location where\n\nthe    defendants’            vessel      was    intercepted       during      the    time    frame\n\nsuggested by the government.                         Id. at 55.        The defendants alleged\n\nthat       the       records       and   tapes       requested     in     discovery     contained\n\nevidence that law enforcement lost sight of the vessel during its\n\npursuit.             Id.    at     54.        This    court     held    that   “[i]n    light     of\n\ndefendants’ theory of the case, and in light of the fact that the\n\ngovernment does not dispute that the logs contain the seemingly\n\nrelevant times and locations of the units in the area, we find\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion in finding the logs\n\nto    be    irrelevant             without     first        reviewing    them.”       Id.    at   55\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       This          case   is     easily     distinguishable.            Caro    has   presented\n\nneither          a     theory        regarding         the      existence      of     potentially\n\nexculpatory evidence on the tapes, nor has he made any showing\n\nthat the tapes would be of substantial assistance to his defense.\n\nHis    discovery            request      to    the    district     court    only     stated   that\n\n“[t]he recordings not provided in discovery may contain evidence\nthat exculpates the defendant.”                         Motion Requesting Discovery, at\n\n2.     This is insufficient to warrant an in camera review of the\ntapes.       Caro’s request that seventy-one tape recordings containing\n\nhours of dialogue be reviewed by the district court is hardly\n\nparticularized.              This is precisely the type of fishing expedition\n\nthat Brady does not permit.                     Caro identified no particular tape of\n\nspecific interest and has provided no basis for this court to\n\nconclude         that        any     recording        contained         potentially     favorable\n\n\n                                                     -14-\n\fevidence.       In the absence of a particularized and focused request,\n\nthe district court is not required to troll through voluminous\n\nrecordings in search of potentially exculpatory evidence.\n\n        When a defendant fails to present a narrowly tailored and\n\nspecific request, Brady places the burden of disclosing evidence\n\nfavorable to the defendant on the government, not on the court.\n\nSee    Ritchie,    480    U.S.     at    59    (“In     the    typical      case    where   a\n\ndefendant makes only a general request for exculpatory material\n\nunder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), it is the State that\n\ndecides    which    information         must     be    disclosed.          Unless    defense\n\ncounsel becomes aware that other exculpatory evidence was withheld\n\nand brings it to the court’s attention, the prosecutor’s decision\n\non disclosure is final.”); cf. United States v. Brooks, 966 F.2d\n1500,     1505    (D.C.     Cir.    1992)        (“Although          the   defendant     has\n\npinpointed       specific   files,        he     has   not     identified     exculpatory\n\nevidence [that the prosecution] withheld, so the case calls for\n\nthe     usual    prosecutorial          rather       than     judicial     examination.”)\n\n(internal citation and punctuation omitted).                      Furthermore, “if the\ngovernment does fail to disclose Brady material, the defendant has\na     constitutional      remedy        for    the     nondisclosure        only    if   the\n\ndefendant can show that there is a reasonable probability that\n\n‘the omission deprived the defendant of a fair trial.’”                               United\n\nStates v. Presser, 844 F.2d 1275, 1282 (6th Cir. 1988) (quoting\n\nUnited    States    v.    Agurs,        427    U.S.    97,     108    (1976))      (internal\n\ncitations omitted).          Without a specific reference to potentially\n\nexculpatory evidence, we hold that the district court did not\n\n\n                                              -15-\n\fabuse its discretion in allowing prosecutorial examination of the\n\ntapes.\n                                                IV.\n\n      Having concluded that Caro’s convictions stand, we turn now\n\nto the sentence imposed by the district court.                           Caro alleges that\n\nthe   district     court     erred         in   its     application         of   a   sentencing\n\nenhancement       pursuant       to     United         States     Sentencing         Guidelines\n\n(hereinafter “U.S.S.G.”) § 2J1.7.\n\n      We review a district court’s interpretation of the sentencing\n\nguidelines de novo.        See United States v. McLaughlin, 378 F.3d 35,\n\n38 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n      Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(c), the district court grouped\n\ntogether    the    eight   counts          upon   which       Caro    was    convicted.      In\n\naccordance with U.S.S.G. § 3D1.3, the district court determined\n\nthat the appropriate offense level is that for the most serious\n\ncounts     comprising      the        group.           The    district       court     properly\n\ndetermined that Caro’s money laundering conviction was the most\n\nserious    of     the   eight         counts.           For     sentencing       purposes,    a\nconviction in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) mandates\n\nthe application of the “offense level for the underlying offense\n\nfrom which the laundered funds were derived, if (A) the defendant\n\ncommitted the underlying offense (or would be accountable for the\n\nunderlying offense under subsection (a)(1)(A) of § 1B1.3 (Relevant\n\nConduct)).”        U.S.S.G.       §    2S1.1.           The    Base     Offense      Level   for\n\nsoliciting and receiving bribes is 10.                        The Court then applied a\n\nnumber    of    enhancements          to    the    Base       Offense       Level    under   the\n\n                                                -16-\n\fSentencing Guidelines, one of which was a three-level enhancement\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 2J1.7.7        It is the application of this enhancement\n\nunder § 2J1.7 that Caro contests.           Caro alleges that the district\n\ncourt erroneously applied the enhancement to the money laundering\n\noffense when it could only properly be applied to the witness\n\ntampering offense.        He does so because this application yielded an\n\nAdjusted Total Offense Level of 27 instead of 24.\n\n        The Government agrees that the district court’s application\n\nof the § 2J1.7 enhancement was erroneous.\n\n        The United States concedes that the district court erred\n        at sentencing.    The court improperly applied a three-\n        level   enhancement   under   United  States  Sentencing\n        Guidelines § 2J1.7.     Section 2J1.7 requires that the\n        three-level enhancement be only applied [to] the offense\n        committed on release.       In this case, the witness\n        tampering offense was the only offense committed on\n        release.   The sentencing court improperly applied the\n        three-level enhancement to the money laundering offense\n        which had been determined to be the highest offense\n        following United States Sentencing Guidelines § 3D1.2.\n        Therefore, Caro’s case should be remanded for re-\n        sentencing.\n\nBrief    for   Appellee    at   14-15.   The   position   so   expressed   is\n\nsupported by the case of United States v. Bahhur, 200 F.3d 917\n(6th Cir. 2000).          We have carefully considered the sentencing\n\nrecord herein and conclude that the agreed-upon position of the\n\n\n\n 7\n  U.S.S.G. § 2J1.7 reads as follows:\n\n         If an enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 applies, add 3\n         levels to the offense level for the offense committed\n         while on release as if this section were a specific\n         offence characteristic contained in the offense guideline\n         for the offense committed while on release.\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fparties is correct and that the § 2J1.7 enhancement was improperly\n\napplied,   to   the   prejudice   of    the   appellant,   and     improperly\n\ninflated the Adjusted Total Offense Level.          The sentence must be\n\nvacated as erroneous.\n                                   V.\n\n      For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Caro’s convictions\n\non all counts.     We vacate Caro’s sentence and remand the case to\n\nthe district court for re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\nAll   issues    concerning   application      of   the   present    advisory\nguideline regime, post United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005), remain open for resolution in the district court on re-\n\nsentencing.\n\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f",

In this appeal, Caro makes two challenges to his convictions and one challenge to his sentence. First, he asserts that the federal bribery statute is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case. Second, Caro assigns error to the district court's failure to conduct an <i>in camera</i> review of tape recordings made by a government informant during the course of the federal investigation. Finally, Caro claims that the district court erred in its application of sentencing enhancements under the federal sentencing guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm Caro's conviction on all counts and remand the case for re-sentencing in light of the district court's error, agreed upon by both parties, in calculating Caro's Adjusted Total Offense Level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this appeal follows a conviction, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See United States v.

Rinc&#243;n received federal funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in excess of $10,000 during the calendar years 1999 and 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter \"FBI\") commenced an investigation relating to the possible solicitation of bribes by public officials. Caro was one official targeted by the investigation. In furtherance of its investigation, the FBI utilized a paid informant, Jos&#233; Calder&#243;n, who was an engineer in the business of providing engineering services to Puerto Rican municipalities. Calder&#243;n was equipped with audio and video recording equipment, which he used to record conversations with municipal mayors. As a result of Calder&#243;n's activities as an informant, the FBI accumulated 140 tapes of conversations between Calder&#243;n and public officials&#8212;including Caro.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calder&#243;n and Caro met multiple times during 1999 and 2000 to discuss municipal construction projects in Rinc&#243;n. At these meetings, or shortly thereafter, Caro solicited bribes from Calder&#243;n in connection with awarding government contracts. Specifically, Caro solicited bribes for the preparation of two of four phases of a territorial allocation plan and the contract for the design of a floodlight tower for a municipal sports complex. The record does not support a finding that the territorial allocation plan or the floodlight tower were funded with federal monies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At an August 18, 2000, meeting at the mayor's office, Calder&#243;n informed Caro that the cost of preparing the floodlight towers would be $15,000. Caro responded by requesting $5000 for awarding the contract. Caro received this $5000 payment from Calder&#243;n on August 29, 2000. In early September 2002, Caro solicited a bribe in the amount of $3000 from Calder&#243;n in connection with the contract for the territorial allocation plan. This bribe was paid in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caro subsequently used $3000 of the bribe proceeds to pay an invoice at a print shop related to his purchase of political materials for his reelection campaign. Caro also represented on his Puerto Rico Elections Commission reports that the payments received from Calder&#243;n were political contributions to his 2000 reelection campaign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the FBI investigation, a federal grand jury returned a ten count superseding indictment charging Caro with solicitation of bribes (counts I-VI), extortion (counts VII and VIII), money laundering (count IX), and witness tampering (count X).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Following a twelve day trial, a jury convicted Caro of counts I-VI, IX, and X. The district court sentenced Caro to a term of imprisonment totaling seventy-two months and a three-year term of supervised release.

The federal bribery statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in subsection (b) of this section exists&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) being an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving any thing of value of $5,000 or more;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. (b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a) of this section is that the organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 666. Caro does not dispute that the Municipality of Rinc&#243;n received more than $10,000 in federal funds during the relevant period, or that the value of the alleged bribery in this case exceeded $5000. Instead, Caro asserts that section 666 \"cannot constitutionally be applied in his case, because the criminalization of alleged bribery transactions that are unconnected to federal funds or a federally funded program is not a necessary or proper means of furthering Congress's legitimate interest in protecting federal funds.\" Brief for Appellant at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review challenges to the constitutionality of a statute <i>de novo. See Planned Parenthood v. Heed,</i> 390 F.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir.2004). In <i>Sabri v. United States,</i> 541 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 1941, 158 L.Ed.2d 891 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held that section 666 was not an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority under the Spending Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 1, or the Necessary and Proper Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 18. <i>Sabri,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1942-43. Specifically, the Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true ... that not every bribe or kickback offered or paid to agents of governments covered by &#167; 666(b) will be traceably skimmed from specific federal payments, or show up in the guise of a <i>quid pro quo</i> for some dereliction in spending a federal grant. But this possibility portends no enforcement beyond the scope of federal interest, for the reason that corruption does not have to be that limited to affect the federal interest. Money is fungible, bribed officials are untrustworthy stewards of federal funds, and corrupt contractors do not deliver dollar-for-dollar value. Liquidity is not a financial term for nothing; money can be drained off here because a federal grant is pouring in there. And officials are not any the less threatening to the objects behind federal spending just because they may accept general retainers. It is certainly enough that the statutes condition the offense on a threshold amount of federal dollars defining the federal interest, such as that provided here, and on a bribe that goes well beyond liquor and cigars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1946 (internal citations omitted). Caro suggests a narrow reading of <i>Sabri,</i> whereby we would view the Supreme Court's decision as only standing for the proposition that section 666 is facially valid. Under this interpretation, Caro suggests that this court may entertain as-applied challenges to the constitutionality of section 666 in instances where it is established that there exists no direct connection between charged bribery payments and federal funds. We decline this invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has previously rejected a challenge to a conviction under section 666 in which the defendants contended that there was an insufficient connection between their conduct and federal funds received by a municipal police department. <i>See United States v. Cianci,</i> 378 F.3d 71, 96 (1st Cir.2004). The district court in <i>Cianci</i> instructed the jury&#8212;without objection&#8212;that a connection between the alleged bribe and federal funds was necessary. <i>Id.</i> at 96-97. On appeal, the <i>Cianci</i> panel concluded that the application of <i>United States v. Zanghi,</i> 189 F.3d 71 (1st Cir.1999), requires the court to \"disregard the nexus instruction upon which Corrente and Autiello base their sufficiency challenges to their joint federal bribery conspiracy convictions.\" <i>Cianci,</i> 378 F.3d at 97.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because the <i>Cianci</i> panel concluded that the nexus instruction was erroneous in light of <i>Sabri,</i> the panel affirmed the appellants' convictions and implicitly held that a nexus requirement is unnecessary in offenses charged under section 666.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caro argues that the <i>Cianci</i> panel misapplied <i>Sabri</i> insofar as the panel purportedly overlooked the fact that the Supreme Court held in <i>Sabri</i> that section 666 was valid on its face, but subject to as-applied challenges. In support of his position that an as-applied challenge to section 666 may be entertained on appeal, Caro cites <i>United States v. Zwick,</i> 199 F.3d 672 (3d Cir.1999), and <i>United States v. Santopietro,</i> 166 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.1999), both of which suggest a nexus between the charged bribery and specific federal funds received by a municipality must be established to support a conviction under section 666. However, both <i>Zwick</i> and <i>Santopietro</i> predated the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Sabri,</i> and we find post-<i>Sabri</i> decisions to be more instructive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to this court's holding in <i>Cianci,</i> our sister circuits have also held that after <i>Sabri,</i> section 666 does not require a nexus between the alleged bribery and the receipt of federal funds. <i>See United States v. Spano,</i> 401 F.3d 837, 841 (7th Cir.2005) (\"although <i>Sabri</i> involved a facial constitutional challenge only, the opinion also forecloses the defendants' as-applied challenge.... [T]he district court was correct in finding that a nexus between the theft/bribe and the federal funds received by the Town of Cicero was not an element of the crimes with which the defendants were charged\"); <i>United States v. Kranovich,</i> 401 F.3d 1107, 1111 (9th Cir.2005) (\"we ... hold the government was not required to establish any connection between the embezzled funds and a federal interest, apart from the express requirement in section 666(b) that the County received federal benefits in excess of $10,000\"); <i>United States v. Mirikitani,</i> 380 F.3d 1223, 1225 (9th Cir.2004) (\"the Supreme Court [in <i>Sabri</i>] not only held that a federal nexus was not an element of the crime, but it held that no federal nexus must be shown at all.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We now extend the implicit holding of <i>Cianci</i> and join our sister circuits in holding that the government is not required to prove a nexus between the bribery charged and the municipality's receipt of federal funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the second issue raised on appeal: whether the district court erred in failing to conduct an <i>in camera</i> review of tape recordings as requested by Caro. Of the 140 tapes generated by Jos&#233; Calder&#243;n's work as an informant, the government disclosed only seventy-one of these tapes to Caro prior to trial. Caro moved for the production of all previously undisclosed recordings on the basis that they might contain exculpatory or impeachment evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court referred this motion to the magistrate judge. In her order, the magistrate judge stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he defense also filed a \"Motion Requesting Discovery\" pursuing the disclosure of approximately 71 audio recordings, not yet provided in discovery. The defense argues these may reveal exculpatory evidence and that the government should not be the party making such [a] determination. The government claims it has disclosed all tapes where defendant appears talking to Jos&#233; Calder&#243;n and that others are not exculpatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government is instructed, unless it can argue that disclosure will jeopardize the case,&#8212;an investigation or life of others&#8212;to arrange for ways and means in which the defense can examine those other related recordings. (i.e. probably allowing for reading of transcripts ...)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Order of August 9, 2001, at 2. Caro objected to the magistrate judge's order and specifically moved in the district court for a vacation of this order. In an order dated February 28, 2002, the district court ruled as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he United States will submit an affidavit sworn by F.B.I. Special Agent Paul Bingham in which he avers that he has listened to and received each of the recordings that had not been disclosed to defendant, that he represents under oath that none of them are related directly or indirectly to this case, that defendant Caro-Mu&#241;iz's voice is not heard in any of them and that nor [sic] is he or anyone related to the facts of this case mentioned in these recordings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Order of February 28, 2001, at 1. Caro did not object to this order. Special Agent Paul Bingham submitted an affidavit pursuant to the district court's order and upon receipt of this affidavit, the district court required the government to disclose three recordings where Caro's voice is heard, six additional recordings that were directly or indirectly related to the Rinc&#243;n investigation, and transcripts of eight recordings that were not directly or indirectly related to the Rinc&#243;n investigation. Order of April 25, 2002, at 1. Caro's request for the remaining recordings was denied. Caro did not move for reconsideration of this order, nor did he raise again the issue at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caro now challenges the district court's denial of his request for an <i>in camera</i> inquiry into the contents of the recordings. The government contends that Caro has waived his right to assert this claim on appeal because he failed to preserve the issue at trial. We do not agree. The district court's order on Caro's motion constituted a final resolution of the issue. Caro had no basis upon which to believe that raising this pretrial discovery issue again during the course of the trial proceedings would be met with a more favorable result. <i>Cf. Fusco v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 11 F.3d 259, 262-63 (1st Cir.1993) (\"where the pretrial proffer is adequate and evidence is excluded unconditionally by a pretrial order, then we think that the proponent has preserved the issue for appeal\"). The same rationale applies here. Because appellant properly raised the <i>Brady</i> discovery issue before the district court through pretrial motions, we find that the issue is properly preserved for purposes of appellate review. With that said, we turn to the merits of Caro's challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's determinations under Rule 16, <i>Brady,</i> and <i>Giglio</i> for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d 48, 55 (1st Cir.1999). At the outset, we note that methods of enforcing disclosure requirements in criminal trials are generally left to the discretion of the trial court. <i>See United States v. Valera,</i> 845 F.2d 923, 927 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Supreme Court's holding in <i>Brady</i> requires the government to disclose any exculpatory evidence which is \"material either to guilt or to punishment.\" <i>Brady,</i> 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. \"Information is material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d at 53 (internal quotation and punctuation omitted). However, \"[a] defendant's right to discover exculpatory evidence does not include the unsupervised authority to search through the [government's] files.\" <i>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. 39, 59, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987). Similarly, <i>Brady</i> does not permit a defendant \"to conduct an <i>in camera</i> fishing expedition through the government's files....\" <i>United States v. Pou,</i> 953 F.2d 363, 367 (8th Cir.1992). Indeed, \"[t]here is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and <i>Brady</i> did not create one.\" <i>Weatherford v. Bursey,</i> 429 U.S. 545, 559, 97 S.Ct. 837, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977). Instead, \"to establish a violation of <i>Brady,</i> a defendant must provide the court with some indication that the materials to which he ... needs access contain material and potentially exculpatory evidence.\" <i>United States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 456 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his position that the district court erred in failing to conduct an <i>in camera</i> inspection of the tapes, Caro relies on this court's decision in <i>Rosario-Peralta.</i> In <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> we held that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to review central communication records and tapes related to the pursuit of defendants' alleged drug-transporting vessel. <i>Rosario-Peralta,</i> 175 F.3d at 54. The defendants argued that disclosure of these materials was essential to their theory that their boat could not have traveled from the location where bales of cocaine were dumped in the ocean to the location where the defendants' vessel was intercepted during the time frame suggested by the government. <i>Id.</i> at 55. The defendants alleged that the records and tapes requested in discovery contained evidence that law enforcement lost sight of the vessel during its pursuit. <i>Id.</i> at 54. This court held that \"[i]n light of defendants' theory of the case, and <i>in light of the fact that the government does not dispute that the logs contain the seemingly relevant times and locations of the units in the area,</i> we find that the district court abused its discretion in finding the logs to be irrelevant without first reviewing them.\" <i>Id.</i> at 55 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is easily distinguishable. Caro has presented neither a theory regarding the existence of potentially exculpatory evidence on the tapes, nor has he made any showing that the tapes would be of substantial assistance to his defense. His discovery request to the district court only stated that \"[t]he recordings not provided in discovery <i>may</i> contain evidence that exculpates the defendant.\" Motion Requesting Discovery, at 2. This is insufficient to warrant an <i>in camera</i> review of the tapes. Caro's request that seventy-one tape recordings containing hours of dialogue be reviewed by the district court is hardly particularized. This is precisely the type of fishing expedition that <i>Brady</i> does not permit. Caro identified no particular tape of specific interest and has provided no basis for this court to conclude that any recording contained potentially favorable evidence. In the absence of a particularized and focused request, the district court is not required to troll through voluminous recordings in search of potentially exculpatory evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant fails to present a narrowly tailored and specific request, <i>Brady</i> places the burden of disclosing evidence favorable to the defendant on the government, not on the court. <i>See Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. at 59, 107 S.Ct. 989 (\"In the typical case where a defendant makes only a general request for exculpatory material under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), it is the State that decides which information must be disclosed. Unless defense counsel becomes aware that other exculpatory evidence was withheld and brings it to the court's attention, the prosecutor's decision on disclosure is final.\"); <i>cf. United States v. Brooks,</i> 966 F.2d 1500, 1505 (D.C.Cir.1992) (\"Although the defendant has pinpointed specific files, he has not identified exculpatory evidence [that the prosecution] withheld, so the case calls for the usual prosecutorial rather than judicial examination.\") (internal citation and punctuation omitted). Furthermore, \"if the government does fail to disclose <i>Brady</i> material, the defendant has a constitutional remedy for the nondisclosure only if the defendant can show that there is a reasonable probability that `the omission deprived the defendant of a fair trial.'\" <i>United States v. Presser,</i> 844 F.2d 1275, 1282 (6th Cir.1988) (quoting <i>United States v. Agurs,</i> 427 U.S. 97, 108, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976)) (internal citations omitted). Without a specific reference to potentially exculpatory evidence, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing prosecutorial examination of the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that Caro's convictions stand, we turn now to the sentence imposed by the district court. Caro alleges that the district court erred in its application of a sentencing enhancement pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines (hereinafter \"U.S.S.G.\") &#167; 2J1.7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <i>de novo. See United States v. McLaughlin,</i> 378 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(c), the district court grouped together the eight counts upon which Caro was convicted. In accordance with U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.3, the district court determined that the appropriate offense level is that for the most serious counts comprising the group. The district court properly determined that Caro's money laundering conviction was the most serious of the eight counts. For sentencing purposes, a conviction in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) mandates the application of the \"offense level for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived, if (A) the defendant committed the underlying offense (or would be accountable for the underlying offense under subsection (a)(1)(A) of &#167; 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)).\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1. The Base Offense Level for soliciting and receiving bribes is 10. The Court then applied a number of enhancements to the Base Offense Level under the Sentencing Guidelines, one of which was a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> It is the application of this enhancement under &#167; 2J1.7 that Caro contests. Caro alleges that the district court erroneously applied the enhancement to the money laundering offense when it could only properly be applied to the witness tampering offense. He does so because this application yielded an Adjusted Total Offense Level of 27 instead of 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government agrees that the district court's application of the &#167; 2J1.7 enhancement was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States concedes that the district court erred at sentencing. The court improperly applied a three-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines &#167; 2J1.7. Section 2J1.7 requires that the three-level enhancement be only applied [to] the offense committed on release. In this case, the witness tampering offense was the only offense committed on release. The sentencing court improperly applied the three-level enhancement to the money laundering offense which had been determined to be the highest offense following United States Sentencing Guidelines &#167; 3D1.2. Therefore, Caro's case should be remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brief for Appellee at 14-15. The position so expressed is supported by the case of <i>United States v. Bahhur,</i> 200 F.3d 917 (6th Cir.2000). We have carefully considered the sentencing record herein and conclude that the agreed-upon position of the parties is correct and that the &#167; 2J1.7 enhancement was improperly applied, to the prejudice of the appellant, and improperly inflated the Adjusted Total Offense Level.

In this appeal, Caro makes two challenges to his convictions and one challenge to his sentence. First, he asserts that the federal bribery statute is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case. Second, Caro assigns error to the district court's failure to conduct an <i>in camera</i> review of tape recordings made by a government informant during the course of the federal investigation. Finally, Caro claims that the district court erred in its application of sentencing enhancements under the federal sentencing guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm Caro's conviction on all counts and remand the case for re-sentencing in light of the district court's error, agreed upon by both parties, in calculating Caro's Adjusted Total Offense Level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this appeal follows a conviction, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>See United States v.

Rinc&#243;n received federal funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in excess of $10,000 during the calendar years 1999 and 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter \"FBI\") commenced an investigation relating to the possible solicitation of bribes by public officials. Caro was one official targeted by the investigation. In furtherance of its investigation, the FBI utilized a paid informant, Jos&#233; Calder&#243;n, who was an engineer in the business of providing engineering services to Puerto Rican municipalities. Calder&#243;n was equipped with audio and video recording equipment, which he used to record conversations with municipal mayors. As a result of Calder&#243;n's activities as an informant, the FBI accumulated 140 tapes of conversations between Calder&#243;n and public officials&#8212;including Caro.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calder&#243;n and Caro met multiple times during 1999 and 2000 to discuss municipal construction projects in Rinc&#243;n. At these meetings, or shortly thereafter, Caro solicited bribes from Calder&#243;n in connection with awarding government contracts. Specifically, Caro solicited bribes for the preparation of two of four phases of a territorial allocation plan and the contract for the design of a floodlight tower for a municipal sports complex. The record does not support a finding that the territorial allocation plan or the floodlight tower were funded with federal monies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At an August 18, 2000, meeting at the mayor's office, Calder&#243;n informed Caro that the cost of preparing the floodlight towers would be $15,000. Caro responded by requesting $5000 for awarding the contract. Caro received this $5000 payment from Calder&#243;n on August 29, 2000. In early September 2002, Caro solicited a bribe in the amount of $3000 from Calder&#243;n in connection with the contract for the territorial allocation plan. This bribe was paid in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caro subsequently used $3000 of the bribe proceeds to pay an invoice at a print shop related to his purchase of political materials for his reelection campaign. Caro also represented on his Puerto Rico Elections Commission reports that the payments received from Calder&#243;n were political contributions to his 2000 reelection campaign.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the FBI investigation, a federal grand jury returned a ten count superseding indictment charging Caro with solicitation of bribes (counts I-VI), extortion (counts VII and VIII), money laundering (count IX), and witness tampering (count X).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Following a twelve day trial, a jury convicted Caro of counts I-VI, IX, and X. The district court sentenced Caro to a term of imprisonment totaling seventy-two months and a three-year term of supervised release.

The federal bribery statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in subsection (b) of this section exists&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) being an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving any thing of value of $5,000 or more;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. (b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a) of this section is that the organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 666. Caro does not dispute that the Municipality of Rinc&#243;n received more than $10,000 in federal funds during the relevant period, or that the value of the alleged bribery in this case exceeded $5000. Instead, Caro asserts that section 666 \"cannot constitutionally be applied in his case, because the criminalization of alleged bribery transactions that are unconnected to federal funds or a federally funded program is not a necessary or proper means of furthering Congress's legitimate interest in protecting federal funds.\" Brief for Appellant at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review challenges to the constitutionality of a statute <i>de novo.

But this possibility portends no enforcement beyond the scope of federal interest, for the reason that corruption does not have to be that limited to affect the federal interest. Money is fungible, bribed officials are untrustworthy stewards of federal funds, and corrupt contractors do not deliver dollar-for-dollar value. Liquidity is not a financial term for nothing; money can be drained off here because a federal grant is pouring in there. And officials are not any the less threatening to the objects behind federal spending just because they may accept general retainers. It is certainly enough that the statutes condition the offense on a threshold amount of federal dollars defining the federal interest, such as that provided here, and on a bribe that goes well beyond liquor and cigars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1946 (internal citations omitted). Caro suggests a narrow reading of <i>Sabri,</i> whereby we would view the Supreme Court's decision as only standing for the proposition that section 666 is facially valid. Under this interpretation, Caro suggests that this court may entertain as-applied challenges to the constitutionality of section 666 in instances where it is established that there exists no direct connection between charged bribery payments and federal funds. We decline this invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has previously rejected a challenge to a conviction under section 666 in which the defendants contended that there was an insufficient connection between their conduct and federal funds received by a municipal police department. <i>See United States v.

The district court in <i>Cianci</i> instructed the jury&#8212;without objection&#8212;that a connection between the alleged bribe and federal funds was necessary. <i>Id.</i> at 96-97. On appeal, the <i>Cianci</i> panel concluded that the application of <i>United States v.

In support of his position that an as-applied challenge to section 666 may be entertained on appeal, Caro cites <i>United States v.

Of the 140 tapes generated by Jos&#233; Calder&#243;n's work as an informant, the government disclosed only seventy-one of these tapes to Caro prior to trial. Caro moved for the production of all previously undisclosed recordings on the basis that they might contain exculpatory or impeachment evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The district court referred this motion to the magistrate judge.

Caro objected to the magistrate judge's order and specifically moved in the district court for a vacation of this order. In an order dated February 28, 2002, the district court ruled as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he United States will submit an affidavit sworn by F.B.I. Special Agent Paul Bingham in which he avers that he has listened to and received each of the recordings that had not been disclosed to defendant, that he represents under oath that none of them are related directly or indirectly to this case, that defendant Caro-Mu&#241;iz's voice is not heard in any of them and that nor [sic] is he or anyone related to the facts of this case mentioned in these recordings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Order of February 28, 2001, at 1. Caro did not object to this order. Special Agent Paul Bingham submitted an affidavit pursuant to the district court's order and upon receipt of this affidavit, the district court required the government to disclose three recordings where Caro's voice is heard, six additional recordings that were directly or indirectly related to the Rinc&#243;n investigation, and transcripts of eight recordings that were not directly or indirectly related to the Rinc&#243;n investigation. Order of April 25, 2002, at 1. Caro's request for the remaining recordings was denied. Caro did not move for reconsideration of this order, nor did he raise again the issue at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Caro now challenges the district court's denial of his request for an <i>in camera</i> inquiry into the contents of the recordings. The government contends that Caro has waived his right to assert this claim on appeal because he failed to preserve the issue at trial. We do not agree. The district court's order on Caro's motion constituted a final resolution of the issue. Caro had no basis upon which to believe that raising this pretrial discovery issue again during the course of the trial proceedings would be met with a more favorable result. <i>Cf. Fusco v. Gen.

The same rationale applies here. Because appellant properly raised the <i>Brady</i> discovery issue before the district court through pretrial motions, we find that the issue is properly preserved for purposes of appellate review.

The defendants argued that disclosure of these materials was essential to their theory that their boat could not have traveled from the location where bales of cocaine were dumped in the ocean to the location where the defendants' vessel was intercepted during the time frame suggested by the government. <i>Id.</i> at 55. The defendants alleged that the records and tapes requested in discovery contained evidence that law enforcement lost sight of the vessel during its pursuit. <i>Id.</i> at 54. This court held that \"[i]n light of defendants' theory of the case, and <i>in light of the fact that the government does not dispute that the logs contain the seemingly relevant times and locations of the units in the area,</i> we find that the district court abused its discretion in finding the logs to be irrelevant without first reviewing them.\" <i>Id.</i> at 55 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is easily distinguishable. Caro has presented neither a theory regarding the existence of potentially exculpatory evidence on the tapes, nor has he made any showing that the tapes would be of substantial assistance to his defense. His discovery request to the district court only stated that \"[t]he recordings not provided in discovery <i>may</i> contain evidence that exculpates the defendant.\" Motion Requesting Discovery, at 2. This is insufficient to warrant an <i>in camera</i> review of the tapes. Caro's request that seventy-one tape recordings containing hours of dialogue be reviewed by the district court is hardly particularized. This is precisely the type of fishing expedition that <i>Brady</i> does not permit. Caro identified no particular tape of specific interest and has provided no basis for this court to conclude that any recording contained potentially favorable evidence. In the absence of a particularized and focused request, the district court is not required to troll through voluminous recordings in search of potentially exculpatory evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant fails to present a narrowly tailored and specific request, <i>Brady</i> places the burden of disclosing evidence favorable to the defendant on the government, not on the court. <i>See Ritchie,</i> 480 U.S. at 59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111822\"><a href=\"/opinion/111822/pennsylvania-v-ritchie/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In accordance with U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.3, the district court determined that the appropriate offense level is that for the most serious counts comprising the group. The district court properly determined that Caro's money laundering conviction was the most serious of the eight counts. For sentencing purposes, a conviction in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) mandates the application of the \"offense level for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived, if (A) the defendant committed the underlying offense (or would be accountable for the underlying offense under subsection (a)(1)(A) of &#167; 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)).\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1. The Base Offense Level for soliciting and receiving bribes is 10. The Court then applied a number of enhancements to the Base Offense Level under the Sentencing Guidelines, one of which was a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2J1.7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> It is the application of this enhancement under &#167; 2J1.7 that Caro contests. Caro alleges that the district court erroneously applied the enhancement to the money laundering offense when it could only properly be applied to the witness tampering offense. He does so because this application yielded an Adjusted Total Offense Level of 27 instead of 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government agrees that the district court's application of the &#167; 2J1.7 enhancement was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States concedes that the district court erred at sentencing. The court improperly applied a three-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines &#167; 2J1.7. Section 2J1.7 requires that the three-level enhancement be only applied [to] the offense committed on release. In this case, the witness tampering offense was the only offense committed on release. The sentencing court improperly applied the three-level enhancement to the money laundering offense which had been determined to be the highest offense following United States Sentencing Guidelines &#167; 3D1.2. Therefore, Caro's case should be remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brief for Appellee at 14-15.
