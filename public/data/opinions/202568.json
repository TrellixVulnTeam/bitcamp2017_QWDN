McGinty, Federal Defender Office, for appellant.\n     Randall E. Kromm, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J.

On       June    13,   2001,   the\n\ndefendant-appellant (the \"defendant\") applied for a United States\n\npassport. Thereafter, the defendant was charged by a federal grand\n\njury in a three-count indictment with making a false statement in\n\na passport application, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1542; misuse of\n\na social security number, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B);\n\nand possession of an unlawful identification document with intent\n\nto     defraud   the    United       States,    in    violation        of    18   U.S.C.\n\n§    1028(a)(4).       After     a   two-day    trial,     a    jury    convicted    the\n\ndefendant on all three counts.\n\n              The defendant now appeals his conviction on the ground\n\nthat    the   district     court      improperly     admitted     expert      testimony\n\nidentifying the defendant as someone other than the person listed\n\non the passport application on the basis of fingerprint analysis.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we affirm the conviction because we\n\nconclude that the district court did not err in admitting the\n\nexpert testimony.\n\n                            I.       Factual Background\n\n              On June 13, 2001, a man identifying himself as Samuel\n\nOrtiz submitted an application for a United States passport (\"the\n\napplication\") at a post office in Dorchester, Massachusetts.                         The\n\napplication indicated that the applicant Samuel Ortiz was a United\n\nStates citizen born in Puerto Rico on May 24, 1963.                     The applicant\n\nsigned the name \"Samuel Ortiz\" on the application in the presence\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fof the window clerk and submitted supporting documents, including\n\na Puerto Rican birth certificate and a Massachusetts identification\n\ncard bearing the applicant's picture, both under the name \"Samuel\n\nOrtiz.\"    The clerk accepted the application and forwarded it for\n\nprocessing.\n\n            The application was reviewed at the National Passport\n\nCenter in Portsmouth, New Hampshire by a passport specialist who\n\ntestified at trial that aspects of the application led her to\n\nbelieve it was fraudulent.1           She forwarded it to a fraud program\n\nmanager    in    the   Boston   Passport      Agency.    The   program   manager\n\ntestified that she also observed indications of fraud and sent a\n\nletter to the applicant requesting additional documentation.                  She\n\nreceived    no    response,     so    she   referred     the   application    for\n\ninvestigation by the Diplomatic Security Service (\"DSS\"), a law\n\nenforcement      branch   of    the   United    States   Department   of     State\n\nresponsible for passport and visa fraud investigation.\n\n            On March 5, 2003, two DSS officers went to the address\n\nprovided on the Massachusetts identification card submitted with\n\nthe application -- an address different from the one written on the\n\napplication.       The agents identified themselves to the woman who\n\nanswered the door and, showing her the picture that had been\n\n\n1\n    The passport specialist testified that she suspected fraud\nbecause the picture identification card and the birth certificates\nsubmitted with the application were recently issued, and because\nOrtiz printed his signature, which she thought was inconsistent\nwith a Puerto Rican education.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fsubmitted with the passport application, asked to see the person\n\ndepicted in the picture.        The woman led the agents inside the\n\napartment to a man who one of the agents identified at trial as the\n\ndefendant.2     The agents questioned the man about the application\n\nand   accompanying     photograph.     The   man   denied   submitting   the\n\napplication, telling the agents that his name was Víctor Vargas\n\n(\"Vargas\") and that he was from the Dominican Republic.             Vargas\n\ngave his birth date as July 25, 1960, and provided the names of his\n\nparents.\n\n            The agents requested that Vargas provide identification.\n\nVargas responded that he did not have any with him, but that he\n\nmight have identification at his mother's house.                The agents\n\noffered    to   take   Vargas   to   his   mother's   house   to   get   the\n\nidentification, and asked if they could take his fingerprints.\n\nVargas provided two sets of fingerprints.           He then went with the\n\nagents to the address he had given as his mother's home.                 The\n\nagents found no one at that location.\n\n            An investigation revealed that the Bureau of Citizenship\n\nand Immigration Service had an alien file (\"A-file\") for Víctor\n\nVargas, born in the Dominican Republic on July 25, 1960.           The date\n\n\n\n2\n   At trial, the agent testified that during this encounter, he\nnoticed that the man they questioned had a mole on his left earlobe\nmatching that shown in the picture submitted with the passport\napplication. On cross-examination, the agent acknowledged that he\ndid not mention the identifying mole in his contemporaneous notes\nof the March 5, 2003 meeting.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fof birth and names of parents on file matched those provided by\n\nVargas to the agents in March 2003.           The A-file established that\n\nVargas had been admitted to the United States as a legal permanent\n\nresident in December 1990 and remained a legal permanent resident\n\nin June 2001, when the passport application was submitted.                 The A-\n\nfile contained an index fingerprint for Víctor Vargas.\n\n           Investigators       also    discovered       that     the     passport\n\napplication     submitted    in   June      2001     contained    four     latent\n\nfingerprints.      The   government      conducted     fingerprint       analysis\n\ncomparing the fingerprints obtained by the agents in March 2003\n\nwith the prints from Vargas's A-file and the latent prints from the\n\npassport application.       The analysis revealed that the fingerprints\n\nobtained by the agents matched both the fingerprint in Vargas' A-\n\nfile and the latent prints lifted off the passport application.\n\n           The government then brought charges against the defendant\n\non the theory that he had fraudulently submitted the passport\n\napplication under the name \"Samuel Ortiz,\" when he was really\n\nVíctor Vargas.\n\n           At trial, the defendant took the position that his name\n\nwas Samuel Ortiz and that he had submitted a truthful passport\n\napplication.      To   contradict     this,    the    government       sought   to\n\nintroduce the expert testimony of Thomas Liszkiewicz, a senior\n\nfingerprint specialist with the Department of Homeland Security\n\n(\"DHS\").   Liszkiewicz had analyzed the fingerprints at issue in\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthis case and, on the basis of that analysis, identified the\n\nindividual who submitted the passport application under the name\n\nSamuel      Ortiz   as   the   legal    permanent       resident    Víctor     Vargas.\n\nSeveral months before trial, the government notified the defendant\n\nof Liszkiewicz's proposed testimony and provided him with a report\n\nof    Liszkiewicz's       conclusions.         The    government     also    made   the\n\npassport application available to the defendant for independent\n\nanalysis.          The   defendant     did    not     request   a   hearing    on   the\n\nadmissibility of Liszkiewicz's fingerprint testimony nor did he\n\nmake any pre-trial motions with respect to Liszkiewicz's proposed\n\ntestimony.\n\n              At    trial,     Liszkiewicz       first     testified        about   his\n\nqualifications.          Liszkiewicz stated that he had been a senior\n\nfingerprint specialist at the DHS for two and a half years.                     He had\n\npreviously spent nineteen to twenty years as a fingerprint examiner\n\nfor   the    Wilmington,       Delaware      police    department.      Liszkiewicz\n\ntestified that, as part of his training while with the Delaware\n\npolice, he took courses and attended conferences on fingerprint\n\nidentification methods, including two forty-hour FBI-sponsored\n\ncourses in basic and advanced fingerprint comparison.                          He also\n\nreceived     training     as    an   intern     to    court-accepted    fingerprint\n\nexaminers in Delaware.          Liszkiewicz testified that he is certified\n\nas a fingerprint examiner in Delaware and has served there as an\n\ninstructor and trainer of fingerprint identification.                        He stated\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fthat he has also been certified by the Forensic Document Lab at the\n\nDHS. Liszkiewicz also testified that he has performed \"hundreds of\n\nthousands\" of fingerprint comparisons and provided expert testimony\n\non more than one hundred occasions.\n\n            After     Liszkiewicz     testified    about      his    background    in\n\nfingerprint analysis, the government moved to qualify Liszkiewicz\n\nas   an     expert.      The    defendant     objected        to     Liszkiewicz's\n\nqualifications.       The judge did not rule on that objection, and the\n\ndefendant    appears     to    have   reserved    the   objection      for    cross-\n\nexamination. Before allowing the prosecution to proceed, the court\n\nbriefly   addressed      the    jury,   discussing      the    court's      role   in\n\nadmitting expert testimony but also noting the jury's independent\n\nresponsibility      to   consider     \"whether    you   think       [the   expert's]\n\nqualifications are sufficient to persuade you that he can give this\n\nopinion about fingerprints in this case.\"\n\n            Liszkiewicz went on to explain certain terminology and\n\nprocedures of fingerprint identification. He described to the jury\n\nthe difference between \"inked\" prints, produced intentionally to\n\n\"reproduce\" the patterns on the fingers, and \"latent\" fingerprints,\n\nobtained from objects that a person touches.                   He described the\n\n\"analysis, comparison, evaluation and verification,\" or \"ACEV,\"\n\nmethod of fingerprint comparison he had been trained to use to\n\ndetermine whether two fingerprints were made by the same person.\n\nLiszkiewicz explained that this method requires the analyst to\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\ffirst ensure that the prints involved are sufficiently clear to\n\nobserve their characteristics, and if so, to compare the prints by\n\nlooking at both their individual characteristics and the overall\n\npattern.     The analyst looks for matching characteristics and\n\npatterns and identifies any points of difference between the\n\nprints.    An observation of at least eight matching characteristics\n\nand no unexplainable points of difference is necessary to indicate\n\nthat two prints come from the same person.                   If the reviewer\n\nbelieves a match has been identified, she submits the conclusion to\n\nanother examiner for verification.\n\n            Liszkiewicz     then   testified      to   the   comparisons      he\n\nperformed    in   the   analysis   at    issue.    First,    he   described    a\n\ncomparison of latent prints found on the passport application to\n\nthe prints obtained by the agents in March 2003.                  Of the four\n\nlatent prints found on the application, Liszkiewicz described his\n\ncomparison of two of them -- a left and right thumb print.            He used\n\n\"chalks\" of the latent and inked prints for both the left and right\n\nthumb, and marked five matching characteristics to explain to the\n\njury.     He explained that he had chosen five characteristics for\n\nillustrative purposes, but had found a larger number of points of\n\nidentity between the prints -- \"into the twenties\" with respect the\n\nleft thumb print.       He testified that he had found no points of\n\ndifference between the latent and inked fingerprints. On the basis\n\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fof his analysis, he concluded that the latent and inked thumb\n\nprints \"were made by one and the same individual.\"\n\n          Liszkiewicz further testified that he compared the index\n\nfingerprint obtained by the agents to the corresponding fingerprint\n\nin the Vargas A-file.   Liszkiewicz noted the presence of a \"tented\n\narch,\" a particularly significant characteristic because it appears\n\nin \"less than five percent, more like three to two percent of the\n\npopulation.\"    He testified that other matching characteristics for\n\nthe index finger \"were positively identified.\" On the basis of his\n\ncomparison, he testified that the two prints \"were made by one and\n\nthe same individual to the exclusion of all others.\"\n\n          The    defendant   cross-examined   Liszkiewicz   on   several\n\naspects of his testimony.     The defendant questioned him about his\n\neducational background and experience. Liszkiewicz acknowledged\n\nthat he did not have an undergraduate degree or an educational\n\nbackground in science. The defendant asked whether Liszkiewicz had\n\npreserved written notes of his analysis in this case, to which\n\nLiszkiewicz responded that, consistent with the policies of his\n\ndepartment, he had not. The defendant also asked Liszkiewicz about\n\nhis reliance on visual inspection to compare fingerprints.           In\n\nresponse, Liszkiewicz testified without objection that the visual\n\ninspection method he used was consistent with his training.         The\n\ndefendant also questioned Liszkiewicz about the quality of the\n\nprints used.    Liszkiewicz testified that while it was his usual\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fpractice to compare fingerprints using \"the best possible image\n\navailable,\" he had used a fax copy of the fingerprints from the A-\n\nfile for Vargas because it was sufficiently clear.          The defendant\n\nchallenged Liszkiewicz's reliance on eight matching characteristics\n\nto find a match in fingerprints, pointing out that other countries\n\nrequire twelve to sixteen matching characteristics.          Finally, the\n\ndefendant asked Liszkiewicz if he knew of statistical studies on\n\nthe reliability of fingerprint identification. The defendant asked\n\nspecifically    about   studies    establishing    the   \"premise\"    that\n\nfingerprints are unique, the \"relative frequencies\" of individual\n\ncharacteristics in the population, and the probability that a given\n\ngroup of characteristics might occur in multiple individuals.\n\nLiszkiewicz said that he was unable to identify specific studies\n\naddressing these points.\n\n           After   Liszkiewicz's    cross-examination,      the   defendant\n\nmoved,   without   further   explanation,   \"to   exclude   Liszkiewicz's\n\ntestimony.\"    The district court denied the motion.        A redirect and\n\nre-cross followed, after which the government rested its case.          At\n\nthis point, the defendant requested a sidebar, during which he\n\nrenewed his motion to exclude the expert testimony, stating:\n\n           Your Honor, I renew my motion to strike the\n           testimony of this witness on the grounds that\n           while he testified to common fingerprint\n           characteristics, he is without knowledge,\n           information    or    expertise   about    the\n           significance of common characteristics. That\n           is an extraordinary omission in the offering\n           of   identification   or  for  identification\n\n                                   -10-\n\f           testimony by this witness. . . . [W]ithout the\n           ability   to   testify    as  to   why   those\n           characteristics are meaningful, based on his\n           experience,   training   and  education,   his\n           testimony to the jury that there was identity\n           between those prints is without foundation,\n           would not survive any Daubert standard in the\n           world because he can't testify to whether\n           these standards of identification are based on\n           any identifiable science, are in any way\n           tested by -- in the literature.        There's\n           utterly no foundation for this.\n\nThe government responded that fingerprint identification had been\n\n\"accepted science for years in courts\" and that Liszkiewicz was a\n\nrecognized expert with relevant training and education.          The court\n\nexpressed agreement with the government's position and denied the\n\ndefendant's motion.    The defendant then moved for a judgment of\n\nacquittal \"on that ground.\"     The district court reserved a ruling\n\non the motion.   The defendant rested his case without calling any\n\nwitnesses.\n\n           In his closing argument, the defendant asked the jury to\n\ndisregard Liszkiewicz's testimony, once again attacking aspects of\n\nLiszkiewicz's    testimony:    Liszkiewicz's     ignorance   about      the\n\nfrequence of certain fingerprint characteristics in the population,\n\nhis reliance on eight matching characteristics, his method of\n\n\"eyeballing\" prints, and his lack of \"scientific\" training.          After\n\nclosing   arguments,   the    district   court   charged   the   jury   to\n\nindependently review and consider the expert testimony in light of\n\nall the evidence presented.     The jury returned a verdict of guilty\n\non all counts.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f              A week after the trial had concluded, the defendant filed\n\na written motion for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial\n\npursuant      to   Federal       Rules   of    Criminal         Procedure   29    and   33,\n\nrespectively.       The defendant argued that Liszkiewicz's testimony\n\nwas inadmissible, and for the first time in the case argued that\n\nthe expert testimony failed to satisfy the requirements of Federal\n\nRule of Evidence 702.            As support for his argument he noted, among\n\nother things, that Liszkiewicz did not memorialize his fingerprint\n\ncomparisons, that he used a faxed copy of a print for one of his\n\ncomparisons,       and    that     he    \"eyeballed\"        the      comparisons.       The\n\ndefendant      expressly     stated       that      he    was    not   challenging      the\n\nadmission of fingerprint evidence generally, limiting his Rule 702\n\nargument to the adequacy of Liszkiewicz's testimony.\n\n              The district court denied this motion, holding that\n\nLiszkiewicz        was     qualified          as     an    expert      in    fingerprint\n\nidentification, that his \"data and methodology . . . were within\n\nthe mainstream of forensic fingerprint technology,\" and that any\n\nflaws in his opinion went to the weight of the evidence, rather\n\nthan its admissibility.\n\n                                   II.    Discussion\n\n              On appeal, the defendant argues Liszkiewicz's testimony\n\nfailed   to    meet      three    criteria         required     by   Rule   702   for   the\n\nadmission of expert testimony: that a witness be \"qualified as an\n\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fexpert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\";3\n\nthat expert testimony be \"based upon sufficient facts or data\"; and\n\nthat the expert \"appl[y] the principles and methods of [fingerprint\n\nanalysis] reliably to the facts of the case.\"         Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n                     A.   Gate-keeping Under Daubert\n\n           Under Rule 702,\n\n           [i]f   scientific,    technical,    or   other\n           specialized knowledge will assist the trier of\n           fact to understand the evidence or to\n           determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified\n           as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,\n           training, or education, may testify thereto in\n           the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1)\n           the testimony is based upon sufficient facts\n           or data, (2) the testimony is the product of\n           reliable principles and methods, and (3) the\n           witness has applied the principles and methods\n           reliably to the facts of the case.\n\nId.   This rule imposes a gate-keeping role on the trial judge to\n\nensure   that   an   expert's   testimony   \"both   rests   on   a   reliable\n\nfoundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\"                 Daubert v.\n\nMerrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993); see also Kumho\n\nTire Co. v.

Expert testimony must be\n\n\n3\n    On appeal, the defendant's \"specific\" argument is that\nLiszkiewicz \"failed to meet two of the criteria for admission\nrequired by Fed. R. Evid. 702; his testimony was not based upon\nsufficient data and he had not applied the relevant methods\nreliably to the facts of the case.\"       The defendant does not\nexplicitly articulate a challenge to Liszkiewicz's qualifications,\nbut he devotes part of his brief to the argument that Liszkiewicz\n\"demonstrated little understanding of fingerprint analysis\nmethodology.\" We understand this argument to go to Liszkiewicz's\nqualifications, and we will address it as such.\n\n                                   -13-\n\freliable, such that \"the reasoning or methodology underlying the\n\ntestimony is scientifically valid and . . . that reasoning or\n\nmethodology   properly    can   be    applied    to   the   facts     in   issue.\"\n\nDaubert, 509 U.S. at 592-93.         The proffered expert testimony must\n\nalso be relevant, \"not only in the sense that all evidence must be\n\nrelevant, but also in the incremental sense that the expert's\n\nproposed opinion, if admitted, likely would assist the trier of\n\nfact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\"                Ruiz-Troche v.\n\nPepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., 161 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591-92) (citations omitted).\n\n            The inquiry under Rule 702 is a \"flexible one.\" Daubert,\n\n509 U.S. at 594.         The trial court enjoys broad latitude in\n\nexecuting   its   gate-keeping       function;    there     is   no   particular\n\nprocedure it is required to follow.         See id.    The Supreme Court has\n\nemphasized the importance of such broad latitude, noting that,\n\nwithout it, the trial court \"would lack the discretionary authority\n\nneeded both to avoid unnecessary 'reliability' proceedings in\n\nordinary cases where the reliability of an expert's methods is\n\nproperly taken for granted, and to require appropriate proceedings\n\nin the less usual or more complex cases where cause for questioning\n\nthe expert's reliability arises.\"           Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 152.\n\n                   B. Liszkiewicz's Qualifications\n\n            The defendant argues that Liszkiewicz's inability to\n\nanswer questions about the significance of common fingerprint\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fcharacteristics renders him unqualified to offer expert testimony\n\nto the jury.    Because the defendant objected to Liszkiewicz's\n\ntestimony on this basis at trial, this argument was preserved, and\n\nwe review the district court's decision to accept Liszkiewicz's\n\nqualifications for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Díaz,\n\n300 F.3d 66, 74 (1st Cir. 2002)(citing Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner,\n\n522 U.S. 136, 138-39 (1997)).\n\n          Before accepting expert testimony, a district court must\n\ndetermine that a witness is \"qualified as an expert by knowledge,\n\nskill, experience, training, or education.\"     Fed. R. Evid. 702.\n\n\"It is well-settled that 'trial judges have broad discretionary\n\npowers in determining the qualification, and thus, admissibility,\n\nof expert witnesses.'\"   Diefenbach v. Sheridan Transp., 229 F.3d\n\n27, 30 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Richmond Steel Inc. v. Puerto Rican\n\nAm. Ins. Co., 954 F.2d 19, 20 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n          Liszkiewicz's qualifications as a fingerprint analyst are\n\nconsiderable.   Liszkiewicz testified that he has worked in the\n\nfield of fingerprint analysis for over twenty years.        He has\n\ncompleted two FBI courses in fingerprint comparison, as well as\n\nother training courses. He is a certified fingerprint examiner and\n\npolice instructor.   He has been deemed qualified as a fingerprint\n\nexpert in over one-hundred previous cases.    Moreover, there is no\n\nevidence that an understanding of statistical studies on the\n\n\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fsignificance of recurring fingerprint characteristics is required\n\nby any standard of fingerprint identification analysis.\n\n          It   is   not    required    that   experts   be   \"blue-ribbon\n\npractitioners\" with optimal qualifications.             United States v.\n\nMahone, 453 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2006).         Given the evidence of\n\nLiszkiewicz's training, experience, and skill, the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in finding him sufficiently qualified\n\nto testify as an expert on fingerprint comparison, as that ruling\n\nfell within the broad purview of the trial court's discretion.\n\n  C. Sufficiency of Liszkiewicz's Data and the Reliability of\n   Liszkiewicz's Application of Fingerprint Analysis Methods\n\n                          1.   Standard of Review\n\n          The defendant also raises an argument under the first and\n\nthird prongs of Rule 702 arguing that Liszkiewicz's testimony was\n\nnot based upon sufficient facts or data and that he did not apply\n\nthe principles and methods of fingerprint analysis reliably to the\n\nfacts of this case.       However, the defendant failed to object to\n\nLiszkiewicz's testimony on these grounds at trial, therefore our\n\nreview is limited to plain error review.\n\n          Rule 103(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence requires\n\nthat an objection to the admission or exclusion of evidence be\n\ntimely and specific in order to preserve the issue for appeal.\n\nThis mandate for specificity requires the objecting party to object\n\nwith the degree of detail that will adequately apprise the trial\n\ncourt of the basis of the objection, unless the specific ground is\n\n                                    -16-\n\fapparent from the context.          See Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(1); see also\n\nUnited States v. Carrillo-Figueroa, 34 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(\"Unless the basis for objection is apparent from the context, the\n\ngrounds for objection must be specific so that the trial court may\n\nhave an opportunity to address the claim later sought to be\n\npresented on appeal.\"); United States v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 769\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (\"The reason for [the specificity] requirement is\n\nto alert the trial court and the other party to the grounds of the\n\nobjection so that it may be addressed or cured.\").\n\n             As with other bases for objecting, \"litigants must raise\n\na   timely   objection   to   the    validity   or   reliability    of   expert\n\ntestimony under Daubert in order to preserve a challenge on appeal\n\nto the admissibility of that evidence.\" Díaz, 300 F.3d at 74.\n\nHowever, \"[n]othing in [Rule 103] precludes taking notice of plain\n\nerrors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought\n\nto the attention of the court.\" Fed. R. Evid. 103(d). Thus, we\n\nreview a claim of error not properly preserved below for plain\n\nerror.   Díaz, 300 F.3d at 74-75.\n\n             Our review of the record indicates that the defendant\n\nobjected to the admission of Liszkiewicz's expert testimony three\n\ntimes.   His first objection was to Liszkiewicz's qualifications.\n\nThe   second   objection   gave     no   explanation   of   his   grounds   for\n\nobjecting; he stated simply and without elaboration, \"I move to\n\nexclude [Liszkiewicz's] testimony.\"          The third and final objection\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\freferred to Liszkiewicz's qualifications and, more generally, to\n\nthe scientific foundation of fingerprint analysis.                         None of the\n\nobjections made reference to the sufficiency of Liszkiewicz's facts\n\nor his application of fingerprint analysis methods.\n\n            The defendant's first objection went to qualifications,\n\nand thus clearly did not preserve these issues for appeal.                            The\n\nsecond objection was a general objection.                It did not specify any\n\ngrounds for objecting and followed a lengthy cross-examination\n\ncovering    many     subjects,     including       aspects      of    Liszkiewicz's\n\neducational background, training, and experience; the methods he\n\nemployed for his analysis of the fingerprints; the memorialization\n\nof his analysis; the accuracy of fingerprint analysis generally;\n\nthe rigor of the standards he employed as compared to standards\n\nemployed    in   other     countries;     the     reliability        of    fingerprint\n\nanalysis    as   compared    to    DNA    analysis;      and    his       knowledge    of\n\nstatistical      studies      on    the         reliability      of        fingerprint\n\nidentification. On the heels of such varied questioning, it cannot\n\nbe said that the specific grounds of the defendant's objection were\n\n\"apparent     from   the   context,\"      such    that   Rule    103(a)       would    be\n\nsatisfied.4      Thus, the defendant's second objection could not\n\n\n4\n   Although the defendant's cross-examination of Liszkiewicz was\nitself limited to the expert's qualifications, methodology, the\nbasis for his ultimate opinion, and the reliability of the\nfingerprint analysis in general, subjects that are all governed by\nRule 702, more than 'I move to exclude his testimony' after a\nwholesale attack on an expert's testimony is necessary to advise\nthe trial court of an objection based on the sufficiency of facts\n\n                                         -18-\n\fadvise   the   district   court   that    the   defendant   was   raising   a\n\nchallenge specifically to the sufficiency of Liszkiewicz's data or\n\nto the application of fingerprint analysis methods under Rule 702.\n\n            The defendant's third objection likewise failed to advise\n\nthe district court of these challenges to Liszkiewicz's testimony.\n\nThis   objection   addressed   Liszkiewicz's     qualifications     and   the\n\nscientific foundation of fingerprint analysis.              Although it was\n\nmore elaborate than his first insofar as the defendant articulated\n\nsome grounds for the motion to strike, it did not call the district\n\ncourt's attention to Liszkiewicz's data or his application of\n\nfingerprint analysis methods.5       In fact, both the district court\n\nand the government understood the defendant to be challenging the\n\nfoundation of fingerprint analysis generally and Liszkiewicz's\n\nqualifications as an expert.6     Because the defendant failed to make\n\n\nemployed by the expert and his application of appropriate methods.\nSee Díaz, 300 F.3d at 75 (noting that because \"Rule 702 encompasses\nan array of expert witness issues,\" an objection on the basis of\none or more of its criteria must advise the court of the specific\nRule 702 provision being challenged).\n5\n   Although the defendant did refer briefly to Daubert, he did not\narticulate how the Daubert standard relates to the specific\nchallenges he brings to our attention on appeal. See Díaz, 300\nF.3d at 75 (finding the defendant's references to \"Daubert\" and\n\"competency\" to be \"woefully deficient for the purposes of advising\nthe district court that [the defendant] was raising a challenge to\nthe reliability of the experts' methods and the application of\nthose methods under 702\").\n6\n   In response to Vargas's objection, the following colloquy took\nplace:\n\n       THE GOVERNMENT: Fingerprint examination has been an accepted\n\n                                   -19-\n\fa   specific    objection      based    on    the   sufficiency    of    the    data\n\nLiszkiewicz employed or his application of fingerprint analysis\n\nmethods, and no such basis of objection could be considered clear\n\nfrom the context, the defendant's objections at trial failed to\n\nadequately     preserve    these    challenges      to    the   admissibility     of\n\nLiszkiewicz's expert testimony.              We review these claims for plain\n\nerror.\n\n                          2.    Plain Error Analysis\n\n           The    defendant      must    demonstrate       \"(1)   that   an    error\n\noccurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings\" to establish plain error in the admission of expert\n\ntestimony.     United States v. Lemmerer, 277 F.3d 579, 591 (1st Cir.\n\n2002)(quoting United States v. Gómez, 255 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n2001))(internal quotation marks omitted).                Nothing of that sort is\n\nimplicated here.\n\n                      a.       Sufficiency of the Data\n\n           The defendant argues that Liszkiewicz's testimony was not\n\nbased on sufficient facts or data because he used a faxed image of\n\n\n      science for years in courts.     He has been accepted as an\n      expert. He has official training and background and education\n      to testify and give his opinion as to how he made this\n      identification.\n\n      THE COURT: Yes. The motion is denied. It has a certain\n      plausibility, but it's denied.\n\n                                        -20-\n\fthe fingerprint in Vargas's A-file to compare that print with the\n\nfingerprints obtained by the agents rather than the original print\n\nor a photograph of the original.\n\n            Liszkiewicz provided unrebutted testimony that the ACEV\n\nmethod of fingerprint comparison required that the analyst ensure\n\nthat the prints being analyzed are sufficiently clear to observe\n\ntheir characteristics.        He also testified that the faxed image of\n\nfingerprint was sufficiently clear to make a comparison.                While he\n\ndid state that it was his practice to try to use the \"best possible\n\nimage\" of a fingerprint for comparisons, his failure to do so with\n\nrespect   to     one   of   the   prints   goes   to    the   weight,   not   the\n\nadmissibility, of his testimony.           See Int'l Adhesive Coating, Co.\n\nv. Bolton Emerson Int'l, 851 F.2d 540, 545 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"When\n\nthe factual underpinning of an expert's opinion is weak, it is a\n\nmatter affecting the weight and credibility of the testimony -- a\n\nquestion to be resolved by the jury.\").             There was no error, much\n\nless    plain     error,    in    the    district      court's   finding      that\n\nLiszkiewicz's testimony was based on sufficient facts.\n\n            b.    Reliability of Application of Methodology\n\n            The defendant also contends that Liszkiewicz's testimony\n\nshould have been excluded because he did not apply the principles\n\nand methods of fingerprint analysis reliably to the facts of this\n\ncase.     He first argues that the district court \"abdicated its\n\nresponsibility to assure that the witness applied the appropriate\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fmethods of his field reliably to the facts of the case\" and that it\n\nultimately erred in finding that Liszkiewicz had applied the\n\naccepted methods of fingerprint analysis reliably.\n\n              The defendant claims that the court should have concluded\n\nthat Liszkiewicz's testimony was inadmissible because he failed to\n\nmemorialize his original analysis with notes,             he based one of his\n\ncomparisons of a faxed image of a fingerprint, he \"eyeballed\" the\n\nfingerprints as a means of identification, and he recited an eight-\n\npoint standard but only identified five matching characteristics as\n\nto two comparisons and only one matching point for the last\n\ncomparison in his testimony to the jury.\n\n              The district court's responsibility under Rule 702 and\n\nDaubert is only to find that the expert's conclusion has \"a\n\nreliable basis in the knowledge and experience of [the expert's]\n\ndiscipline.\"      Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592; see also Ruiz-Troche, 161\n\nF.3d at 85 (\"[Daubert] demands only that the proponent of the\n\nevidence show that the expert's conclusion has been arrived at in\n\na scientifically sound and methodologically reliable fashion.\").\n\nWe have specifically noted that \"Daubert does not require that the\n\nparty who proffers expert testimony carry the burden of proving to\n\nthe   judge    that   the   expert's    assessment   of   the   situation   is\n\ncorrect.\"      Ruiz-Troche, 161 F.3d at 85.      Once the district court\n\nfinds that the expert's methodology is reliable, the expert is\n\nallowed to testify as to the inferences and conclusions he draws\n\n\n                                       -22-\n\ffrom it.     United States v. Mooney, 315 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(\"We . . . note that Rule 702 specifically allows qualified experts\n\nto   offer    their     opinions,    a    testimonial        latitude     generally\n\nunavailable to other witnesses.\").\n\n             The record shows that Liszkiewicz explained that the\n\nmethods    and    procedures    he   employed      in    analyzing      fingerprint\n\nidentity     required     him   to       find     at    least   eight      matching\n\ncharacteristics and no unexplainable points of difference in order\n\nto determine that two fingerprints came from the same person.\n\nLiszkiewicz testified that he examined every set of fingerprints\n\npersonally and that each examination yielded sufficient points of\n\nidentity to determine that they belonged to the defendant.                       He\n\nstated     that   the   comparisons       yielded       no   characteristics     of\n\ndifference, and emphasized the significance of finding more than\n\ntwenty points of identity as to one comparison and a matching\n\n\"tented arch\" characteristic as to another.                  Liszkiewicz stated\n\nthat his use of only five points was for illustrative purposes, and\n\nhe never suggested that he relied on fewer than eight points of\n\nidentity in declaring a match.                  He also testified that while\n\ngetting the \"best possible image\" was important, the faxed image of\n\nthe print was sufficiently clear to make a comparison.                     We find\n\nthis testimony more than sufficient to support the district court's\n\ndetermination that Liszkiewicz's conclusions had a reliable basis\n\nin the knowledge and discipline of fingerprint analysis.\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f             This Court has made clear that\n\n             [a]s long as an expert's scientific testimony\n             rests upon good grounds, based on what is\n             known, it should be tested by the adversary\n             process -- competing expert testimony and\n             active   cross-examination  --   rather  than\n             excluded from jurors' scrutiny for fear that\n             they will not grasp its complexities or\n             satisfactorily weigh its inadequacies.\n\nRuiz-Troche, 161 F.3d at 85 (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted); see also Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596 (\"Vigorous cross-\n\nexamination,        presentation      of    contrary         evidence,     and   careful\n\ninstruction      on    the   burden    of    proof         are   the   traditional   and\n\nappropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\").\n\n             We note that the defendant questioned Liszkiewicz at\n\nlength on all of the alleged deficiencies in his testimony that he\n\nchallenges on appeal.         He presented the jury with his view of the\n\ninconsistencies        and    weaknesses          in       Liszkiewicz's     testimony.\n\nMoreover, the district court below instructed the jury that,\n\nnotwithstanding the court's decision to admit the evidence, it had\n\nthe    \"separate      responsibilit[y]        of       determining       whether     [it]\n\nbelieve[d] him and his opinions, in particular, based on [its]\n\njudgment    of   his    qualifications        as       a   fingerprint     analyst   and\n\nexpert.\"    In light of the district court's cautionary instructions\n\nto    the   jury,     the    defendant's      vigorous           cross-examination    of\n\nLiszkiewicz, and his argument to the jury at closing that the\n\nfingerprint evidence should not be credited, we are confident that\n\n\n\n                                           -24-\n\fthe jury could draw its own conclusions as to the strength of the\n\nsupport for Liszkiewicz's opinions.\n\n          Thus, the defendant is unable to establish the first\n\nprong of the plain error test: there was no error in the district\n\ncourt's assessment of the reliability of Liszkiewicz's application\n\nof fingerprint analysis methodology to the facts of this case.\n\n                        III.

After careful consideration, we affirm the conviction because we conclude that the district court did not err in admitting the expert testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 13, 2001, a man identifying himself as Samuel Ortiz submitted an application for a United States passport (\"the application\") at a post office in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The application indicated that the applicant Samuel Ortiz was a United States citizen born in Puerto Rico on May 24, 1963. The applicant signed the name \"Samuel Ortiz\" on the application in the presence of the window clerk and submitted supporting documents, including a Puerto Rican birth certificate and a Massachusetts identification card bearing the applicant's picture, both under the name \"Samuel Ortiz.\" The clerk accepted the application and forwarded it for processing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application was reviewed at the National Passport Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire by a passport specialist who testified at trial that aspects of the application led her to believe it was fraudulent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> She forwarded it to a fraud program manager in the Boston Passport Agency. The program manager testified that she also observed indications of fraud and sent a letter to the applicant requesting additional documentation. She received no response, so she referred the application for investigation by the Diplomatic Security Service (\"DSS\"), a law enforcement branch of the United States Department of State responsible for passport and visa fraud investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 5, 2003, two DSS officers went to the address provided on the Massachusetts identification card submitted with the application&#8212;an address different from the one written on the application. The agents identified themselves to the woman who answered the door and, showing her the picture that had been submitted with the passport application, asked to see the person depicted in the picture. The woman led the agents inside the apartment to a man who one of the agents identified at trial as the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The agents questioned the man about the application and accompanying photograph. The man denied submitting the application, telling the agents that his name was V&#237;ctor Vargas (\"Vargas\") and that he was from the Dominican Republic. Vargas gave his birth date as July 25, 1960, and provided the names of his parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents requested that Vargas provide identification. Vargas responded that he did not have any with him, but that he might have identification at his mother's house. The agents offered to take Vargas to his mother's house to get the identification, and asked if they could take his fingerprints. Vargas provided two sets of fingerprints. He then went with the agents to the address he had given as his mother's home. The agents found no one at that location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An investigation revealed that the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service had an alien file (\"A-file\") for V&#237;ctor Vargas, born in the Dominican Republic on July 25, 1960. The date of birth and names of parents on file matched those provided by Vargas to the agents in March 2003. The A-file established that Vargas had been admitted to the United States as a legal permanent resident in December 1990 and remained a legal permanent resident in June 2001, when the passport application was submitted. The A-file contained an index fingerprint for V&#237;ctor Vargas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Investigators also discovered that the passport application submitted in June 2001 contained four latent fingerprints. The government conducted fingerprint analysis comparing the fingerprints obtained by the agents in March 2003 with the prints from Vargas's A-file and the latent prints from the passport application. The analysis revealed that the fingerprints obtained by the agents matched both the fingerprint in Vargas' A-file and the latent prints lifted off the passport application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then brought charges against the defendant on the theory that he had fraudulently submitted the passport application under the name \"Samuel Ortiz,\" when he was really V&#237;ctor Vargas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the defendant took the position that his name was Samuel Ortiz and that he had submitted a truthful passport application. To contradict this, the government sought to introduce the expert testimony of Thomas Liszkiewicz, a senior fingerprint specialist with the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). Liszkiewicz had analyzed the fingerprints at issue in this case and, on the basis of that analysis, identified the individual who submitted the passport application under the name Samuel Ortiz as the legal permanent resident V&#237;ctor Vargas. Several months before trial, the government notified the defendant of Liszkiewicz's proposed testimony and provided him with a report of Liszkiewicz's conclusions. The government also made the passport application available to the defendant for independent analysis. The defendant did not request a hearing on the admissibility of Liszkiewicz's fingerprint testimony nor did he make any pre-trial motions with respect to Liszkiewicz's proposed testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Liszkiewicz first testified about his qualifications. Liszkiewicz stated that he had been a senior fingerprint specialist at the DHS for two and a half years. He had previously spent nineteen to twenty years as a fingerprint examiner for the Wilmington, Delaware police department. Liszkiewicz testified that, as part of his training while with the Delaware police, he took courses and attended conferences on fingerprint identification methods, including two forty-hour FBI-sponsored courses in basic and advanced fingerprint comparison. He also received training as an intern to court-accepted fingerprint examiners in Delaware. Liszkiewicz testified that he is certified as a fingerprint examiner in Delaware and has served there as an instructor and trainer of fingerprint identification. He stated that he has also been certified by the Forensic Document Lab at the DHS. Liszkiewicz also testified that he has performed \"hundreds of thousands\" of fingerprint comparisons and provided expert testimony on more than one hundred occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Liszkiewicz testified about his background in fingerprint analysis, the government moved to qualify Liszkiewicz as an expert. The defendant objected to Liszkiewicz's qualifications. The judge did not rule on that objection, and the defendant appears to have reserved the objection for cross-examination. Before allowing the prosecution to proceed, the court briefly addressed the jury, discussing the court's role in admitting expert testimony but also noting the jury's independent responsibility to consider \"whether you think [the expert's] qualifications are sufficient to persuade you that he can give this opinion about fingerprints in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liszkiewicz went on to explain certain terminology and procedures of fingerprint identification. He described to the jury the difference between \"inked\" prints, produced intentionally to \"reproduce\" the patterns on the fingers, and \"latent\" fingerprints, obtained from objects that a person touches. He described the \"analysis, comparison, evaluation and verification,\" or \"ACEV,\" method of fingerprint comparison he had been trained to use to determine whether two fingerprints were made by the same person. Liszkiewicz explained that this method requires the analyst to first ensure that the prints involved are sufficiently clear to observe their characteristics, and if so, to compare the prints by looking at both their individual characteristics and the overall pattern. The analyst looks for matching characteristics and patterns and identifies any points of difference between the prints. An observation of at least eight matching characteristics and no unexplainable points of difference is necessary to indicate that two prints come from the same person. If the reviewer believes a match has been identified, she submits the conclusion to another examiner for verification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liszkiewicz then testified to the comparisons he performed in the analysis at issue. First, he described a comparison of latent prints found on the passport application to the prints obtained by the agents in March 2003. Of the four latent prints found on the application, Liszkiewicz described his comparison of two of them&#8212;a left and right thumb print. He used \"chalks\" of the latent and inked prints for both the left and right thumb, and marked five matching characteristics to explain to the jury. He explained that he had chosen five characteristics for illustrative purposes, but had found a larger number of points of identity between the prints&#8212;\"into the twenties\" with respect the left thumb print. He testified that he had found no points of difference between the latent and inked fingerprints. On the basis of his analysis, he concluded that the latent and inked thumb prints \"were made by one and the same individual.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liszkiewicz further testified that he compared the index fingerprint obtained by the agents to the corresponding fingerprint in the Vargas A-file. Liszkiewicz noted the presence of a \"tented arch,\" a particularly significant characteristic because it appears in \"less than five percent, more like three to two percent of the population.\" He testified that other matching characteristics for the index finger \"were positively identified.\" On the basis of his comparison, he testified that the two prints \"were made by one and the same individual to the exclusion of all others.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant cross-examined Liszkiewicz on several aspects of his testimony. The defendant questioned him about his educational background and experience. Liszkiewicz acknowledged that he did not have an undergraduate degree or an educational background in science. The defendant asked whether Liszkiewicz had preserved written notes of his analysis in this case, to which Liszkiewicz responded that, consistent with the policies of his department, he had not. The defendant also asked Liszkiewicz about his reliance on visual inspection to compare fingerprints. In response, Liszkiewicz testified without objection that the visual inspection method he used was consistent with his training. The defendant also questioned Liszkiewicz about the quality of the prints used. Liszkiewicz testified that while it was his usual practice to compare fingerprints using \"the best possible image available,\" he had used a fax copy of the fingerprints from the A-file for Vargas because it was sufficiently clear. The defendant challenged Liszkiewicz's reliance on eight matching characteristics to find a match in fingerprints, pointing out that other countries require twelve to sixteen matching characteristics. Finally, the defendant asked Liszkiewicz if he knew of statistical studies on the reliability of fingerprint identification. The defendant asked specifically about studies establishing the \"premise\" that fingerprints are unique, the \"relative frequencies\" of individual characteristics in the population, and the probability that a given group of characteristics might occur in multiple individuals. Liszkiewicz said that he was unable to identify specific studies addressing these points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Liszkiewicz's cross-examination, the defendant moved, without further explanation, \"to exclude Liszkiewicz's testimony.\" The district court denied the motion. A redirect and re-cross followed, after which the government rested its case. At this point, the defendant requested a sidebar, during which he renewed his motion to exclude the expert testimony, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Your Honor, I renew my motion to strike the testimony of this witness on the grounds that while he testified to common fingerprint characteristics, he is without knowledge, information or expertise about the significance of common characteristics. That is an extraordinary omission in the offering of identification or for identification testimony by this witness.... [W]ithout the ability to testify as to why those characteristics are meaningful, based on his experience, training and education, his testimony to the jury that there was identity between those prints is without foundation, would not survive any Daubert standard in the world because he can't testify to whether these standards of identification are based on any identifiable science, are in any way tested by&#8212;in the literature. There's utterly no foundation for this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responded that finger-print identification had been \"accepted science for years in courts\" and that Lisz-kiewicz was a recognized expert with relevant training and education. The court expressed agreement with the government's position and denied the defendant's motion. The defendant then moved for a judgment of acquittal \"on that ground.\" The district court reserved a ruling on the motion. The defendant rested his case without calling any witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his closing argument, the defendant asked the jury to disregard Liszkiewicz's testimony, once again attacking aspects of Liszkiewicz's testimony: Liszkiewicz's ignorance about the frequence of certain fingerprint characteristics in the population, his reliance on eight matching characteristics, his method of \"eyeballing\" prints, and his lack of \"scientific\" training. After closing arguments, the district court charged the jury to independently review and consider the expert testimony in light of all the evidence presented. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A week after the trial had concluded, the defendant filed a written motion for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 29 and 33, respectively. The defendant argued that Liszkiewicz's testimony was inadmissible, and for the first time in the case argued that the expert testimony failed to satisfy the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 702. As support for his argument he noted, among other things, that Liszkiewicz did not memorialize his fingerprint comparisons, that he used a faxed copy of a print for one of his comparisons, and that he \"eyeballed\" the comparisons. The defendant expressly stated that he was not challenging the admission of fingerprint evidence generally, limiting his Rule 702 argument to the adequacy of Liszkiewicz's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied this motion, holding that Liszkiewicz was qualified as an expert in fingerprint identification, that his \"data and methodology . . . were within the mainstream of forensic fingerprint technology,\" and that any flaws in his opinion went to the weight of the evidence, rather than its admissibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the defendant argues Liszkiewicz's testimony failed to meet three criteria required by Rule 702 for the admission of expert testimony: that a witness be \"qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\";<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> that expert testimony be \"based upon sufficient facts or data\"; and that the expert \"appl[y] the principles and methods of [fingerprint analysis] reliably to the facts of the case.\" Fed.

The proffered expert testimony must also be relevant, \"not only in the sense that all evidence must be relevant, but also in the incremental sense that the expert's proposed opinion, if admitted, likely would assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\" <i>Ruiz-Troche v.

The trial court enjoys broad latitude in executing its gate-keeping function; there is no particular procedure it is required to follow. <i>See id.</i> The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of such broad latitude, noting that, without it, the trial court \"would lack the discretionary authority needed both to avoid unnecessary `reliability' proceedings in ordinary cases where the reliability of an expert's methods is properly taken for granted, and to require appropriate proceedings in the less usual or more complex cases where cause for questioning the expert's reliability arises.\" <i>Kumho Tire,</i> 526 U.S. at 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Liszkiewicz's Qualifications</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that Liszkiewicz's inability to answer questions about the significance of common fingerprint characteristics renders him unqualified to offer expert testimony to the jury. Because the defendant objected to Liszkiewicz's testimony on this basis at trial, this argument was preserved, and we review the district court's decision to accept Liszkiewicz's qualifications for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. D&#237;az,</i> 300 F.3d 66, 74 (1st Cir.2002)(citing <i>Gen. Elec. Co. v.

Liszkiewicz testified that he has worked in the field of fingerprint analysis for over twenty years. He has completed two FBI courses in fingerprint comparison, as well as other training courses. He is a certified fingerprint examiner and police instructor. He has been deemed qualified as a fingerprint expert in over one-hundred previous cases. Moreover, there is no evidence that an understanding of statistical studies on the significance of recurring fingerprint characteristics is required by any standard of fingerprint identification analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not required that experts be \"blue-ribbon practitioners\" with optimal qualifications. <i>United States v. Mahone,</i> 453 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir.2006). Given the evidence of Liszkiewicz's training, experience, and skill, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding him sufficiently qualified to testify as an expert on fingerprint comparison, as that ruling fell within the broad purview of the trial court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant also raises an argument under the first and third prongs of Rule 702 arguing that Liszkiewicz's testimony was not based upon sufficient facts or data and that he did not apply the principles and methods of fingerprint analysis reliably to the facts of this case. However, the defendant failed to object to Liszkiewicz's testimony on these grounds at trial, therefore our review is limited to plain error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 103(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence requires that an objection to the admission or exclusion of evidence be timely and specific in order to preserve the issue for appeal. This mandate for specificity requires the objecting party to object with the degree of detail that will adequately apprise the trial court of the basis of the objection, unless the specific ground is apparent from the context. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 103(a)(1); <i>see also United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa,</i> 34 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Unless the basis for objection is apparent from the context, the grounds for objection must be specific so that the trial court may have an opportunity to address the claim later sought to be presented on appeal.\"); <i>United States v.

However, \"[n]othing in [Rule 103] precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\" Fed.R.Evid. 103(d). Thus, we review a claim of error not properly preserved below for plain error. <i>D&#237;az,</i> 300 F.3d at 74-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the record indicates that the defendant objected to the admission of Liszkiewicz's expert testimony three times. His first objection was to Liszkiewicz's qualifications. The second objection gave no explanation of his grounds for objecting; he stated simply and without elaboration, \"I move to exclude [Liszkiewicz's] testimony.\" The third and final objection referred to Liszkiewicz's qualifications and, more generally, to the scientific foundation of fingerprint analysis. None of the objections made reference to the sufficiency of Liszkiewicz's facts or his application of fingerprint analysis methods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's first objection went to qualifications, and thus clearly did not preserve these issues for appeal. The second objection was a general objection. It did not specify any grounds for objecting and followed a lengthy cross-examination covering many subjects, including aspects of Liszkiewicz's educational background, training, and experience; the methods he employed for his analysis of the fingerprints; the memorialization of his analysis; the accuracy of fingerprint analysis generally; the rigor of the standards he employed as compared to standards employed in other countries; the reliability of fingerprint analysis as compared to DNA analysis; and his knowledge of statistical studies on the reliability of fingerprint identification. On the heels of such varied questioning, it cannot be said that the <i>specific</i> grounds of the defendant's objection were \"apparent from the context,\" such that Rule 103(a) would be satisfied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, the defendant's second objection could not advise the district court that the defendant was raising a challenge specifically to the sufficiency of Liszkiewicz's data or to the application of fingerprint analysis methods under Rule 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's third objection likewise failed to advise the district court of these challenges to Liszkiewicz's testimony. This objection addressed Liszkiewicz's qualifications and the scientific foundation of fingerprint analysis. Although it was more elaborate than his first insofar as the defendant articulated some grounds for the motion to strike, it did not call the district court's attention to Liszkiewicz's data or his application of fingerprint analysis methods.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In fact, both the district court and the government understood the defendant to be challenging the foundation of fingerprint analysis generally and Liszkiewicz's qualifications as an expert.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Because the defendant failed to make a specific objection based on the sufficiency of the data Liszkiewicz employed or his application of fingerprint analysis methods, and no such basis of objection could be considered clear from the context, the defendant's objections at trial failed to adequately preserve these challenges to the admissibility of Liszkiewicz's expert testimony.

He also testified that the faxed image of fingerprint was sufficiently clear to make a comparison. While he did state that it was his practice to try to use the \"best possible image\" of a fingerprint for comparisons, his failure to do so with respect to one of the prints goes to the weight, not the admissibility, of his testimony. <i>See Int'l Adhesive Coating, Co. v. Bolton Emerson Int'l,</i> 851 F.2d 540, 545 (1st Cir.1988) (\"When the factual underpinning of an expert's opinion is weak, it is a matter affecting the weight and credibility of the testimony&#8212;a question to be resolved by the jury.\").

Reliability of Application of Methodology</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant also contends that Liszkiewicz's testimony should have been excluded because he did not apply the principles and methods of fingerprint analysis reliably to the facts of this case. He first argues that the district court \"abdicated its responsibility to assure that the witness applied the appropriate methods of his field reliably to the facts of the case\" and that it ultimately erred in finding that Liszkiewicz had applied the accepted methods of fingerprint analysis reliably.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant claims that the court should have concluded that Liszkiewicz's testimony was inadmissible because he failed to memorialize his original analysis with notes, he based one of his comparisons of a faxed image of a fingerprint, he \"eyeballed\" the fingerprints as a means of identification, and he recited an eight-point standard but only identified five matching characteristics as to two comparisons and only one matching point for the last comparison in his testimony to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's responsibility under Rule 702 and <i>Daubert</i> is only to find that the expert's conclusion has \"a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of [the expert's] discipline.\" <i>Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786; <i>see also Ruiz-Troche,</i> 161 F.3d at 85 (\"[<i>Daubert</i>] demands only that the proponent of the evidence show that the expert's conclusion has been arrived at in a scientifically sound and methodologically reliable fashion.\"). We have specifically noted that \"<i>Daubert</i> does not require that the party who proffers expert testimony carry the burden of proving to the judge that the expert's assessment of the situation is correct.\" <i>Ruiz-Troche,</i> 161 F.3d at 85. Once the district court finds that the expert's methodology is reliable, the expert is allowed to testify as to the inferences and conclusions he draws from it. <i>United States v.

Liszkiewicz testified that he examined every set of fingerprints personally and that each examination yielded sufficient points of identity to determine that they belonged to the defendant. He stated that the comparisons yielded no characteristics of difference, and emphasized the significance of finding more than twenty points of identity as to one comparison and a matching \"tented arch\" characteristic as to another. Liszkiewicz stated that his use of only five points was for illustrative purposes, and he never suggested that he relied on fewer than eight points of identity in declaring a match. He also testified that while getting the \"best possible image\" was important, the faxed image of the print was sufficiently clear to make a comparison. We find this testimony more than sufficient to support the district court's determination that Liszkiewicz's conclusions had a reliable basis in the knowledge and discipline of fingerprint analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">This Court has made clear that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]s long as an expert's scientific testimony rests upon good grounds, based on what is known, it should be tested by the adversary process&#8212;competing expert testimony and active cross-examination&#8212;rather than excluded from jurors' scrutiny for fear that they will not grasp its complexities or satisfactorily weigh its inadequacies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ruiz-Troche,</i> 161 F.3d at 85 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <i>see also Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 596, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (\"Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that the defendant questioned Liszkiewicz at length on all of the alleged deficiencies in his testimony that he challenges on appeal.

The application indicated that the applicant Samuel Ortiz was a United States citizen born in Puerto Rico on May 24, 1963. The applicant signed the name \"Samuel Ortiz\" on the application in the presence of the window clerk and submitted supporting documents, including a Puerto Rican birth certificate and a Massachusetts identification card bearing the applicant's picture, both under the name \"Samuel Ortiz.\" The clerk accepted the application and forwarded it for processing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application was reviewed at the National Passport Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire by a passport specialist who testified at trial that aspects of the application led her to believe it was fraudulent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> She forwarded it to a fraud program manager in the Boston Passport Agency. The program manager testified that she also observed indications of fraud and sent a letter to the applicant requesting additional documentation. She received no response, so she referred the application for investigation by the Diplomatic Security Service (\"DSS\"), a law enforcement branch of the United States Department of State responsible for passport and visa fraud investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 5, 2003, two DSS officers went to the address provided on the Massachusetts identification card submitted with the application&#8212;an address different from the one written on the application. The agents identified themselves to the woman who answered the door and, showing her the picture that had been submitted with the passport application, asked to see the person depicted in the picture. The woman led the agents inside the apartment to a man who one of the agents identified at trial as the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The agents questioned the man about the application and accompanying photograph. The man denied submitting the application, telling the agents that his name was V&#237;ctor Vargas (\"Vargas\") and that he was from the Dominican Republic. Vargas gave his birth date as July 25, 1960, and provided the names of his parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents requested that Vargas provide identification. Vargas responded that he did not have any with him, but that he might have identification at his mother's house. The agents offered to take Vargas to his mother's house to get the identification, and asked if they could take his fingerprints. Vargas provided two sets of fingerprints. He then went with the agents to the address he had given as his mother's home. The agents found no one at that location.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An investigation revealed that the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Service had an alien file (\"A-file\") for V&#237;ctor Vargas, born in the Dominican Republic on July 25, 1960. The date of birth and names of parents on file matched those provided by Vargas to the agents in March 2003. The A-file established that Vargas had been admitted to the United States as a legal permanent resident in December 1990 and remained a legal permanent resident in June 2001, when the passport application was submitted. The A-file contained an index fingerprint for V&#237;ctor Vargas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Investigators also discovered that the passport application submitted in June 2001 contained four latent fingerprints. The government conducted fingerprint analysis comparing the fingerprints obtained by the agents in March 2003 with the prints from Vargas's A-file and the latent prints from the passport application. The analysis revealed that the fingerprints obtained by the agents matched both the fingerprint in Vargas' A-file and the latent prints lifted off the passport application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then brought charges against the defendant on the theory that he had fraudulently submitted the passport application under the name \"Samuel Ortiz,\" when he was really V&#237;ctor Vargas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the defendant took the position that his name was Samuel Ortiz and that he had submitted a truthful passport application. To contradict this, the government sought to introduce the expert testimony of Thomas Liszkiewicz, a senior fingerprint specialist with the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). Liszkiewicz had analyzed the fingerprints at issue in this case and, on the basis of that analysis, identified the individual who submitted the passport application under the name Samuel Ortiz as the legal permanent resident V&#237;ctor Vargas. Several months before trial, the government notified the defendant of Liszkiewicz's proposed testimony and provided him with a report of Liszkiewicz's conclusions. The government also made the passport application available to the defendant for independent analysis. The defendant did not request a hearing on the admissibility of Liszkiewicz's fingerprint testimony nor did he make any pre-trial motions with respect to Liszkiewicz's proposed testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Liszkiewicz first testified about his qualifications. Liszkiewicz stated that he had been a senior fingerprint specialist at the DHS for two and a half years. He had previously spent nineteen to twenty years as a fingerprint examiner for the Wilmington, Delaware police department. Liszkiewicz testified that, as part of his training while with the Delaware police, he took courses and attended conferences on fingerprint identification methods, including two forty-hour FBI-sponsored courses in basic and advanced fingerprint comparison. He also received training as an intern to court-accepted fingerprint examiners in Delaware. Liszkiewicz testified that he is certified as a fingerprint examiner in Delaware and has served there as an instructor and trainer of fingerprint identification. He stated that he has also been certified by the Forensic Document Lab at the DHS. Liszkiewicz also testified that he has performed \"hundreds of thousands\" of fingerprint comparisons and provided expert testimony on more than one hundred occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Liszkiewicz testified about his background in fingerprint analysis, the government moved to qualify Liszkiewicz as an expert. The defendant objected to Liszkiewicz's qualifications. The judge did not rule on that objection, and the defendant appears to have reserved the objection for cross-examination. Before allowing the prosecution to proceed, the court briefly addressed the jury, discussing the court's role in admitting expert testimony but also noting the jury's independent responsibility to consider \"whether you think [the expert's] qualifications are sufficient to persuade you that he can give this opinion about fingerprints in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liszkiewicz went on to explain certain terminology and procedures of fingerprint identification. He described to the jury the difference between \"inked\" prints, produced intentionally to \"reproduce\" the patterns on the fingers, and \"latent\" fingerprints, obtained from objects that a person touches. He described the \"analysis, comparison, evaluation and verification,\" or \"ACEV,\" method of fingerprint comparison he had been trained to use to determine whether two fingerprints were made by the same person. Liszkiewicz explained that this method requires the analyst to first ensure that the prints involved are sufficiently clear to observe their characteristics, and if so, to compare the prints by looking at both their individual characteristics and the overall pattern. The analyst looks for matching characteristics and patterns and identifies any points of difference between the prints. An observation of at least eight matching characteristics and no unexplainable points of difference is necessary to indicate that two prints come from the same person. If the reviewer believes a match has been identified, she submits the conclusion to another examiner for verification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liszkiewicz then testified to the comparisons he performed in the analysis at issue. First, he described a comparison of latent prints found on the passport application to the prints obtained by the agents in March 2003. Of the four latent prints found on the application, Liszkiewicz described his comparison of two of them&#8212;a left and right thumb print. He used \"chalks\" of the latent and inked prints for both the left and right thumb, and marked five matching characteristics to explain to the jury. He explained that he had chosen five characteristics for illustrative purposes, but had found a larger number of points of identity between the prints&#8212;\"into the twenties\" with respect the left thumb print. He testified that he had found no points of difference between the latent and inked fingerprints. On the basis of his analysis, he concluded that the latent and inked thumb prints \"were made by one and the same individual.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liszkiewicz further testified that he compared the index fingerprint obtained by the agents to the corresponding fingerprint in the Vargas A-file. Liszkiewicz noted the presence of a \"tented arch,\" a particularly significant characteristic because it appears in \"less than five percent, more like three to two percent of the population.\" He testified that other matching characteristics for the index finger \"were positively identified.\" On the basis of his comparison, he testified that the two prints \"were made by one and the same individual to the exclusion of all others.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant cross-examined Liszkiewicz on several aspects of his testimony. The defendant questioned him about his educational background and experience. Liszkiewicz acknowledged that he did not have an undergraduate degree or an educational background in science. The defendant asked whether Liszkiewicz had preserved written notes of his analysis in this case, to which Liszkiewicz responded that, consistent with the policies of his department, he had not. The defendant also asked Liszkiewicz about his reliance on visual inspection to compare fingerprints. In response, Liszkiewicz testified without objection that the visual inspection method he used was consistent with his training. The defendant also questioned Liszkiewicz about the quality of the prints used. Liszkiewicz testified that while it was his usual practice to compare fingerprints using \"the best possible image available,\" he had used a fax copy of the fingerprints from the A-file for Vargas because it was sufficiently clear. The defendant challenged Liszkiewicz's reliance on eight matching characteristics to find a match in fingerprints, pointing out that other countries require twelve to sixteen matching characteristics. Finally, the defendant asked Liszkiewicz if he knew of statistical studies on the reliability of fingerprint identification. The defendant asked specifically about studies establishing the \"premise\" that fingerprints are unique, the \"relative frequencies\" of individual characteristics in the population, and the probability that a given group of characteristics might occur in multiple individuals. Liszkiewicz said that he was unable to identify specific studies addressing these points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Liszkiewicz's cross-examination, the defendant moved, without further explanation, \"to exclude Liszkiewicz's testimony.\" The district court denied the motion. A redirect and re-cross followed, after which the government rested its case. At this point, the defendant requested a sidebar, during which he renewed his motion to exclude the expert testimony, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Your Honor, I renew my motion to strike the testimony of this witness on the grounds that while he testified to common fingerprint characteristics, he is without knowledge, information or expertise about the significance of common characteristics. That is an extraordinary omission in the offering of identification or for identification testimony by this witness.... [W]ithout the ability to testify as to why those characteristics are meaningful, based on his experience, training and education, his testimony to the jury that there was identity between those prints is without foundation, would not survive any Daubert standard in the world because he can't testify to whether these standards of identification are based on any identifiable science, are in any way tested by&#8212;in the literature. There's utterly no foundation for this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responded that finger-print identification had been \"accepted science for years in courts\" and that Lisz-kiewicz was a recognized expert with relevant training and education. The court expressed agreement with the government's position and denied the defendant's motion. The defendant then moved for a judgment of acquittal \"on that ground.\" The district court reserved a ruling on the motion. The defendant rested his case without calling any witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his closing argument, the defendant asked the jury to disregard Liszkiewicz's testimony, once again attacking aspects of Liszkiewicz's testimony: Liszkiewicz's ignorance about the frequence of certain fingerprint characteristics in the population, his reliance on eight matching characteristics, his method of \"eyeballing\" prints, and his lack of \"scientific\" training. After closing arguments, the district court charged the jury to independently review and consider the expert testimony in light of all the evidence presented. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A week after the trial had concluded, the defendant filed a written motion for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 29 and 33, respectively.

His first objection was to Liszkiewicz's qualifications. The second objection gave no explanation of his grounds for objecting; he stated simply and without elaboration, \"I move to exclude [Liszkiewicz's] testimony.\" The third and final objection referred to Liszkiewicz's qualifications and, more generally, to the scientific foundation of fingerprint analysis.

The second objection was a general objection. It did not specify any grounds for objecting and followed a lengthy cross-examination covering many subjects, including aspects of Liszkiewicz's educational background, training, and experience; the methods he employed for his analysis of the fingerprints; the memorialization of his analysis; the accuracy of fingerprint analysis generally; the rigor of the standards he employed as compared to standards employed in other countries; the reliability of fingerprint analysis as compared to DNA analysis; and his knowledge of statistical studies on the reliability of fingerprint identification. On the heels of such varied questioning, it cannot be said that the <i>specific</i> grounds of the defendant's objection were \"apparent from the context,\" such that Rule 103(a) would be satisfied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, the defendant's second objection could not advise the district court that the defendant was raising a challenge specifically to the sufficiency of Liszkiewicz's data or to the application of fingerprint analysis methods under Rule 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's third objection likewise failed to advise the district court of these challenges to Liszkiewicz's testimony. This objection addressed Liszkiewicz's qualifications and the scientific foundation of fingerprint analysis. Although it was more elaborate than his first insofar as the defendant articulated some grounds for the motion to strike, it did not call the district court's attention to Liszkiewicz's data or his application of fingerprint analysis methods.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In fact, both the district court and the government understood the defendant to be challenging the foundation of fingerprint analysis generally and Liszkiewicz's qualifications as an expert.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Because the defendant failed to make a specific objection based on the sufficiency of the data Liszkiewicz employed or his application of fingerprint analysis methods, and no such basis of objection could be considered clear from the context, the defendant's objections at trial failed to adequately preserve these challenges to the admissibility of Liszkiewicz's expert testimony.

He also testified that the faxed image of fingerprint was sufficiently clear to make a comparison. While he did state that it was his practice to try to use the \"best possible image\" of a fingerprint for comparisons, his failure to do so with respect to one of the prints goes to the weight, not the admissibility, of his testimony. <i>See Int'l Adhesive Coating, Co. v.

Liszkiewicz testified that he examined every set of fingerprints personally and that each examination yielded sufficient points of identity to determine that they belonged to the defendant. He stated that the comparisons yielded no characteristics of difference, and emphasized the significance of finding more than twenty points of identity as to one comparison and a matching \"tented arch\" characteristic as to another. Liszkiewicz stated that his use of only five points was for illustrative purposes, and he never suggested that he relied on fewer than eight points of identity in declaring a match. He also testified that while getting the \"best possible image\" was important, the faxed image of the print was sufficiently clear to make a comparison.

Moreover, the district court below instructed the jury that, notwithstanding the court's decision to admit the evidence, it had the \"separate responsibilit[y] of determining whether [it] believe[d] him and his opinions, in particular, based on [its] judgment of his qualifications as a fingerprint analyst and expert.\" In light of the district court's cautionary instructions to the jury, the defendant's vigorous cross-examination of Liszkiewicz, and his argument to the jury at closing that the fingerprint evidence should not be credited, we are confident that the jury could draw its own conclusions as to the strength of the support for Liszkiewicz's opinions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the defendant is unable to establish the first prong of the plain error test: there was no error in the district court's assessment of the reliability of Liszkiewicz's application of fingerprint analysis methodology to the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The passport specialist testified that she suspected fraud because the picture identification card and the birth certificates submitted with the application were recently issued, and because Ortiz printed his signature, which she thought was inconsistent with a Puerto Rican education</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> At trial, the agent testified that during this encounter, he noticed that the man they questioned had a mole on his left earlobe matching that shown in the picture submitted with the passport application. On cross-examination, the agent acknowledged that he did not mention the identifying mole in his contemporaneous notes of the March 5, 2003 meeting</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> On appeal, the defendant's \"specific\" argument is that Liszkiewicz \"failed to meet two of the criteria for admission required by Fed. R.Evid. 702; his testimony was not based upon sufficient data and he had not applied the relevant methods reliably to the facts of the case.\" The defendant does not explicitly articulate a challenge to Liszkiewicz's qualifications, but he devotes part of his brief to the argument that Liszkiewicz \"demonstrated little understanding of fingerprint analysis methodology.\" We understand this argument to go to Liszkiewicz's qualifications, and we will address it as such</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although the defendant's cross-examination of Liszkiewicz was itself limited to the expert's qualifications, methodology, the basis for his ultimate opinion, and the reliability of the fingerprint analysis in general, subjects that are all governed by Rule 702, more than `I move to exclude his testimony' after a wholesale attack on an expert's testimony is necessary to advise the trial court of an objection based on the sufficiency of facts employed by the expert and his application of appropriate methods<i>See D&#237;az,</i> 300 F.3d at 75 (noting that because \"Rule 702 encompasses an array of expert witness issues,\" an objection on the basis of one or more of its criteria must advise the court of the specific Rule 702 provision being challenged).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although the defendant did refer briefly to<i>Daubert,</i> he did not articulate how the <i>Daubert</i> standard relates to the specific challenges he brings to our attention on appeal. <i>See D&#237;az,</i> 300 F.3d at 75 (finding the defendant's references to \"<i>Daubert</i>\" and \"competency\" to be \"woefully deficient for the purposes of advising the district court that [the defendant] was raising a challenge to the reliability of the experts' methods and the application of those methods under 702\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In response to Vargas's objection, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">THE GOVERNMENT: Fingerprint examination has been an accepted science for years in courts. He has been accepted as an expert. He has official training and background and education to testify and give his opinion as to how he made this identification.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: Yes. The motion is denied. It has a certain plausibility, but it's denied.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
