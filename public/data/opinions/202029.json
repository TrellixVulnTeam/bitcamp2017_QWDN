Puerto Rico Law 75 prohibits a principal\n\nfrom terminating a distribution contract with its dealer without\n\njust cause.   10 L.P.R.A. § 278.            Law 75 was enacted on June 24,\n\n1964, and does not apply retroactively to distribution agreements\n\nreached before the law's enactment. See Warner Lambert v. Superior\n\nCourt, 101 D.P.R. 378 (1973).           In this case, Unilever Home &\n\nPersonal Care USA (Unilever), the manufacturer of Helene Curtis\n\nbeauty    products,    sought     a   declaratory          judgment   that     its\n\nrelationship with a former distributor, Puerto Rico Beauty Supply\n\nCompany   (PRBS),     was   not   governed     by    Law    75    because    their\n\ndistribution relationship commenced before June 24, 1964.                     The\n\nparties cross-moved for summary judgment, and the district court\n\nentered judgment for Unilever.        We vacate the judgment and remand\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n           Resolution of this appeal requires an understanding of\n\nthe relationships among three entities:             Helene Curtis Industries\n\n(Helene   Curtis)     (which    Unilever     acquired      in    1996),   Llorens\n\nCaribbean Distribution Company (Llorens Caribbean), and PRBS.                  As\n\nthis case is before us after the grant of summary judgment in favor\n\nof Unilever, we present the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nPRBS.1    See Sargent v. Tenaska, Inc., 108 F.3d 5, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n\n\n     1\n      PRBS has not appealed the denial of its cross-motion for\nsummary judgment.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                  In 1958, Llorens Caribbean, owned by two brothers,\n\nHumberto and Edgar Llorens, became the Puerto Rico distributor of\n\nHelene Curtis's professional and retail lines of beauty products.2\n\nIn 1961, the Llorens brothers incorporated PRBS.              PRBS operated as\n\na store in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, selling to salons and beauticians\n\nvarious cosmetic lines, including the Helene Curtis professional\n\nline.\n\n             Although      the   Llorens     brothers     owned    both   Llorens\n\nCaribbean and PRBS from 1961 until 1971, the companies maintained\n\nseparate employees, records, books, and accounts.                  One of PRBS's\n\nemployees was Gloria Soegaard de Martin.                 In 1969, the Llorens\n\nbrothers hired Soegaard's husband, Carlos Martin, as the accountant\n\nfor both companies.\n\n             In 1971, the Llorens brothers decided to sell PRBS to the\n\nMartins to generate additional capital for Llorens Caribbean, which\n\nwas financially distressed.          To effectuate the sale, the Llorens\n\nbrothers transferred ownership of all PRBS stock from themselves to\n\nLlorens Caribbean, thus making PRBS a wholly-owned subsidiary of\n\nLlorens Caribbean.         The Martins then purchased PRBS's stock from\n\nLlorens Caribbean.\n\n             After the sale, PRBS continued to operate as before.             It\n\nordered     its   Helene    Curtis   professional       products   from   Llorens\n\n\n\n        2\n      In 1958, Llorens Caribbean was known as Curtis Laboratories.\nIt changed its name in 1969.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fCaribbean and resold them from its store. Martin continued to work\n\nfor Llorens Caribbean as its accountant until March 1972, when he\n\nresigned.         Shortly      thereafter,      Llorens    Caribbean      filed    for\n\nbankruptcy.\n\n            Sometime near the end of 1973, Martin learned from Edgar\n\nLlorens that Llorens Caribbean was planning to close because of\n\nfinancial difficulties. This prompted Martin to contact Helene\n\nCurtis    about     the     possibility      of   becoming       its    Puerto     Rico\n\ndistributor.       Martin learned that, if this was to happen, Helene\n\nCurtis could not designate PRBS as its Puerto Rico distributor\n\nuntil it terminated its relationship with Llorens Caribbean, and\n\nthat PRBS would have to distribute both the professional and retail\n\nlines of products.\n\n            In the early summer of 1974, Helene Curtis informed\n\nMartin that it was terminating its relationship with Llorens\n\nCaribbean.        In    June    1974,   Helene    Curtis       sent    PRBS   a   draft\n\nagreement, which included a provision requiring PRBS to repay\n\nLlorens Caribbean's outstanding debt to Helene Curtis. PRBS signed\n\nthe agreement on July 1, 1974.            The only parties to the agreement\n\nwere Helene Curtis and PRBS.                 Sometime after PRBS signed the\n\nagreement, it amended its corporate documents to state that it\n\nwould    engage    in     \"retail   and    wholesale      of    beauty    products.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied.)            Previously, the corporate objective was\n\nstated to be the \"purchase and sale of beauty products.\"\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f             The    initial   distribution       agreement   between       PRBS   and\n\nHelene Curtis was modified in 1977.             A new contract was executed in\n\n1982, and was later modified in 1987 and 1990.                  In 1996, Unilever\n\nacquired Helene Curtis and, in 1999, it presented PRBS with a new\n\ndistribution agreement.\n\n             PRBS refused to sign the agreement and the parties'\n\nrelationship       deteriorated.         On     February   6,    2002,     Unilever\n\nterminated PRBS as a distributor.                 In its termination letter,\n\nUnilever offered three reasons: (1) PRBS failed to provide proper\n\nservice to national accounts such as Wal-Mart; (2) PRBS failed to\n\nwork diligently to insure that Helene Curtis products destined for\n\nPuerto Rico were not diverted to the United States mainland; and\n\n(3) PRBS had failed to modernize its operations to provide adequate\n\nmarketing services.\n\n             Shortly    after    the     termination,      Unilever      sought     a\n\ndeclaratory    judgment       that   the   parties'     relationship       was    not\n\ngoverned by Law 75 or, if Law 75 did apply, the relationship had\n\nbeen terminated for \"just cause.\"              At the conclusion of discovery,\n\nUnilever moved for summary judgment on three grounds: (1) PRBS had\n\nbeen a distributor of Helene Curtis products since its founding in\n\n1961; (2) PRBS was assigned Llorens Caribbean's distributorship in\n\n1974   and    was    therefore       a   successor-in-interest        to    Llorens\n\nCaribbean's relationship with Helene Curtis (which predated Law\n\n75's June 24, 1964 enactment date); and (3) Unilever terminated its\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\frelationship with PRBS for just cause.\n\n           The district court granted Unilever's motion on a ground\n\nnot argued by Unilever.     It concluded that Llorens Caribbean was a\n\ndistributor of Helene Curtis products prior to the enactment of Law\n\n75 and that PRBS was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Llorens Caribbean\n\nwhen Llorens Caribbean sold PRBS to the Martins.             Based on these\n\nfacts,   the   court   ruled   that,   by   operation   of    law,   Llorens\n\nCaribbean's    distribution    relationship    with   Helene    Curtis   was\n\ntransferred to the Martins as part of the Martins' purchase of PRBS\n\nin 1971. And, since this transferred relationship began before Law\n\n75's enactment, Law 75 did not apply to the parties' relationship.\n\n           We review the district court's summary judgment ruling de\n\nnovo. See Guzman-Rosario v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 397 F.3d 6,\n\n9 (1st Cir. 2005).     Summary judgment is appropriate where there is\n\nno genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c).\n\n           The parties agree that Law 75 does not apply if the\n\ndistributorship relationship between PRBS and Helene Curtis began\n\nbefore Law 75's enactment in June 1964.        As just explained above,\n\nthe district court concluded that the relationship began before\n\nJune 1964 because of PRBS's status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of\n\nLlorens Caribbean when PRBS was sold to the Martins in 1971.\n\n           The district court incorrectly concluded that PRBS was or\n\nbecame a party to Llorens Caribbean's distributor relationship with\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fHelene Curtis merely because it was Llorens Caribbean's subsidiary\n\nin 1971. \"The properties of two corporations are distinct though\n\nthe same shareholders own or control both,\"                      1 W. Fletcher,\n\nCyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations § 31 (rev. ed. 1999).\n\nMoreover, a subsidiary does not own the property of its parent\n\ncompany simply by virtue of its subsidiary status, see Dole Food\n\nCo. v. Patrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 475 (2003).3                     Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court's ruling is only sustainable if PRBS was in fact a\n\ndistributor of Helene Curtis products prior to the enactment of Law\n\n75.\n\n               The record is not sufficiently undisputed to require such\n\na conclusion.          The former president of Helene Curtis, Ronald\n\nGidwitz, testified that Llorens Caribbean was the sole owner of the\n\ncontract to distribute Helene Curtis products in Puerto Rico until\n\nHelene Curtis terminated its relationship with Llorens Caribbean in\n\n1974.       Similarly, Edgar Llorens testified that PRBS \"did not have\n\na relationship with Helene Curtis\" while PRBS was owned by the\n\nLlorens       brothers    and    that   \"all   purchases    of    Helene   Curtis\n\nprofessional products made by PRBS prior to the termination of the\n\ncontract between Llorens Caribbean Distributing Corporation and\n\nHelene Curtis were done through Llorens Caribbean Distributing\n\nCorporation,      as     the    exclusive   distributor    of    [Helene   Curtis]\n\n\n        3\n      The parties assume for purposes of appeal that the Llorens\nbrothers did not disregard corporate formalities to such a degree\nthat the PRBS and Llorens Caribbean were in fact one entity.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fproducts.\"     Moreover,   Carlos    Martin   testified    that    Llorens\n\nCaribbean was the exclusive distributor of Helene Curtis products\n\nuntil July 1974 and that, after he bought PRBS in 1971, the company\n\ncontinued to purchase all of its Helene Curtis products from\n\nLlorens Caribbean.      Finally, PRBS did not change its corporate\n\nobjective to the \"wholesale\" sale of beauty products until after it\n\nsigned   the   1974   distributorship     agreement.      This    evidence\n\nestablishes, at the least, a material issue of fact as to whether\n\nPRBS had a distributor relationship with Helene Curtis prior to the\n\nenactment of Law 75.4\n\n          Arguing in the alternative, Unilever contends that the\n\nundisputed facts demonstrate that Llorens Caribbean assigned its\n\ndistributorship contract to PRBS in 1974. Since Llorens Caribbean's\n\ndistributor relationship with Helene Curtis began before Law 75's\n\nenactment, Unilever argues that Law 75 does not apply.\n\n          We may, of course, affirm on this ground even though it\n\nwas not the basis for the district court's ruling.        See Fabiano v.\n\nHopkins, 352 F.3d 447, 451 (1st Cir. 2003).       PRBS does not dispute\n\nthat the relationship between Llorens Caribbean and Helene Curtis\n\npredated the enactment of Law 75 and agrees that Law 75 would not\n\n\n     4\n      To defend the summary judgment ruling, Unilever cites cases\nholding that an entity may simultaneously act as a retail store and\ndistributor.   See, e.g., J. Soler Motors, Inc. v. Kaiser Jeep\nInt'l, 108 P.R. Dec. 134, 139 (1979). While this may be so, a\nfactfinder could conclude that PRBS was only a retail store and not\na distributor of Helene Curtis products prior to Law 75's\nenactment.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fapply if PRBS succeeded to Llorens Caribbean's distributorship\n\nagreement with Helene Curtis.   It contends, however, that the facts\n\nare disputed as to whether it assumed Llorens Caribbean's contract\n\nor formed an independent distributor relationship with Helene Curtis\n\nby signing the July 1974 agreement.       We agree.\n\n          Under Puerto Rico law, the assignment of a contract is\n\n\"the transfer by one of the contracting parties to a third party,\n\nof the exact and integral position occupied by the former in the\n\nassigned contract.\"   Goya de P.R. v. Rowland Coffee Roasters, Inc.,\n\n206 F. Supp. 2d 211, 218 (D.P.R. 2002) (internal citation omitted).\n\nFor an effective assignment to occur, \"the three interested parties\n\nmust concur in the act of the assignment: the party that transfers\n\nits position in the contract (the assignor), the assignee party that\n\nwill acquire it and the obligor that will be affected by the change\n\nof the person with whom he had contracted.\"       Id.\n\n          The record is in      dispute concerning whether Llorens\n\nCaribbean, PRBS, and Helene Curtis agreed that Llorens Caribbean's\n\ndistributorship   contract   would   be   assigned    to   PRBS.   Martin\n\ntestified that he learned,      at the end of 1973, that Llorens\n\nCaribbean was going to close because of financial troubles. At that\n\npoint, he contacted Helene Curtis about PRBS becoming its Puerto\n\nRico distributor.   After approaching Helene Curtis, Martin was told\n\nthat Helene Curtis could not appoint PRBS as the distributor until\n\nit had concluded its relationship with Llorens Caribbean.          After\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthat, Martin took no further action until Helene Curtis sent him a\n\ndistributorship agreement.     These proffered facts do not compel a\n\nconclusion that Martin agreed with Llorens Caribbean to assume its\n\ncontractual     relationship   before      signing    the   distributorship\n\nagreement.\n\n            Moreover, Edgar Llorens testified that Llorens Caribbean\n\nnever agreed to transfer its distributorship rights to \"anyone.\"\n\nThis testimony, in turn, was consistent with Gidwitz's testimony\n\nthat Helene Curtis understood that Llorens Caribbean was its sole\n\ndistributor.     The record thus contains evidence from which a\n\nfactfinder could conclude that neither PRBS (the potential assignee)\n\nnor   Llorens   Caribbean   (the   potential    assignor)    agreed   to   an\n\nassignment of Llorens Caribbean's rights to distribute Helene Curtis\n\nproducts.\n\n            Unilever argues that PRBS's promise that it would pay\n\nLlorens Caribbean's outstanding debt to Helene Curtis is conclusive\n\nproof of such an assignment.       We disagree.      At most, this suggests\n\na connection between Llorens Caribbean's relationship with Helene\n\nCurtis and PRBS's subsequent agreement with Helene Curtis.            On the\n\nother hand, it could be that Helen Curtis demanded this concession\n\nfrom PRBS as a condition of the new distributorship relationship.\n\nThe factfinder must sort this out.\n\n            Finally, Unilever contends that, even if Law 75 applies\n\nto the parties' relationship, summary judgment was appropriately\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fgranted       because     the    undisputed       facts   indicate     that   Unilever\n\nterminated its relationship with PRBS for just cause.                           Law 75\n\ndefines \"just cause\" as \"nonperformance of the essential obligations\n\nof the [distributor] . . . that adversely and substantially affects\n\nthe interest of the [manufacturer] in promoting the marketing or\n\ndistribution of the merchandise or service.\"                  10 L.P.R.A. § 278(d).\n\nAs mentioned, Unilever offered three reasons for terminating its\n\nrelationship with PRBS.            But, as to each, there are disputed issues\n\nof fact.\n\n              Unilever claimed that PRBS failed to properly service the\n\nWal-Mart account. But representatives from Wal-Mart testified that\n\nthey were satisfied with PRBS's service.                   Victor Schiavo, a Wal-\n\nMart senior buyer who worked directly with PRBS for five years,\n\ntestified that PRBS's service of Wal-Mart's account was \"excellent\"\n\nand    that    he    knew   of     no   complaints    about   PRBS's     performance.\n\nMoreover, Milagros Ester Meléndez-Rodríguez, another Wal-Mart buyer,\n\ntestified that PRBS was \"one of the best\" distributors that Wal-Mart\n\nhad.\n\n              Unilever      also    contended      that   PRBS   was    intentionally\n\ndiverting Helene Curtis product to the mainland. However, there was\n\nevidence challenging this assertion. Ronald Gidwitz testified that\n\nthere   had     been      investigations     into    allegations       that   PRBS   was\n\ninvolved in the diversion of Helene Curtis products but that these\n\nallegations         had    never    been   substantiated.          Moreover,     Norma\n\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fSantamaría, Helene Curtis's director of Latin America and Eastern\n\nEuropean sales until February 1999, testified that Martin acted\n\naggressively on behalf of PRBS to address complaints concerning the\n\ndiversion of products.\n\n           Unilever    further accused PRBS of failing to provide\n\nadequate   service    to   the   Puerto   Rico    market,   but   Gidwitz   and\n\nSantamaría provided contrary testimony. Santamaría stated that PRBS\n\nwas \"one of the best [distributors] in Latin America,\" that \"its\n\nsalesmen were well prepared,\" and that there was a positive response\n\nfrom PRBS's customers to its efforts.            Gidwitz similarly testified\n\nthat PRBS \"was doing quite a good job\" in distributing Helene Curtis\n\nproducts in Puerto Rico.\n\n           In sum, whether PRBS was distributing              Helene Curtis\n\nproducts before the enactment of Law 75, whether Llorens Caribbean\n\nassigned its distribution agreement to PRBS in 1974, and whether\n\nUnilever terminated its relationship with PRBS for just cause cannot\n\nbe resolved on summary judgment, but will instead require resolution\n\nof contested factual issues.\n\n           Vacated and remanded.

Puerto Rico Law 75 prohibits a principal\n\nfrom terminating a distribution contract with its dealer without\n\njust cause.   10 L.P.R.A. § 278.            Law 75 was enacted on June 24,\n\n1964, and does not apply retroactively to distribution agreements\n\nreached before the law's enactment. See Warner Lambert v. Superior\n\nCourt, 101 D.P.R. 378 (1973).           In this case, Unilever Home &\n\nPersonal Care USA (Unilever), the manufacturer of Helene Curtis\n\nbeauty    products,    sought     a   declaratory          judgment   that     its\n\nrelationship with a former distributor, Puerto Rico Beauty Supply\n\nCompany   (PRBS),     was   not   governed     by    Law    75    because    their\n\ndistribution relationship commenced before June 24, 1964.                     The\n\nparties cross-moved for summary judgment, and the district court\n\nentered judgment for Unilever.        We vacate the judgment and remand\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n           Resolution of this appeal requires an understanding of\n\nthe relationships among three entities:             Helene Curtis Industries\n\n(Helene   Curtis)     (which    Unilever     acquired      in    1996),   Llorens\n\nCaribbean Distribution Company (Llorens Caribbean), and PRBS.                  As\n\nthis case is before us after the grant of summary judgment in favor\n\nof Unilever, we present the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nPRBS.1    See Sargent v. Tenaska, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197237\"><a href=\"/opinion/197237/sargent-v-tenaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n\n\n     1\n      PRBS has not appealed the denial of its cross-motion for\nsummary judgment.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                  In 1958, Llorens Caribbean, owned by two brothers,\n\nHumberto and Edgar Llorens, became the Puerto Rico distributor of\n\nHelene Curtis's professional and retail lines of beauty products.2\n\nIn 1961, the Llorens brothers incorporated PRBS.              PRBS operated as\n\na store in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, selling to salons and beauticians\n\nvarious cosmetic lines, including the Helene Curtis professional\n\nline.\n\n             Although      the   Llorens     brothers     owned    both   Llorens\n\nCaribbean and PRBS from 1961 until 1971, the companies maintained\n\nseparate employees, records, books, and accounts.                  One of PRBS's\n\nemployees was Gloria Soegaard de Martin.                 In 1969, the Llorens\n\nbrothers hired Soegaard's husband, Carlos Martin, as the accountant\n\nfor both companies.\n\n             In 1971, the Llorens brothers decided to sell PRBS to the\n\nMartins to generate additional capital for Llorens Caribbean, which\n\nwas financially distressed.          To effectuate the sale, the Llorens\n\nbrothers transferred ownership of all PRBS stock from themselves to\n\nLlorens Caribbean, thus making PRBS a wholly-owned subsidiary of\n\nLlorens Caribbean.         The Martins then purchased PRBS's stock from\n\nLlorens Caribbean.\n\n             After the sale, PRBS continued to operate as before.             It\n\nordered     its   Helene    Curtis   professional       products   from   Llorens\n\n\n\n        2\n      In 1958, Llorens Caribbean was known as Curtis Laboratories.\nIt changed its name in 1969.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fCaribbean and resold them from its store. Martin continued to work\n\nfor Llorens Caribbean as its accountant until March 1972, when he\n\nresigned.         Shortly      thereafter,      Llorens    Caribbean      filed    for\n\nbankruptcy.\n\n            Sometime near the end of 1973, Martin learned from Edgar\n\nLlorens that Llorens Caribbean was planning to close because of\n\nfinancial difficulties. This prompted Martin to contact Helene\n\nCurtis    about     the     possibility      of   becoming       its    Puerto     Rico\n\ndistributor.       Martin learned that, if this was to happen, Helene\n\nCurtis could not designate PRBS as its Puerto Rico distributor\n\nuntil it terminated its relationship with Llorens Caribbean, and\n\nthat PRBS would have to distribute both the professional and retail\n\nlines of products.\n\n            In the early summer of 1974, Helene Curtis informed\n\nMartin that it was terminating its relationship with Llorens\n\nCaribbean.        In    June    1974,   Helene    Curtis       sent    PRBS   a   draft\n\nagreement, which included a provision requiring PRBS to repay\n\nLlorens Caribbean's outstanding debt to Helene Curtis. PRBS signed\n\nthe agreement on July 1, 1974.            The only parties to the agreement\n\nwere Helene Curtis and PRBS.                 Sometime after PRBS signed the\n\nagreement, it amended its corporate documents to state that it\n\nwould    engage    in     \"retail   and    wholesale      of    beauty    products.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied.)            Previously, the corporate objective was\n\nstated to be the \"purchase and sale of beauty products.\"\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f             The    initial   distribution       agreement   between       PRBS   and\n\nHelene Curtis was modified in 1977.             A new contract was executed in\n\n1982, and was later modified in 1987 and 1990.                  In 1996, Unilever\n\nacquired Helene Curtis and, in 1999, it presented PRBS with a new\n\ndistribution agreement.\n\n             PRBS refused to sign the agreement and the parties'\n\nrelationship       deteriorated.         On     February   6,    2002,     Unilever\n\nterminated PRBS as a distributor.                 In its termination letter,\n\nUnilever offered three reasons: (1) PRBS failed to provide proper\n\nservice to national accounts such as Wal-Mart; (2) PRBS failed to\n\nwork diligently to insure that Helene Curtis products destined for\n\nPuerto Rico were not diverted to the United States mainland; and\n\n(3) PRBS had failed to modernize its operations to provide adequate\n\nmarketing services.\n\n             Shortly    after    the     termination,      Unilever      sought     a\n\ndeclaratory    judgment       that   the   parties'     relationship       was    not\n\ngoverned by Law 75 or, if Law 75 did apply, the relationship had\n\nbeen terminated for \"just cause.\"              At the conclusion of discovery,\n\nUnilever moved for summary judgment on three grounds: (1) PRBS had\n\nbeen a distributor of Helene Curtis products since its founding in\n\n1961; (2) PRBS was assigned Llorens Caribbean's distributorship in\n\n1974   and    was    therefore       a   successor-in-interest        to    Llorens\n\nCaribbean's relationship with Helene Curtis (which predated Law\n\n75's June 24, 1964 enactment date); and (3) Unilever terminated its\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\frelationship with PRBS for just cause.\n\n           The district court granted Unilever's motion on a ground\n\nnot argued by Unilever.     It concluded that Llorens Caribbean was a\n\ndistributor of Helene Curtis products prior to the enactment of Law\n\n75 and that PRBS was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Llorens Caribbean\n\nwhen Llorens Caribbean sold PRBS to the Martins.             Based on these\n\nfacts,   the   court   ruled   that,   by   operation   of    law,   Llorens\n\nCaribbean's    distribution    relationship    with   Helene    Curtis   was\n\ntransferred to the Martins as part of the Martins' purchase of PRBS\n\nin 1971. And, since this transferred relationship began before Law\n\n75's enactment, Law 75 did not apply to the parties' relationship.\n\n           We review the district court's summary judgment ruling de\n\nnovo. See Guzman-Rosario v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201699\"><a href=\"/opinion/201699/guzman-rosario-v-united-parcel/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n9 (1st Cir. 2005).     Summary judgment is appropriate where there is\n\nno genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (c).\n\n           The parties agree that Law 75 does not apply if the\n\ndistributorship relationship between PRBS and Helene Curtis began\n\nbefore Law 75's enactment in June 1964.        As just explained above,\n\nthe district court concluded that the relationship began before\n\nJune 1964 because of PRBS's status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of\n\nLlorens Caribbean when PRBS was sold to the Martins in 1971.\n\n           The district court incorrectly concluded that PRBS was or\n\nbecame a party to Llorens Caribbean's distributor relationship with\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fHelene Curtis merely because it was Llorens Caribbean's subsidiary\n\nin 1971. \"The properties of two corporations are distinct though\n\nthe same shareholders own or control both,\"                      1 W. Fletcher,\n\nCyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations § 31 (rev. ed. 1999).\n\nMoreover, a subsidiary does not own the property of its parent\n\ncompany simply by virtue of its subsidiary status, see Dole Food\n\nCo. v. Patrickson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127913\"><a href=\"/opinion/127913/dole-food-co-v-patrickson/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 475 (2003).3                     Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court's ruling is only sustainable if PRBS was in fact a\n\ndistributor of Helene Curtis products prior to the enactment of Law\n\n75.\n\n               The record is not sufficiently undisputed to require such\n\na conclusion.          The former president of Helene Curtis, Ronald\n\nGidwitz, testified that Llorens Caribbean was the sole owner of the\n\ncontract to distribute Helene Curtis products in Puerto Rico until\n\nHelene Curtis terminated its relationship with Llorens Caribbean in\n\n1974.       Similarly, Edgar Llorens testified that PRBS \"did not have\n\na relationship with Helene Curtis\" while PRBS was owned by the\n\nLlorens       brothers    and    that   \"all   purchases    of    Helene   Curtis\n\nprofessional products made by PRBS prior to the termination of the\n\ncontract between Llorens Caribbean Distributing Corporation and\n\nHelene Curtis were done through Llorens Caribbean Distributing\n\nCorporation,      as     the    exclusive   distributor    of    [Helene   Curtis]\n\n\n        3\n      The parties assume for purposes of appeal that the Llorens\nbrothers did not disregard corporate formalities to such a degree\nthat the PRBS and Llorens Caribbean were in fact one entity.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fproducts.\"     Moreover,   Carlos    Martin   testified    that    Llorens\n\nCaribbean was the exclusive distributor of Helene Curtis products\n\nuntil July 1974 and that, after he bought PRBS in 1971, the company\n\ncontinued to purchase all of its Helene Curtis products from\n\nLlorens Caribbean.      Finally, PRBS did not change its corporate\n\nobjective to the \"wholesale\" sale of beauty products until after it\n\nsigned   the   1974   distributorship     agreement.      This    evidence\n\nestablishes, at the least, a material issue of fact as to whether\n\nPRBS had a distributor relationship with Helene Curtis prior to the\n\nenactment of Law 75.4\n\n          Arguing in the alternative, Unilever contends that the\n\nundisputed facts demonstrate that Llorens Caribbean assigned its\n\ndistributorship contract to PRBS in 1974. Since Llorens Caribbean's\n\ndistributor relationship with Helene Curtis began before Law 75's\n\nenactment, Unilever argues that Law 75 does not apply.\n\n          We may, of course, affirm on this ground even though it\n\nwas not the basis for the district court's ruling.        See Fabiano v.\n\nHopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200766\"><a href=\"/opinion/200766/fabiano-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 451 (1st Cir. 2003).       PRBS does not dispute\n\nthat the relationship between Llorens Caribbean and Helene Curtis\n\npredated the enactment of Law 75 and agrees that Law 75 would not\n\n\n     4\n      To defend the summary judgment ruling, Unilever cites cases\nholding that an entity may simultaneously act as a retail store and\ndistributor.   See, e.g., J. Soler Motors, Inc. v. Kaiser Jeep\nInt'l, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139 (1979). While this may be so, a\nfactfinder could conclude that PRBS was only a retail store and not\na distributor of Helene Curtis products prior to Law 75's\nenactment.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fapply if PRBS succeeded to Llorens Caribbean's distributorship\n\nagreement with Helene Curtis.   It contends, however, that the facts\n\nare disputed as to whether it assumed Llorens Caribbean's contract\n\nor formed an independent distributor relationship with Helene Curtis\n\nby signing the July 1974 agreement.       We agree.\n\n          Under Puerto Rico law, the assignment of a contract is\n\n\"the transfer by one of the contracting parties to a third party,\n\nof the exact and integral position occupied by the former in the\n\nassigned contract.\"   Goya de P.R. v. Rowland Coffee Roasters, Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433349\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433349/goya-de-puerto-rico-inc-v-rowland-coffee/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (D.P.R. 2002) (internal citation omitted).\n\nFor an effective assignment to occur, \"the three interested parties\n\nmust concur in the act of the assignment: the party that transfers\n\nits position in the contract (the assignor), the assignee party that\n\nwill acquire it and the obligor that will be affected by the change\n\nof the person with whom he had contracted.\"       Id.\n\n          The record is in      dispute concerning whether Llorens\n\nCaribbean, PRBS, and Helene Curtis agreed that Llorens Caribbean's\n\ndistributorship   contract   would   be   assigned    to   PRBS.   Martin\n\ntestified that he learned,      at the end of 1973, that Llorens\n\nCaribbean was going to close because of financial troubles. At that\n\npoint, he contacted Helene Curtis about PRBS becoming its Puerto\n\nRico distributor.   After approaching Helene Curtis, Martin was told\n\nthat Helene Curtis could not appoint PRBS as the distributor until\n\nit had concluded its relationship with Llorens Caribbean.          After\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthat, Martin took no further action until Helene Curtis sent him a\n\ndistributorship agreement.     These proffered facts do not compel a\n\nconclusion that Martin agreed with Llorens Caribbean to assume its\n\ncontractual     relationship   before      signing    the   distributorship\n\nagreement.\n\n            Moreover, Edgar Llorens testified that Llorens Caribbean\n\nnever agreed to transfer its distributorship rights to \"anyone.\"\n\nThis testimony, in turn, was consistent with Gidwitz's testimony\n\nthat Helene Curtis understood that Llorens Caribbean was its sole\n\ndistributor.     The record thus contains evidence from which a\n\nfactfinder could conclude that neither PRBS (the potential assignee)\n\nnor   Llorens   Caribbean   (the   potential    assignor)    agreed   to   an\n\nassignment of Llorens Caribbean's rights to distribute Helene Curtis\n\nproducts.\n\n            Unilever argues that PRBS's promise that it would pay\n\nLlorens Caribbean's outstanding debt to Helene Curtis is conclusive\n\nproof of such an assignment.       We disagree.      At most, this suggests\n\na connection between Llorens Caribbean's relationship with Helene\n\nCurtis and PRBS's subsequent agreement with Helene Curtis.            On the\n\nother hand, it could be that Helen Curtis demanded this concession\n\nfrom PRBS as a condition of the new distributorship relationship.\n\nThe factfinder must sort this out.\n\n            Finally, Unilever contends that, even if Law 75 applies\n\nto the parties' relationship, summary judgment was appropriately\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fgranted       because     the    undisputed       facts   indicate     that   Unilever\n\nterminated its relationship with PRBS for just cause.                           Law 75\n\ndefines \"just cause\" as \"nonperformance of the essential obligations\n\nof the [distributor] . . . that adversely and substantially affects\n\nthe interest of the [manufacturer] in promoting the marketing or\n\ndistribution of the merchandise or service.\"                  10 L.P.R.A. § 278(d).\n\nAs mentioned, Unilever offered three reasons for terminating its\n\nrelationship with PRBS.            But, as to each, there are disputed issues\n\nof fact.\n\n              Unilever claimed that PRBS failed to properly service the\n\nWal-Mart account. But representatives from Wal-Mart testified that\n\nthey were satisfied with PRBS's service.                   Victor Schiavo, a Wal-\n\nMart senior buyer who worked directly with PRBS for five years,\n\ntestified that PRBS's service of Wal-Mart's account was \"excellent\"\n\nand    that    he    knew   of     no   complaints    about   PRBS's     performance.\n\nMoreover, Milagros Ester Meléndez-Rodríguez, another Wal-Mart buyer,\n\ntestified that PRBS was \"one of the best\" distributors that Wal-Mart\n\nhad.\n\n              Unilever      also    contended      that   PRBS   was    intentionally\n\ndiverting Helene Curtis product to the mainland. However, there was\n\nevidence challenging this assertion. Ronald Gidwitz testified that\n\nthere   had     been      investigations     into    allegations       that   PRBS   was\n\ninvolved in the diversion of Helene Curtis products but that these\n\nallegations         had    never    been   substantiated.          Moreover,     Norma\n\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fSantamaría, Helene Curtis's director of Latin America and Eastern\n\nEuropean sales until February 1999, testified that Martin acted\n\naggressively on behalf of PRBS to address complaints concerning the\n\ndiversion of products.\n\n           Unilever    further accused PRBS of failing to provide\n\nadequate   service    to   the   Puerto   Rico    market,   but   Gidwitz   and\n\nSantamaría provided contrary testimony. Santamaría stated that PRBS\n\nwas \"one of the best [distributors] in Latin America,\" that \"its\n\nsalesmen were well prepared,\" and that there was a positive response\n\nfrom PRBS's customers to its efforts.            Gidwitz similarly testified\n\nthat PRBS \"was doing quite a good job\" in distributing Helene Curtis\n\nproducts in Puerto Rico.\n\n           In sum, whether PRBS was distributing              Helene Curtis\n\nproducts before the enactment of Law 75, whether Llorens Caribbean\n\nassigned its distribution agreement to PRBS in 1974, and whether\n\nUnilever terminated its relationship with PRBS for just cause cannot\n\nbe resolved on summary judgment, but will instead require resolution\n\nof contested factual issues.\n\n           Vacated and remanded.
