This case presents an important\n\nquestion     of   statutory   construction.     We   must   decide   whether\n\ninterception      of   an   e-mail   message   in    temporary,   transient\n\nelectronic storage states an offense under the Wiretap Act, as\n\namended by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 2510-2522. The government believes it does, and indicted\n\nCouncilman under that theory.         The district court disagreed and\n\ndismissed the indictment.       A divided panel of this court affirmed.\n\nWe granted review en banc and now reverse.1\n\n                                     I.\n\nA.           An Introduction to Internet E-mail\n\n             The Internet is a network of interconnected computers.\n\nData transmitted across the Internet are broken down into small\n\n\"packets\" that are forwarded from one computer to another until\n\nthey reach their destination, where they are reconstituted. See\n\nOrin S. Kerr, Internet Surveillance Law After the USA Patriot Act:\n\nThe Big Brother that Isn't, 97 Nw. U. L. Rev. 607, 613-14 (2003).\n\nEach service on the Internet -- e.g., e-mail, the World Wide Web,\n\nor instant messaging -- has its own protocol for using packets of\n\ndata to transmit information from one place to another. The e-mail\n\nprotocol is known as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (\"SMTP\").\n\n\n\n\n     1\n         We acknowledge with gratitude the assistance of amici curiae.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f                   After a user composes a message in an e-mail client\n\nprogram,2 a program called a mail transfer agent (\"MTA\") formats\n\nthat message and sends it to another program that \"packetizes\" it\n\nand sends the packets out to the Internet.                       Computers on the\n\nnetwork then pass the packets from one to another; each computer\n\nalong        the    route    stores   the    packets   in   memory,    retrieves   the\n\naddresses of their final destinations, and then determines where to\n\nsend them next.             At various points the packets are reassembled to\n\nform the original e-mail message, copied, and then repacketized for\n\nthe next leg of the journey.                See J. Klensin, RFC 2821: Simple Mail\n\nTransfer                    Protocol                (Apr.        2001),            at\n\nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt; Jonathan B. Postel, RFC 821:\n\nSimple             Mail      Transfer        Protocol       (Aug.       1982),     at\n\nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc821.txt (\"RFC 821\"). Sometimes messages\n\ncannot be transferred immediately and must be saved for later\n\ndelivery.          Even when delivery is immediate, intermediate computers\n\noften retain backup copies, which they delete later.                     This method\n\nof transmission is commonly called \"store and forward\" delivery.\n\n                   Once all the packets reach the recipient's mail server,\n\nthey are reassembled to form the e-mail message.                      A mail delivery\n\nagent (\"MDA\") accepts the message from the MTA, determines which\n\nuser should receive the message, and performs the actual delivery\n\nby placing the message in that user's mailbox.                  One popular MDA is\n\n\n        2\n            Sometimes called a mail user agent (\"MUA\").\n\n                                              -4-\n\f\"procmail,\" which is controlled by short programs or scripts called\n\n\"recipe files.\"       These recipe files can be used in various ways.\n\nFor example, a procmail recipe can instruct the MDA to deposit mail\n\naddressed to one address into another user's mailbox (e.g., to send\n\nmail addressed to \"help\" to the tech support department), to reject\n\nmail from certain addresses, or to make copies of certain messages.\n\n              Once the MDA has deposited a message into the recipient's\n\nmailbox, the recipient simply needs to use an e-mail client program\n\nto retrieve and read the message.3           While the journey from sender\n\nto recipient may seem rather involved, it usually takes just a few\n\nseconds, with each intermediate step taking well under a second.\n\nSee, e.g., W. Houser et al., RFC 1865:                EDI Meets the Internet\n\n(Jan. 1996), at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1865.txt (\"For a modest\n\namount of data with a dedicated connection, a message transmission\n\nwould occur in a matter of seconds . . . .\").\n\nB.            Facts Alleged in the Indictment\n\n              Defendant-appellee      Bradford   C.    Councilman    was    Vice\n\nPresident of Interloc, Inc., which ran an online rare and out-of-\n\nprint book listing service.          As part of its service, Interloc gave\n\nbook       dealer   customers   an     e-mail    address    at   the       domain\n\n\"interloc.com\" and acted as the e-mail provider.                    Councilman\n\nmanaged the e-mail service and the dealer subscription list.\n\n\n\n       3\n      In some cases, the e-mail client program is accessed through\nthe World Wide Web. This does not change the present discussion.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f            According to the indictment, in January 1998, Councilman\n\ndirected Interloc employees to intercept and copy all incoming\n\ncommunications to subscriber dealers from Amazon.com, an Internet\n\nretailer that sells books and other products.             Interloc's systems\n\nadministrator modified the server's procmail recipe so that, before\n\ndelivering any message from Amazon.com to the recipient's mailbox,\n\nprocmail would copy the message and place the copy in a separate\n\nmailbox    that   Councilman   could    access.        Thus,   procmail   would\n\nintercept and copy all incoming messages from Amazon.com before\n\nthey were delivered to the recipient's mailbox, and therefore,\n\nbefore    the   intended   recipient    could   read    the    message.   This\n\ndiversion intercepted thousands of messages, and Councilman and\n\nother Interloc employees routinely read the e-mail messages sent to\n\nInterloc subscribers in the hope of gaining a commercial advantage.\n\nC.          Procedural History\n\n            On July 11, 2001, a grand jury returned a two-count\n\nindictment against Councilman.           Count One charged him under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 371, the general federal criminal conspiracy statute, for\n\nconspiracy to violate the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2511,4 by\n\nintercepting electronic communications, disclosing their contents,\n\nusing their contents, and causing a person providing an electronic\n\n\n\n     4\n      The Wiretap Act was amended in relevant respects in 2001,\nafter Councilman's alleged conduct and, for that matter, after the\nindictment. Accordingly, all statutes are cited according to the\nUnited States Code as of 1998 except where specified otherwise.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fcommunications service to divulge the communications' contents to\n\npersons other than the addressees.5               The object of the conspiracy\n\nwas to exploit the content of e-mail from Amazon.com to dealers in\n\norder to develop a list of books, learn about competitors, and\n\nattain a commercial advantage for Interloc and its parent company.6\n\n                 The parties stipulated to certain undisputed facts: the\n\nprocmail recipe worked only within the confines of Interloc's\n\ncomputer; at all times at which procmail performed operations\n\naffecting the e-mail system, the messages existed \"in the random\n\naccess memory (RAM) or in hard disks, or both, within Interloc's\n\ncomputer system\"; and each e-mail message, while traveling through\n\nwires,       was    an   \"electronic       communication\"     under     18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 2510(12).\n\n                 Councilman moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to\n\nstate       an    offense   under   the    Wiretap     Act,   arguing    that   the\n\nintercepted        e-mail   messages      were   in   \"electronic   storage,\"    as\n\ndefined in 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17), and therefore were not, as a\n\n\n     5\n      The indictment contained several errors.         It alleged\nconspiracy to disclose the contents of unlawfully intercepted\nelectronic communications under 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a), which\nshould have read § 2511(1)(c), and conspiracy to use the contents\nof   unlawfully  intercepted   electronic   communications   under\n§ 2511(1)(c), which should have read § 2511(1)(d) or § 2511(1)(b).\nNo superseding indictment corrected these errors. Councilman has\nnot raised this issue, and we assume, for purposes of this appeal\nonly, that the indictment charged the conspiracy correctly.\n        6\n      Count Two, which alleged conspiracy to violate the Computer\nFraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030(a)(2)(C) and (c)(2)(B), was\nvoluntarily dismissed by the government.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fmatter of law, subject to the prohibition on \"intercept[ing] . . .\n\nelectronic communication[s],\" 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a). The district\n\ncourt initially denied the motion to dismiss. As trial preparation\n\nbegan, however, the district court sua sponte reconsidered its\n\ndecision in light of the then-recently decided case of Konop v.\n\nHawaiian Airlines, Inc., 302 F.3d 868 (9th Cir. 2002).               After\n\nfurther briefing, the district court granted Councilman's motion to\n\ndismiss Count One, ruling that the messages were not, at the moment\n\nof interception, \"electronic communications\" under the Wiretap Act.\n\nUnited States v. Councilman, 245 F. Supp. 2d 319 (D. Mass. 2003).\n\n          A divided panel of this court affirmed. United States v.\n\nCouncilman, 373 F.3d 197 (1st Cir. 2004).          The majority concluded\n\nthat, because the definition of \"wire communication\" includes\n\n\"electronic   storage\"     but     the     definition      of   \"electronic\n\ncommunication\"   does    not,    the     Wiretap   Act's   prohibition   on\n\n\"intercept[ion]\" does not apply to messages that are, even briefly,\n\nin \"electronic storage.\"     Id. at 200-04.        The full court granted\n\nthe government's petition for rehearing en banc. 385 F.3d 793 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (per curiam).        Because this is an appeal of an order\n\ndismissing an indictment on \"purely legal\" grounds, our review is\n\nde novo, United States v. Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2002), and we assume the truth of            the facts alleged in the\n\nindictment, see Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250,\n\n261 (1988).\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f                                         II.\n\n            The Wiretap Act of 19687 specified, inter alia, the\n\nconditions under which law enforcement officers could intercept\n\nwire communications, and the penalties for unauthorized private\n\ninterceptions of wire communications. As amended by the Electronic\n\nCommunications Privacy Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat.\n\n1848 (\"ECPA\"), the Act makes it an offense to \"intentionally\n\nintercept[], endeavor[] to intercept, or procure[] any other person\n\nto    intercept   or    endeavor    to    intercept,        any   wire,    oral,    or\n\nelectronic communication.\"         18 U.S.C. § 2511(1).           Two terms are at\n\nissue here: \"electronic communication\" and \"intercept.\"\n\n            Councilman contends that the e-mail messages he obtained\n\nwere not, when procmail copied them, \"electronic communication[s],\"\n\nand   moreover    the   method     by    which    they   were     copied    was    not\n\n\"intercept[ion]\" under the Act.            Because these contentions raise\n\nimportant    questions      of     statutory       construction       with    broad\n\nramifications, we discuss in some detail the Act's text, structure,\n\nand    legislative      history.         We      conclude     that   Councilman's\n\ninterpretation of the Wiretap Act is inconsistent with Congress's\n\nintent.    We then turn to whether Councilman had fair warning that\n\nthe Act would be construed to cover his alleged conduct in a\n\ncriminal case, and whether the rule of lenity or other principles\n\n\n       7\n      Formally known as Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and\nSafe Streets Act of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-351, tit. III, §§ 801-804,\n82 Stat. 211 (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522).\n\n                                         -9-\n\frequire us to construe the Act in his favor.                    We find no basis to\n\napply any of the fair warning doctrines.\n\nA.            \"Electronic Communication\"\n\n              The government contends that \"electronic communication\"\n\nmeans what it says, and no less: \"any transfer of signs, signals,\n\nwriting, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature\n\ntransmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic,\n\nphotoelectronic or photooptical system that affects interstate or\n\nforeign commerce,\" with four specific exceptions not relevant here.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2510(12).            Councilman argues, however, that Congress\n\nintended to exclude any communication that is in (even momentary)\n\nelectronic storage.            In his view, \"electronic communication[s]\"\n\nunder the Wiretap Act are limited to communications traveling\n\nthrough      wires     between    computers.8        Once   a    message    enters   a\n\ncomputer, he says, the message ceases (at least temporarily) to be\n\nan electronic communication protected by the Wiretap Act.                            He\n\nclaims that Congress considered communications in computers to be\n\nworthy of less protection than communications in wires because\n\nusers       have   a   lower     expectation    of    privacy      for     electronic\n\ncommunications that are in electronic storage even fleetingly, and\n\nthat the Act embodies this understanding.\n\n\n\n\n        8\n      We understand Councilman to refer to communications in\n\"wires\" in order to exclude communications within computers, rather\nthan to exclude wireless connections.\n\n                                        -10-\n\f             1.          Text\n\n             We begin, as we must, with the statute's text.               United\n\nStates v. Rosa-Ortiz, 348 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir. 2003).                  As noted\n\nabove, the statutory definition of \"electronic communication\" is\n\nbroad and, taken alone, would appear to cover incoming e-mail\n\nmessages while the messages are being processed by the MTA.\n\n             Councilman argues, however, that the plain text of the\n\nstatute exempts electronic communications that are in storage from\n\nthe purview of the Wiretap Act.           He contends that the definition of\n\n\"electronic communication\" must be read alongside the definition of\n\n\"wire communication\" and limited by what the latter includes but\n\nthe former does not.            The ECPA amended the 1968 definition of \"wire\n\ncommunication\" to specify that \"such term includes any electronic\n\nstorage     of    such    communication.\"        18   U.S.C.   §   2510(1);   ECPA\n\n§ 101(a)(1)(D), 100 Stat. at 1848.              By contrast, the definition of\n\n\"electronic communication\" does not mention electronic storage.\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 2510(12).9            Therefore, Councilman infers, Congress\n\n\n     9\n         Section 2510(12) defines \"electronic communication\" as:\n\n     [A]ny transfer of signs, signals, writing, images,\n     sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted\n     in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic,\n     photoelectronic or photooptical system that affects . . .\n     commerce, but . . . not includ[ing] --\n     (A) any wire or oral communication;\n     (B) any communication made through a tone-only paging device;\n     (C) any communication from a tracking device . . . or\n     (D) electronic funds transfer information stored by a\n          financial institution in a communications system used for\n          the electronic storage and transfer of funds.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fintended wire communications, but not electronic communications, to\n\ninclude electronic storage. Moreover, Congress defined \"electronic\n\nstorage\"   expansively     to    include      \"any    temporary,       intermediate\n\nstorage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the\n\nelectronic transmission thereof.\"                  18 U.S.C. § 2510(17); see\n\nCouncilman, 245 F. Supp. 2d at 320 (describing this definition as\n\n\"extraordinarily     --   indeed,      almost      breathtakingly      --   broad\").\n\nSince the parties stipulated that the messages in this case were\n\n\"in the random access memory (RAM) or in the hard disks, or both,\n\nwithin Interloc's computer system\" at the time of the interception,\n\nthose messages fall under the statutory definition of \"storage.\"\n\n           As often happens under close scrutiny, the plain text is\n\nnot so plain.    The statute contains no explicit indication that\n\nCongress intended to exclude communications in transient storage\n\nfrom the definition of \"electronic communication,\" and, hence, from\n\nthe scope of the Wiretap Act.           Councilman, without acknowledging\n\nit, looks beyond the face of the statute and makes an inferential\n\nleap.   He infers that Congress intended to exclude communications\n\nin   transient   storage        from    the        definition     of    \"electronic\n\ncommunication,\" regardless of whether they are in the process of\n\nbeing   delivered,   simply     because       it    did    not   include    the   term\n\n\"electronic storage\" in that definition.                  This inferential leap is\n\nnot a plain text reading of the statute.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f            Councilman's basis for making this leap is a canon of\n\nconstruction: \"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\n\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the same\n\nAct, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and\n\npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\"     Russello v.\n\nUnited States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted; alteration in original); see also Trenkler v. United\n\nStates, 268 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir. 2001) (characterizing the maxim\n\nas a canon of construction).   Reliance on a canon of construction\n\nto support the inference belies the availability of a plain text\n\nargument.    Rather, it confirms that the text of the statute is\n\nambiguous with regard to the communications at issue.\n\n            The question, then, is whether Councilman's inferential\n\nleap, based on a canon of construction, is justified. The Russello\n\nmaxim -- which is simply a particular application of the classic\n\nprinciple expressio unius est exclusio alterius -- assumes that\n\nCongress acts carefully and deliberately in including terms in one\n\npart of a statute and omitting them in another.    See Barnhart v.\n\nPeabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003) (\"We do not read the\n\nenumeration of one case to exclude another unless it is fair to\n\nsuppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant\n\nto say no to it.\").\n\n            Sometimes that is a reasonable assumption; sometimes it\n\nis not.   \"The general rule that the expression of one thing is the\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fexclusion of others is subject to exceptions. Like other canons of\n\nstatutory construction it is only an aid in the ascertainment of\n\nthe    meaning   of   the   law,    and    must       yield   whenever    a    contrary\n\nintention on the part of the lawmaker is apparent.\"                      Springer v.\n\nGov't of Phil. Islands, 277 U.S. 189, 206 (1928); United States v.\n\nVonn, 535 U.S. 55, 65 (2002) (\"[T]he canon . . . is only a guide,\n\nwhose    fallibility    can    be   shown        by   contrary     indications    that\n\nadopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to\n\nsignal any exclusion of its common relatives.\").\n\n              The maxim upon which Councilman relies is most apt when\n\nCongress enacts a new, self-contained statute, and two provisions\n\nof that act, drafted with parallel language, differ in that one\n\nprovision uses a term, but the other provision, where it would be\n\nequally sensible to use that term if Congress desired it to apply,\n\nconspicuously     omits     it.     Under        such   conditions,      the   maxim's\n\ninterpretive value is at its apex because the underlying inference\n\nof legislative intent is most plausible.                  See Field v. Mans, 516\n\nU.S.    59,   75-76   (1995)      (\"The    more       apparently    deliberate      the\n\ncontrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example, to\n\ncontrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in\n\nrelevant respects.\")\n\n              If the statute's language, structure, or circumstances of\n\nenactment differ from that idealized picture, the canon's force is\n\ndiminished.      For example, if the language of the two provisions at\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fissue is not parallel, then Congress may not have envisioned that\n\nthe two provisions would be closely compared in search of terms\n\npresent   in   one   and   absent   from   the   other.    \"The   Russello\n\npresumption -- that the presence of a phrase in one provision and\n\nits absence in another reveals Congress'[s] design -- grows weaker\n\nwith each difference in the formulation of the provisions under\n\ninspection.\"    City of Columbus v. Ours Garage & Wrecker Serv.,\n\nInc., 536 U.S. 424, 435-36 (2002); see also Clay v. United States,\n\n537 U.S. 522, 529 (2003) (rejecting Russello-based argument because\n\ntwo statutory provisions were not parallel).         Similarly, where the\n\nhistory of the two provisions is complex, the canon may be a less\n\nreliable guide to Congressional intent.          For example, if the first\n\nprovision was already part of the law, whereas the second is\n\nentirely new, Congress may have paid less attention to subtle\n\ndifferences between the two. Cf. Moreno Rios v. United States, 256\n\nF.2d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 1958) (Magruder, C.J.) (the expressio unius\n\ninference \"is pretty weak when applied to acts of Congress enacted\n\nat widely separated times\").\n\n           In attempting to determine whether Congress intended the\n\nterm   \"electronic   communication\"    to   exclude    communications   in\n\nmomentary storage, the expressio unius maxim is not particularly\n\nhelpful. Put differently, though it may be \"presumed that Congress\n\nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fexclusion,\" Russello, 464 U.S. at 23, that presumption may be\n\nrebutted.          That is the case here.\n\n               First,      the   definitions   of   \"wire   communication\"   and\n\n\"electronic communication\" in the Wiretap Act are not parallel.\n\nThe former is defined in a single lengthy clause that specifies\n\nmultiple independent criteria, with the electronic storage clause\n\ntacked onto the end.              See 18 U.S.C. § 2510(1).         The revised\n\ndefinition hews closely to its original definition in the 1968\n\nWiretap Act; the ECPA simply amended that definition by replacing\n\nthe phrase \"communication\" with \"aural transfer,\" making certain\n\nmodifications not relevant here, and, of course, adding the clause\n\n\"and        such    term    includes   any     electronic    storage   of    such\n\ncommunication.\"10          See ECPA § 101(a)(1)(D), 100 Stat. at 1848.         By\n\n\n       10\n            Before the ECPA, the definition of \"wire communication\" read:\n\n       \"Wire communication\" means any communication made in\n       whole or in part through the use of facilities for the\n       transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable,\n       or other like connection between the point of origin and\n       the point of reception furnished or operated by any\n       person engaged as a common carrier in providing or\n       operating such facilities for the transmission of\n       interstate or foreign communications.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2510(12) (1972).           As amended by the ECPA in 1986, that\ndefinition read:\n\n       \"Wire communication\" means any aural transfer made in\n       whole or in part through the use of facilities for the\n       transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable,\n       or other like connection between the point of origin and\n       the point of reception (including the use of such\n       connection in a switching station) furnished or operated\n       by any person engaged in providing or operating such\n\n                                        -16-\n\fcontrast, \"electronic communication\" is first defined in broad\n\nterms which are narrowed by four specific exclusions enumerated in\n\nseparate subparagraphs.              See 18 U.S.C. § 2510(12).           The definition\n\nwas drafted from scratch as part of the ECPA.                         ECPA § 101(a)(6),\n\n100 Stat. at 1848-49.\n\n              Second, any expressio unius inference that can be drawn\n\nfrom    the   presence         of    the    electronic     storage      clause    in   one\n\ndefinition and its absence from another is in tension with a much\n\nmore    compelling        --   and    directly      contrary     --     expressio   unius\n\ninference drawn from the same               statutory provisions: Congress knew\n\nhow    to,    and    in    fact      did,   explicitly      exclude      four    specific\n\ncategories      of    communications          from    the       broad    definition     of\n\n\"electronic     communication.\"              See    ECPA    §   101(a)(6)(C).11        Yet\n\n\n\n       facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign\n       communications or communications affecting interstate or\n       foreign commerce and such term includes any electronic\n       storage of such communication, but such term does not\n       include the radio portion of a cordless telephone\n       communication that is transmitted between the cordless\n       telephone handset and the base unit.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2510(12) (1988).\n       11\n      In 1994, Congress deleted the exclusion of cordless phone\nconversations, see Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement\nAct, Pub. L. No. 103-414, tit. II, § 202(a)(1), 108 Stat. 4279,\n4291 (1994), and two years later, added an exclusion for electronic\nfunds transfer information, see Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, tit. VII, § 731(1)(C),\n110 Stat. 1214, 1303 (1996).     Thus, by the time of the conduct\nalleged in the indictment, Congress had enacted five separate\nexclusions from the definition of \"electronic communication,\" and\ndeleted one of them, on three separate occasions.\n\n                                             -17-\n\fCongress never added the exclusion urged by Councilman: \"any\n\nelectronic     communication          in    electronic    storage.\"           This\n\ninterpretative principle then applies: \"Where Congress explicitly\n\nenumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional\n\nexceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a\n\ncontrary legislative intent.\"              TRW v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 28\n\n(2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n          In short, the ECPA's plain text does not clearly state\n\nwhether a communication is still an \"electronic communication\"\n\nwithin the scope of the Wiretap Act when it is in electronic\n\nstorage during transmission.          Applying canons of construction does\n\nnot resolve the question. Given this continuing ambiguity, we turn\n\nto the legislative history.\n\n          2.        Legislative History\n\n          As we explain below, the purpose of the broad definition\n\nof electronic storage was to enlarge privacy protections for stored\n\ndata under the Wiretap Act, not to exclude e-mail messages stored\n\nduring transmission from those strong protections.                    Moreover,\n\nCongress's   sole   purpose      in    adding    electronic    storage   to    the\n\ndefinition of \"wire communication\" was to protect voice mail, and\n\nnot to affect e-mail at all.\n\n                    a.    Background of the ECPA\n\n          By    the      early    1980s,        the   advent   of   electronic\n\ncommunications, principally e-mail, suggested to many that the\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fWiretap Act needed revision.        To update the Act, Senator Patrick\n\nLeahy introduced the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1985.\n\nSee S. 1667, 99th Cong. (1985), reprinted in 131 Cong. Rec. S11,795\n\n(Sept. 19, 1985).    That bill would have amended the Act by striking\n\nout the existing definition of \"wire communication,\" substituting\n\nthe phrase \"electronic communication\" for \"wire communication\"\n\nthroughout the Act, and subsuming wire communications within the\n\nnewly-defined term \"electronic communication.\"       See id. § 101.\n\n             Shortly after the bill was introduced, the Congressional\n\nOffice of Technology Assessment released a long-awaited study of\n\nthe privacy implications of electronic surveillance. See Office of\n\nTechnology Assessment, Federal Government Information Technology:\n\nElectronic     Surveillance   and    Civil   Liberties,   available   at\n\nhttp://www.wws.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1985/8509_n.html          (Oct.\n\n1985) (\"OTA Report\").     The report identified the different points\n\nat which an e-mail message could be intercepted:\n\n             There are at least five discrete stages at\n             which an electronic mail message could be\n             intercepted and its contents divulged to an\n             unintended receiver: at the terminal or in the\n             electronic files of the sender, while being\n             communicated, in the electronic mailbox of the\n             receiver, when printed into hardcopy, and when\n             retained in the files of the electronic mail\n             company for administrative purposes. Existing\n             law offers little protection.\n\nId. at 48.    It emphasized that \"interception of electronic mail at\n\nany stage involves a high level of intrusiveness and a significant\n\nthreat to civil liberties.\"     Id. at 50 (emphasis added).\n\n                                    -19-\n\f             The Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") was the principal\n\nopponent of the original bill.              DOJ conceded that \"the level of\n\nintrusion during [an e-mail message's] transmission is higher than\n\nwhen it is stored,\" but urged that \"the interception of electronic\n\nmail should include some but not all of the procedural requirements\n\nof [the Wiretap Act].\"             Electronic Communications Privacy Act:\n\nHearings     on   H.R.   3378   Before      the   Subcomm.   on   Courts,   Civil\n\nLiberties, and the Admin. of Justice, House Comm. on the Judiciary,\n\n99th Cong. 214, 230 (1986) (\"House Hearings\") (statement of James\n\nKnapp, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S.\n\nDep't   of   Justice).       DOJ    asked    Congress   to   treat   prospective\n\nsurveillance      of     electronic      communications      differently    from\n\nsurveillance of wire communications in three specific respects that\n\nare related solely to law enforcement and are not relevant here.\n\nSee id. at 215, 232-33.         DOJ's willingness to extend some of the\n\nWiretap Act's protections to e-mail did not, however, extend to\n\n\"the time after a specific communication has been sent and while it\n\nis in the electronic mail firm's computers but has not been\n\ndelivered, or has been delivered to the electronic mailbox but has\n\nnot been received by the recipient.\"              Id. at 234.     In such cases,\n\nDOJ suggested, the message should be treated like first-class mail,\n\nand law enforcement should be able to seize it with an ordinary\n\nsearch warrant.        Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f            A new version of the bill was introduced to meet some,\n\nbut not all, of DOJ's concerns.              See Electronic Communications\n\nPrivacy Act of 1986, S. 2575, 99th Cong. (1986).                     The new bill\n\nrejected DOJ's preferred solution and instead added electronic\n\ncommunications     to    the    Wiretap    Act's    existing    prohibitions     on\n\ninterception of wire communications.                As the House report made\n\nclear,    Congress       intended     to     give     the    term     \"electronic\n\ncommunication\" a broad definition:\n\n            The   term    'electronic   communication'   is\n            intended    to   cover    a   broad  range   of\n            communication activities . . . . As a rule, a\n            communication is an electronic communication\n            if it is neither carried by sound waves nor\n            can fairly be characterized as one containing\n            the human voice (carried in part by wire).\n            Communications consisting solely of data, for\n            example    .   .    .   would    be  electronic\n            communications.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 99-647 (1986), at 35.             By incorporating electronic\n\ncommunications into the Wiretap Act, the bill largely rejected\n\nDOJ's    view    that   e-mail    should    receive     no   (or    little)     more\n\nprotection than first class mail.           See H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 22\n\n(explaining why e-mail differs from regular mail).                  Nevertheless,\n\nbecause   some    of    DOJ's    specific    concerns    were      addressed,   DOJ\n\nacknowledged that \"the bill has been substantially modified to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\faccommodate     our   concerns\"   and   supported     it.     Id.   at     30-31.\n\n                      b.   The broad definition of electronic storage\n\n           Responding to concerns raised in the OTA Report, Congress\n\nsought to ensure that the messages and by-product files that are\n\nleft behind after transmission, as well as messages stored in a\n\nuser's mailbox, are protected from unauthorized access.                    E-mail\n\nmessages   in   the    sender's   and   recipient's    computers     could     be\n\naccessed by electronically \"breaking into\" those computers and\n\nretrieving the files.      OTA Report at 48-49.        Before the ECPA, the\n\nvictim of such an attack had few legal remedies for such an\n\ninvasion. Furthermore, the e-mail messages retained on the service\n\nprovider's computers after transmission -- which, the report noted,\n\nare primarily retained for \"billing purposes and as a convenience\n\nin case the customer loses the message\" -- could be accessed and\n\npossibly disclosed by the provider.         Id. at 50.       Before the ECPA,\n\nit was not clear whether the user had the right to challenge such\n\na disclosure. Id. Similar concerns applied to temporary financial\n\nrecords and personal data retained after transmission.               Id.\n\n           Given this background and the evidence in the legislative\n\nhistory that Congress responded to the OTA Report in refining the\n\nlegislation, see, e.g., House Hearings at 42-73, it appears that\n\nCongress had in mind these types of pre- and post-transmission\n\n\"temporary,     intermediate      storage   of   a    wire    or    electronic\n\ncommunication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof,\"\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fsee 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17),           when it established the definition of\n\n\"electronic storage.\"         Its aim was simply to protect such data.\n\nSee infra Part II.C.1 (describing the Stored Communications Act).\n\nThere is no indication that it meant to exclude the type of storage\n\nused during transmission from the scope of the Wiretap Act.\n\n                      c.     The electronic storage clause in the\n                             definition of \"wire communication\"\n\n               The original version of the ECPA of 1986 included the\n\ndefinition of \"electronic storage\" as it reads today, but did not\n\ninclude        electronic    storage       in   the    definition     of     \"wire\n\ncommunication.\"       132 Cong. Rec. S7,991 (June 19, 1986).               Neither\n\nSenator Leahy's floor statement upon introducing the bill nor the\n\nstaff bill summary mentioned voice mail in the context of the\n\nWiretap Act amendments.         See id.; cf. H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 63\n\n(mentioning voice mail in the context of Stored Communications\n\nAct).        Voice mail had not, apparently, been a major subject of\n\ndiscussion in the context of the ECPA.12\n\n               Similarly, when Representative Kastenmeier introduced his\n\nidentical bill in the House, he did not mention voice mail in his\n\nremarks.        See   132   Cong.   Rec.    H4,039    (June   23,   1986).    The\n\nelectronic storage clause in the wire communications definition\n\nfirst appeared in Senate committee markup after the House had\n\nalready passed the bill without the clause. See 132 Cong. Rec.\n\n\n        12\n      For example, it was not mentioned in the OTA Report or DOJ's\ncomments in the House or Senate hearings.\n\n                                       -23-\n\fS14,441 (Oct. 1, 1986). Senator Leahy, in his statement in support\n\nof the amended bill, specifically mentioned voice mail, which he\n\nhad not done in his remarks earlier that year, and the staff\n\nsummary explained that one effect of the amended bill was that\n\n\"[w]ire communications in storage, like voice mail, remain wire\n\ncommunications.\"    Id. (emphasis added).13\n\n           If the addition of the electronic storage clause to the\n\ndefinition   of    \"wire   communication\"   was   intended   to   remove\n\nelectronic communications from the scope of the Wiretap Act for the\n\nbrief instants during which they are in temporary storage en route\n\nto their destinations -- which, as it turns out, are often the\n\npoints where it is technologically easiest to intercept those\n\ncommunications -- neither of the Senate co-sponsors saw fit to\n\nmention this to their colleagues, and no one, evidently, remarked\n\nupon it.     No document or legislator ever suggested that the\n\naddition of the electronic storage clause to the definition of\n\n\"wire communication\" would take messages in electronic storage out\n\nof the definition of \"electronic communication.\"      Indeed, we doubt\n\nthat Congress contemplated the existential oddity that Councilman's\n\ninterpretation creates: messages -- conceded by stipulation to be\n\n\n\n     13\n      The   summary   also  noted   that   \"[c]ertain   electronic\ncommunications are exempted from the coverage of the bill\" and\nlisted the exceptions contained in 18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(g), none of\nwhich are relevant here.      Id.   Nowhere did it suggest that\nelectronic communications that were briefly in temporary storage\nwere exempted from the coverage of the bill.\n\n                                  -24-\n\felectronic      communications      --    briefly            cease       to   be    electronic\n\ncommunications for very short intervals, and then suddenly become\n\nelectronic communications again.               Cf. H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 35\n\n(\"The term 'electronic communication' is intended to cover a broad\n\nrange    of    communication      activities        .        .   .   .

Indeed, that is exactly what happened when\n\nCongress      later   removed     the    explicit        reference            to   \"electronic\n\nstorage\" from the definition of \"wire communication\" in the Uniting\n\nand Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required\n\nto Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act, Pub.

Conclusion\n\n              We conclude that the term \"electronic communication\"\n\nincludes transient electronic storage that is intrinsic to the\n\ncommunication process for such communications.          That conclusion is\n\nconsistent with our precedent. See Blumofe v. Pharmatrak, Inc. (In\n\nre Pharmatrak Privacy Litig.), 329 F.3d 9, 21 (1st Cir. 2003) (a\n\nrigid \"storage-transit dichotomy . . . may be less than apt to\n\naddress current problems\");14 see also Hall v. EarthLink Network,\n\nInc., 396 F.3d 500, 503 n.1 (2d Cir. 2005) (rejecting arguments\n\nthat \"communication over the Internet can only be electronic\n\ncommunication while it is in transit, not while it is in electronic\n\nstorage\").         Consequently, in this context we reject Councilman's\n\nproposed distinction between \"in transit\" and \"in storage.\"\n\nB.            \"Intercept\"\n\n              Even though we conclude that the temporarily stored e-\n\nmail messages at issue here constitute electronic communications\n\nwithin the scope of the Wiretap Act, the statute also requires the\n\nconduct alleged in the indictment to be an \"intercept[ion].\"             18\n\nU.S.C.    §    2511(1)    (making   it   an   offense   to   \"intentionally\n\nintercept[], endeavor[] to intercept, or procure[] any other person\n\n\n     14\n      Pharmatrak arose from a tracking program that surreptitiously\ntransmitted information about users' web browsing activity to a\nthird party. Web sites using the service added to their web pages\nan instruction to download an invisible image from the Pharmatrak\nweb site. This caused the user's computer to communicate directly\nto Pharmatrak's web server, which recorded information about the\nuser and her browsing activity. See id. at 13-14.\n\n                                     -26-\n\fto intercept or endeavor to intercept, any . . . electronic\n\ncommunication\").            The term \"intercept\" is defined broadly as \"the\n\naural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic,\n\nor     oral    communication       through      the   use    of   any    electronic,\n\nmechanical, or other device.\"            Id. § 2510(4).\n\n               Councilman's core argument on appeal is that because the\n\nmessages at issue, when acquired, were in transient electronic\n\nstorage,       they    were      not   \"electronic      communication[s]\"       and,\n\ntherefore, section 2511(1)'s prohibition on \"intercept[ion]\" of any\n\n\"electronic communication\" did not apply.                    That is the argument\n\nthat we have now rejected in holding that an e-mail message does\n\nnot cease to be an \"electronic communication\" during the momentary\n\nintervals, intrinsic to the communication process, at which the\n\nmessage resides in transient electronic storage.                      See supra Part\n\nII.A.\n\n               Councilman's appeal does not provide any other basis for\n\nfinding       that    the    acquisitions    were     not    \"intercept[ions]\"    of\n\n\"electronic communication[s].\"              To be sure, Councilman does argue\n\nthat     \"Congress      intended       'intercept'      to    cover     acquisitions\n\n'contemporaneous with transmission.'\" However, his entire argument\n\non this point is based on the theory, as he writes in his brief,\n\nthat \"[c]ourts uniformly have understood 'electronic storage' to\n\nnegate the 'contemporaneous with transmission' element of a Wiretap\n\nAct 'intercept,'\" and therefore \"an e-mail in 'electronic storage'\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\f. . . cannot by definition be acquired 'contemporaneous with\n\ntransmission.'\"           That argument is simply a variation on, and\n\nentirely subsumed within, his primary argument concerning \"storage\"\n\n-- the very argument that we have now rejected.\n\n             Consequently, this appeal does not implicate the question\n\nof whether the term \"intercept\" applies only to acquisitions that\n\noccur contemporaneously with the transmission of a message from\n\nsender to recipient or, instead, extends to an event that occurs\n\nafter   a   message       has    crossed     the   finish     line    of    transmission\n\n(whatever that point may be).                See Pharmatrak, 329 F.3d at 21-22\n\n(noting     that    the    concept      of    a    contemporaneity          or   real-time\n\nrequirement, which evolved in other factual contexts, may not be\n\napt to address issues involving the application of the Wiretap Act\n\nto electronic communications).               We therefore need not decide that\n\nquestion.     See United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (noting that, in certain circumstances, an appellee is\n\nobliged, on pain of waiver, to raise additional or alternative\n\nbases for affirming a favorable judgment); Raxton Corp. v. Anania\n\nAssocs., Inc., 668 F.2d 622, 624 (1st Cir. 1982) (emphasizing the\n\nimportance     of    \"[t]he       presentation       on   appeal       of    all    viable\n\njustifications of a judgment\").\n\n             That ends this aspect of the matter.                    Because the facts\n\nof   this    case    and        the   arguments      before     us    do     not    invite\n\nconsideration of either the existence or the applicability of a\n\n\n                                           -28-\n\fcontemporaneity or real-time requirement, we need not and do not\n\nplunge into that morass.               We note, however, that even were we\n\nprepared to recognize a contemporaneity or real-time requirement --\n\na step that we do not take today -- we think it highly unlikely\n\nthat    Councilman      could        generate    a    winning      argument     in     the\n\ncircumstances of this case.               Any such argument would entail a\n\nshowing   that      each    transmission        was   complete     at    the    time    of\n\nacquisition and, therefore, that the definition of \"intercept\" does\n\nnot cover the acquisitions.              Such a showing would appear to be\n\nimpossible      since      we   have    concluded      that     the     messages     were\n\nelectronic communications, and it is undisputed that they were\n\nacquired while they were still en route to the intended recipients.\n\nC.            Intersection of the               Wiretap     Act    and    the      Stored\n              Communications Act\n\n              Thus far we have considered only the Wiretap Act, not the\n\nStored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2701-2712, because the\n\nindictment only alleged a violation of the former.                          Councilman\n\nargues that acquisition of electronic communications in temporary\n\nelectronic storage is regulated by the Stored Communications Act.\n\nFrom this he infers that such acquisition is not regulated by the\n\nWiretap Act, or that, at minimum, the potential overlap implicates\n\nthe    rule    of   lenity      or    other     doctrines     of    \"fair      warning.\"\n\nConsequently, we must delve into the \"complex, often convoluted\"\n\nintersection of the Wiretap Act and Stored Communications Act.\n\nUnited States v. Smith, 155 F.3d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir. 1998).\n\n                                          -29-\n\f           1.          The Stored Communications Act's Coverage\n\n           While drafting the ECPA's amendments to the Wiretap Act,\n\nCongress also recognized that, with the rise of remote computing\n\noperations and large databanks of stored electronic communications,\n\nthreats to individual privacy extended well beyond the bounds of\n\nthe   Wiretap       Act's    prohibition    against    the    \"interception\"      of\n\ncommunications.        These types of stored communications -- including\n\nstored e-mail messages -- were not protected by the Wiretap Act.\n\nTherefore, Congress concluded that \"the information [in these\n\ncommunications] may be open to possible wrongful use and public\n\ndisclosure by law enforcement authorities as well as unauthorized\n\nprivate parties.\"           S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 3 (1986), reprinted in\n\n1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3557.\n\n           Congress         added   Title   II   to   the   ECPA   to   halt   these\n\npotential intrusions on individual privacy.                 This title, commonly\n\nreferred to as the Stored Communications Act,15 established new\n\npunishments for accessing, without (or in excess of) authorization,\n\nan electronic communications service facility and thereby obtaining\n\naccess to a wire or electronic communication in electronic storage.\n\n18    U.S.C.    §     2701(a).       Another     provision     bars     electronic\n\ncommunications service providers from \"divulg[ing] to any person or\n\n\n\n      15\n      As noted, Title I of the ECPA amended the 1968 Wiretap Act.\nBy \"Wiretap Act,\" we mean the 1968 Wiretap Act as amended by Title\nI of the ECPA. We refer to Title II of the ECPA simply as the\nStored Communications Act.\n\n                                        -30-\n\fentity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage\n\nby that service.\"   Id. § 2702(a)(1).\n\n          The   privacy   protections   established   by   the   Stored\n\nCommunications Act were intended to apply to two categories of\n\ncommunications defined by the statutory term \"electronic storage\":\n\n          (A) any temporary, intermediate storage of a\n          wire or electronic communication incidental to\n          the electronic transmission thereof; and\n          (B) any storage of such communication by an\n          electronic communication service for purposes\n          of backup protection of such communication.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2510(17); id. § 2711(a) (incorporating Wiretap Act\n\ndefinitions into Stored Communications Act).    The first category,\n\nwhich is relevant here, refers to temporary storage, such as when\n\na message sits in an e-mail user's mailbox after transmission but\n\nbefore the user has retrieved the message from the mail server.\n\n          Councilman's conduct may appear to fall under the Stored\n\nCommunications Act's main criminal provision:\n\n          (a) Offense. Except as provided in subsection\n          (c) of this section whoever--\n                  (1) intentionally accesses without\n                  authorization a facility through which\n                  an electronic communication service is\n                  provided; or\n                  (2) intentionally exceeds an\n                  authorization to access that\n                  facility;\n          and thereby obtains, alters, or prevents\n          authorized access to a wire or electronic\n          communication while it is in electronic\n          storage in such system shall be punished\n          . . . .\n\n\n\n\n                                -31-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 2701(a).       At the same time, Councilman would arguably\n\nbe exempted by the Stored Communications Act's provider exception:\n\n\"Subsection (a) of this section does not apply with respect to\n\nconduct authorized (1) by the person or entity providing a wire or\n\nelectronic communications service.\"        Id. § 2701(c).      Under this\n\ntheory, § 2701(c)(1) establishes virtually complete immunity for a\n\nservice provider that \"obtains, alters, or prevents authorized\n\naccess to\" e-mail that is \"in electronic storage\" in its system.\n\nSee Fraser, 352 F.3d at 115 (\"[W]e read § 2701(c) literally to\n\nexcept from Title II's protection all searches by communications\n\nservice providers.\").      The district court surmised that § 2701(a)\n\nwould have covered Councilman's conduct but that § 2701(c)(1)\n\nexempted him.     Councilman, 245 F. Supp. 2d at 320.\n\n          A second provision of the Stored Communications Act\n\nprohibits \"a person or entity providing an electronic communication\n\nservice to the public [from] knowingly divulg[ing] to any person or\n\nentity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage\n\nby that service.\"     18 U.S.C. § 2702(a)(1).          Yet this provision,\n\ntoo, has service provider exceptions, permitting a provider to\n\ndivulge an electronic communication \"to a person employed or\n\nauthorized   or    whose    facilities    are   used    to   forward   such\n\ncommunication to its destination,\" id. § 2702(b)(4), or \"as may be\n\nnecessarily incident to the rendition of the service or to the\n\nprotection of the rights or property of the provider of that\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\fservice,\" id. § 2702(b)(5). We assume, dubitante, that one or both\n\nof these provisions would exempt Councilman under § 2702.\n\n           On this premise, he argues that if he is not liable under\n\nthe Stored Communications Act, then he cannot be liable under the\n\nWiretap Act either.        Since Congress enacted the ECPA as a package,\n\nhe says, it did not intend to lay traps in the overlap between the\n\ntwo titles. If conduct that potentially falls under both titles is\n\nexempt from one of them, then that exemption provides a \"safe\n\nharbor\" and the conduct does not violate the other title either.\n\n           We find this argument unpersuasive.              In general, if two\n\nstatutes cover the same conduct, the government may charge a\n\nviolation of either.        See United States v. Herring, 993 F.2d 784,\n\n788 n.4 (11th Cir. 1993) (en banc) (\"The overlapping coverage of\n\nthe Wiretap Act and the Communications Act [of 1934] presents no\n\nproblem.   In such a case, the prosecution has the right to select\n\nthe   statute     under    which    the   indictment    will   be   brought.\").\n\nMoreover, the exceptions in the Stored Communications Act do not,\n\nby their terms, apply to the Wiretap Act.                   The exception in\n\n§ 2701(c) specifically limits its application by stating that\n\n\"[s]ubsection (a) of this section does not apply . . . to conduct\n\nauthorized\" by the service provider.                 (Emphasis added).      The\n\n§ 2701(c)(1) provider exception's breadth presents a striking\n\ncontrast     to   the     Wiretap   Act's     own,   much   narrower   provider\n\nexception:\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\f            It shall not be unlawful under this chapter\n            for . . . an officer, employee, or agent of a\n            provider of wire or electronic communication\n            service, whose facilities are used in the\n            transmission   of   a   wire   or   electronic\n            communication, to intercept, disclose, or use\n            that communication in the normal course of his\n            employment while engaged in any activity which\n            is a necessary incident to the rendition of\n            his service or to the protection of the rights\n            or property of the provider of that service\n            . . . .\n\nId. § 2511(2)(a)(i) (emphasis added).      It is indisputable that the\n\nWiretap Act's narrower service provider exception would not protect\n\nCouncilman.      His alleged conduct was clearly not \"a necessary\n\nincident to the rendition of his service or to the protection of\n\nthe rights or property of the provider of that service.\"         If there\n\nwere any doubt remaining, it would be resolved by the Wiretap Act's\n\nexpress provision that the only exceptions to its prohibitions are\n\nthose specifically listed within the Wiretap Act, not those found\n\nin other laws.       See 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1) (prohibitions apply\n\n\"[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter [the\n\nWiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522]\") (emphasis added).\n\n            2.     Fair Warning\n\n            Councilman argues in the alternative that the two titles\n\nare sufficiently confusing that principles of fair warning require\n\ndismissal of the indictment. Those principles are expressed in the\n\nlaw through three related doctrines: the rule of lenity, the\n\nvagueness   doctrine,   and   the   prohibition   against   unforeseeably\n\nexpansive judicial constructions. See United States v. Lanier, 520\n\n                                    -34-\n\fU.S. 259, 266-67 (1997); United States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9,\n\n14-16 (1st Cir. 2003).    We address each in turn.\n\n                 a.      Lenity\n\n          Under the rule of lenity, grievous ambiguity in a penal\n\nstatute is resolved in the defendant's favor. See Lanier, 520 U.S.\n\nat 266. \"The simple existence of some statutory ambiguity, however,\n\nis not sufficient to warrant application of that rule, for most\n\nstatutes are ambiguous to some degree.\" Muscarello v. United\n\nStates, 524 U.S. 125, 138-39 (1998). Rather, the rule only applies\n\nif \"there is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute.\"\n\nId. at 139 (quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nFurthermore, lenity \"applies only if, after seizing everything from\n\nwhich aid can be derived, [a court] can make no more than a guess\n\nas to what Congress intended.\"      Reno v. Koray, 515 U.S. 50, 65\n\n(1995) (quotation marks and citation omitted); accord United States\n\nv. Balint, 201 F.3d 928, 935 (7th Cir. 2000) (\"The rule of lenity\n\nis unavailable to us if the purported ambiguity in a statute can be\n\nresolved through normal methods of statutory construction.\").\n\n          Here, while the statute contains some textual ambiguity,\n\nit is not \"grievous.\" We have construed it using traditional tools\n\nof construction, particularly legislative history, and lenity is\n\ntherefore inapplicable.     See, e.g., Dixson v. United States, 465\n\nU.S. 482, 491 (1984) (\"If the legislative history fails to clarify\n\nthe statutory language, our rule of lenity would compel us to\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\fconstrue     the   statute   in    favor    of   petitioners,   as   criminal\n\ndefendants in these cases.\") (emphasis added).\n\n             Furthermore,    Congress      specifically   anticipated   that\n\ncommunication service providers might, in good faith, misapprehend\n\ntheir lawful ability to intercept or disclose communications in\n\ncertain circumstances.        Congress addressed that problem with a\n\nbroad, affirmative good faith defense:\n\n             A good faith reliance on . . . (3) a good\n             faith determination that [§ 2511(3)] permitted\n             the conduct complained of[] is a complete\n             defense against any civil or criminal action\n             brought under [the Wiretap Act] or any other\n             law.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2520(d)(3).16         Section 2511(3), in turn, authorizes a\n\ncommunication service provider to divulge a communication to one\n\nother than the recipient in four specified circumstances.17             Thus,\n\n\n     16\n      Section 2520(d) originated with the 1968 Wiretap Act, which\nspecified that \"[a] good faith reliance on a court order or on the\nprovisions of [18 U.S.C. § 2518(7) (emergency wiretaps)] shall\nconstitute a complete defense to any civil or criminal action\nbrought under this chapter.\" Pub. L. No. 90-851, sec. 802, § 2520,\n82 Stat. at 223. After various other amendments not relevant here,\nsee generally Jacobson v. Rose, 592 F.2d 515, 522-23 & nn. 13-15\n(9th Cir. 1978) (recounting pre-ECPA history of provision), the\nECPA broadened the types of authority on which the defense could be\nbased. ECPA § 103, 100 Stat. at 1854.\n     17\n          Those circumstances are:\n\n     (i) as otherwise authorized in section 2511(2)(a) or 2517\n     . . .\n     (ii) with the lawful consent of the originator or any\n     addressee or intended recipient of such communication;\n     (iii) to a person employed or authorized, or whose\n     facilities are used, to forward such communication to its\n     destination; or\n\n                                     -36-\n\fCongress contemplated that service providers might, in good faith,\n\nmisunderstand the limits of their authority on a particular set of\n\nfacts, and provided a statutory mechanism to solve this problem.\n\nWe may neither expand the good faith defense's scope, nor convert\n\nit from a fact-based affirmative defense to a basis for dismissing\n\nan indictment on legal grounds.18\n\n                   b.    Vagueness\n\n           The vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of a statute\n\nwhose terms are \"so vague that men of common intelligence must\n\nnecessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\"\n\nLanier, 520 U.S. at 266 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nBut   vagueness    is   more   than   just    \"garden-variety,   textual\n\nambiguity.\"    Sabetti v. Dipaolo, 16 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(Breyer, C.J.).    \"Many statutes will have some inherent vagueness,\n\nfor    '[i]n   most     English   words      and   phrases   there   lurk\n\nuncertainties.'\"      Rose v. Locke, 423 U.S. 48, 49-50 (1975) (per\n\ncuriam) (citation omitted).       But a statute is unconstitutionally\n\nvague only if it \"prohibits . . . an act in terms so uncertain that\n\n\n\n\n      (iv) [if the communications] were inadvertently obtained\n      by the service provider and which appear to pertain to\n      the commission of a crime, if such divulgence is made to\n      a law enforcement agency.\n\n      18 U.S.C. §§ 2511(3)(b)(i)-(iv).\n      18\n      Nothing in this opinion prejudices Councilman's ability to\nargue the good faith defense in subsequent proceedings.\n\n                                   -37-\n\fpersons of average intelligence would have no choice but to guess\n\nat its meaning and modes of application.\"             Hussein, 351 F.3d at 14.\n\n            The Wiretap Act is not unconstitutionally vague in its\n\napplication here.       From its text, a person of average intelligence\n\nwould, at the very least, be on notice that \"[e]xcept as otherwise\n\nspecifically provided in\" the Act, \"electronic communication[s],\"\n\nwhich are defined expansively, may not be \"intercepted.\" 18 U.S.C.\n\n§   2511(1)(a).          An    exception      is   provided     for    electronic\n\ncommunication service providers, but it only applies to \"activity\n\nwhich is a necessary incident to the rendition of [the] service or\n\nto the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that\n\nservice.\"     18 U.S.C. § 2511(2)(a)(i).            The Act puts the service\n\nprovider on notice of both the prohibited conduct and the narrow\n\nprovider exception.       That is adequate notice.\n\n                    c.        Unforeseeably expansive interpretation\n\n            Finally, the third branch of fair warning doctrine \"bars\n\ncourts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to\n\nconduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision\n\nhas fairly disclosed to be within its scope.\"               Lanier, 520 U.S. at\n\n266.      This    doctrine       principally       \"bars    'unforeseeable     and\n\nretroactive judicial expansion of narrow and precise statutory\n\nlanguage.'\"      Hussein, 351 F.3d at 14 (citation omitted); accord\n\nBalint,   201    F.3d    at    935   (doctrine     only    applies    if   judicial\n\ninterpretations \"amount to an unpredictable shift in the law\").\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\f               That doctrine does not apply here.                      The simplest reading\n\nof    the   statute        is   that        the    e-mail      messages      were    \"electronic\n\ncommunications\" under the statute at the point where they were\n\nintercepted.             One must apply tools of statutory construction to\n\nremove the conduct from the statute's ambit by interpreting a\n\nsubtlety in the definition of \"wire communications.\" Whatever else\n\none    might       say    about       the    Wiretap       Act,    \"intercept[ing]       .   .   .\n\nelectronic communication[s],\" 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a), is \"conduct\n\nthat . . . the statute . . . has fairly disclosed to be within its\n\nscope,\" Lanier, 520 U.S. at 266.\n\n               Indeed, a 1997 law review article observed that, under a\n\nnarrow      interpretation            of     the    ECPA's       \"intercept\"        prohibition,\n\n\"unless some type of automatic routing software is used (for\n\nexample,       a     duplicate          of        all     an    employee's      messages     are\n\nautomatically sent to the employee's boss), interception of E-mail\n\nwithin the prohibition of the ECPA is virtually impossible.\"\n\nJarrod J. White, E-Mail @ Work.com: Employer Monitoring of Employee\n\nE-Mail, 48 Ala. L. Rev. 1079, 1083 (1997) (emphasis added); see\n\nalso     Pharmatrak,            329     F.3d        at    22      (quoting     this     language\n\napprovingly).             Thus, almost a year before Councilman's alleged\n\nconduct, the academic literature had noted that, even under a\n\nreading     of     the     ECPA   narrower          than       ours,   \"automatic        routing\n\nsoftware\" that automatically forwarded duplicate copies of a user's\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -39-\n\fmessages would qualify as \"interception of E-mail within the\n\nprohibition of the ECPA.\"          Id.    That observation anticipated this\n\ncase.19\n\n                                         III.\n\n               Although the text of the statute does not specify whether\n\nthe term \"electronic communication\" includes communications in\n\nelectronic storage, the legislative history of the ECPA indicates\n\nthat        Congress   intended    the    term     to     be   defined   broadly.\n\nFurthermore, that history confirms that Congress did not intend, by\n\nincluding       electronic    storage     within    the    definition    of   wire\n\ncommunications, to thereby exclude electronic storage from the\n\ndefinition of electronic communications.\n\n               We   therefore     conclude      that    the    term   \"electronic\n\ncommunication\"         includes   transient      electronic    storage   that   is\n\nintrinsic to the communication process, and hence that interception\n\nof an e-mail message in such storage is an offense under the\n\nWiretap Act.        Moreover, the various doctrines of fair warning do\n\n\n\n\n       19\n      The dissent says that \"White's article, like other\nscholarship available at the time, thus would have forcefully\nsuggested that Councilman's conduct was not prohibited.\" Post at\n51 (Torruella, J., dissenting).    That is not so.    Although the\narticle described the implications of the Fifth Circuit opinion in\nSteve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Serv., 36 F.3d\n457, 458 (5th Cir. 1994), it identified the possibility that, even\nunder that case's narrow view of the intercept prohibition, there\nis a category of automatic e-mail routing software that might, in\nsome situations, violate the Wiretap Act.\n\n                                         -40-\n\fnot bar prosecution for that offense.   Consequently, the district\n\ncourt erred in dismissing the indictment.\n\n          Judgment   vacated.   Remanded   for   further   proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                 - Dissenting Opinion Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                                -41-\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, with whom CYR, Senior Circuit\n\nJudge, joins (Dissenting).      Although I commend Judge Lipez on his\n\nerudite and articulate majority opinion, I am impeded from joining\n\nthe same for two reasons.           First, the indictment is legally\n\ninsufficient to establish a criminal violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371\n\nfor conspiracy to violate the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2511,\n\ninsofar as the e-mails Councilman is alleged to have retrieved were\n\nin \"electronic storage,\" 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17), when that action\n\ntook place, and therefore, the Wiretap Act's requisite element of\n\n\"interception,\" 18 U.S.C. § 2511, is lacking. See United States v.\n\nCouncilman, 373 F.3d 197, 200-04 (1st Cir. 2004).              Second, and in\n\nthe   alternative,   the   result   reached   by   the    en   banc   majority\n\ndeprives Councilman of due process of law, because he had no \"fair\n\nwarning\" of the potential criminal consequences of his actions.\n\nSee United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 265 (1997).\n\n           But for the juxtaposition of our respective views, there\n\nis not much new in the positions of the majority and dissent from\n\nthose presented by the panel opinion except that, by reason of the\n\nmajority's conclusion that the indictment charges a valid criminal\n\nviolation, we are required to discuss Councilman's due process\n\nclaim, which the panel did not have to reach.            See Councilman, 373\n\nF.3d at 204 n.7.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -42-\n\f                                        I.\n\n             The facts of this case as stipulated by the parties state\n\nthat    \"[a]t     all   times   that   sendmail    and   procmail   performed\n\noperations affecting the email messages at issue, the messages\n\nexisted in the random access memory (RAM) or in hard disks, or\n\nboth, within Interloc's computer system.\"            (Emphasis added).\n\n             Stripped of all technical jargon, the sole legal issue\n\npresented by this appeal is whether the information contained in\n\nthis computer system is data that can be \"intercepted\" within the\n\nmeaning of the Wiretap Act.        The answer to that question is not to\n\nbe found in the wringing of the proverbial hands or dire warnings\n\nof the Doomsday that is predicted to follow one or the other\n\nconclusion.       Cf. Yvette Joy Liebesman, The Potential Effects of\n\nUnited States v. Councilman on the Confidentiality of Attorney-\n\nClient E-Mail Communications, 18 Geog. J. Legal Ethics 893 (2005).\n\nRather,     the   answer   lies   in   a     dispassionate   reading   of   the\n\nlegislation20 upon which the criminal charges are based.\n\n             The statute that Councilman is charged with conspiring to\n\nviolate provides for criminal sanctions against \"any person who --\n\n(a) intentionally intercepts,21 endeavors to intercept, or procures\n\n\n       20\n      As in the majority's opinion, statutory references herein are\nto the pre-2001 version of the Wiretap Act. See maj. op. at 6,\nn.4.\n       21\n      The term \"intercept\" is defined as \"the aural or other\nacquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral\ncommunication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or\n\n                                       -43-\n\fany other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire,\n\noral, or electronic communication.\"             18 U.S.C. § 2511(1) (emphasis\n\nadded).      The term \"electronic communication\" is defined as \"any\n\ntransfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or\n\nintelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by wire,\n\nradio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system.\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2510(12).         In contrast, the term \"wire communication\"\n\nis defined as \"any aural transfer made in whole or in part through\n\nthe use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the\n\naid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of\n\norigin and the point of reception . . . furnished or operated by\n\nany person engaged in providing or operating such facilities . . .\n\nand   such     term      includes   any     electronic    storage22     of      such\n\ncommunication.\"         18 U.S.C. § 2510(1) (emphasis added).\n\n             It   is    Congress'   failure     to   provide    this   emphasized\n\nlanguage in its definition of \"electronic communication\" that\n\nincites the majority into engaging in what I believe to be an\n\nunfortunate       act    of   judicial    legislation    that    no    amount    of\n\nsyllogization can camouflage. The lacuna between the definition of\n\n\n\nother device.\"         18 U.S.C. § 2510(4).\n      22\n      \"Electronic storage\" is broadly defined as \"(A) any\ntemporary, intermediate storage of a wire or electronic\ncommunication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof;\nand (B) any storage of such communication by an electronic\ncommunication service for purposes of backup protection of such\ncommunication.\" 18 U.S.C. § 2510(17) (emphasis added).\n\n                                         -44-\n\f\"wire communication\" and that of \"electronic communication\" can\n\nonly be bridged by the body that created it; jurisprudential \"body\n\nEnglish\" does not suffice to fill that vacuum.                 Although nature\n\nabhors a vacuum, it has no power over legislative oversights.\n\n             In finding the correct legal answer to the non-existent\n\ndilemma which the majority believes exists, we need go no further\n\nthan   our   own    In    re   Hart,   in   which,   apropos   of   the   present\n\ncircumstances, we stated that, \"[w]hen Congress includes particular\n\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another\n\nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress\n\nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\n\nexclusion.\"        328 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Barnhart v.\n\nSigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 452 (2002)).                    Contrary to the\n\nmajority's assertions that this expressio unius presumption ought\n\nnot apply because the language in question was not part of a \"new,\n\nself-contained statute,\" maj. op. at 13, it is actually \"made\n\nstronger when, as here, Congress has amended a statute to include\n\ncertain language in some, but not all, provisions of the Statute.\"\n\nUnited States v. Steiger, 318 F.3d 1039, 1051 (11th Cir. 2003)\n\n(construing    the       Electronic    Communications   Privacy     Act),   cert.\n\ndenied, 538 U.S. 1051 (2003); see also United States v. Fisher, 6\n\nU.S. (2 Cranch) 358, 399 (1805) (\"Where a law is plain and\n\nunambiguous, whether it be expressed in general or limited terms,\n\n\n\n\n                                        -45-\n\fthe legislature should be intended to mean what they have plainly\n\nexpressed, and consequently no room is left for construction.\").\n\n           These   principles    are   particularly   relevant   to   the\n\ninterpretation of federal criminal statutes, for \"[f]ederal crimes\n\nare defined by Congress, not the courts,\" and thus \"policies of\n\nstrict construction\" should guide our actions. Lanier, 520 U.S. at\n\n267 n.6.\n\n           It is not by coincidence that every court that has passed\n\nupon the issue before us has reached a conclusion opposite to that\n\nof the en banc majority:        that the Wiretap Act's prohibition on\n\nintercepting electronic communications does not apply when they are\n\ncontained in electronic storage, whether such storage occurs pre-\n\nor post-delivery, and even if the storage lasts only a few mili-\n\nseconds.   See Theofel v. Farey-Jones, 359 F.3d 1066, 1077-78 (9th\n\nCir. 2004) (post-delivery); Fraser v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 352\n\nF.3d 107, 113-14 (3d Cir. 2003) (post-delivery); United States v.\n\nSteiger, 318 F.3d 1039, 1048-49 (11th Cir. 2003) (on hard drive),\n\ncert. denied, 538 U.S. 1051 (2003); Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines, 302\n\nF.3d 868, 878-79 (9th Cir. 2002) (on website server), cert. denied,\n\n537 U.S. 1193 (2003); Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States\n\nSecret Serv., 36 F.3d 457, 461-62 (5th Cir. 1994) (pre-retrieval);\n\nsee also United States v. Reyes, 922 F. Supp. 818, 836 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n1996) (finding no interception where messages were retrieved from\n\n\n\n\n                                   -46-\n\fpagers' memories prior to their retrieval by intended recipients\n\nbecause the messages were in \"electronic storage\").\n\n           Contrary    to     the   en     banc   majority's    view,   our\n\ninterpretation of the statute does not require that we assume that\n\nCongress contemplated the complete evisceration of the privacy\n\nprotections   for   e-mail.     When     considering   the   intra-computer\n\n\"interceptions\" at issue here, Congress rationally may well have\n\nconcluded that the public's privacy rights, or more specifically\n\nthose between an e-mail service provider and its own customers,\n\ncould be adequately controlled by normal contract principles rather\n\nthan by federal statute.      Councilman's \"interception\" of Interloc\n\ncustomers' e-mail was not akin to an interception engaged in by an\n\noutside party who was unrelated or unknown to the contracting\n\nparties.   When a customer signs up with an e-mail provider like\n\nInterloc, he routinely is asked to read and expressly sign off on\n\na privacy agreement which defines his expectations of privacy vis-\n\nà-vis the provider.     If the protections are inadequate, he may\n\ndecline the e-mail service and seek an alternative service contract\n\nwhich will afford him the protections he requires.             Neither the\n\nWiretap Act nor its legislative history forecloses the inference\n\nthat Congress, in its exclusion of \"electronic storage\" from the\n\ndefinition of \"electronic communication,\" intended to leave such\n\nmatters to the exigencies of the contracting parties.           If Interloc\n\n\n\n\n                                    -47-\n\fdid intercept its customers' messages in breach of a privacy\n\nagreement, the remedy lies in contract, not in the Wiretap Act.\n\n            I see no point in rummaging through the legislative\n\nhistory of a statute whose language, or more accurately, absence\n\nthereof, speaks for itself.        \"[W]hen the statute's language is\n\nplain, the sole function of the courts -- at least where the\n\ndisposition required by the text is not absurd -- is to enforce it\n\naccording to its terms.\"      Dodd v. United States, 125 S. Ct. 2478,\n\n2483 (2005) (quoting Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union\n\nPlanters Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6 (2000)).    This case presents the\n\nclassic example of \"legislative history [which] is itself often\n\nmurky,    ambiguous,   and   contradictory.\"   Exxon   Mobil   Corp.   v.\n\nAttapattah Servs., Inc., 125 S. Ct. 2611, 2626 (2005) (rev'g\n\nRosario Ortega v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc., 370 F.3d 124 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)).\n\n            Judicial investigation of legislative history\n            has a tendency to become, to borrow Judge\n            Leventhal's memorable phrase, an exercise in\n            'looking over a crowd and picking out your\n            friends.' . . . [J]udicial reliance on\n            legislative materials like committee reports,\n            which are not themselves subject to the\n            requirements   of   Article    I,   may   give\n            unrepresentative committee members--or worse\n            yet, unelected staffers and lobbyists--both\n            the power and incentive to attempt strategic\n            manipulations of legislative history to secure\n            results they were unable to achieve through\n            the statutory text.\n\nId.   In any event, I refer to the panel opinion on this point.\n\nCouncilman, 373 F.3d at 203-04.\n\n                                   -48-\n\f            I believe that both viewpoints on the first issue before\n\nthe en banc court have been adequately expressed.             Ultimately, it\n\nis up to the Supreme Court to determine which is correct, but, in\n\nmy view the government has attempted to fish with a net that has\n\nholes in it and is thus in need of repair.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Unfortunately,   the    matter      does   not   end    here.    As\n\ndemonstrated by the results of previous efforts by this and other\n\ncourts to grapple with the statute in question, any lingering\n\nambiguity   that   makes   room    for    the   majority's    interpretation\n\ncertainly qualifies as \"grievous,\" maj. op. at 35.                 Due process,\n\ntherefore, requires that the statute be construed against criminal\n\nliability, in accordance with the rule of lenity.            See Lanier, 520\n\nU.S. at 266; Huddleston v. United States, 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974).\n\nEven if the ambiguity is not so serious, and \"clarity at the\n\nrequisite level may be supplied by [the majority's] judicial gloss\n\non an otherwise uncertain statute, due process bars courts from\n\napplying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that\n\nneither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly\n\ndisclosed to be within its scope.\"              Lanier, 520 U.S. at 266.\n\nWhichever doctrine of \"fair warning\" one might apply, the bottom\n\nline is that the statute and the cases construing it did not make\n\nit \"reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant's\n\nconduct was criminal.\"     Id. at 267.\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\f           At   the   time    that   Councilman   allegedly    violated   the\n\nWiretap Act in 1998, he would have had available the following to\n\nguide his conduct:          (1) the statute in question, and (2) the\n\nJackson Games case (1994) and, tangentially, the Reyes case (1996).\n\nThere is little in any of these that would have given Councilman\n\nfair notice of the en banc majority's interpretation, which itself\n\nrequires   reliance    on    legislative    \"history\"   that   resembles   a\n\nByzantine maze.\n\n           Nor did the 1997 law review article cited by the majority\n\nrender the interpretation adopted today foreseeable.              Quite the\n\nopposite, in fact.      That article examined the decision in Steve\n\nJackson Games, 36 F.3d 457, in which the Fifth Circuit determined\n\nthat the pre-retrieval seizure of private e-mails stored on a\n\nbulletin board server did not constitute an \"intercept\" under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2511(1)(a).        White wrote:\n\n           Rejecting   the   appellant's  argument   that\n           logically seizure of something before it is\n           received should constitute interception, the\n           Steve Jackson Games court held that the E-mail\n           stored on the [bulletin board's] computer hard\n           drive was no longer in transmission, and thus\n           could not be intercepted within the meaning of\n           18 U.S.C. S 2511(1)(a). . . . The narrowness\n           of the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of\n           \"interception\" is important.     Following the\n           Fifth Circuit's rationale, there is only a\n           narrow   window    during  which    an  E-mail\n           interception may occur -- the seconds or\n           mili-seconds before which a newly composed\n           message is saved to any temporary location\n           following a send command. Therefore, unless\n           some type of automatic routing software is\n           used (for example, a duplicate of all an\n\n                                     -50-\n\f            employee's messages are automatically sent to\n            the employee's boss), interception of E-mail\n            within the prohibition of the ECPA is\n            virtually impossible.\n\n\nWhite, supra, at 1082-83 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nClearly, the software used by Councilman was not \"automatic routing\n\nsoftware\" that operates \"before a newly composed message is saved\n\nto any temporary location.\"    Id. at 1083.   White's article, like\n\nother scholarship available at the time, thus would have forcefully\n\nsuggested that Councilman's conduct was not prohibited. See Thomas\n\nR. Greenberg, E-Mail and Voice Mail:      Employee Privacy and the\n\nFederal Wiretap Statute, 44 Am. U. L. Rev. 219, 249 (1994) (\"Thus,\n\nthe limitations imposed on employer interceptions of wire and\n\nelectronic communications vanish once the same communication is in\n\nstorage.    Accordingly, in order to avoid Title III liability, an\n\nemployer need only access employee communications once they have\n\nbeen stored.\"); Ruel Torres Hernández, ECPA and Online Computer\n\nPrivacy, 41 Fed. Comm. L.J. 17, 39 (1988-1989) (\"In other words,\n\nthere simply is no ECPA violation if the person or entity providing\n\na wire or electronic communication service intentionally examines\n\neverything [in storage] on the system, whether or not it is for the\n\npurpose of a quality control check.\") (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Thus, I am at a loss to conceive how Councilman would\n\nhave had fair notice of the majority's interpretation at the time\n\nof his actions.\n\n\n                                -51-\n\f           Finally, Congress's provision of a good faith exception\n\nfor those who divulge intercepted communications because they\n\nmisconstrued    the    Wiretap    Act's   narrow    exceptions     to    criminal\n\nliability as an affirmative defense, see maj. op. at 36-37 (citing\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2520(d)(3)), is irrelevant. Councilman should not have\n\nto show he relied on those exceptions to divulge the e-mails he\n\nobtained, because he had no \"reasonably clear\" indication that to\n\ndo so would otherwise violate the Wiretap Act.\n\n           Councilman is being held to a level of knowledge which\n\nwould not be expected of any of the judges who have dealt with this\n\nproblem,   to    say    nothing     of    \"men     [and   women]    of    common\n\nintelligence.\"    Lanier, 520 U.S. at 266 (quoting Connally v. Gen.\n\nConstr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926)).            If the issue presented be\n\n\"garden-variety,\" maj. op. at 37 (quoting Sabetti v. Diapaolo, 16\n\nF.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1994)), this is a garden in need of a weed\n\nkiller.\n\n           For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -52-\n\f",

We must decide whether interception of an e-mail message in temporary, transient electronic storage states an offense under the Wiretap Act, as amended by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-2522. The government believes it does, and indicted Councilman under that theory. The district court disagreed and dismissed the indictment. A divided panel of this court affirmed. We granted review en banc and now reverse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. An Introduction to Internet E-mail</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Internet is a network of interconnected computers. Data transmitted across the Internet are broken down into small \"packets\" that are forwarded from one computer to another until they reach their destination, where they are reconstituted. <i>See</i> Orin S. Kerr, <i>Internet Surveillance Law After the USA Patriot Act: The Big Brother that Isn't,</i> 97 Nw. U.L.Rev. 607, 613-14 (2003). Each service on the Internet &#8212; e.g., e-mail, the World Wide Web, or instant messaging &#8212; has its own protocol for using packets of data to transmit information from one place to another. The e-mail protocol is known as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (\"SMTP\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a user composes a message in an e-mail client program,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> a program called a mail transfer agent (\"MTA\") formats that message and sends it to another program that \"packetizes\" it and sends the packets out to the Internet. Computers on the network then pass the packets from one to another; each computer along the route stores the packets in memory, retrieves the addresses of their final destinations, and then determines where to send them next. At various points the packets are reassembled to form the original e-mail message, copied, and then repacketized for the next leg of the journey. <i>See</i> J. Klensin, <i>RFC 2821: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</i> (Apr.2001), <i>at</i> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt; Jonathan B. Postel, <i>RFC 821: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</i> (Aug.1982), <i>at</i> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc821.txt (\"<i>RFC 821</i>\"). Sometimes messages cannot be transferred immediately and must be saved for later delivery. Even when delivery is immediate, intermediate computers often retain backup copies, which they delete later. This method of transmission is commonly called \"store and forward\" delivery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once all the packets reach the recipient's mail server, they are reassembled to form the e-mail message. A mail delivery agent (\"MDA\") accepts the message from the MTA, determines which user should receive the message, and performs the actual delivery by placing the message in that user's mailbox. One popular MDA is \"procmail,\" which is controlled by short programs or scripts called \"recipe files.\" These recipe files can be used in various ways. For example, a procmail recipe can instruct the MDA to deposit mail addressed to one address into another user's mailbox (e.g., to send mail addressed to \"help\" to the tech support department), to reject mail from certain addresses, or to make copies of certain messages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the MDA has deposited a message into the recipient's mailbox, the recipient simply needs to use an e-mail client program to retrieve and read the message.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While the journey from sender to recipient may seem rather involved, it usually takes just a few seconds, with each intermediate step taking well under a second. <i>See, e.g.,</i> W. Houser et al., <i>RFC 1865: EDI Meets the Internet</i> (Jan.1996), <i>at</i> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1865.txt (\"For a modest amount of data with a dedicated connection, a message transmission would occur in a matter of seconds. . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Facts Alleged in the Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellee Bradford C. Councilman was Vice President of Interloc, Inc., which ran an online rare and out-of-print book listing service. As part of its service, Interloc gave book dealer customers an e-mail address at the domain \"interloc.com\" and acted as the e-mail provider. Councilman managed the e-mail service and the dealer subscription list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the indictment, in January 1998, Councilman directed Interloc employees to intercept and copy all incoming communications to subscriber dealers from Amazon.com, an Internet retailer that sells books and other products. Interloc's systems administrator modified the server's procmail recipe so that, before delivering any message from Amazon.com to the recipient's mailbox, procmail would copy the message and place the copy in a separate mailbox that Councilman could access. Thus, procmail would intercept and copy all incoming messages from Amazon.com before they were delivered to the recipient's mailbox, and therefore, before the intended recipient could read the message. This diversion intercepted thousands of messages, and Councilman and other Interloc employees routinely read the e-mail messages sent to Interloc subscribers in the hope of gaining a commercial advantage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 11, 2001, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Councilman. Count One charged him under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, the general federal criminal conspiracy statute, for conspiracy to violate the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> by intercepting electronic communications, disclosing their contents, using their contents, and causing a person providing an electronic communications service to divulge the communications' contents to persons other than the addressees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The object of the conspiracy was to exploit the content of e-mail from Amazon.com to dealers in order to develop a list of books, learn about competitors, and attain a commercial advantage for Interloc and its parent company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties stipulated to certain undisputed facts: the procmail recipe worked only within the confines of Interloc's computer; at all times at which procmail performed operations affecting the e-mail system, the messages existed \"in the random access memory (RAM) or in hard disks, or both, within Interloc's computer system\"; and each e-mail message, while traveling through wires, was an \"electronic communication\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(12).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense under the Wiretap Act, arguing that the intercepted e-mail messages were in \"electronic storage,\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(17), and therefore were not, as a matter of law, subject to the prohibition on \"intercept[ing] . . . electronic communication[s],\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1)(a). The district court initially denied the motion to dismiss. As trial preparation began, however, the district court <i>sua sponte</i> reconsidered its decision in light of the then-recently decided case of <i>Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc.,</i> 302 F.3d 868 (9th Cir.2002). After further briefing, the district court granted Councilman's motion to dismiss Count One, ruling that the messages were not, at the moment of interception, \"electronic communications\" under the Wiretap Act. <i>United States v. Councilman,</i> 245 F.Supp.2d 319 (D.Mass.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A divided panel of this court affirmed. <i>United States v. Councilman,</i> 373 F.3d 197 (1st Cir.2004). The majority concluded that, because the definition of \"wire communication\" includes \"electronic storage\" but the definition of \"electronic communication\" does not, the Wiretap Act's prohibition on \"intercept[ion]\" does not apply to messages that are, even briefly, in \"electronic storage.\" <i>Id.</i> at 200-04. The full court granted the government's petition for rehearing en banc. 385 F.3d 793 (1st Cir.2004) (per curiam). Because this is an appeal of an order dismissing an indictment on \"purely legal\" grounds, our review is <i>de novo, United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2002), and we assume the truth of the facts alleged in the indictment, <i>see Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States,</i> 487 U.S. 250, 261, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Wiretap Act of 1968<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> specified, <i>inter alia,</i> the conditions under which law enforcement officers could intercept wire communications, and the penalties for unauthorized private interceptions of wire communications. As amended by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848 (\"ECPA\"), the Act makes it an offense to \"intentionally intercept[], endeavor[] to intercept, or procure[] any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1). Two terms are at issue here: \"electronic communication\" and \"intercept.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman contends that the e-mail messages he obtained were not, when procmail copied them, \"electronic communication[s],\" and moreover the method by which they were copied was not \"intercept[ion]\" under the Act. Because these contentions raise important questions of statutory construction with broad ramifications, we discuss in some detail the Act's text, structure, and legislative history. We conclude that Councilman's interpretation of the Wiretap Act is inconsistent with Congress's intent. We then turn to whether Councilman had fair warning that the Act would be construed to cover his alleged conduct in a criminal case, and whether the rule of lenity or other principles require us to construe the Act in his favor. We find no basis to apply any of the fair warning doctrines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. \"Electronic Communication\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that \"electronic communication\" means what it says, and no less: \"any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo electronic or photooptical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce,\" with four specific exceptions not relevant here. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(12). Councilman argues, however, that Congress intended to exclude any communication that is in (even momentary) electronic storage. In his view, \"electronic communication[s]\" under the Wiretap Act are limited to communications traveling through wires between computers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Once a message enters a computer, he says, the message ceases (at least temporarily) to be an electronic communication protected by the Wiretap Act. He claims that Congress considered communications in computers to be worthy of less protection than communications in wires because users have a lower expectation of privacy for electronic communications that are in electronic storage even fleetingly, and that the Act embodies this understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Text</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin, as we must, with the statute's text. <i>United States v. Rosa-Ortiz,</i> 348 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir.2003). As noted above, the statutory definition of \"electronic communication\" is broad and, taken alone, would appear to cover incoming e-mail messages while the messages are being processed by the MTA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman argues, however, that the plain text of the statute exempts electronic communications that are in storage from the purview of the Wiretap Act. He contends that the definition of \"electronic communication\" must be read alongside the definition of \"wire communication\" and limited by what the latter includes but the former does not. The ECPA amended the 1968 definition of \"wire communication\" to specify that \"such term includes any electronic storage of such communication.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(1); ECPA &#167; 101(a)(1)(D), 100 Stat. at 1848. By contrast, the definition of \"<i>electronic</i> communication\" does not mention electronic storage. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(12).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Therefore, Councilman infers, Congress intended wire communications, <i>but not electronic communications,</i> to include electronic storage. Moreover, Congress defined \"electronic storage\" expansively to include \"any temporary, intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(17); <i>see Councilman,</i> 245 F.Supp.2d at 320 (describing this definition as \"extraordinarily &#8212; indeed, almost breathtakingly &#8212; broad\"). Since the parties stipulated that the messages in this case were \"in the random access memory (RAM) or in the hard disks, or both, within Interloc's computer system\" at the time of the interception, those messages fall under the statutory definition of \"storage.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As often happens under close scrutiny, the plain text is not so plain. The statute contains no explicit indication that Congress intended to exclude communications in transient storage from the definition of \"electronic communication,\" and, hence, from the scope of the Wiretap Act. Councilman, without acknowledging it, looks beyond the face of the statute and makes an inferential leap. He <i>infers</i> that Congress intended to exclude communications in transient storage from the definition of \"electronic communication,\" regardless of whether they are in the process of being delivered, simply because it did not include the term \"electronic storage\" in that definition. This inferential leap is not a plain text reading of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman's basis for making this leap is a canon of construction: \"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" <i>Russello v. United States,</i> 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (quotation marks and citation omitted; alteration in original); <i>see also Trenkler v. United States,</i> 268 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir.2001) (characterizing the maxim as a canon of construction). Reliance on a canon of construction to support the inference belies the availability of a plain text argument. Rather, it confirms that the text of the statute is ambiguous with regard to the communications at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether Councilman's inferential leap, based on a canon of construction, is justified. The <i>Russello</i> maxim &#8212; which is simply a particular application of the classic principle <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> &#8212; assumes that Congress acts carefully and deliberately in including terms in one part of a statute and omitting them in another. <i>See Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co.,</i> 537 U.S. 149, 168, 123 S.Ct. 748, 154 L.Ed.2d 653 (2003) (\"We do not read the enumeration of one case to exclude another unless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometimes that is a reasonable assumption; sometimes it is not. \"The general rule that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of others is subject to exceptions. Like other canons of statutory construction it is only an aid in the ascertainment of the meaning of the law, and must yield whenever a contrary intention on the part of the lawmaker is apparent.\" <i>Springer v. Gov't of Phil. Islands,</i> 277 U.S. 189, 206, 48 S.Ct. 480, 72 L.Ed. 845 (1928); <i>United States v. Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. 55, 65, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002) (\"[T]he canon. . . is only a guide, whose fallibility can be shown by contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion of its common relatives.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The maxim upon which Councilman relies is most apt when Congress enacts a new, self-contained statute, and two provisions of that act, drafted with parallel language, differ in that one provision uses a term, but the other provision, where it would be equally sensible to use that term if Congress desired it to apply, conspicuously omits it. Under such conditions, the maxim's interpretive value is at its apex because the underlying inference of legislative intent is most plausible. <i>See Field v. Mans,</i> 516 U.S. 59, 75-76, 116 S.Ct. 437, 133 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (\"The more apparently deliberate the contrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in relevant respects.\")</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the statute's language, structure, or circumstances of enactment differ from that idealized picture, the canon's force is diminished. For example, if the language of the two provisions at issue is not parallel, then Congress may not have envisioned that the two provisions would be closely compared in search of terms present in one and absent from the other. \"The <i>Russello</i> presumption &#8212; that the presence of a phrase in one provision and its absence in another reveals Congress'[s] design &#8212; grows weaker with each difference in the formulation of the provisions under inspection.\" <i>City of Columbus v. Ours Garage &amp; Wrecker Serv., Inc.,</i> 536 U.S. 424, 435-36, 122 S.Ct. 2226, 153 L.Ed.2d 430 (2002); <i>see also Clay v. United States,</i> 537 U.S. 522, 529, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003) (rejecting <i>Russello</i>-based argument because two statutory provisions were not parallel). Similarly, where the history of the two provisions is complex, the canon may be a less reliable guide to Congressional intent. For example, if the first provision was already part of the law, whereas the second is entirely new, Congress may have paid less attention to subtle differences between the two. <i>Cf. Moreno Rios v. United States,</i> 256 F.2d 68, 71 (1st Cir.1958) (Magruder, C.J.) (the <i>expressio unius</i> inference \"is pretty weak when applied to acts of Congress enacted at widely separated times\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In attempting to determine whether Congress intended the term \"electronic communication\" to exclude communications in momentary storage, the <i>expressio unius</i> maxim is not particularly helpful. Put differently, though it may be \"presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion,\" <i>Russello,</i> 464 U.S. at 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, that presumption may be rebutted. That is the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the definitions of \"wire communication\" and \"electronic communication\" in the Wiretap Act are not parallel. The former is defined in a single lengthy clause that specifies multiple independent criteria, with the electronic storage clause tacked onto the end. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(1). The revised definition hews closely to its original definition in the 1968 Wiretap Act; the ECPA simply amended that definition by replacing the phrase \"communication\" with \"aural transfer,\" making certain modifications not relevant here, and, of course, adding the clause \"and such term includes any electronic storage of such communication.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> <i>See</i> ECPA &#167; 101(a)(1)(D), 100 Stat. at 1848. By contrast, \"electronic communication\" is first defined in broad terms which are narrowed by four specific exclusions enumerated in separate subparagraphs. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(12). The definition was drafted from scratch as part of the ECPA. ECPA &#167; 101(a)(6), 100 Stat. at 1848-49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, any <i>expressio unius</i> inference that can be drawn from the presence of the electronic storage clause in one definition and its absence from another is in tension with a much more compelling &#8212; and directly contrary &#8212; <i>expressio unius</i> inference drawn from the same statutory provisions: Congress knew how to, and in fact did, explicitly exclude four specific categories of communications from the broad definition of \"electronic communication.\" <i>See</i> ECPA &#167; 101(a)(6)(C).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Yet Congress never added the exclusion urged by Councilman: \"any electronic communication in electronic storage.\" This interpretative principle then applies: \"Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.\" <i>TRW v. Andrews,</i> 534 U.S. 19, 28, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the ECPA's plain text does not clearly state whether a communication is still an \"electronic communication\" within the scope of the Wiretap Act when it is in electronic storage during transmission. Applying canons of construction does not resolve the question. Given this continuing ambiguity, we turn to the legislative history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Legislative History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we explain below, the purpose of the broad definition of electronic storage was to enlarge privacy protections for stored data under the Wiretap Act, not to exclude e-mail messages stored during transmission from those strong protections. Moreover, Congress's sole purpose in adding electronic storage to the definition of \"wire communication\" was to protect voice mail, and not to affect e-mail at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Background of the ECPA</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the early 1980s, the advent of electronic communications, principally e-mail, suggested to many that the Wiretap Act needed revision. To update the Act, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1985. <i>See</i> S. 1667, 99th Cong. (1985), <i>reprinted in</i> 131 Cong. Rec. S11, 795 (Sept. 19, 1985). That bill would have amended the Act by striking out the existing definition of \"wire communication,\" substituting the phrase \"electronic communication\" for \"wire communication\" throughout the Act, and subsuming wire communications within the newly-defined term \"electronic communication.\" <i>See id.</i> &#167; 101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the bill was introduced, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment released a long-awaited study of the privacy implications of electronic surveillance. <i>See</i> Office of Technology Assessment, <i>Federal Government Information Technology: Electronic Surveillance and Civil Liberties, available at</i> http://www.wws.princeton.edu/ota/disk2/1985/8509_n.html (Oct.1985) (\"<i>OTA Report</i>\"). The report identified the different points at which an e-mail message could be intercepted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least five discrete stages at which an electronic mail message could be intercepted and its contents divulged to an unintended receiver: at the terminal or in the electronic files of the sender, while being communicated, in the electronic mailbox of the receiver, when printed into hardcopy, and when retained in the files of the electronic mail company for administrative purposes. Existing law offers little protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 48, 122 S.Ct. 441. It emphasized that \"interception of electronic mail at <i>any</i> stage involves a high level of intrusiveness and a significant threat to civil liberties.\" <i>Id.</i> at 50, 122 S.Ct. 441 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") was the principal opponent of the original bill. DOJ conceded that \"the level of intrusion during [an e-mail message's] transmission is higher than when it is stored,\" but urged that \"the interception of electronic mail should include some but not all of the procedural requirements of [the Wiretap Act].\" <i>Electronic Communications Privacy Act: Hearings on H.R. 3378 Before the Subcomm. on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Admin. of Justice, House Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 99th Cong. 214, 230 (1986) (\"<i>House Hearings</i>\") (statement of James Knapp, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S. Dep't of Justice). DOJ asked Congress to treat prospective surveillance of electronic communications differently from surveillance of wire communications in three specific respects that are related solely to law enforcement and are not relevant here. <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> at 215, 232-33. DOJ's willingness to extend some of the Wiretap Act's protections to e-mail did not, however, extend to \"the time after a specific communication has been sent and while it is in the electronic mail firm's computers but has not been delivered, or has been delivered to the electronic mailbox but has not been received by the recipient.\" <i>Id.</i> at 234. In such cases, DOJ suggested, the message should be treated like first-class mail, and law enforcement should be able to seize it with an ordinary search warrant. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new version of the bill was introduced to meet some, but not all, of DOJ's concerns. <i>See</i> Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, S. 2575, 99th Cong. (1986). The new bill rejected DOJ's preferred solution and instead added electronic communications to the Wiretap Act's existing prohibitions on interception of wire communications. As the House report made clear, Congress intended to give the term \"electronic communication\" a broad definition:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term `electronic communication' is intended to cover a broad range of communication activities. . . . As a rule, a communication is an electronic communication if it is neither carried by sound waves nor can fairly be characterized as one containing the human voice (carried in part by wire). Communications consisting solely of data, for example . . . would be electronic communications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep. No. 99-647 (1986), at 35. By incorporating electronic communications into the Wiretap Act, the bill largely rejected DOJ's view that e-mail should receive no (or little) more protection than first class mail. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-647, at 22 (explaining why e-mail differs from regular mail). Nevertheless, because some of DOJ's specific concerns were addressed, DOJ acknowledged that \"the bill has been substantially modified to accommodate our concerns\" and supported it. <i>Id.</i> at 30-31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The broad definition of electronic storage</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Responding to concerns raised in the OTA Report, Congress sought to ensure that the messages and by-product files that are left behind after transmission, as well as messages stored in a user's mailbox, are protected from unauthorized access. E-mail messages in the sender's and recipient's computers could be accessed by electronically \"breaking into\" those computers and retrieving the files. <i>OTA Report</i> at 48-49. Before the ECPA, the victim of such an attack had few legal remedies for such an invasion. Furthermore, the e-mail messages retained on the service provider's computers after transmission &#8212; which, the report noted, are primarily retained for \"billing purposes and as a convenience in case the customer loses the message\" &#8212; could be accessed and possibly disclosed by the provider. <i>Id.</i> at 50. Before the ECPA, it was not clear whether the user had the right to challenge such a disclosure. <i>Id.</i> Similar concerns applied to temporary financial records and personal data retained after transmission. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this background and the evidence in the legislative history that Congress responded to the OTA Report in refining the legislation, <i>see, e.g., House Hearings</i> at 42-73, it appears that Congress had in mind these types of pre- and post-transmission \"temporary, intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof,\" <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(17), when it established the definition of \"electronic storage.\" Its aim was simply to protect such data. <i>See infra</i> Part II.C.1 (describing the Stored Communications Act). There is no indication that it meant to exclude the type of storage used during transmission from the scope of the Wiretap Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. The electronic storage clause in the definition of \"wire communication\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original version of the ECPA of 1986 included the definition of \"electronic storage\" as it reads today, but did not include electronic storage in the definition of \"wire communication.\" 132 Cong. Rec. S7,991 (June 19, 1986). Neither Senator Leahy's floor statement upon introducing the bill nor the staff bill summary mentioned voice mail in the context of the Wiretap Act amendments. <i>See id.; cf.</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-647, at 63 (mentioning voice mail in the context of Stored Communications Act). Voice mail had not, apparently, been a major subject of discussion in the context of the ECPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, when Representative Kastenmeier introduced his identical bill in the House, he did not mention voice mail in his remarks. <i>See</i> 132 Cong. Rec. H4,039 (June 23, 1986). The electronic storage clause in the wire communications definition first appeared in Senate committee markup after the House had already passed the bill without the clause. <i>See</i> 132 Cong. Rec. S14,441 (Oct. 1, 1986). Senator Leahy, in his statement in support of the amended bill, specifically mentioned voice mail, which he had not done in his remarks earlier that year, and the staff summary explained that one effect of the amended bill was that \"[w]ire communications in storage, <i>like voice mail,</i> remain wire communications.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the addition of the electronic storage clause to the definition of \"wire communication\" was intended to remove electronic communications from the scope of the Wiretap Act for the brief instants during which they are in temporary storage en route to their destinations &#8212; which, as it turns out, are often the points where it is technologically easiest to intercept those communications &#8212; neither of the Senate co-sponsors saw fit to mention this to their colleagues, and no one, evidently, remarked upon it. No document or legislator ever suggested that the addition of the electronic storage clause to the definition of \"wire communication\" would take messages in electronic storage out of the definition of \"electronic communication.\" Indeed, we doubt that Congress contemplated the existential oddity that Councilman's interpretation creates: messages &#8212; conceded by stipulation to be electronic communications &#8212; briefly cease to be electronic communications for very short intervals, and then suddenly become electronic communications again. <i>Cf.</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-647, at 35 (\"The term `electronic communication' is intended to cover a broad range of communication activities. . . . Communications consisting solely of data . . . would be electronic communications.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the legislative history indicates that Congress included the electronic storage clause in the definition of \"wire communication\" provision for the sole reason that, without it, access to voicemail would have been regulated solely by the Stored Communications Act. Indeed, that is exactly what happened when Congress later removed the explicit reference to \"electronic storage\" from the definition of \"wire communication\" in the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act, Pub.L. No. 107-56, tit. II, &#167; 209(1)(A), 115 Stat. 272, 283 (2001). <i>See</i> Robert A. Pikowsky, <i>An Overview of the Law of Electronic Surveillance Post September 11, 2001,</i> 94 Law Libr. J. 601, 608 (2002) (\"[T]he USA PATRIOT Act amended the statutory scheme and unambiguously brought voicemail under the Stored Communications Act.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the term \"electronic communication\" includes transient electronic storage that is intrinsic to the communication process for such communications. That conclusion is consistent with our precedent. <i>See Blumofe v. Pharmatrak, Inc.</i> (<i>In re Pharmatrak Privacy Litig.</i>), 329 F.3d 9, 21 (1st Cir.2003) (a rigid \"storage-transit dichotomy . . . may be less than apt to address current problems\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> <i>see also Hall v. EarthLink Network, Inc.,</i> 396 F.3d 500, 503 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005) (rejecting arguments that \"communication over the Internet can only be electronic communication while it is in transit, not while it is in electronic storage\"). Consequently, in this context we reject Councilman's proposed distinction between \"in transit\" and \"in storage.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. \"Intercept\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though we conclude that the temporarily stored e-mail messages at issue here constitute electronic communications within the scope of the Wiretap Act, the statute also requires the conduct alleged in the indictment to be an \"intercept[ion].\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1) (making it an offense to \"intentionally intercept[], endeavor[] to intercept, or procure[] any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any . . . electronic communication\"). The term \"intercept\" is defined broadly as \"the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2510(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman's core argument on appeal is that because the messages at issue, when acquired, were in transient electronic storage, they were not \"electronic communication[s]\" and, therefore, section 2511(1)'s prohibition on \"intercept[ion]\" of any \"electronic communication\" did not apply. That is the argument that we have now rejected in holding that an e-mail message does not cease to be an \"electronic communication\" during the momentary intervals, intrinsic to the communication process, at which the message resides in transient electronic storage. <i>See supra</i> Part II.A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman's appeal does not provide any other basis for finding that the acquisitions were not \"intercept[ions]\" of \"electronic communication[s].\" To be sure, Councilman does argue that \"Congress intended `intercept' to cover acquisitions `contemporaneous with transmission.'\" However, his entire argument on this point is based on the theory, as he writes in his brief, that \"[c]ourts uniformly have understood `electronic storage' to <i>negate</i> the `contemporaneous with transmission' element of a Wiretap Act `intercept,'\" and therefore \"an e-mail in `electronic storage' . . . cannot by definition be acquired `contemporaneous with transmission.'\" That argument is simply a variation on, and entirely subsumed within, his primary argument concerning \"storage\" &#8212; the very argument that we have now rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, this appeal does not implicate the question of whether the term \"intercept\" applies only to acquisitions that occur contemporaneously with the transmission of a message from sender to recipient or, instead, extends to an event that occurs after a message has crossed the finish line of transmission (whatever that point may be). <i>See Pharmatrak,</i> 329 F.3d at 21-22 (noting that the concept of a contemporaneity or real-time requirement, which evolved in other factual contexts, may not be apt to address issues involving the application of the Wiretap Act to electronic communications). We therefore need not decide that question. <i>See United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that, in certain circumstances, an appellee is obliged, on pain of waiver, to raise additional or alternative bases for affirming a favorable judgment); <i>Raxton Corp. v. Anania Assocs., Inc.,</i> 668 F.2d 622, 624 (1st Cir.1982) (emphasizing the importance of \"[t]he presentation on appeal of all viable justifications of a judgment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Because the facts of this case and the arguments before us do not invite consideration of either the existence or the applicability of a contemporaneity or real-time requirement, we need not and do not plunge into that morass. We note, however, that even were we prepared to recognize a contemporaneity or real-time requirement &#8212; a step that we do not take today &#8212; we think it highly unlikely that Councilman could generate a winning argument in the circumstances of this case. Any such argument would entail a showing that each transmission was complete at the time of acquisition and, therefore, that the definition of \"intercept\" does not cover the acquisitions. Such a showing would appear to be impossible since we have concluded that the messages were electronic communications, and it is undisputed that they were acquired while they were still en route to the intended recipients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Intersection of the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far we have considered only the Wiretap Act, not the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2701-2712, because the indictment only alleged a violation of the former. Councilman argues that acquisition of electronic communications in temporary electronic storage is regulated by the Stored Communications Act. From this he infers that such acquisition is <i>not</i> regulated by the Wiretap Act, or that, at minimum, the potential overlap implicates the rule of lenity or other doctrines of \"fair warning.\" Consequently, we must delve into the \"complex, often convoluted\" intersection of the Wiretap Act and Stored Communications Act. <i>United States v.

These types of stored communications &#8212; including stored e-mail messages &#8212; were not protected by the Wiretap Act. Therefore, Congress concluded that \"the information [in these communications] may be open to possible wrongful use and public disclosure by law enforcement authorities as well as unauthorized private parties.\" S.Rep.

At the same time, Councilman would arguably be exempted by the Stored Communications Act's provider exception: \"Subsection (a) of this section does not apply with respect to conduct authorized (1) by the person or entity providing a wire or electronic communications service.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2701(c). Under this theory, &#167; 2701(c)(1) establishes virtually complete immunity for a service provider that \"obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to\" e-mail that is \"in electronic storage\" in its system. <i>See Fraser,</i> 352 F.3d at 115 (\"[W]e read &#167; 2701(c) literally to except from Title II's protection all searches by communications service providers.\"). The district court surmised that &#167; 2701(a) would have covered Councilman's conduct but that &#167; 2701(c)(1) exempted him. <i>Councilman,</i> 245 F.Supp.2d at 320.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second provision of the Stored Communications Act prohibits \"a person or entity providing an electronic communication service to the public [from] knowingly divulg[ing] to any person or entity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage by that service.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2702(a)(1). Yet this provision, too, has service provider exceptions, permitting a provider to divulge an electronic communication \"to a person employed or authorized or whose facilities are used to forward such communication to its destination,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2702(b)(4), or \"as may be necessarily incident to the rendition of the service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2702(b)(5). We assume, <i>dubitante,</i> that one or both of these provisions would exempt Councilman under &#167; 2702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this premise, he argues that if he is not liable under the Stored Communications Act, then he cannot be liable under the Wiretap Act either. Since Congress enacted the ECPA as a package, he says, it did not intend to lay traps in the overlap between the two titles. If conduct that potentially falls under both titles is exempt from one of them, then that exemption provides a \"safe harbor\" and the conduct does not violate the other title either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this argument unpersuasive. In general, if two statutes cover the same conduct, the government may charge a violation of either. <i>See United States v. Herring,</i> 993 F.2d 784, 788 n. 4 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc) (\"The overlapping coverage of the Wiretap Act and the Communications Act [of 1934] presents no problem. In such a case, the prosecution has the right to select the statute under which the indictment will be brought.\"). Moreover, the exceptions in the Stored Communications Act do not, by their terms, apply to the Wiretap Act. The exception in &#167; 2701(c) specifically limits its application by stating that \"<i>[s]ubsection (a) of this section</i> does not apply . . . to conduct authorized\" by the service provider. (Emphasis added). The &#167; 2701(c)(1) provider exception's breadth presents a striking contrast to the Wiretap Act's own, much narrower provider exception:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for . . . an officer, employee, or agent of a provider of wire or electronic communication service, whose facilities are used in the transmission of a wire or electronic communication, to intercept, disclose, or use that communication in the normal course of his employment while engaged in any activity which is a <i>necessary incident to the rendition of his service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service</i>. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 2511(2)(a)(i) (emphasis added). It is indisputable that the Wiretap Act's narrower service provider exception would not protect Councilman. His alleged conduct was clearly not \"a necessary incident to the rendition of his service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service.\" If there were any doubt remaining, it would be resolved by the Wiretap Act's express provision that the only exceptions to its prohibitions are those specifically listed within the Wiretap Act, not those found in other laws. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1) (prohibitions apply \"[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided in <i>this chapter</i> [the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-2522]\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Fair Warning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman argues in the alternative that the two titles are sufficiently confusing that principles of fair warning require dismissal of the indictment. Those principles are expressed in the law through three related doctrines: the rule of lenity, the vagueness doctrine, and the prohibition against unforeseeably expansive judicial constructions. <i>See United States v. Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. 259, 266-67, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997); <i>United States v.</i> <i>Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d 9, 14-16 (1st Cir.2003). We address each in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Lenity</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the rule of lenity, grievous ambiguity in a penal statute is resolved in the defendant's favor. <i>See Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219. \"The simple existence of some statutory ambiguity, however, is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule, for most statutes are ambiguous to some degree.\" <i>Muscarello v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 125, 138-39, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998). Rather, the rule only applies if \"there is a <i>grievous</i> ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 139, 118 S.Ct. 1911 (quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added). Furthermore, lenity \"applies only if, after seizing everything from which aid can be derived, [a court] can make no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\" <i>Reno v. Koray,</i> 515 U.S. 50, 65, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995) (quotation marks and citation omitted); <i>accord United States v. Balint,</i> 201 F.3d 928, 935 (7th Cir.2000) (\"The rule of lenity is unavailable to us if the purported ambiguity in a statute can be resolved through normal methods of statutory construction.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, while the statute contains some textual ambiguity, it is not \"grievous.\" We have construed it using traditional tools of construction, particularly legislative history, and lenity is therefore inapplicable. <i>See, e.g., Dixson v. United States,</i> 465 U.S. 482, 491, 104 S.Ct. 1172, 79 L.Ed.2d 458 (1984) (\"<i>If the legislative history fails to clarify the statutory language,</i> our rule of lenity would compel us to construe the statute in favor of petitioners, as criminal defendants in these cases.\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Congress specifically anticipated that communication service providers might, in good faith, misapprehend their lawful ability to intercept or disclose communications in certain circumstances. Congress addressed that problem with a broad, affirmative good faith defense:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A good faith reliance on . . . (3) a good faith determination that [&#167; 2511(3)] permitted the conduct complained of[] is a complete defense against any civil or criminal action brought under [the Wiretap Act] or any other law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 2520(d)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> Section 2511(3), in turn, authorizes a communication service provider to divulge a communication to one other than the recipient in four specified circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Thus, Congress contemplated that service providers might, in good faith, misunderstand the limits of their authority on a particular set of facts, and provided a statutory mechanism to solve this problem. We may neither expand the good faith defense's scope, nor convert it from a fact-based affirmative defense to a basis for dismissing an indictment on legal grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Vagueness</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of a statute whose terms are \"so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\" <i>Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219 (quotation marks and citation omitted). But vagueness is more than just \"garden-variety, textual ambiguity.\" <i>Sabetti v. Dipaolo,</i> 16 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1994) (Breyer, C.J.). \"Many statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for `[i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties.'\" <i>Rose v. Locke,</i> 423 U.S. 48, 49-50, 96 S.Ct. 243, 46 L.Ed.2d 185 (1975) (per curiam) (citation omitted). But a statute is unconstitutionally vague only if it \"prohibits . . . an act in terms so uncertain that persons of average intelligence would have no choice but to guess at its meaning and modes of application.\" <i>Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Wiretap Act is not unconstitutionally vague in its application here. From its text, a person of average intelligence would, at the very least, be on notice that \"[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided in\" the Act, \"electronic communication[s],\" which are defined expansively, may not be \"intercepted.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1)(a). An exception is provided for electronic communication service providers, but it only applies to \"activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of [the] service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(2)(a)(i). The Act puts the service provider on notice of both the prohibited conduct and the narrow provider exception. That is adequate notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Unforeseeably expansive interpretation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the third branch of fair warning doctrine \"bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope.\" <i>Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219. This doctrine principally \"bars `unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of narrow and precise statutory language.'\" <i>Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d at 14 (citation omitted); <i>accord Balint,</i> 201 F.3d at 935 (doctrine only applies if judicial interpretations \"amount to an unpredictable shift in the law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That doctrine does not apply here. The simplest reading of the statute is that the e-mail messages were \"electronic communications\" under the statute at the point where they were intercepted. One must apply tools of statutory construction to <i>remove</i> the conduct from the statute's ambit by interpreting a subtlety in the definition of \"wire communications.\" Whatever else one might say about the Wiretap Act, \"intercept[ing] . . . electronic communication[s],\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1)(a), is \"conduct that . . . the statute . . . has fairly disclosed to be within its scope,\" <i>Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, a 1997 law review article observed that, under a narrow interpretation of the ECPA's \"intercept\" prohibition, \"unless some type of automatic routing software is used (for example, a duplicate of all an employee's messages are automatically sent to the employee's boss), interception of E-mail within the prohibition of the ECPA is virtually impossible.\" Jarrod J. White, <i>E-Mail @ Work.com: Employer Monitoring of Employee E-Mail,</i> 48 Ala. L.Rev. 1079, 1083 (1997) (emphasis added); <i>see also Pharmatrak,</i> 329 F.3d at 22 (quoting this language approvingly). Thus, almost a year before Councilman's alleged conduct, the academic literature had noted that, even under a reading of the ECPA narrower than ours, \"automatic routing software\" that automatically forwarded duplicate copies of a user's messages <i>would</i> qualify as \"interception of E-mail within the prohibition of the ECPA.\" <i>Id.</i> That observation anticipated this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the text of the statute does not specify whether the term \"electronic communication\" includes communications in electronic storage, the legislative history of the ECPA indicates that Congress intended the term to be defined broadly. Furthermore, that history confirms that Congress did <i>not</i> intend, by including electronic storage within the definition of wire communications, to thereby exclude electronic storage from the definition of electronic communications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that the term \"electronic communication\" includes transient electronic storage that is intrinsic to the communication process, and hence that interception of an e-mail message in such storage is an offense under the Wiretap Act. Moreover, the various doctrines of fair warning do not bar prosecution for that offense. Consequently, the district court erred in dismissing the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Judgment vacated.

That is not so. Although the article described the implications of the Fifth Circuit opinion in <i>Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Serv.,</i> 36 F.3d 457, 458 (5th Cir.1994), it identified the possibility that, even under that case's narrow view of the intercept prohibition, there is a category of automatic e-mail routing software that might, in some situations, violate the Wiretap Act.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, with whom CYR, Senior Circuit Judge, joins (Dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although I commend Judge Lipez on his erudite and articulate majority opinion, I am impeded from joining the same for two reasons. First, the indictment is legally insufficient to establish a criminal violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 for conspiracy to violate the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511, insofar as the e-mails Councilman is alleged to have retrieved were in \"electronic storage,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(17), when that action took place, and therefore, the Wiretap Act's requisite element of \"interception,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511, is lacking. <i>See United States v. Councilman,</i> 373 F.3d 197, 200-04 (1st Cir.2004). Second, and in the alternative, the result reached by the en banc majority deprives Councilman of due process of law, because he had no \"fair warning\" of the potential criminal consequences of his actions. <i>See United States v. Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. 259, 265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But for the juxtaposition of our respective views, there is not much new in the positions of the majority and dissent from those presented by the panel opinion except that, by reason of the majority's conclusion that the indictment charges a valid criminal violation, we are required to discuss Councilman's due process claim, which the panel did not have to reach. <i>See Councilman,</i> 373 F.3d at 204 n. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case as stipulated by the parties state that \"[a]t all times that sendmail and procmail performed operations affecting the email messages at issue, the messages existed in the random access memory (RAM) or in hard disks, or both, <i>within Interloc's computer system.</i>\" (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stripped of all technical jargon, the sole legal issue presented by this appeal is whether the information contained in this computer system is data that can be \"intercepted\" within the meaning of the Wiretap Act. The answer to that question is not to be found in the wringing of the proverbial hands or dire warnings of the Doomsday that is predicted to follow one or the other conclusion. <i>Cf.</i> Yvette Joy Liebesman, <i>The Potential Effects of United States v. Councilman on the Confidentiality of Attorney-Client E-Mail Communications,</i> 18 Geog. J. Legal Ethics 893 (2005). Rather, the answer lies in a dispassionate reading of the legislation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> upon which the criminal charges are based.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute that Councilman is charged with conspiring to violate provides for criminal sanctions against \"any person who &#8212;(a) intentionally <i>intercepts,</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or <i>electronic communication.</i>\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1) (emphasis added). The term \"electronic communication\" is defined as \"any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(12). In contrast, the term \"wire communication\" is defined as \"any aural transfer made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception . . . furnished or operated by any person engaged in providing or operating such facilities . . . <i>and such term includes any electronic storage</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> <i>of such communication.</i>\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is <i>Congress'</i> failure to provide this emphasized language in its definition of \"electronic communication\" that incites the majority into engaging in what I believe to be an unfortunate act of judicial legislation that no amount of syllogization can camouflage. The lacuna between the definition of \"wire communication\" and that of \"electronic communication\" can only be bridged by the body that created it; jurisprudential \"body English\" does not suffice to fill that vacuum. Although nature abhors a vacuum, it has no power over legislative oversights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding the correct legal answer to the non-existent dilemma which the majority believes exists, we need go no further than our own <i>In re Hart,</i> in which, apropos of the present circumstances, we stated that, \"[w]hen Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" 328 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,</i> 534 U.S. 438, 452, 122 S.Ct. 941, 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002)). Contrary to the majority's assertions that this <i>expressio unius</i> presumption ought not apply because the language in question was not part of a \"new, self-contained statute,\" <i>maj. op.</i> at 73, it is actually \"made stronger when, as here, Congress has amended a statute to include certain language in some, but not all, provisions of the Statute.\" <i>United States v.

Farey-Jones,</i> 359 F.3d 1066, 1077-78 (9th Cir.2004) (post-delivery); <i>Fraser v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 352 F.3d 107, 113-14 (3d Cir.2003) (post-delivery); <i>United States v.

When considering the intra-computer \"interceptions\" at issue here, Congress rationally may well have concluded that the public's privacy rights, or more specifically those between an e-mail service provider and its own customers, could be adequately controlled by normal contract principles rather than by federal statute. Councilman's \"interception\" of Interloc customers' e-mail was not akin to an interception engaged in by an outside party who was unrelated or unknown to the contracting parties. When a customer signs up with an e-mail provider like Interloc, he routinely is asked to read and expressly sign off on a privacy agreement which defines his expectations of privacy vis-&#224;-vis the provider. If the protections are inadequate, he may decline the e-mail service and seek an alternative service contract which will afford him the protections he requires. Neither the Wiretap Act nor its legislative history forecloses the inference that Congress, in its exclusion of \"electronic storage\" from the definition of \"electronic communication,\" intended to leave such matters to the exigencies of the contracting parties. If Interloc did intercept its customers' messages in breach of a privacy agreement, the remedy lies in contract, not in the Wiretap Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I see no point in rummaging through the legislative history of a statute whose language, or more accurately, absence thereof, speaks for itself. \"[W]hen the statute's language is plain, the sole function of the courts &#8212; at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd &#8212; is to enforce it according to its terms.\" <i>Dodd v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 2483, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, ___ (2005) (quoting <i>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v.

This case presents the classic example of \"legislative history [which] is itself often murky, ambiguous, and contradictory.\" <i>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 125 S.Ct. 2611, 2626, ___ L.Ed.2d ___, ___ (2005) (<i>rev'g Rosario Ortega v.

[J]udicial reliance on legislative materials like committee reports, which are not themselves subject to the requirements of Article I, may give unrepresentative committee members&#8212;or worse yet, unelected staffers and lobbyists&#8212;both the power and incentive to attempt strategic manipulations of legislative history to secure results they were unable to achieve through the statutory text.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> In any event, I refer to the panel opinion on this point. <i>Councilman,</i> 373 F.3d at 203-04.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that both viewpoints on the first issue before the en banc court have been adequately expressed. Ultimately, it is up to the Supreme Court to determine which is correct, but, in my view the government has attempted to fish with a net that has holes in it and is thus in need of repair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, the matter does not end here. As demonstrated by the results of previous efforts by this and other courts to grapple with the statute in question, any lingering ambiguity that makes room for the majority's interpretation certainly qualifies as \"grievous,\" <i>maj. op.</i> at 81. Due process, therefore, requires that the statute be construed against criminal liability, in accordance with the rule of lenity. <i>See Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219; <i>Huddleston v. United States,</i> 415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974). Even if the ambiguity is not so serious, and \"clarity at the requisite level may be supplied by [the majority's] judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain statute, due process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope.\" <i>Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219. Whichever doctrine of \"fair warning\" one might apply, the bottom line is that the statute and the cases construing it did not make it \"reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant's conduct was criminal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 267, 117 S.Ct. 1219.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time that Councilman allegedly violated the Wiretap Act in 1998, he would have had available the following to guide his conduct: (1) the statute in question, and (2) the <i>Jackson Games</i> case (1994) and, tangentially, the <i>Reyes</i> case (1996). There is little in any of these that would have given Councilman fair notice of the en banc majority's interpretation, which itself requires reliance on legislative \"history\" that resembles a Byzantine maze.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the 1997 law review article cited by the majority render the interpretation adopted today foreseeable. Quite the opposite, in fact. That article examined the decision in <i>Steve Jackson Games,</i> 36 F.3d 457, in which the Fifth Circuit determined that the pre-retrieval seizure of private e-mails stored on a bulletin board server did not constitute an \"intercept\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1)(a). White wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rejecting the appellant's argument that logically seizure of something before it is received should constitute interception, the Steve Jackson Games court held that the E-mail stored on the [bulletin board's] computer hard drive was no longer in transmission, and thus could not be intercepted within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1)(a). . . . The narrowness of the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of \"interception\" is important. Following the Fifth Circuit's rationale, <i>there is only a narrow window during which an E-mail interception may occur &#8212; the seconds or mili-seconds before which a newly composed message is saved to any temporary location following a send command.</i> Therefore, unless some type of automatic routing software is used (for example, a duplicate of all an employee's messages are automatically sent to the employee's boss), interception of E-mail within the prohibition of the ECPA is virtually impossible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White, <i>supra,</i> at 1082-83 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). Clearly, the software used by Councilman was not \"automatic routing software\" that operates \"before a newly composed message is saved to any temporary location.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1083. White's article, like other scholarship available at the time, thus would have forcefully suggested that Councilman's conduct was not prohibited. <i>See</i> Thomas R. Greenberg, <i>E-Mail and Voice Mail: Employee Privacy and the Federal Wiretap Statute,</i> 44 Am. U.L.Rev. 219, 249 (1994) (\"Thus, the limitations imposed on employer interceptions of wire and electronic communications vanish once the same communication is in storage. Accordingly, in order to avoid Title III liability, an employer need only access employee communications once they have been stored.\"); Ruel Torres Hern&#225;ndez, <i>ECPA and Online Computer Privacy,</i> 41 Fed. Comm. L.J. 17, 39 (1988-1989) (\"In other words, there simply is no ECPA violation if the person or entity providing a wire or electronic communication service intentionally examines everything [in storage] on the system, whether or not it is for the purpose of a quality control check.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, I am at a loss to conceive how Councilman would have had fair notice of the majority's interpretation at the time of his actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Congress's provision of a good faith exception for those who divulge intercepted communications because they misconstrued the Wiretap Act's narrow exceptions to criminal liability as an affirmative defense, <i>see maj. op.</i> at 36-37 (citing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2520(d)(3)), is irrelevant. Councilman should not have to show he relied on those exceptions to divulge the e-mails he obtained, because he had no \"reasonably clear\" indication that to do so would otherwise violate the Wiretap Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman is being held to a level of knowledge which would not be expected of any of the judges who have dealt with this problem, to say nothing of \"men [and women] of common intelligence.\" <i>Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219 (quoting <i>Connally v.

We must decide whether interception of an e-mail message in temporary, transient electronic storage states an offense under the Wiretap Act, as amended by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-2522. The government believes it does, and indicted Councilman under that theory. The district court disagreed and dismissed the indictment. A divided panel of this court affirmed. We granted review en banc and now reverse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. An Introduction to Internet E-mail</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Internet is a network of interconnected computers. Data transmitted across the Internet are broken down into small \"packets\" that are forwarded from one computer to another until they reach their destination, where they are reconstituted. <i>See</i> Orin S. Kerr, <i>Internet Surveillance Law After the USA Patriot Act: The Big Brother that Isn't,</i> 97 Nw. U.L.Rev. 607, 613-14 (2003). Each service on the Internet &#8212; e.g., e-mail, the World Wide Web, or instant messaging &#8212; has its own protocol for using packets of data to transmit information from one place to another. The e-mail protocol is known as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (\"SMTP\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a user composes a message in an e-mail client program,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> a program called a mail transfer agent (\"MTA\") formats that message and sends it to another program that \"packetizes\" it and sends the packets out to the Internet. Computers on the network then pass the packets from one to another; each computer along the route stores the packets in memory, retrieves the addresses of their final destinations, and then determines where to send them next. At various points the packets are reassembled to form the original e-mail message, copied, and then repacketized for the next leg of the journey. <i>See</i> J. Klensin, <i>RFC 2821: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</i> (Apr.2001), <i>at</i> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt; Jonathan B. Postel, <i>RFC 821: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</i> (Aug.1982), <i>at</i> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc821.txt (\"<i>RFC 821</i>\"). Sometimes messages cannot be transferred immediately and must be saved for later delivery. Even when delivery is immediate, intermediate computers often retain backup copies, which they delete later. This method of transmission is commonly called \"store and forward\" delivery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once all the packets reach the recipient's mail server, they are reassembled to form the e-mail message. A mail delivery agent (\"MDA\") accepts the message from the MTA, determines which user should receive the message, and performs the actual delivery by placing the message in that user's mailbox. One popular MDA is \"procmail,\" which is controlled by short programs or scripts called \"recipe files.\" These recipe files can be used in various ways. For example, a procmail recipe can instruct the MDA to deposit mail addressed to one address into another user's mailbox (e.g., to send mail addressed to \"help\" to the tech support department), to reject mail from certain addresses, or to make copies of certain messages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the MDA has deposited a message into the recipient's mailbox, the recipient simply needs to use an e-mail client program to retrieve and read the message.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While the journey from sender to recipient may seem rather involved, it usually takes just a few seconds, with each intermediate step taking well under a second. <i>See, e.g.,</i> W. Houser et al., <i>RFC 1865: EDI Meets the Internet</i> (Jan.1996), <i>at</i> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1865.txt (\"For a modest amount of data with a dedicated connection, a message transmission would occur in a matter of seconds. . . .\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Facts Alleged in the Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellee Bradford C. Councilman was Vice President of Interloc, Inc., which ran an online rare and out-of-print book listing service. As part of its service, Interloc gave book dealer customers an e-mail address at the domain \"interloc.com\" and acted as the e-mail provider. Councilman managed the e-mail service and the dealer subscription list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the indictment, in January 1998, Councilman directed Interloc employees to intercept and copy all incoming communications to subscriber dealers from Amazon.com, an Internet retailer that sells books and other products. Interloc's systems administrator modified the server's procmail recipe so that, before delivering any message from Amazon.com to the recipient's mailbox, procmail would copy the message and place the copy in a separate mailbox that Councilman could access. Thus, procmail would intercept and copy all incoming messages from Amazon.com before they were delivered to the recipient's mailbox, and therefore, before the intended recipient could read the message. This diversion intercepted thousands of messages, and Councilman and other Interloc employees routinely read the e-mail messages sent to Interloc subscribers in the hope of gaining a commercial advantage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 11, 2001, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Councilman. Count One charged him under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, the general federal criminal conspiracy statute, for conspiracy to violate the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> by intercepting electronic communications, disclosing their contents, using their contents, and causing a person providing an electronic communications service to divulge the communications' contents to persons other than the addressees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The object of the conspiracy was to exploit the content of e-mail from Amazon.com to dealers in order to develop a list of books, learn about competitors, and attain a commercial advantage for Interloc and its parent company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties stipulated to certain undisputed facts: the procmail recipe worked only within the confines of Interloc's computer; at all times at which procmail performed operations affecting the e-mail system, the messages existed \"in the random access memory (RAM) or in hard disks, or both, within Interloc's computer system\"; and each e-mail message, while traveling through wires, was an \"electronic communication\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(12).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman moved to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense under the Wiretap Act, arguing that the intercepted e-mail messages were in \"electronic storage,\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(17), and therefore were not, as a matter of law, subject to the prohibition on \"intercept[ing] . . . electronic communication[s],\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1)(a). The district court initially denied the motion to dismiss. As trial preparation began, however, the district court <i>sua sponte</i> reconsidered its decision in light of the then-recently decided case of <i>Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779052\"><a href=\"/opinion/779052/robert-c-konop-v-hawaiian-airlines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2002). After further briefing, the district court granted Councilman's motion to dismiss Count One, ruling that the messages were not, at the moment of interception, \"electronic communications\" under the Wiretap Act. <i>United States v. Councilman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515069\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515069/united-states-v-councilman/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Councilman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span> (1st Cir.2004). The majority concluded that, because the definition of \"wire communication\" includes \"electronic storage\" but the definition of \"electronic communication\" does not, the Wiretap Act's prohibition on \"intercept[ion]\" does not apply to messages that are, even briefly, in \"electronic storage.\" <i>Id.</i> at 200-04.

As amended by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848 (\"ECPA\"), the Act makes it an offense to \"intentionally intercept[], endeavor[] to intercept, or procure[] any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1). Two terms are at issue here: \"electronic communication\" and \"intercept.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman contends that the e-mail messages he obtained were not, when procmail copied them, \"electronic communication[s],\" and moreover the method by which they were copied was not \"intercept[ion]\" under the Act. Because these contentions raise important questions of statutory construction with broad ramifications, we discuss in some detail the Act's text, structure, and legislative history. We conclude that Councilman's interpretation of the Wiretap Act is inconsistent with Congress's intent. We then turn to whether Councilman had fair warning that the Act would be construed to cover his alleged conduct in a criminal case, and whether the rule of lenity or other principles require us to construe the Act in his favor. We find no basis to apply any of the fair warning doctrines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. \"Electronic Communication\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that \"electronic communication\" means what it says, and no less: \"any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo electronic or photooptical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce,\" with four specific exceptions not relevant here. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(12). Councilman argues, however, that Congress intended to exclude any communication that is in (even momentary) electronic storage. In his view, \"electronic communication[s]\" under the Wiretap Act are limited to communications traveling through wires between computers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Once a message enters a computer, he says, the message ceases (at least temporarily) to be an electronic communication protected by the Wiretap Act. He claims that Congress considered communications in computers to be worthy of less protection than communications in wires because users have a lower expectation of privacy for electronic communications that are in electronic storage even fleetingly, and that the Act embodies this understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Text</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin, as we must, with the statute's text. <i>United States v. Rosa-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784026\"><a href=\"/opinion/784026/united-states-v-miguel-rosa-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2003). As noted above, the statutory definition of \"electronic communication\" is broad and, taken alone, would appear to cover incoming e-mail messages while the messages are being processed by the MTA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman argues, however, that the plain text of the statute exempts electronic communications that are in storage from the purview of the Wiretap Act. He contends that the definition of \"electronic communication\" must be read alongside the definition of \"wire communication\" and limited by what the latter includes but the former does not. The ECPA amended the 1968 definition of \"wire communication\" to specify that \"such term includes any electronic storage of such communication.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(1); ECPA &#167; 101(a)(1)(D), 100 Stat. at 1848. By contrast, the definition of \"<i>electronic</i> communication\" does not mention electronic storage. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(12).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Therefore, Councilman infers, Congress intended wire communications, <i>but not electronic communications,</i> to include electronic storage. Moreover, Congress defined \"electronic storage\" expansively to include \"any temporary, intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(17); <i>see Councilman,</i> 245 F.Supp.2d at 320 (describing this definition as \"extraordinarily &#8212; indeed, almost breathtakingly &#8212; broad\"). Since the parties stipulated that the messages in this case were \"in the random access memory (RAM) or in the hard disks, or both, within Interloc's computer system\" at the time of the interception, those messages fall under the statutory definition of \"storage.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As often happens under close scrutiny, the plain text is not so plain. The statute contains no explicit indication that Congress intended to exclude communications in transient storage from the definition of \"electronic communication,\" and, hence, from the scope of the Wiretap Act. Councilman, without acknowledging it, looks beyond the face of the statute and makes an inferential leap. He <i>infers</i> that Congress intended to exclude communications in transient storage from the definition of \"electronic communication,\" regardless of whether they are in the process of being delivered, simply because it did not include the term \"electronic storage\" in that definition. This inferential leap is not a plain text reading of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman's basis for making this leap is a canon of construction: \"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" <i>Russello v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111043\"><a href=\"/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span> (1983) (quotation marks and citation omitted; alteration in original); <i>see also Trenkler v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199633\"><a href=\"/opinion/199633/trenkler-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2001) (characterizing the maxim as a canon of construction). Reliance on a canon of construction to support the inference belies the availability of a plain text argument. Rather, it confirms that the text of the statute is ambiguous with regard to the communications at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether Councilman's inferential leap, based on a canon of construction, is justified. The <i>Russello</i> maxim &#8212; which is simply a particular application of the classic principle <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> &#8212; assumes that Congress acts carefully and deliberately in including terms in one part of a statute and omitting them in another. <i>See Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122253\"><a href=\"/opinion/122253/barnhart-v-peabody-coal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span>, 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122253\"><a href=\"/opinion/122253/barnhart-v-peabody-coal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Like other canons of statutory construction it is only an aid in the ascertainment of the meaning of the law, and must yield whenever a contrary intention on the part of the lawmaker is apparent.\" <i>Springer v.

Under such conditions, the maxim's interpretive value is at its apex because the underlying inference of legislative intent is most plausible. <i>See Field v. Mans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117980\"><a href=\"/opinion/117980/field-v-mans/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 75-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117980\"><a href=\"/opinion/117980/field-v-mans/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For example, if the language of the two provisions at issue is not parallel, then Congress may not have envisioned that the two provisions would be closely compared in search of terms present in one and absent from the other. \"The <i>Russello</i> presumption &#8212; that the presence of a phrase in one provision and its absence in another reveals Congress'[s] design &#8212; grows weaker with each difference in the formulation of the provisions under inspection.\" <i>City of Columbus v.

Moreover, Congress's sole purpose in adding electronic storage to the definition of \"wire communication\" was to protect voice mail, and not to affect e-mail at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Background of the ECPA</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the early 1980s, the advent of electronic communications, principally e-mail, suggested to many that the Wiretap Act needed revision. To update the Act, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1985. <i>See</i> S. 1667, 99th Cong. (1985), <i>reprinted in</i> 131 Cong. Rec. S11, 795 (Sept. 19, 1985). That bill would have amended the Act by striking out the existing definition of \"wire communication,\" substituting the phrase \"electronic communication\" for \"wire communication\" throughout the Act, and subsuming wire communications within the newly-defined term \"electronic communication.\" <i>See id.</i> &#167; 101.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the bill was introduced, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment released a long-awaited study of the privacy implications of electronic surveillance. <i>See</i> Office of Technology Assessment, <i>Federal Government Information Technology: Electronic Surveillance and Civil Liberties, available at</i> http://www.wws.princeton.edu/ota/disk2/1985/8509_n.html (Oct.1985) (\"<i>OTA Report</i>\"). The report identified the different points at which an e-mail message could be intercepted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least five discrete stages at which an electronic mail message could be intercepted and its contents divulged to an unintended receiver: at the terminal or in the electronic files of the sender, while being communicated, in the electronic mailbox of the receiver, when printed into hardcopy, and when retained in the files of the electronic mail company for administrative purposes. Existing law offers little protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118465\"><a href=\"/opinion/118465/trw-inc-v-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

DOJ conceded that \"the level of intrusion during [an e-mail message's] transmission is higher than when it is stored,\" but urged that \"the interception of electronic mail should include some but not all of the procedural requirements of [the Wiretap Act].\" <i>Electronic Communications Privacy Act: Hearings on H.R. 3378 Before the Subcomm. on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Admin. of Justice, House Comm. on the Judiciary,</i> 99th Cong. 214, 230 (1986) (\"<i>House Hearings</i>\") (statement of James Knapp, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S. Dep't of Justice). DOJ asked Congress to treat prospective surveillance of electronic communications differently from surveillance of wire communications in three specific respects that are related solely to law enforcement and are not relevant here. <i>See</i> <i>id.</i> at 215, 232-33. DOJ's willingness to extend some of the Wiretap Act's protections to e-mail did not, however, extend to \"the time after a specific communication has been sent and while it is in the electronic mail firm's computers but has not been delivered, or has been delivered to the electronic mailbox but has not been received by the recipient.\" <i>Id.</i> at 234. In such cases, DOJ suggested, the message should be treated like first-class mail, and law enforcement should be able to seize it with an ordinary search warrant. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new version of the bill was introduced to meet some, but not all, of DOJ's concerns. <i>See</i> Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, S. 2575, 99th Cong. (1986). The new bill rejected DOJ's preferred solution and instead added electronic communications to the Wiretap Act's existing prohibitions on interception of wire communications. As the House report made clear, Congress intended to give the term \"electronic communication\" a broad definition:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term `electronic communication' is intended to cover a broad range of communication activities. . . . As a rule, a communication is an electronic communication if it is neither carried by sound waves nor can fairly be characterized as one containing the human voice (carried in part by wire). Communications consisting solely of data, for example . . . would be electronic communications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep. No. 99-647 (1986), at 35. By incorporating electronic communications into the Wiretap Act, the bill largely rejected DOJ's view that e-mail should receive no (or little) more protection than first class mail. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-647, at 22 (explaining why e-mail differs from regular mail). Nevertheless, because some of DOJ's specific concerns were addressed, DOJ acknowledged that \"the bill has been substantially modified to accommodate our concerns\" and supported it. <i>Id.</i> at 30-31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

E-mail messages in the sender's and recipient's computers could be accessed by electronically \"breaking into\" those computers and retrieving the files. <i>OTA Report</i> at 48-49. Before the ECPA, the victim of such an attack had few legal remedies for such an invasion. Furthermore, the e-mail messages retained on the service provider's computers after transmission &#8212; which, the report noted, are primarily retained for \"billing purposes and as a convenience in case the customer loses the message\" &#8212; could be accessed and possibly disclosed by the provider. <i>Id.</i> at 50. Before the ECPA, it was not clear whether the user had the right to challenge such a disclosure. <i>Id.</i> Similar concerns applied to temporary financial records and personal data retained after transmission. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this background and the evidence in the legislative history that Congress responded to the OTA Report in refining the legislation, <i>see, e.g., House Hearings</i> at 42-73, it appears that Congress had in mind these types of pre- and post-transmission \"temporary, intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof,\" <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(17), when it established the definition of \"electronic storage.\" Its aim was simply to protect such data. <i>See infra</i> Part II.C.1 (describing the Stored Communications Act). There is no indication that it meant to exclude the type of storage used during transmission from the scope of the Wiretap Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.

Rec. S7,991 (June 19, 1986). Neither Senator Leahy's floor statement upon introducing the bill nor the staff bill summary mentioned voice mail in the context of the Wiretap Act amendments. <i>See id.; cf.</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-647, at 63 (mentioning voice mail in the context of Stored Communications Act). Voice mail had not, apparently, been a major subject of discussion in the context of the ECPA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, when Representative Kastenmeier introduced his identical bill in the House, he did not mention voice mail in his remarks. <i>See</i> 132 Cong. Rec. H4,039 (June 23, 1986). The electronic storage clause in the wire communications definition first appeared in Senate committee markup after the House had already passed the bill without the clause. <i>See</i> 132 Cong. Rec. S14,441 (Oct. 1, 1986). Senator Leahy, in his statement in support of the amended bill, specifically mentioned voice mail, which he had not done in his remarks earlier that year, and the staff summary explained that one effect of the amended bill was that \"[w]ire communications in storage, <i>like voice mail,</i> remain wire communications.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the addition of the electronic storage clause to the definition of \"wire communication\" was intended to remove electronic communications from the scope of the Wiretap Act for the brief instants during which they are in temporary storage en route to their destinations &#8212; which, as it turns out, are often the points where it is technologically easiest to intercept those communications &#8212; neither of the Senate co-sponsors saw fit to mention this to their colleagues, and no one, evidently, remarked upon it. No document or legislator ever suggested that the addition of the electronic storage clause to the definition of \"wire communication\" would take messages in electronic storage out of the definition of \"electronic communication.\" Indeed, we doubt that Congress contemplated the existential oddity that Councilman's interpretation creates: messages &#8212; conceded by stipulation to be electronic communications &#8212; briefly cease to be electronic communications for very short intervals, and then suddenly become electronic communications again. <i>Cf.</i> H.R.Rep. No. 99-647, at 35 (\"The term `electronic communication' is intended to cover a broad range of communication activities. . . .

Indeed, that is exactly what happened when Congress later removed the explicit reference to \"electronic storage\" from the definition of \"wire communication\" in the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act, Pub.L. No. 107-56, tit. II, &#167; 209(1)(A), 115 Stat. 272, 283 (2001). <i>See</i> Robert A. Pikowsky, <i>An Overview of the Law of Electronic Surveillance Post September 11, 2001,</i> 94 Law Libr.

The term \"intercept\" is defined broadly as \"the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 2510(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman's core argument on appeal is that because the messages at issue, when acquired, were in transient electronic storage, they were not \"electronic communication[s]\" and, therefore, section 2511(1)'s prohibition on \"intercept[ion]\" of any \"electronic communication\" did not apply. That is the argument that we have now rejected in holding that an e-mail message does not cease to be an \"electronic communication\" during the momentary intervals, intrinsic to the communication process, at which the message resides in transient electronic storage. <i>See supra</i> Part II.A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman's appeal does not provide any other basis for finding that the acquisitions were not \"intercept[ions]\" of \"electronic communication[s].\" To be sure, Councilman does argue that \"Congress intended `intercept' to cover acquisitions `contemporaneous with transmission.'\" However, his entire argument on this point is based on the theory, as he writes in his brief, that \"[c]ourts uniformly have understood `electronic storage' to <i>negate</i> the `contemporaneous with transmission' element of a Wiretap Act `intercept,'\" and therefore \"an e-mail in `electronic storage' . . . cannot by definition be acquired `contemporaneous with transmission.'\" That argument is simply a variation on, and entirely subsumed within, his primary argument concerning \"storage\" &#8212; the very argument that we have now rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, this appeal does not implicate the question of whether the term \"intercept\" applies only to acquisitions that occur contemporaneously with the transmission of a message from sender to recipient or, instead, extends to an event that occurs after a message has crossed the finish line of transmission (whatever that point may be). <i>See Pharmatrak,</i> 329 F.3d at 21-22 (noting that the concept of a contemporaneity or real-time requirement, which evolved in other factual contexts, may not be apt to address issues involving the application of the Wiretap Act to electronic communications). We therefore need not decide that question. <i>See United States v. Moran,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201379\"><a href=\"/opinion/201379/united-states-v-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that, in certain circumstances, an appellee is obliged, on pain of waiver, to raise additional or alternative bases for affirming a favorable judgment); <i>Raxton Corp. v.

Because the facts of this case and the arguments before us do not invite consideration of either the existence or the applicability of a contemporaneity or real-time requirement, we need not and do not plunge into that morass. We note, however, that even were we prepared to recognize a contemporaneity or real-time requirement &#8212; a step that we do not take today &#8212; we think it highly unlikely that Councilman could generate a winning argument in the circumstances of this case. Any such argument would entail a showing that each transmission was complete at the time of acquisition and, therefore, that the definition of \"intercept\" does not cover the acquisitions. Such a showing would appear to be impossible since we have concluded that the messages were electronic communications, and it is undisputed that they were acquired while they were still en route to the intended recipients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Councilman argues that acquisition of electronic communications in temporary electronic storage is regulated by the Stored Communications Act. From this he infers that such acquisition is <i>not</i> regulated by the Wiretap Act, or that, at minimum, the potential overlap implicates the rule of lenity or other doctrines of \"fair warning.\" Consequently, we must delve into the \"complex, often convoluted\" intersection of the Wiretap Act and Stored Communications Act. <i>United States v.

These types of stored communications &#8212; including stored e-mail messages &#8212; were not protected by the Wiretap Act. Therefore, Congress concluded that \"the information [in these communications] may be open to possible wrongful use and public disclosure by law enforcement authorities as well as unauthorized private parties.\" S.Rep.

Under this theory, &#167; 2701(c)(1) establishes virtually complete immunity for a service provider that \"obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to\" e-mail that is \"in electronic storage\" in its system. <i>See Fraser,</i> 352 F.3d at 115 (\"[W]e read &#167; 2701(c) literally to except from Title II's protection all searches by communications service providers.\"). The district court surmised that &#167; 2701(a) would have covered Councilman's conduct but that &#167; 2701(c)(1) exempted him. <i>Councilman,</i> 245 F.Supp.2d at 320.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second provision of the Stored Communications Act prohibits \"a person or entity providing an electronic communication service to the public [from] knowingly divulg[ing] to any person or entity the contents of a communication while in electronic storage by that service.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2702(a)(1). Yet this provision, too, has service provider exceptions, permitting a provider to divulge an electronic communication \"to a person employed or authorized or whose facilities are used to forward such communication to its destination,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2702(b)(4), or \"as may be necessarily incident to the rendition of the service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 2702(b)(5).

Since Congress enacted the ECPA as a package, he says, it did not intend to lay traps in the overlap between the two titles. If conduct that potentially falls under both titles is exempt from one of them, then that exemption provides a \"safe harbor\" and the conduct does not violate the other title either.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find this argument unpersuasive. In general, if two statutes cover the same conduct, the government may charge a violation of either. <i>See United States v.

In such a case, the prosecution has the right to select the statute under which the indictment will be brought.\"). Moreover, the exceptions in the Stored Communications Act do not, by their terms, apply to the Wiretap Act. The exception in &#167; 2701(c) specifically limits its application by stating that \"<i>[s]ubsection (a) of this section</i> does not apply . . . to conduct authorized\" by the service provider. (Emphasis added). The &#167; 2701(c)(1) provider exception's breadth presents a striking contrast to the Wiretap Act's own, much narrower provider exception:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for . . . an officer, employee, or agent of a provider of wire or electronic communication service, whose facilities are used in the transmission of a wire or electronic communication, to intercept, disclose, or use that communication in the normal course of his employment while engaged in any activity which is a <i>necessary incident to the rendition of his service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service</i>. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 2511(2)(a)(i) (emphasis added). It is indisputable that the Wiretap Act's narrower service provider exception would not protect Councilman. His alleged conduct was clearly not \"a necessary incident to the rendition of his service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service.\" If there were any doubt remaining, it would be resolved by the Wiretap Act's express provision that the only exceptions to its prohibitions are those specifically listed within the Wiretap Act, not those found in other laws. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1) (prohibitions apply \"[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided in <i>this chapter</i> [the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2510-2522]\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

Thus, almost a year before Councilman's alleged conduct, the academic literature had noted that, even under a reading of the ECPA narrower than ours, \"automatic routing software\" that automatically forwarded duplicate copies of a user's messages <i>would</i> qualify as \"interception of E-mail within the prohibition of the ECPA.\" <i>Id.</i> That observation anticipated this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the text of the statute does not specify whether the term \"electronic communication\" includes communications in electronic storage, the legislative history of the ECPA indicates that Congress intended the term to be defined broadly.

Second, and in the alternative, the result reached by the en banc majority deprives Councilman of due process of law, because he had no \"fair warning\" of the potential criminal consequences of his actions. <i>See United States v.

The answer to that question is not to be found in the wringing of the proverbial hands or dire warnings of the Doomsday that is predicted to follow one or the other conclusion. <i>Cf.</i> Yvette Joy Liebesman, <i>The Potential Effects of United States v.

In contrast, the term \"wire communication\" is defined as \"any aural transfer made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception . . . furnished or operated by any person engaged in providing or operating such facilities . . . <i>and such term includes any electronic storage</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> <i>of such communication.</i>\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2510(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is <i>Congress'</i> failure to provide this emphasized language in its definition of \"electronic communication\" that incites the majority into engaging in what I believe to be an unfortunate act of judicial legislation that no amount of syllogization can camouflage.

Councilman's \"interception\" of Interloc customers' e-mail was not akin to an interception engaged in by an outside party who was unrelated or unknown to the contracting parties. When a customer signs up with an e-mail provider like Interloc, he routinely is asked to read and expressly sign off on a privacy agreement which defines his expectations of privacy vis-&#224;-vis the provider. If the protections are inadequate, he may decline the e-mail service and seek an alternative service contract which will afford him the protections he requires. Neither the Wiretap Act nor its legislative history forecloses the inference that Congress, in its exclusion of \"electronic storage\" from the definition of \"electronic communication,\" intended to leave such matters to the exigencies of the contracting parties. If Interloc did intercept its customers' messages in breach of a privacy agreement, the remedy lies in contract, not in the Wiretap Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I see no point in rummaging through the legislative history of a statute whose language, or more accurately, absence thereof, speaks for itself. \"[W]hen the statute's language is plain, the sole function of the courts &#8212; at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd &#8212; is to enforce it according to its terms.\" <i>Dodd v.

[J]udicial reliance on legislative materials like committee reports, which are not themselves subject to the requirements of Article I, may give unrepresentative committee members&#8212;or worse yet, unelected staffers and lobbyists&#8212;both the power and incentive to attempt strategic manipulations of legislative history to secure results they were unable to achieve through the statutory text.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> In any event, I refer to the panel opinion on this point. <i>Councilman,</i> 373 F.3d at 203-04.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that both viewpoints on the first issue before the en banc court have been adequately expressed.

As demonstrated by the results of previous efforts by this and other courts to grapple with the statute in question, any lingering ambiguity that makes room for the majority's interpretation certainly qualifies as \"grievous,\" <i>maj. op.</i> at 81. Due process, therefore, requires that the statute be construed against criminal liability, in accordance with the rule of lenity. <i>See Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118098\"><a href=\"/opinion/118098/united-states-v-lanier/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Even if the ambiguity is not so serious, and \"clarity at the requisite level may be supplied by [the majority's] judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain statute, due process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope.\" <i>Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118098\"><a href=\"/opinion/118098/united-states-v-lanier/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whichever doctrine of \"fair warning\" one might apply, the bottom line is that the statute and the cases construing it did not make it \"reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant's conduct was criminal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 267, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118098\"><a href=\"/opinion/118098/united-states-v-lanier/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is little in any of these that would have given Councilman fair notice of the en banc majority's interpretation, which itself requires reliance on legislative \"history\" that resembles a Byzantine maze.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the 1997 law review article cited by the majority render the interpretation adopted today foreseeable. Quite the opposite, in fact. That article examined the decision in <i>Steve Jackson Games,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6751\"><a href=\"/opinion/6751/steve-jackson-games-inc-v-us-secret-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, in which the Fifth Circuit determined that the pre-retrieval seizure of private e-mails stored on a bulletin board server did not constitute an \"intercept\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1)(a). White wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rejecting the appellant's argument that logically seizure of something before it is received should constitute interception, the Steve Jackson Games court held that the E-mail stored on the [bulletin board's] computer hard drive was no longer in transmission, and thus could not be intercepted within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511(1)(a). . . . The narrowness of the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of \"interception\" is important. Following the Fifth Circuit's rationale, <i>there is only a narrow window during which an E-mail interception may occur &#8212; the seconds or mili-seconds before which a newly composed message is saved to any temporary location following a send command.</i> Therefore, unless some type of automatic routing software is used (for example, a duplicate of all an employee's messages are automatically sent to the employee's boss), interception of E-mail within the prohibition of the ECPA is virtually impossible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">White, <i>supra,</i> at 1082-83 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). Clearly, the software used by Councilman was not \"automatic routing software\" that operates \"before a newly composed message is saved to any temporary location.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1083. White's article, like other scholarship available at the time, thus would have forcefully suggested that Councilman's conduct was not prohibited. <i>See</i> Thomas R. Greenberg, <i>E-Mail and Voice Mail: Employee Privacy and the Federal Wiretap Statute,</i> 44 Am. U.L.Rev. 219, 249 (1994) (\"Thus, the limitations imposed on employer interceptions of wire and electronic communications vanish once the same communication is in storage. Accordingly, in order to avoid Title III liability, an employer need only access employee communications once they have been stored.\"); Ruel Torres Hern&#225;ndez, <i>ECPA and Online Computer Privacy,</i> 41 Fed. Comm. L.J. 17, 39 (1988-1989) (\"In other words, there simply is no ECPA violation if the person or entity providing a wire or electronic communication service intentionally examines everything [in storage] on the system, whether or not it is for the purpose of a quality control check.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, I am at a loss to conceive how Councilman would have had fair notice of the majority's interpretation at the time of his actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Congress's provision of a good faith exception for those who divulge intercepted communications because they misconstrued the Wiretap Act's narrow exceptions to criminal liability as an affirmative defense, <i>see maj. op.</i> at 36-37 (citing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2520(d)(3)), is irrelevant. Councilman should not have to show he relied on those exceptions to divulge the e-mails he obtained, because he had no \"reasonably clear\" indication that to do so would otherwise violate the Wiretap Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Councilman is being held to a level of knowledge which would not be expected of any of the judges who have dealt with this problem, to say nothing of \"men [and women] of common intelligence.\" <i>Lanier,</i> 520 U.S. at 266, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118098\"><a href=\"/opinion/118098/united-states-v-lanier/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
