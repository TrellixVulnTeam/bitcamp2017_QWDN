R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 05-1241\n\n                 XIU LI YUAN a/k/a YONG XIU LIN,\n\n                               Petitioner,\n\n                                     v.\n\n               ALBERTO GONZALES, Attorney General\n\n                               Respondent.\n\n\n              ON PETITION FOR REVIEW OF AN ORDER OF\n\n                THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\n\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Haian Lin for petitioner.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney and Anita\nJohnson, Assistant United States Attorney on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                          November 23, 2005\n\f          Per curiam.     Petitioner Xiu Li Yuan, a citizen of the\n\nPeople's Republic of China, unlawfully entered the United States on\n\nJuly 7, 2000 and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture.          Yuan sought\n\nrelief on the ground that the Chinese government forced her to have\n\nan abortion.    See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(42)(A).   An Immigration Judge\n\n(IJ) denied Yuan's relief requests, and the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed.    Yuan has timely petitioned this court for\n\nreview of the final agency decision.     We deny the petition.\n\n           At her removal hearing, Yuan testified as follows.     She\n\nresided in Fujian Province of China, and, in December 1994,\n\nmarried Xin Ren Chen.     The couple registered their marriage in\n\nAugust 1995.     At that time, Yuan was visibly pregnant.         The\n\ngovernment official with whom they registered told Yuan that she\n\nwas pregnant \"early\" and, therefore, assessed a substantial fine.\n\nIn July 1995, \"the local commune\" damaged the couple's house\n\nbecause they had not paid the fine.    Five or six people came to the\n\nhouse and told Yuan to pay, before damaging the doors and windows\n\nwith hammers.   Chen was not at home when the damage occurred.   Yuan\n\ndescribed the house as facing a roadway.\n\n          After Yuan's son was born, the government forced Yuan to\n\nhave an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted.      But the IUD fell out,\n\nand she became pregnant with the couple's second child.      When the\n\ngovernment discovered this pregnancy, it immediately forced Yuan to\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fhave an abortion.     Yuan's son was at her mother's house when the\n\nabortion occurred, and Chen was at work.      After the abortion, Yuan\n\ncalled Chen, and he met her at her mother's house that afternoon.\n\nSeveral days later, the government forced Yuan to have another IUD\n\ninserted.     Yuan   substantiated   her   testimony   with   documentary\n\nsubmissions, including a certificate of abortion dated March 1998\n\nand a picture purporting to show the damage to the house.\n\n            Chen also testified at the removal hearing.        Concerning\n\nthe damage to the house, Chen stated that the government imposed\n\nthe fine in January 1996 because of the early birth of their son.\n\nThe local authorities came to inform him of the fine and gave him\n\nseveral days to pay.     When he failed to do so, a \"cadre\" smashed\n\nthe windows and doors of his house.        He said he was at home when\n\nthe attack occurred.    In describing the house, Chen explained that\n\nit had open space in front and abutted other inhabited homes in the\n\nrear.\n\n            Regarding the abortion, Chen testified that, on the date\n\nit was performed, he was hiding in another village.           Yuan called\n\nhim from the hospital to tell him about the procedure.           At that\n\ntime, their son was staying with his aunt.      Chen met Yuan at their\n\nhome the following day and stayed with her for several days before\n\nleaving.\n\n            At the conclusion of the removal hearing, the IJ rejected\n\nYuan's petitions for relief on the ground that her testimony was\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fnot credible. The BIA affirmed on this basis.             Because the BIA\n\nadopted the IJ's reasoning, we review the IJ's decision directly.\n\nAlbathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Yuan challenges the IJ's adverse credibility finding\n\nwhich was sufficient to warrant the denial of all forms of relief\n\nthat Yuan sought. We recently discussed the principles guiding our\n\nreview of challenges of this type:\n\n            [M]any asylum claims . . . depend on whether\n            the statements made by an alien in support of\n            the asylum application are accepted as\n            credible. When the agency's final decision\n            rests on the ground that the alien was not\n            credible,   then,   we    see   whether   the\n            determination    of     non-credibility    is\n            conclusive of [her] claim.    If the adverse\n            credibility determination is supported by\n            substantial evidence -- that is, if we cannot\n            say a finding that the alien is credible is\n            compelled -- then the decision must be\n            affirmed.    There may be times when, in\n            performing our judicial review function, we\n            are impaired because the agency does not\n            explain the adverse credibility finding.\n            That situation does not arise when the IJ\n            gives specific reasons for the determination,\n            which are in turn supported by substantial\n            evidence.\n\nChen v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 110, 113 (1st Cir. 2005) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            To   support    the   adverse   credibility   finding,     the   IJ\n\nidentified   material      inconsistencies    between   Yuan's   and   Chen's\n\ntestimony.    Yuan and Chen provided divergent accounts of the time\n\nof day that the abortion took place, Chen's and their son's\n\nlocation on that day, and the place and time that they met\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthereafter. Yuan and Chen also provided inconsistent stories about\n\nthe alleged damage to their house. They provided conflicting dates\n\nof when the fine was imposed and when the \"cadre\" came to damage\n\nthe house.   They also disagreed on whether Chen was at the house\n\nwhen the damage occurred.1\n\n          The IJ also found that much of the key documentary\n\nevidence was suspect.    The IJ declined to credit the purported\n\npicture of the damaged house because the building in the picture\n\ndiffered materially from Chen's description.   The IJ also declined\n\nto credit Yuan's purported abortion certificate because a State\n\nDepartment Report has stated that the Chinese government does not\n\ntypically issue such certificates for forced abortions, and that\n\nsuch certificates are often forged by asylum applicants.   See Qin\n\nv. Gonzales, 360 F.3d 302, 307 (1st Cir. 2003) (approving the BIA's\n\nreliance on State Department Report to discredit purported forced-\n\nabortion certificate).\n\n          The IJ made several findings, all supported by the\n\nrecord, that contributed to the overall conclusion that Yuan's\n\ntestimony was not credible.   The agency record is not so one-sided\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      These inconsistencies pertain to the two incidents that most\nstrongly supported Yuan's asylum claim. This case is therefore\ndistinguishable from Ren v. Ashcroft, No. 04-1702, 2005 WL 1950805,\nat *4 (1st Cir. Aug. 16, 2005), in which we rejected the BIA's\nadverse credibility finding where the identified inconsistencies\nconcerned the witnesses' interpretation of peripheral events which\ndid not go \"to the heart of the asylum claim.\"\n\n                                -5-\n\fthat   the   IJ   was   compelled   to   reach   the   opposite   conclusion\n\nregarding Yuan's credibility.\n\n             The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",
