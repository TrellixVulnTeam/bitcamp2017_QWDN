The district court granted summary judgment in favor\n\nof Defendant and Plaintiff appealed.                   We have jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.               For the reasons that follow\n\nwe affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further\n\nconsideration.\n\n                                      I.\n\n              On an appeal from the grant of summary judgment, we\n\nview the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty.     See Feeney v. Correctional Medical Services, Inc.,\n\n464 F.3d 158, 161 (1st Cir. 2006).                   We recite the facts as\n\nfound    by   the   district      court   and   supported      by     the   record\n\nadding a few undisputed details gleaned from the record.\n\n              Plaintiff is a Hispanic woman, born in New York to\n\nPuerto Rican parents.             Plaintiff has been a United States\n\nPostal Service employee from May 1981 through the present\n\ndate.     During     the   time    relevant     to    this    case,    Plaintiff\n\nworked at the Postal Service Air Mail Facility in Carolina,\n\nPuerto    Rico      (the   Caribbean        Branch),     as    Transportation\n\nContracts Manager of the Caribbean district.                        Since 2000,\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fPlaintiff’s position has been classified as EAS Level 25. 1\n\nThe Caribbean Branch office is part of the New York Metro\n\nArea    Distribution          Networks     Office   (“NY    Metro      DNO”).      NY\n\nMetro DNO is divided into two sectors: Networks functions\n\nand Transportation Contracts functions.                     Plaintiff reports\n\nto Postal Service Headquarters in Washington D.C. and also\n\nto her supervisor, Stuart Gossoff, at the NY Metro DNO, who\n\namong    other       things,      is    responsible       for    overseeing       the\n\nNetworks and Transportation Contracts functions of the                             NY\n\nMetro DNO.          Plaintiff is the only female manager out of\n\ntwelve       DNO   managers       nationwide.        She    is    one    of     three\n\nmanagers in the NY Metro DNO.\n\n              In her capacity as Transportation Contracts Manager\n\nof     the     Caribbean        district,        Plaintiff       is     officially\n\nresponsible for Transportation Contracts functions work.                           In\n\naddition, because she is physically present in the Caribbean\n\nBranch       office,      she   has     been    responsible      for    day-to-day\n\nmanagement         of   the     Networks       function    for   the     Caribbean\n\ndistrict.          She has two counterparts in the NY Metro DNO:\n\nMark    Stein,      who   works    on    Networks    and   is    officially       the\n\nNetworks supervisor for the Caribbean district, and Héctor\n\nMartínez, who works on Transportation Contracts.\n\n\n1\n   EAS refers to the Executive and Administrative System of\npay and grade. The higher the EAS level, the higher the pay\nrange and grade.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f            In    April   2003,    the   Postal   Service    instituted    a\n\nnationwide       Area   Office     Distribution   Networks     Realignment\n\nProgram.         The    realignment      only   affected     the    Networks\n\nfunctions of the DNOs. 2            The realignment created four new\n\npositions of Senior Networks Operations Analyst EAS Level\n\n23,   and   fourteen      Senior    Networks    Operations    Analyst    EAS\n\nLevel 21 to be allocated to the NY Metro DNO.                      Stein was\n\nin charge of selecting employees to fill these positions.\n\nStein instructed Networks functions employees ranked lower\n\nthan EAS 21 to apply for the new positions.                  The Caribbean\n\nBranch office had two such employees: Jorge Antongiorgi and\n\nFelix Torres.\n\n            Plaintiff learned Stein announced at a meeting that\n\nnone of the EAS Level 21 or 23 positions would be assigned\n\nto the Caribbean Branch office. 3           Plaintiff contacted Gossoff\n\nto express her discontent.           Plaintiff complained about being\n\nexcluded from participating in the decision concerning the\n\ndistribution of the newly created positions as well as the\n\nselection of employees to fill those positions.                    Plaintiff\n\n\n2\n   The realignment plan left unaffected staffing conditions\non the Contracts functions.\n3\n   Antongiorgi applied and was granted an interview for a\nEAS 21 position.      During the interview, Stein asked\nAntongiorgi whether if selected for the position he would be\nwilling to relocate to New York.   Antongiorgi expressed an\nunwillingness to relocate and, consequently, was not offered\nthe position.\n\n                                      -4-\n\falso expressed her disagreement with the decision not to\n\nassign    any    of       the   new    positions    to    the    Caribbean     Branch\n\noffice.     Plaintiff told Gossoff she believed the actions\n\nwere discriminatory.                  Gossoff informed Plaintiff that the\n\nnature of the Caribbean district operations, including the\n\nvolume of mail distributed in the                   Caribbean and the type of\n\nNetworks Transportation, did not warrant any EAS Level 21 or\n\n23   positions        when      comparing     those   factors      with   New    York\n\noperations.           Contemporaneously,            Plaintiff      complained      to\n\nGossoff about allegedly derogatory statements he had made\n\nand that other managers had made in his presence concerning\n\nmembers of the Caribbean Branch office.\n\n            According           to    Plaintiff, prior to         the   April    2003\n\nrealignment, Plaintiff supervised three employees: Torres,\n\nan EAS Level 19 Networks Specialist; Antongiorgi, who was\n\nalso   an   EAS       Level      19    Networks     Specialist      but   did    some\n\nContracts work; and Concepción González, an EAS Level 19\n\nContracts Specialists.                It is undisputed the Senior Networks\n\nOperation Analyst EAS Level 23 positions were created so\n\nthat the EAS Level 25 area networks office managers would\n\nnot have to directly oversee EAS Level 21 and EAS Level 19\n\nemployees       on    a    day-to-day      basis.        After   the    realignment\n\nTorres    and    Antongiorgi           were   assigned     to    report   to    Danny\n\nFarino, an EAS Level 23 Senior Networks Analyst in the New\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fYork Metro DNO.        Nevertheless, Plaintiff’s day-to-day duties\n\nand responsibilities over these Networks function employees\n\nwere    left    unaffected.           Even    though      on    paper    the   two\n\nemployees      were    under    Farino’s      supervision,         according    to\n\nPlaintiff,      they    still    reported        to    her.       Following    the\n\nimplementations of the realignment, however, Torres retired.\n\nAt Plaintiff’s request, Torres’s position was converted into\n\na Contracts position now occupied by Noemí Carrión.                       Carrión\n\nand González work directly under Plaintiff’s supervision.\n\n            After exhausting all her administrative remedies,\n\nPlaintiff       brought        this      action         claiming        Defendant\n\ndiscriminated against her on account of her sex and national\n\norigin in violation of Title VII by (1) excluding her from\n\nan important managerial decision, (2) removing members of\n\nher staff from under her supervision, (3) failing to assign\n\nnewly created positions to the Caribbean Branch Office, and\n\n(4) making and tolerating derogatory comments alluding to\n\nher    national    origin.           Plaintiff    also        claimed   Defendant\n\nretaliated        against       her      after         she      complained      of\n\ndiscrimination by ceasing to communicate directly with her.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of discovery, Defendant moved for\n\nsummary    judgment.           The    district        court    granted   summary\n\njudgment to Defendant on all claims concluding Plaintiff did\n\nnot suffer an adverse employment action.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                                        II.\n\n              We review the district court order granting summary\n\njudgment de novo.           See Thore v. Howe, 466 F.3d 173, 178 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).         The purpose of summary judgment is to pierce\n\nthe pleadings and assess the proof to determine if there is\n\na genuine need for trial.              Thus, summary judgment is proper\n\n“if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\n\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\n\nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as\n\na    matter    of   law.”      Fed.     R.    Civ.   P.    56(c).      To     overcome\n\nsummary       judgment,     the   nonmoving      party         must   rebut    such    a\n\nshowing by presenting sufficient evidence from which a jury\n\ncould reasonably find in its favor.                   Davric Maine Corp. v.\n\nRancourt, 216 F.3d 143, 147 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                         A.\n\n              Title VII makes it unlawful for a federal employer\n\nto   discriminate       against    an    employee         on    the   basis    of   the\n\nemployee’s “sex, or national origin.”                          42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n16(a).         Absent     direct      evidence       of    discrimination,            an\n\nemployee may proceed to prove her case using the McDonnell\n\nDouglas burden-shifting framework.                    See McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).                      Under this well-known\n\nanalytical framework, an employee has the initial burden of\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fcoming forward with sufficient evidence to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of discrimination.                       To do so, an employee must\n\nshow, among other things, she suffered an adverse employment\n\naction.         See    Santiago-Ramos           v.    Centennial         P.R.     Wireless\n\nCorp., 217 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir. 2000) (sex discrimination);\n\nFeliciano de la Cruz v. El Conquistador Resort and Country\n\nClub,     218    F.3d      1,    5    (1st     Cir.       2000)    (national           origin\n\ndiscrimination).             Generally, an adverse employment action\n\ninvolves a discrete change in the terms and conditions of\n\nemployment,       such      as   “hiring,       firing,      failing         to    promote,\n\nreassignment with significantly different responsibilities,\n\nor   a   decision       causing         significant         change      in     benefits.”\n\nBurlington       Indus.,         Inc.    v.     Ellerth,         524    U.S.      742,    761\n\n(1998); accord Gu v. Boston Police Dep’t, 312 F.3d 6, 14\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (“To be adverse, an action must materially\n\nchange     the        conditions        of      plaintiffs’            employ.”).           A\n\nmaterially adverse change in the terms and conditions of\n\nemployment        “must          be     more        disruptive          than       a     mere\n\ninconvenience         or    an    alteration         of    job    responsibilities.”\n\nMarrero v. Goya of P.R., 304 F.3d 7, 23 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            Plaintiff argues she suffered the following adverse\n\nemployment actions: (1) Defendant excluded her from a major\n\nmanagerial       decision,        (2)    Defendant         removed       two      employees\n\nfrom     under   her       supervision,        and    (3)    Defendant          failed     to\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\fassign any EAS Level 21 and 23 positions to the Caribbean\n\nBranch office.          After reviewing the record before us, we\n\nagree Plaintiff did not suffer an adverse employment action.\n\nPlaintiff    presented       no     evidence         the    allegedly       adverse\n\nemployment       actions    materially          changed        the     terms       and\n\nconditions of her employment.\n\n            Plaintiff’s exclusion from one managerial decision\n\nis insufficient to constitute a material change in the terms\n\nand conditions of her employment.                    See Gu, 312 F.3d at 14;\n\nsee also Duffy v. Paper Magic Group, Inc., 265 F.3d 163, 169\n\n(3d Cir. 2001) (concluding exclusion from committees, hiring\n\ndecisions, a single staff meeting, and a single supervisor\n\nseminar     insufficiently         severe       to     alter    conditions          of\n\nemployments so as to make employment unbearable).                                As we\n\nnoted elsewhere, “if an employee finds herself . . . without\n\na voice in major decisions, this could constitute an adverse\n\nemployment action.”         Gu, 312 F.3d at 14 (emphasis added).\n\nPlaintiff,       however,       presented        no        evidence        she     was\n\nsubsequently excluded from other managerial decisions.                            More\n\nimportantly, Plaintiff presented no evidence the terms and\n\nconditions of her employment included a right to participate\n\nin the decision.           The record reflects that at all times\n\nrelevant    to   this    case     Stein   was    officially          the   Networks\n\nfunctions supervisor of the Caribbean district and, as such,\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fresponsible for the Networks employees in the NY Metro DNO.\n\nWhile Plaintiff’s physical presence in Puerto Rico allowed\n\nher   to   exert    some    supervisory          authority    over    Networks\n\nfunctions    employees      in    the    Caribbean    Branch       office,   the\n\nrealignment of the Networks functions of the NY Metro DNO\n\n(including the Caribbean district) involved matters beyond\n\nday-to-day    management         that    fell    outside     the   purview    of\n\nPlaintiff’s duties and responsibilities.\n\n            Plaintiff also did not suffer an adverse employment\n\naction as a result of Farino’s new supervisory role over\n\nAntongiorgi and Torres.            Plaintiff alleges she lost direct\n\nsupervisory authority over these employees as a result of\n\nthe realignment, but as explained, Stein, not Plaintiff, was\n\nthe official supervisor of the Networks employees in the\n\nCaribbean Branch.        It is undisputed that while Farino became\n\nAntongiorgi       and   Torres’s        official    supervisor,      Plaintiff\n\nmaintained    her       day-to-day       supervisory       role    over   these\n\nemployees after the realignment took effect.                  Therefore, the\n\nstatus quo remained unaffected.                 See id. (noting that only\n\na dramatic decrease in supervisory authority may constitute\n\nan adverse employment action).                 Moreover, shortly after the\n\nrealignment, Torres retired and at Plaintiff’s request his\n\nposition    was    converted      into    a    Contracts     position,    which\n\nCarrión currently occupies.              Thus, as things currently stand\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fPlaintiff officially supervises two Contracts employees, one\n\nmore employee under her official supervision than she did\n\nprior to the realignment.\n\n            Plaintiff        also      argued          she    suffered          an     adverse\n\nemployment      action       as   a   result        of      Defendant’s         failure        to\n\nassign the higher level position to the Caribbean Branch\n\noffice    because       according           to     Plaintiff,         “the       number        of\n\nemployees assigned to supervise are criteria considered in\n\nqualifying       candidates           for    promotions[.]”                     Title        VII,\n\nhowever, does not guarantee a promotion.                             “Congress did not\n\nintend    by    Title    VII,     however,          to      guarantee       a    job    [or     a\n\npromotion] to every person regardless of qualifications.                                       In\n\nshort, the Act does not command that any person be hired [or\n\npromoted]      simply    because        he       was     formerly     the       subject        of\n\ndiscrimination,         or   because        he     is    a   member     of      a    minority\n\ngroup.”        McDonnell-Douglas                 Corp.,      411     U.S.       at     800-01.\n\nMoreover,       Plaintiff         presented            no    evidence           Defendant’s\n\nfailure    to    assign       the      newly       created         positions           to     the\n\nCaribbean       Branch       office     diminished             her    chances           to     be\n\npromoted.       See Serna v. City of San Antonio, 244 F.3d 479,\n\n(5th Cir. 2001) (finding no adverse employment action where\n\nthe plaintiff presented no objective evidence his chances\n\nfor promotion were reduced by employer’s act).                                   To prevail\n\non summary judgment the nonmoving party must do more than\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\frest    upon    merely      “conclusory        allegations,     improbable\n\ninferences,    and    unsupported      speculations.”         Quiñones     v.\n\nBuick, 436 F.3d 284, 289 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           After the realignment was implemented, Plaintiff\n\nwas still employed as Transportation Contracts Manager of\n\nthe    Caribbean     district,   her     EAS    ranking   and      pay   were\n\nunaffected,    and    her   supervisory    authority      and   day-to-day\n\nmanagerial duties and responsibilities remained the same.\n\nTherefore,     the   district    court    did     not   err   in   granting\n\nsummary judgment to Defendant on Plaintiff’s Title VII claim\n\nof discrimination. 4\n\n\n4\n   In addition to Plaintiff’s disparate treatment claim,\nPlaintiff also brought a disparate impact claim alleging\nDefendant’s practice as it relates to excluding the\nCaribbean Branch from being assigned EAS Level 21 and 23\npositions   constitutes   national   origin  discrimination.\nAccording to Plaintiff, Stein’s decision to exclude “Puerto\nRico from higher grade levels, has an adverse impact on all\nthe employees of the Caribbean Branch . . . in terms of\ntheir professional advancements and development[,]” and on\nPlaintiff in terms of “her career development[.]”\n     Plaintiff’s disparate impact claim fails for two\nreasons. As discussed, Plaintiff presented no evidence she\nwas not promoted as a result of Defendant’s decision not to\nassign the newly created positions to the Caribbean Branch.\nPlaintiff’s claim also fails insofar as she attempts to step\ninto the shoes of the Caribbean employees who were allegedly\ndiscriminated against as a result of Defendant’s act.\nPlaintiff lacks standing to bring a claim on behalf of the\nCaribbean employees allegedly affected by Defendant’s act.\nTo have standing, a plaintiff must allege some personal\ninjury   fairly  traceable   to  the  defendant’s  allegedly\nunlawful conduct, which she has not done here. See Baena v.\nKPMG LLP, 453 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Valley Forge\nChristian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation of Church\n                                              (continued...)\n\n                                  -12-\n\f                                          B.\n\n             As part of her claim of discrimination, Plaintiff\n\nalso alleged she suffered an adverse employment action when\n\nGossoff      made    derogatory          comments       and    tolerated       other\n\nemployees      who        made    derogatory        comments        alluding      to\n\nPlaintiff’s national origin. The district court correctly\n\nrecognized     that       traditionally         these     allegations     are    put\n\nforward as a hostile work environment claim.                      Discrimination\n\nbased on sex or national origin that creates a hostile work\n\nenvironment     violates         Title    VII.      See    Harris    v.   Forklift\n\nSys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).                       Plaintiff makes the\n\nfollowing allegations of derogatory language: (1) Gossoff\n\nonce   referred      to    the    Caribbean      Branch       employees   as    “you\n\npeople,” (2) Stein once stated in reference to mail coming\n\nfrom Puerto Rico as mail “coming off of the banana boat,”\n\nand (3) a NY Metro employee once stated the employees in\n\nPuerto Rico were like blind musicians Ray Charles and José\n\nFeliciano.\n\n             Assuming discriminatory animus toward Puerto Ricans\n\nwas    the     motivation          for     these        comments,     they       are\n\ninsufficient, as a matter of law, to create a hostile work\n\nenvironment.          “[S]imple      teasing,       offhand       comments,      and\n\n\n4\n   (...continued)\nand State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982)).      Therefore,\nPlaintiff cannot prevail on her disparate impact claim.\n\n                                         -13-\n\fisolated       incidents      (unless       extremely      serious)      will      not\n\namount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions\n\nof employment.” Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S.\n\n775,     787-88      (1998).          A    working      environment        must     be\n\n“permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and\n\ninsult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the\n\nterms     and     conditions      of        victim’s      employment”       to      be\n\nactionable under Title VII.                  Id.       at 21.     Therefore, the\n\ndistrict court did not err in finding the alleged derogatory\n\nremarks could not establish a hostile work environment.\n\n                                           C.\n\n            Plaintiff also brought a claim under Title VII for\n\nretaliation alleging that after she complained to Gossoff,\n\nhe stopped communicating directly with her.                         According to\n\nPlaintiff,        Gossoff      began       communicating         with    Plaintiff\n\nthrough employees ranked lower than her.                       The district court\n\nfound Plaintiff’s alleged retaliatory act did not rise to\n\nthe    level    of     an   adverse       employment     action.        While     this\n\nappeal    was     pending,     however,          the   Supreme     Court    decided\n\nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 __ U.S. __,\n\n126 S. Ct. 2405 (2006), changing the legal standard to be\n\napplied to claims of retaliation brought under Title VII.\n\nWe    express     no    opinion   as       to    how    this    issue   should      be\n\nresolved.       We think it proper to allow the district court to\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\ffirst   address     this     issue      in   light    of     Burlington.\n\nAccordingly,   we   remand   to   the    district    court   Plaintiff’s\n\nTitle VII retaliation claim. 5\n\n         Affirmed in Part, Vacated in Part, and Remanded in\n\nPart.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Plaintiff also argues the alleged acts of discrimination\ndiscussed above are also acts of retaliation because in 1997\nshe engaged in protected activity by filing a complaint of\ndiscrimination against the Postal Service.          We find\nPlaintiff’s argument unpersuasive. All the alleged acts of\ndiscrimination occurred in 2003.     Plaintiff presented no\nevidence of a     casual connection between the adverse\nemployment actions in 2003 and the protected activity in\n1997, nor can we reasonably infer any such evidence.    See,\ne.g., Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de\nMelecio, 406 F.3d 1, 11 n.5 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing cases\nholding too much time between protected activity and\nretaliatory act undermines argument of a causal connection).\n\n                                  -15-\n\f",

We recite the facts as\n\nfound    by   the   district      court   and   supported      by     the   record\n\nadding a few undisputed details gleaned from the record.\n\n              Plaintiff is a Hispanic woman, born in New York to\n\nPuerto Rican parents.             Plaintiff has been a United States\n\nPostal Service employee from May 1981 through the present\n\ndate.     During     the   time    relevant     to    this    case,    Plaintiff\n\nworked at the Postal Service Air Mail Facility in Carolina,\n\nPuerto    Rico      (the   Caribbean        Branch),     as    Transportation\n\nContracts Manager of the Caribbean district.                        Since 2000,\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fPlaintiff’s position has been classified as EAS Level 25. 1\n\nThe Caribbean Branch office is part of the New York Metro\n\nArea    Distribution          Networks     Office   (“NY    Metro      DNO”).      NY\n\nMetro DNO is divided into two sectors: Networks functions\n\nand Transportation Contracts functions.                     Plaintiff reports\n\nto Postal Service Headquarters in Washington D.C. and also\n\nto her supervisor, Stuart Gossoff, at the NY Metro DNO, who\n\namong    other       things,      is    responsible       for    overseeing       the\n\nNetworks and Transportation Contracts functions of the                             NY\n\nMetro DNO.          Plaintiff is the only female manager out of\n\ntwelve       DNO   managers       nationwide.        She    is    one    of     three\n\nmanagers in the NY Metro DNO.\n\n              In her capacity as Transportation Contracts Manager\n\nof     the     Caribbean        district,        Plaintiff       is     officially\n\nresponsible for Transportation Contracts functions work.                           In\n\naddition, because she is physically present in the Caribbean\n\nBranch       office,      she   has     been    responsible      for    day-to-day\n\nmanagement         of   the     Networks       function    for   the     Caribbean\n\ndistrict.          She has two counterparts in the NY Metro DNO:\n\nMark    Stein,      who   works    on    Networks    and   is    officially       the\n\nNetworks supervisor for the Caribbean district, and Héctor\n\nMartínez, who works on Transportation Contracts.\n\n\n1\n   EAS refers to the Executive and Administrative System of\npay and grade. The higher the EAS level, the higher the pay\nrange and grade.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f            In    April   2003,    the   Postal   Service    instituted    a\n\nnationwide       Area   Office     Distribution   Networks     Realignment\n\nProgram.         The    realignment      only   affected     the    Networks\n\nfunctions of the DNOs. 2            The realignment created four new\n\npositions of Senior Networks Operations Analyst EAS Level\n\n23,   and   fourteen      Senior    Networks    Operations    Analyst    EAS\n\nLevel 21 to be allocated to the NY Metro DNO.                      Stein was\n\nin charge of selecting employees to fill these positions.\n\nStein instructed Networks functions employees ranked lower\n\nthan EAS 21 to apply for the new positions.                  The Caribbean\n\nBranch office had two such employees: Jorge Antongiorgi and\n\nFelix Torres.\n\n            Plaintiff learned Stein announced at a meeting that\n\nnone of the EAS Level 21 or 23 positions would be assigned\n\nto the Caribbean Branch office. 3           Plaintiff contacted Gossoff\n\nto express her discontent.           Plaintiff complained about being\n\nexcluded from participating in the decision concerning the\n\ndistribution of the newly created positions as well as the\n\nselection of employees to fill those positions.                    Plaintiff\n\n\n2\n   The realignment plan left unaffected staffing conditions\non the Contracts functions.\n3\n   Antongiorgi applied and was granted an interview for a\nEAS 21 position.      During the interview, Stein asked\nAntongiorgi whether if selected for the position he would be\nwilling to relocate to New York.   Antongiorgi expressed an\nunwillingness to relocate and, consequently, was not offered\nthe position.\n\n                                      -4-\n\falso expressed her disagreement with the decision not to\n\nassign    any    of       the   new    positions    to    the    Caribbean     Branch\n\noffice.     Plaintiff told Gossoff she believed the actions\n\nwere discriminatory.                  Gossoff informed Plaintiff that the\n\nnature of the Caribbean district operations, including the\n\nvolume of mail distributed in the                   Caribbean and the type of\n\nNetworks Transportation, did not warrant any EAS Level 21 or\n\n23   positions        when      comparing     those   factors      with   New    York\n\noperations.           Contemporaneously,            Plaintiff      complained      to\n\nGossoff about allegedly derogatory statements he had made\n\nand that other managers had made in his presence concerning\n\nmembers of the Caribbean Branch office.\n\n            According           to    Plaintiff, prior to         the   April    2003\n\nrealignment, Plaintiff supervised three employees: Torres,\n\nan EAS Level 19 Networks Specialist; Antongiorgi, who was\n\nalso   an   EAS       Level      19    Networks     Specialist      but   did    some\n\nContracts work; and Concepción González, an EAS Level 19\n\nContracts Specialists.                It is undisputed the Senior Networks\n\nOperation Analyst EAS Level 23 positions were created so\n\nthat the EAS Level 25 area networks office managers would\n\nnot have to directly oversee EAS Level 21 and EAS Level 19\n\nemployees       on    a    day-to-day      basis.        After   the    realignment\n\nTorres    and    Antongiorgi           were   assigned     to    report   to    Danny\n\nFarino, an EAS Level 23 Senior Networks Analyst in the New\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fYork Metro DNO.        Nevertheless, Plaintiff’s day-to-day duties\n\nand responsibilities over these Networks function employees\n\nwere    left    unaffected.           Even    though      on    paper    the   two\n\nemployees      were    under    Farino’s      supervision,         according    to\n\nPlaintiff,      they    still    reported        to    her.       Following    the\n\nimplementations of the realignment, however, Torres retired.\n\nAt Plaintiff’s request, Torres’s position was converted into\n\na Contracts position now occupied by Noemí Carrión.                       Carrión\n\nand González work directly under Plaintiff’s supervision.\n\n            After exhausting all her administrative remedies,\n\nPlaintiff       brought        this      action         claiming        Defendant\n\ndiscriminated against her on account of her sex and national\n\norigin in violation of Title VII by (1) excluding her from\n\nan important managerial decision, (2) removing members of\n\nher staff from under her supervision, (3) failing to assign\n\nnewly created positions to the Caribbean Branch Office, and\n\n(4) making and tolerating derogatory comments alluding to\n\nher    national    origin.           Plaintiff    also        claimed   Defendant\n\nretaliated        against       her      after         she      complained      of\n\ndiscrimination by ceasing to communicate directly with her.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of discovery, Defendant moved for\n\nsummary    judgment.
