The government appeals from\n                                   \n\na district court pretrial order suppressing the testimony  of its\n\ncentral  witness in  the prosecution  of defendant-appellee  Noel\n\nFemia for  various drug  crimes.  We  have jurisdiction  under 18\n\nU.S.C.   3731.   The district  court suppressed the  testimony in\n\norder  to  remedy a  perceived violation  of Femia's  due process\n\nrights,  resulting   from  the  government's   allegedly  grossly\n\nnegligent destruction of tape recordings of conversations between\n\nthe witness  and other  co-conspirators.   For  the reasons  that\n\nfollow,  we reverse  and  remand with  directions  to vacate  the\n\nsuppression order.\n\n                                I\n\n          In   the  summer   of   1985,  the   Drug   Enforcement\n\nAdministration (\"DEA\")  entered an  on-going  investigation of  a\n\nmetropolitan Boston cocaine  organization known as the  \"Triple X\n\nPublic  Service  Corporation\"  (\"Triple   X\"),  which  was  being\n\nconducted by the  Ashland, Massachusetts Police Department.   The\n\nDEA  recruited one  of the  three founding  members of  Triple X,\n\nChristopher  LaPlante,  who   was  also  its  bookkeeper,   as  a\n\ngovernment  informant   in  exchange  for   a  plea   agreement.1\n\nLaPlante  informed the DEA  that Femia and  co-conspirator Benhur\n\nPerea were the two suppliers of cocaine  to Triple X.  As part of\n\nthe  investigation, over  a period  of  several months,  LaPlante\n\nsecretly tape-recorded conversations  with various employees  and\n\n                    \n\n1  The  other two founders allegedly  were Alan Stone  and Edward\nIntinarelli.\n\n                               -2-\n\ncustomers of Triple  X.  In all, the  government made twenty-four\n\ntape recordings of conversations between LaPlante and alleged co-\n\nconspirators or customers of Triple X (the \"LaPlante tapes\").\n\n          On  October 3, 1986,  a federal  grand jury  returned a\n\nmultiple  count  indictment  charging  Femia  with conspiracy  to\n\ndistribute  cocaine,   possession  of  cocaine   with  intent  to\n\ndistribute,   and   aiding  and   abetting,   in  violation   of,\n\nrespectively, 21  U.S.C.    846,  841(a)(1), and 18 U.S.C.    2.2\n\nThe  indictment also  charged  eight  other  defendants  and  co-\n\nconspirators,  whose cases  are  not part  of  this appeal,  with\n\nvarious drug  crimes.  The  government secured the  conviction of\n\nthe other  eight defendants  by   trial or guilty  plea in  1987.\n\nFemia remained a fugitive until July of 1992.\n\n          The DEA prepared three files for the co-conspirators in\n\nthe drug prosecution: one each  for Perea, Femia, and Alan Stone,\n\none  of Femia's alleged co-conspirators.  The LaPlante tapes were\n\nphysically stored  in Perea's  file.  The  Perea file  was cross-\n\nreferenced  to the  Stone  and  Femia files.    According to  DEA\n\nSpecial  Agent Albert G. Reilly, the cross-reference was intended\n\nto indicate that  the cases were connected and  that the evidence\n\nin each  file pertained to the  other cases.  Apparently,  it was\n\nthe  intent that an agent closing  the Perea file would not order\n\nthe routine destruction of evidence  in the file until all cross-\n\nreferenced cases were closed as well.\n\n                    \n\n2  A racketeering charge for violation of 18 U.S.C.   1962(c) was\ndismissed.  \n\n                               -3-\n\n          On  October 8, 1987, a newly-assigned DEA agent, Albert\n\nLively,  authorized the  destruction of  all  the LaPlante  tapes\n\ncontained in the Perea file.  On that same day, Agent Lively made\n\na notation  in the  Femia file  that \"this  case  is pending  the\n\narrest and prosecution of Femia.\"\n\n          The  government finally  apprehended  Femia in  July of\n\n1992.  As a result of requests for information discoverable under\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure  16 and Brady v. Maryland, 373\n                                                            \n\nU.S. 83 (1963),  the government learned  that the LaPlante  tapes\n\nhad been  destroyed.  Apparently,  the destruction was  a mistake\n\nthat occurred because Agent Lively incorrectly failed to heed the\n\ncross-referencing notation  linking  the Perea  file  to  Femia's\n\nfile, which should  have alerted him that the  tape recordings in\n\nPerea's file  were to  be preserved  pending  the disposition  of\n\nFemia's case.   According to  Agent Reilly, \"[t]he fact  that the\n\ntape  recordings  were  destroyed was  an  inadvertent  oversight\n\ncaused by  the three-part filing  system that had  been created.\"\n\nThe district court specifically found that the government did not\n\ndestroy  the  LaPlante  tapes  in  bad  faith,  but  rather,  the\n\ndestruction resulted from the government's gross negligence.3\n\n          The  government,  however,  provided  some  information\n\nregarding seventeen  of the twenty-four original tape recordings.\n\nTapes  and transcripts  had been  made  for six  of the  recorded\n\n                    \n\n3  Whether this conduct can be described as \"gross\" negligence is\nnot an issue  before us and  thus we express  no opinion on  this\nmatter except to indicate that we will assume that the finding is\nappropriate for purpose of this appeal.\n\n                               -4-\n\nconversations (the  DEA obtained  copies of  six of  the original\n\ntapes  from Perea's  counsel).4   In  addition, transcripts  were\n\nmade for  two other  tape recordings;5 no  copies of  these tapes\n\nare available,  however.   Finally, the  government provided  DEA\n\nReport No.  184, identifying the date, person recorded, and, with\n\nrespect to some  tapes, an extremely  cursory description of  the\n\nsubject  matter  of   the  recorded  conversation.6     Testimony\n\nconcerning  the  tapes  from  Agent  Reilly  and  Ashland  Police\n\nDetective Thomas Kinder  was also presented to the  court.  Agent\n\nReilly contemporaneously monitored the recorded conversations and\n\nDetective Kinder reviewed the tapes.\n\n          By  affidavit,  Detective  Kinder   explained  that  he\n\ntranscribed seven of the tapes.  Secretaries at the DEA typed his\n\nnotes.  He verified that the typed transcripts accurately matched\n\nhis  notes and  again  listened  to tapes  to  confirm that  each\n\ntranscript was accurate and complete.  Kinder stated that the DEA\n\nprepared the initial transcript of a conversation on February 13,\n\n1986 (tape  N-14).   Because he  was not  satisfied with the  DEA\n\n                    \n\n4  These  recordings occurred November 5, 1985,  February 13, 18,\n27, 1986, and March 18 and 25, 1986.\n\n5    These are  transcripts  of tape  recorded  conversation that\noccurred on February 4, 1986 and June 5, 1986.\n\n6   These \"summaries\" are  of limited utility; for  example, some\nprovide   no  information   concerning   the   contents  of   the\nconversations and others merely indicate that the subjects engage\nin a \"drug  conspiracy conversion.\"   The  most detailed  summary\ncontains  the unhelpful statement  that the subject  \"admitted to\ntransporting multi-kilos of cocaine from Florida to Massachusetts\nfor Benhur  Perea et  al.\"  The  reports concern  recordings that\noccurred on February  11, 1986, March 7 (two on this day), 11, 13\n(two on this day), 18, and 25, 1986.\n\n                               -5-\n\ntranscript  version,  he  prepared a  second  transcript  that he\n\nbelieved was accurate and complete.\n\n          Agent Reilly's affidavit  is to a  similar effect.   He\n\nstated  that  he  listened  to  the  conversations as  they  were\n\nrecorded, determined that eight of the tapes were relevant to the\n\ninvestigation, and had  those transcribed by the  Ashland police.\n\nAlthough the  DEA transcribed  one of the  tapes, Reilly  had the\n\nAshland  police  produce  another version,  believing  that their\n\nknowledge of the central figures and events in the  investigation\n\nwould produce a more accurate and complete transcript.\n\n          Both Kinder and  Reilly explained  in their  affidavits\n\nthat  they had  listened to each of the sixteen  tapes which were\n\nnot transcribed  and determined that,  given the  investigation's\n\nlimited  resources and  their opinion  that  the tapes  contained\n\ngeneral  conversations that were not specifically relevant to the\n\ncore of  the Triple  X investigation, those  tapes should  not be\n\ntranscribed.    Both asserted  that  none  of the  sixteen  tapes\n\ncontained any  reference to Femia  or his code names  or numbers.\n             \n\nAgent Reilly  indicated that  he would  have ordered  transcripts\n\nmade of any conversation in which references were made to Femia.\n\n          Femia  filed a motion to  dismiss the indictment, or in\n\nthe  alternative, to  suppress the  testimony  of the  government\n\nwitness, LaPlante, arguing  that the destruction of  the LaPlante\n\ntapes denied him of material exculpatory evidence in violation of\n\nBrady and its progeny.  After a suppression hearing, the district\n     \n\ncourt denied  the motion  to dismiss, but  granted the  motion to\n\n                               -6-\n\nsuppress.  This appeal followed.\n\n                               -7-\n\n                                II\n\n          In   this   case   we   consider   the   constitutional\n\nramifications  of the destruction  by the government  of original\n\ntape recorded evidence pertaining to a criminal defendant's case.\n\n          It  is axiomatic that Brady and its progeny established\n                                     \n\nthat a defendant  has a due process right  to request and receive\n\nevidence that the  government possesses which is material  to his\n\nguilt  or punishment.   Id., 373 U.S.  at 87.   The Constitution,\n                           \n\nhowever, does not require a prosecutor \"routinely to deliver  his\n\nentire file  to defense  counsel.\"  United  States v.  Agurs, 427\n                                                            \n\nU.S.  97, 111  (1976).   In  recent years  the Supreme  Court has\n\ndeveloped a framework  to analyze \"what  might loosely be  called\n\nthe  area of  constitutionally  guaranteed access  to  evidence.\"\n\nCalifornia v. Trombetta, 467 U.S.  479, 485 (1984) and Arizona v.\n                                                              \n\nYoungblood, 488 U.S. 51, 55 (1988) (each quoting United States v.\n                                                              \n\nValenzuela-Bernal,  458 U.S.  858,  867  (1982)).    The  Supreme\n                 \n\nCourt's jurisprudence  divides cases  involving nondisclosure  of\n\nevidence into  two distinct  universes.   Brady  and its  progeny\n                                               \n\naddress   exculpatory   evidence   still  in   the   government's\n\npossession.   Youngblood and Trombetta govern  cases in which the\n                                      \n\ngovernment no longer possesses the disputed evidence.\n\n          The  standards established by the Supreme Court to deal\n\nwith evidence  that the government has lost or destroyed reflect,\n\nin  part,  \"the  difficulty  of  developing rules  to  deal  with\n\nevidence destroyed  through prosecutorial neglect  or oversight.\"\n\nTrombetta, 467 U.S.  at 486.  As  the Court stated  in Trombetta,\n                                                                \n\n                               -8-\n\n\"[w]henever potentially exculpatory evidence is permanently lost,\n\ncourts face  the  treacherous  task  of divining  the  import  of\n\nmaterials  whose contents are unknown and, very often, disputed.\"\n\nId.  The Court's pronouncements also demonstrate  respect for the\n   \n\ndifference  between  nondisclosure  cases,  which  involve  known\n                                                                 \n\nquantities of evidence  and in which a new  trial may be ordered;\n\nand  missing  evidence cases,  which  implicate only  potentially\n                                                                 \n\nexculpatory  evidence  and  in which  the  possible  remedies are\n\ndismissal  or suppression of the state's most probative evidence.\n\nSee id. at 486-87.\n       \n\n          Trombetta   and  Youngblood   together  established   a\n                                     \n\ntripartite  test to determine  whether a defendant's  due process\n\nrights  have been  infringed  by  law  enforcement's  failure  to\n\npreserve evidence.   See Griffin v.  Spratt, 969 F.2d 16,  21 (3d\n                                           \n\nCir. 1992); Jones v.

The court stated:\n\n            Whatever duty the Constitution imposes on\n            the  States  to preserve  evidence,  that\n            duty  must be  limited  to evidence  that\n            might be expected  to play a  significant\n            role in  the suspect's defense.   To meet\n            this    standard     of    constitutional\n            materiality,  .  . .  evidence  must both\n            possess  an  exculpatory value  that  was\n            apparent   before   the    evidence   was\n            destroyed, and be of  such a nature  that\n            the defendant  would be unable  to obtain\n            comparable evidence  by other  reasonably\n\n                               -9-\n\n            available means.\n\nTrombetta, 467 U.S.  at 488-89.7  In Youngblood,  the Court later\n                                               \n\nadded  a third  element  when  it held  that  \"unless a  criminal\n\ndefendant can show bad faith on  the part of the police,  failure\n\nto preserve  potentially useful  evidence does  not constitute  a\n\ndenial of  due process of  the law.\"   Id.,  488 U.S. at  58.   A\n                                         \n\ndefendant   who  seeks  to  suppress  evidence  formerly  in  the\n\ngovernment's possession  therefore must show that the government,\n\nin  failing to preserve the evidence, (1) acted in bad faith when\n\nit   destroyed  evidence,   which  (2)   possessed  an   apparent\n\nexculpatory value and, which (3) is to some extent irreplaceable.\n\nThus in missing  evidence cases, the presence or  absence of good\n\nor bad faith by the government will be dispositive.\n\n          Femia contends that  the missing evidence  test created\n\nby Youngblood and Trombetta is  inapplicable to his case and that\n                           \n\nthe district  court properly  suppressed LaPlante's  testimony as\n\nrequired by Brady.8   The thrust of Femia's  argument, we gather,\n                 \n\nis that  the Youngblood  analysis  only applies  to evidence  \"of\n                       \n\nwhich no more can be said than that it could have  been subjected\n\nto tests, the results of which might have  exonerated defendant.\"\n\nId., 488 U.S. at 57.

See Brady,  373 U.S. at 87; Youngblood, 488  U.S. at\n                                                   \n\n57.\n\n          Femia asserts that  the record evidence  fully supports\n\nthe  district   court's  conclusion   that  the  LaPlante   tapes\n\nconstituted material  exculpatory evidence.   The  district court\n\nfound  that the  LaPlante  tapes  very likely  could  be used  to\n\nimpeach  LaPlante;  second,  the  tapes,  at  least  those  whose\n\ncontents  are discernible from  transcripts or  copies, contained\n\nstatements  that directly  exculpate  the defendant;  and  third,\n\nbecause  the tapes implicated other individuals in crimes alleged\n\nto have  been committed  by Femia, they  could be used  to create\n\nreasonable doubt.9\n\n          The district court appears to have treated the LaPlante\n\ntapes  as a monolithic  whole rather than  distinguishing between\n\nthose tapes for which evidence of their contents exists and tapes\n\nfor which no copies or transcripts  were made.  As a result,  the\n\ndistrict court  incorrectly  applied  Youngblood.    Because  the\n                                                \n\nSupreme  Court has prescribed different due process standards for\n\ndifferent  types of  nondisclosed  evidence,  we categorize  each\n\npiece of evidence and separately discuss our resolution under the\n\n                    \n\n9    The  district   court  had  no  basis  to   make  a  factual\ndetermination regarding the exculpatory value of tapes or portion\nof tapes concerning which it had no concrete evidence.\n\n                               -11-\n\nappropriate  due  process  standard.    We  apply  Youngblood  to\n                                                             \n\nevidence which no longer exists and Brady to exculpatory evidence\n                                         \n\nin the government's possession.\n\n          In  this case, we  find no  due process  violation with\n\nrespect  to evidence  that no  longer exists  because it  was not\n\ndestroyed  in  bad  faith.    As a  result,  the  district  court\n\nimproperly suppressed LaPlante's  testimony on the basis  of this\n\nmissing evidence.  With respect  to evidence that exists, we find\n\nthat the government complied with its obligation under Brady,  it\n                                                            \n\ndisclosed the  evidence.  Thus,  to the extent that  the district\n\ncourt  suppressed  LaPlante's  testimony  based  on  a  perceived\n\nviolation of Brady, it erred.10\n                  \n\n          We begin then by analyzing  the six LaPlante tapes  for\n\nwhich copies were made and provided to Femia after being obtained\n\nfrom Perea's counsel.  Femia  claims and the district court found\n\nthat  these   tapes  contain  material   exculpatory  evidence.11\n\nFemia argues that because the copies cannot serve as a reasonable\n\nsubstitute for the originals -- he allegedly cannot verify  their\n\nauthenticity  or ensure  that no  tampering has  occurred --  the\n\ndistrict court properly suppressed LaPlante's testimony to remedy\n\n                    \n\n10  The characterization of evidence as either in existence or no\nlonger existing is a factual  determination.  The record is clear\nas to which pieces of evidence presently exist.\n\n11  For example, one of the transcripts of the February  13, 1986\ntape  indicates  that  the   original  tape  apparently  contains\nexculpatory  material.  The  tape records a  conversation between\nLaPlante, Stone, and two others.   On that tape, Stone apparently\nstates:  \"He's [Benhur  Perea] the only one bringing  coke in the\narea, brother.  He was the only  one.  Him and Noel [Femia], man.\nNoel, Noel don't do nothing no more.\"\n\n                               -12-\n\nthe  government's   failure  to  disclose   material  exculpatory\n\nevidence.  We disagree.\n\n          No Brady violation has occurred with respect to the six\n                  \n\nLaPlante  tapes  that  were copied  because  Femia  requested and\n\nreceived copies of  these tapes prior to  trial.  It is  true, as\n\nFemia  contends,  that  the six  copies  may  have been  altered,\n\ndamaged, or inexpertly copied from  the originals.  We will never\n\nknow, however,  with any degree  of certainty whether  the copies\n\nare entirely  accurate reproductions  of the  originals.12   With\n\nrespect to  fragments of  the original tapes  that may  have been\n\nirretrievably lost, we can say  no more than that those fragments\n\nmight  have  contained  material  exculpatory  evidence.    These\n\nallegedly missing fragments, like the breath and semen samples at\n\nissue in Trombetta and  Youngblood, can only be characterized  as\n                                  \n\npotentially  exculpatory  evidence.13     In  this  circumstance,\n\nhaving shown no bad faith by the government, the possibility that\n\nthe  copies of the  tapes may have  been altered, or  segments of\n\ntape  may have been deleted, provides no  basis for finding a due\n\nprocess violation.\n\n                    \n\n12  If, for  some reason, Femia could  not use the six copies  of\nthese  tapes  in his  defense,  we  would  be confronted  with  a\nsituation  in  which  we  knew   of  the  existence  of  material\nexculpatory evidence that the government failed to tender.  Under\nthose circumstances, it  is quite likely  that a Brady  violation\n                                                      \nwould exist  and would warrant granting the defendant's motion to\nsuppress evidence.\n\n13  The scientific tests required to determine  exculpatory value\ninvolved  in  Trombetta   and  Youngblood  provide  no   relevant\n                                         \ndistinction.   In those  cases, some  scientific analysis of  the\ndisputed evidence was  required.  Here, someone had  to listen to\nthe allegedly missing fragments to determine exculpatory value.\n\n                               -13-\n\n          We  consider  next  the  tapes  for  which  Femia  only\n\npossesses a transcript.  Femia complains that the transcripts are\n\nof poor quality.  He points to the great discrepancy  between the\n\nDEA transcript of  the February 13, 1986 tape (tape N-16) and the\n\nAshland  police version  as  proof that  the  transcripts do  not\n\nreflect  important  material evidence.    The loss  of  the audio\n\nportion  and  of   the  statements  that  were   negligently  not\n\ntranscribed by law enforcement agents presents the same situation\n\nas the case  in which missing fragments of  conversation may have\n\nbeen lost when  the six other tapes were copied.  We do not know,\n\nand never will know, the content of statements that may have been\n\nlost.  Contrary to the  district court's decision, no due process\n\nviolation  has  occurred.    The  government  has  disclosed  the\n\ntranscript evidence  allegedly possessing  exculpatory value,  as\n\nrequired by Brady  and its progeny.   The lost audio  portion and\n                 \n\nstatements not transcribed are  only potentially exculpatory, and\n\nthe failure to retain that  evidence does not violate Femia's due\n\nprocess  rights  because  the  government  did  not  destroy  the\n\nevidence in bad faith.  Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 58.\n                                  \n\n          With respect to those LaPlante tapes for which only DEA\n\nReport No. 184 summaries exist and  the tapes for which no record\n\nof content exists, the district  court clearly erred in finding a\n\ndue process violation because  these tapes were destroyed due  to\n\nthe government's gross negligence, not bad faith.  Id.\n                                                      \n\n          While  the  failure  to  demonstrate that  the  missing\n\nevidence in this case was destroyed in bad faith is sufficient to\n\n                               -14-\n\nreverse  the district  court,  we  note that  Femia  has not  met\n\nTrombetta's materiality requirement for the missing evidence.  To\n         \n\nsatisfy   Trombetta's   constitutional    materiality   standard,\n                   \n\n\"evidence  must  both  possess  an  exculpatory  value  that  was\n\napparent  before the  evidence was  destroyed, and  be of  such a\n\nnature that the  defendant would be  unable to obtain  comparable\n\nevidence  by other reasonably  available means.\"   Trombetta, 467\n                                                            \n\nU.S. at  488-89.  The  evidence before the district  court showed\n\nthat  any missing  evidence --  whether  one considers  allegedly\n\nmissing fragments  of the tapes  for which copies exist  or those\n\ntapes  which no  longer  exist in  any  form --  did not  possess\n\nexculpatory  value apparent before  law enforcement destroyed the\n                                  \n\ntapes.   Agent Reilly  and Detective  Kinder provided  affidavits\n\nstating  that  the  destroyed tapes  contained  no  references to\n\nFemia, his  code names or  numbers.  Agent Reilly  also explained\n\nthat  any tape  containing references  to  Femia would  have been\n\ntranscribed.  The district court  presumably would have found the\n\ndestruction to have been in bad faith if it did not credit Reilly\n\nand Kinder's evidence  and if the exculpatory  value was apparent\n\nbefore  the destruction of the tapes.  Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 56\n                                                 \n\nn.* (\"The  presence or  absence of  bad faith  by the  police for\n\npurposes of the  Due Process Clause must necessarily  turn on the\n\npolice's knowledge  of the exculpatory  value of the  evidence at\n\nthe time  it was  lost or  destroyed.\").   However, no  bad faith\n\nfinding was made by the district court.

We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3731.  The district court suppressed the testimony in order to remedy a perceived violation of Femia's due process rights, resulting from the government's allegedly grossly negligent destruction of tape recordings of conversations between the witness and other co-conspirators.

The DEA recruited one of the three founding members of Triple X, Christopher LaPlante, who was also its bookkeeper, as a government informant in exchange for a plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  LaPlante informed the DEA that Femia and co-conspirator Benhur Perea were the two suppliers of cocaine to Triple X.  As part of the investigation, over a period of several months, LaPlante secretly tape-recorded conversations with various employees and customers of Triple X.  In all, the government made twenty-four tape recordings of conversations between LaPlante and alleged co-conspirators or customers of Triple X (the \"LaPlante tapes\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 3, 1986, a federal grand jury returned a multiple count indictment charging Femia with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and aiding and abetting, in violation of, respectively, 21 U.S.C. Secs. 846, 841(a)(1), and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The indictment also charged eight other defendants and co-conspirators, whose cases are not part of this appeal, with various drug crimes.  The government secured the conviction of the other eight defendants by trial or guilty plea in 1987.  Femia remained a fugitive until July of 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DEA prepared three files for the co-conspirators in the drug prosecution:  one each for Perea, Femia, and Alan Stone, one of Femia's alleged co-conspirators.  The LaPlante tapes were physically stored in Perea's file.  The Perea file was cross-referenced to the Stone and Femia files.  According to DEA Special Agent Albert G. Reilly, the cross-reference was intended to indicate that the cases were connected and that the evidence in each file pertained to the other cases.  Apparently, it was the intent that an agent closing the Perea file would not order the routine destruction of evidence in the file until all cross-referenced cases were closed as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 8, 1987, a newly-assigned DEA agent, Albert Lively, authorized the destruction of all the LaPlante tapes contained in the Perea file.  On that same day, Agent Lively made a notation in the Femia file that \"this case is pending the arrest and prosecution of Femia.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government finally apprehended Femia in July of 1992.  As a result of requests for information discoverable under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the government learned that the LaPlante tapes had been destroyed.  Apparently, the destruction was a mistake that occurred because Agent Lively incorrectly failed to heed the cross-referencing notation linking the Perea file to Femia's file, which should have alerted him that the tape recordings in Perea's file were to be preserved pending the disposition of Femia's case.  According to Agent Reilly, \"[t]he fact that the tape recordings were destroyed was an inadvertent oversight caused by the three-part filing system that had been created.\"   The district court specifically found that the government did not destroy the LaPlante tapes in bad faith, but rather, the destruction resulted from the government's gross negligence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, however, provided some information regarding seventeen of the twenty-four original tape recordings.  Tapes and transcripts had been made for six of the recorded conversations (the DEA obtained copies of six of the original tapes from Perea's counsel).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In addition, transcripts were made for two other tape recordings;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  no copies of these tapes are available, however.  Finally, the government provided DEA Report No. 184, identifying the date, person recorded, and, with respect to some tapes, an extremely cursory description of the subject matter of the recorded conversation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Testimony concerning the tapes from Agent Reilly and Ashland Police Detective Thomas Kinder was also presented to the court.  Agent Reilly contemporaneously monitored the recorded conversations and Detective Kinder reviewed the tapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By affidavit, Detective Kinder explained that he transcribed seven of the tapes.  Secretaries at the DEA typed his notes.  He verified that the typed transcripts accurately matched his notes and again listened to tapes to confirm that each transcript was accurate and complete.  Kinder stated that the DEA prepared the initial transcript of a conversation on February 13, 1986 (tape N-14).  Because he was not satisfied with the DEA transcript version, he prepared a second transcript that he believed was accurate and complete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent Reilly's affidavit is to a similar effect.  He stated that he listened to the conversations as they were recorded, determined that eight of the tapes were relevant to the investigation, and had those transcribed by the Ashland police.  Although the DEA transcribed one of the tapes, Reilly had the Ashland police produce another version, believing that their knowledge of the central figures and events in the investigation would produce a more accurate and complete transcript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Kinder and Reilly explained in their affidavits that they had listened to each of the sixteen tapes which were not transcribed and determined that, given the investigation's limited resources and their opinion that the tapes contained general conversations that were not specifically relevant to the core of the Triple X investigation, those tapes should not be transcribed.  Both asserted that none of the sixteen tapes contained any reference to Femia or his code names or numbers.  Agent Reilly indicated that he would have ordered transcripts made of any conversation in which references were made to Femia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Femia filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, or in the alternative, to suppress the testimony of the government witness, LaPlante, arguing that the destruction of the LaPlante tapes denied him of material exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady and its progeny.  After a suppression hearing, the district court denied the motion to dismiss, but granted the motion to suppress.

As the Court stated in Trombetta, \"[w]henever potentially exculpatory evidence is permanently lost, courts face the treacherous task of divining the import of materials whose contents are unknown and, very often, disputed.\"  Id.  The Court's pronouncements also demonstrate respect for the difference between nondisclosure cases, which involve known quantities of evidence and in which a new trial may be ordered;  and missing evidence cases, which implicate only potentially exculpatory evidence and in which the possible remedies are dismissal or suppression of the state's most probative evidence.

To meet this standard of constitutional materiality, ... evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 488-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2534.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In Youngblood, the Court later added a third element when it held that \"unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of the law.\"  Id., 488 U.S. at 58, 109 S.Ct. at 337.   A defendant who seeks to suppress evidence formerly in the government's possession therefore must show that the government, in failing to preserve the evidence, (1) acted in bad faith when it destroyed evidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and, which (3) is to some extent irreplaceable.  Thus in missing evidence cases, the presence or absence of good or bad faith by the government will be dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Femia contends that the missing evidence test created by Youngblood and Trombetta is inapplicable to his case and that the district court properly suppressed LaPlante's testimony as required by Brady.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The thrust of Femia's argument, we gather, is that the Youngblood analysis only applies to evidence \"of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated defendant.\"  Id., 488 U.S. at 57, 109 S.Ct. at 337.   Here, because defendant requested and the government did not furnish evidence that the district court found to be material exculpatory evidence, Femia contends that Brady established and Youngblood confirmed that such evidence must be excluded, irrespective of the good or bad faith of the government.  See Brady, 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196;  Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 57, 109 S.Ct. at 337.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Femia asserts that the record evidence fully supports the district court's conclusion that the LaPlante tapes constituted material exculpatory evidence.  The district court found that the LaPlante tapes very likely could be used to impeach LaPlante;  second, the tapes, at least those whose contents are discernible from transcripts or copies, contained statements that directly exculpate the defendant;  and third, because the tapes implicated other individuals in crimes alleged to have been committed by Femia, they could be used to create reasonable doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appears to have treated the LaPlante tapes as a monolithic whole rather than distinguishing between those tapes for which evidence of their contents exists and tapes for which no copies or transcripts were made.  As a result, the district court incorrectly applied Youngblood.   Because the Supreme Court has prescribed different due process standards for different types of nondisclosed evidence, we categorize each piece of evidence and separately discuss our resolution under the appropriate due process standard.  We apply Youngblood to evidence which no longer exists and Brady to exculpatory evidence in the government's possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we find no due process violation with respect to evidence that no longer exists because it was not destroyed in bad faith.  As a result, the district court improperly suppressed LaPlante's testimony on the basis of this missing evidence.  With respect to evidence that exists, we find that the government complied with its obligation under Brady, it disclosed the evidence.  Thus, to the extent that the district court suppressed LaPlante's testimony based on a perceived violation of Brady, it erred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin then by analyzing the six LaPlante tapes for which copies were made and provided to Femia after being obtained from Perea's counsel.  Femia claims and the district court found that these tapes contain material exculpatory evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Femia argues that because the copies cannot serve as a reasonable substitute for the originals--he allegedly cannot verify their authenticity or ensure that no tampering has occurred--the district court properly suppressed LaPlante's testimony to remedy the government's failure to disclose material exculpatory evidence.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No Brady violation has occurred with respect to the six LaPlante tapes that were copied because Femia requested and received copies of these tapes prior to trial.  It is true, as Femia contends, that the six copies may have been altered, damaged, or inexpertly copied from the originals.  We will never know, however, with any degree of certainty whether the copies are entirely accurate reproductions of the originals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  With respect to fragments of the original tapes that may have been irretrievably lost, we can say no more than that those fragments might have contained material exculpatory evidence.  These allegedly missing fragments, like the breath and semen samples at issue in Trombetta and Youngblood, can only be characterized as potentially exculpatory evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In this circumstance, having shown no bad faith by the government, the possibility that the copies of the tapes may have been altered, or segments of tape may have been deleted, provides no basis for finding a due process violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider next the tapes for which Femia only possesses a transcript.  Femia complains that the transcripts are of poor quality.  He points to the great discrepancy between the DEA transcript of the February 13, 1986 tape (tape N-16) and the Ashland police version as proof that the transcripts do not reflect important material evidence.  The loss of the audio portion and of the statements that were negligently not transcribed by law enforcement agents presents the same situation as the case in which missing fragments of conversation may have been lost when the six other tapes were copied.  We do not know, and never will know, the content of statements that may have been lost.  Contrary to the district court's decision, no due process violation has occurred.  The government has disclosed the transcript evidence allegedly possessing exculpatory value, as required by Brady and its progeny.  The lost audio portion and statements not transcribed are only potentially exculpatory, and the failure to retain that evidence does not violate Femia's due process rights because the government did not destroy the evidence in bad faith.  Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 58, 109 S.Ct. at 337.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to those LaPlante tapes for which only DEA Report No. 184 summaries exist and the tapes for which no record of content exists, the district court clearly erred in finding a due process violation because these tapes were destroyed due to the government's gross negligence, not bad faith.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the failure to demonstrate that the missing evidence in this case was destroyed in bad faith is sufficient to reverse the district court, we note that Femia has not met Trombetta 's materiality requirement for the missing evidence.  To satisfy Trombetta 's constitutional materiality standard, \"evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\"  Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 488-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2534.   The evidence before the district court showed that any missing evidence--whether one considers allegedly missing fragments of the tapes for which copies exist or those tapes which no longer exist in any form--did not possess exculpatory value apparent before law enforcement destroyed the tapes.  Agent Reilly and Detective Kinder provided affidavits stating that the destroyed tapes contained no references to Femia, his code names or numbers.  Agent Reilly also explained that any tape containing references to Femia would have been transcribed.  The district court presumably would have found the destruction to have been in bad faith if it did not credit Reilly and Kinder's evidence and if the exculpatory value was apparent before the destruction of the tapes.  Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 56 n. *, 109 S.Ct. at 336 n. *  (\"The presence or absence of bad faith by the police for purposes of the Due Process Clause must necessarily turn on the police's knowledge of the exculpatory value of the evidence at the time it was lost or destroyed.\").  However, no bad faith finding was made by the district court.  Femia therefore did not establish the constitutional materiality of the lost evidence required to demonstrate a due process violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse and remand with directions to vacate the suppression order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The other two founders allegedly were Alan Stone and Edward Intinarelli</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> A racketeering charge for violation of 18 U.S.C.

The DEA recruited one of the three founding members of Triple X, Christopher LaPlante, who was also its bookkeeper, as a government informant in exchange for a plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  LaPlante informed the DEA that Femia and co-conspirator Benhur Perea were the two suppliers of cocaine to Triple X.  As part of the investigation, over a period of several months, LaPlante secretly tape-recorded conversations with various employees and customers of Triple X.  In all, the government made twenty-four tape recordings of conversations between LaPlante and alleged co-conspirators or customers of Triple X (the \"LaPlante tapes\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 3, 1986, a federal grand jury returned a multiple count indictment charging Femia with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and aiding and abetting, in violation of, respectively, 21 U.S.C. Secs. 846, 841(a)(1), and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The indictment also charged eight other defendants and co-conspirators, whose cases are not part of this appeal, with various drug crimes.

The LaPlante tapes were physically stored in Perea's file.  The Perea file was cross-referenced to the Stone and Femia files.  According to DEA Special Agent Albert G. Reilly, the cross-reference was intended to indicate that the cases were connected and that the evidence in each file pertained to the other cases.  Apparently, it was the intent that an agent closing the Perea file would not order the routine destruction of evidence in the file until all cross-referenced cases were closed as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 8, 1987, a newly-assigned DEA agent, Albert Lively, authorized the destruction of all the LaPlante tapes contained in the Perea file.

Apparently, the destruction was a mistake that occurred because Agent Lively incorrectly failed to heed the cross-referencing notation linking the Perea file to Femia's file, which should have alerted him that the tape recordings in Perea's file were to be preserved pending the disposition of Femia's case.  According to Agent Reilly, \"[t]he fact that the tape recordings were destroyed was an inadvertent oversight caused by the three-part filing system that had been created.\"   The district court specifically found that the government did not destroy the LaPlante tapes in bad faith, but rather, the destruction resulted from the government's gross negligence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, however, provided some information regarding seventeen of the twenty-four original tape recordings.  Tapes and transcripts had been made for six of the recorded conversations (the DEA obtained copies of six of the original tapes from Perea's counsel).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In addition, transcripts were made for two other tape recordings;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  no copies of these tapes are available, however.

Secretaries at the DEA typed his notes.  He verified that the typed transcripts accurately matched his notes and again listened to tapes to confirm that each transcript was accurate and complete.  Kinder stated that the DEA prepared the initial transcript of a conversation on February 13, 1986 (tape N-14).

He stated that he listened to the conversations as they were recorded, determined that eight of the tapes were relevant to the investigation, and had those transcribed by the Ashland police.  Although the DEA transcribed one of the tapes, Reilly had the Ashland police produce another version, believing that their knowledge of the central figures and events in the investigation would produce a more accurate and complete transcript.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Kinder and Reilly explained in their affidavits that they had listened to each of the sixteen tapes which were not transcribed and determined that, given the investigation's limited resources and their opinion that the tapes contained general conversations that were not specifically relevant to the core of the Triple X investigation, those tapes should not be transcribed.  Both asserted that none of the sixteen tapes contained any reference to Femia or his code names or numbers.  Agent Reilly indicated that he would have ordered transcripts made of any conversation in which references were made to Femia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Femia filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, or in the alternative, to suppress the testimony of the government witness, LaPlante, arguing that the destruction of the LaPlante tapes denied him of material exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady and its progeny.  After a suppression hearing, the district court denied the motion to dismiss, but granted the motion to suppress.

As the Court stated in Trombetta, \"[w]henever potentially exculpatory evidence is permanently lost, courts face the treacherous task of divining the import of materials whose contents are unknown and, very often, disputed.\"  Id.  The Court's pronouncements also demonstrate respect for the difference between nondisclosure cases, which involve known quantities of evidence and in which a new trial may be ordered;  and missing evidence cases, which implicate only potentially exculpatory evidence and in which the possible remedies are dismissal or suppression of the state's most probative evidence.

The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Whatever duty the Constitution imposes on the States to preserve evidence, that duty must be limited to evidence that might be expected to play a significant role in the suspect's defense.  To meet this standard of constitutional materiality, ... evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 488-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2534.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In Youngblood, the Court later added a third element when it held that \"unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of the law.\"  Id., 488 U.S. at 58, 109 S.Ct. at 337.   A defendant who seeks to suppress evidence formerly in the government's possession therefore must show that the government, in failing to preserve the evidence, (1) acted in bad faith when it destroyed evidence, which (2) possessed an apparent exculpatory value and, which (3) is to some extent irreplaceable.  Thus in missing evidence cases, the presence or absence of good or bad faith by the government will be dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Femia contends that the missing evidence test created by Youngblood and Trombetta is inapplicable to his case and that the district court properly suppressed LaPlante's testimony as required by Brady.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The thrust of Femia's argument, we gather, is that the Youngblood analysis only applies to evidence \"of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated defendant.\"  Id., 488 U.S. at 57, 109 S.Ct. at 337.   Here, because defendant requested and the government did not furnish evidence that the district court found to be material exculpatory evidence, Femia contends that Brady established and Youngblood confirmed that such evidence must be excluded, irrespective of the good or bad faith of the government.  See Brady, 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196;  Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 57, 109 S.Ct. at 337.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Femia asserts that the record evidence fully supports the district court's conclusion that the LaPlante tapes constituted material exculpatory evidence.  The district court found that the LaPlante tapes very likely could be used to impeach LaPlante;  second, the tapes, at least those whose contents are discernible from transcripts or copies, contained statements that directly exculpate the defendant;  and third, because the tapes implicated other individuals in crimes alleged to have been committed by Femia, they could be used to create reasonable doubt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court appears to have treated the LaPlante tapes as a monolithic whole rather than distinguishing between those tapes for which evidence of their contents exists and tapes for which no copies or transcripts were made.  As a result, the district court incorrectly applied Youngblood.   Because the Supreme Court has prescribed different due process standards for different types of nondisclosed evidence, we categorize each piece of evidence and separately discuss our resolution under the appropriate due process standard.  We apply Youngblood to evidence which no longer exists and Brady to exculpatory evidence in the government's possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we find no due process violation with respect to evidence that no longer exists because it was not destroyed in bad faith.  As a result, the district court improperly suppressed LaPlante's testimony on the basis of this missing evidence.  With respect to evidence that exists, we find that the government complied with its obligation under Brady, it disclosed the evidence.  Thus, to the extent that the district court suppressed LaPlante's testimony based on a perceived violation of Brady, it erred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin then by analyzing the six LaPlante tapes for which copies were made and provided to Femia after being obtained from Perea's counsel.  Femia claims and the district court found that these tapes contain material exculpatory evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Femia argues that because the copies cannot serve as a reasonable substitute for the originals--he allegedly cannot verify their authenticity or ensure that no tampering has occurred--the district court properly suppressed LaPlante's testimony to remedy the government's failure to disclose material exculpatory evidence.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No Brady violation has occurred with respect to the six LaPlante tapes that were copied because Femia requested and received copies of these tapes prior to trial.  It is true, as Femia contends, that the six copies may have been altered, damaged, or inexpertly copied from the originals.  We will never know, however, with any degree of certainty whether the copies are entirely accurate reproductions of the originals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  With respect to fragments of the original tapes that may have been irretrievably lost, we can say no more than that those fragments might have contained material exculpatory evidence.  These allegedly missing fragments, like the breath and semen samples at issue in Trombetta and Youngblood, can only be characterized as potentially exculpatory evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  In this circumstance, having shown no bad faith by the government, the possibility that the copies of the tapes may have been altered, or segments of tape may have been deleted, provides no basis for finding a due process violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider next the tapes for which Femia only possesses a transcript.  Femia complains that the transcripts are of poor quality.  He points to the great discrepancy between the DEA transcript of the February 13, 1986 tape (tape N-16) and the Ashland police version as proof that the transcripts do not reflect important material evidence.  The loss of the audio portion and of the statements that were negligently not transcribed by law enforcement agents presents the same situation as the case in which missing fragments of conversation may have been lost when the six other tapes were copied.  We do not know, and never will know, the content of statements that may have been lost.  Contrary to the district court's decision, no due process violation has occurred.  The government has disclosed the transcript evidence allegedly possessing exculpatory value, as required by Brady and its progeny.  The lost audio portion and statements not transcribed are only potentially exculpatory, and the failure to retain that evidence does not violate Femia's due process rights because the government did not destroy the evidence in bad faith.  Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 58, 109 S.Ct. at 337.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to those LaPlante tapes for which only DEA Report No. 184 summaries exist and the tapes for which no record of content exists, the district court clearly erred in finding a due process violation because these tapes were destroyed due to the government's gross negligence, not bad faith.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the failure to demonstrate that the missing evidence in this case was destroyed in bad faith is sufficient to reverse the district court, we note that Femia has not met Trombetta 's materiality requirement for the missing evidence.  To satisfy Trombetta 's constitutional materiality standard, \"evidence must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\"  Trombetta, 467 U.S. at 488-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2534.   The evidence before the district court showed that any missing evidence--whether one considers allegedly missing fragments of the tapes for which copies exist or those tapes which no longer exist in any form--did not possess exculpatory value apparent before law enforcement destroyed the tapes.  Agent Reilly and Detective Kinder provided affidavits stating that the destroyed tapes contained no references to Femia, his code names or numbers.  Agent Reilly also explained that any tape containing references to Femia would have been transcribed.  The district court presumably would have found the destruction to have been in bad faith if it did not credit Reilly and Kinder's evidence and if the exculpatory value was apparent before the destruction of the tapes.  Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 56 n. *, 109 S.Ct. at 336 n. *  (\"The presence or absence of bad faith by the police for purposes of the Due Process Clause must necessarily turn on the police's knowledge of the exculpatory value of the evidence at the time it was lost or destroyed.\").  However, no bad faith finding was made by the district court.  Femia therefore did not establish the constitutional materiality of the lost evidence required to demonstrate a due process violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse and remand with directions to vacate the suppression order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The other two founders allegedly were Alan Stone and Edward Intinarelli</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> A racketeering charge for violation of 18 U.S.C.
