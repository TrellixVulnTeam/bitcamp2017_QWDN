GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\n\n                              Respondent.\n\n\n                    PETITION FOR REVIEW OF AN ORDER\n\n                  OF THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                    Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n\n                      and Smith,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Thomas Stylianos, Jr. on brief for petitioners.\n     Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, and Aixa\nMaldonado-Quiñones, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n                           December 1, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.         The petitioners, Try Ang and\n\nSokunthea Mean, are both Cambodian nationals.          They seek judicial\n\nreview of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n\ndenying their joint application for asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nand relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT). Because Mean's application is derivative and its success is\n\ndependent upon the success of Ang's application, see, e.g., Da\n\nSilva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 4 n.4 (1st Cir. 2005), we analyze\n\nthe case as if Ang were the sole petitioner.\n\n           Ang assigns error in four respects: (i) failure to\n\nconsider his membership in a social group when determining his\n\nrefugee status; (ii) misinterpretation of testimony which, properly\n\nconstrued, would tend to support his claims; (iii) failure to\n\nrecognize that country conditions had not changed so significantly\n\nas to negate any founded fear of future persecution; and (iv)\n\nfailure to grant asylum for humanitarian reasons.              Finding these\n\nclaims of error unpersuasive, we deny the petition.\n\n           The record reflects that Ang, armed with a tourist visa,\n\nentered the United States on April 2, 2000.       His wife, Mean, joined\n\nhim two months later (having entered the country illegally).              On\n\nNovember 6, they sought asylum.\n\n           The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged\n\nthe   couple   with   remaining   in   the   United   States    longer   than\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fpermitted.1     See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).      The INS scheduled a\n\nhearing   for    October   20,   2002.    The    petitioners   conceded\n\nremovability and cross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nrelief under the CAT, and in the alternative, voluntary departure.\n\n           At an evidentiary hearing held on August 20, 2003, Ang\n\ntestified about his political activities and employment in Cambodia\n\nand the circumstances that brought him and his wife to the United\n\nStates.   Mean did not testify.\n\n           The story, insofar as it is relevant here, began in 1988,\n\nwhen Ang fled to a Cambodian refugee camp in order to escape forced\n\nconscription by the reigning government.        The camp was located in\n\nan area controlled by a minority political party, the National\n\nUnited Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooperative, and Independent\n\nCambodia (FUNCINPEC).      Ang began working for this party as a\n\nvolunteer.    He played an active role in the campaign leading up to\n\nthe 1993 national elections.2       The   FUNCINPEC prevailed in the\n\nelections and ascended to power.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, §\n471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. §\n291(a)), abolished the INS and transferred its duties to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security. See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d\n8, 13 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004).      For simplicity's sake, we refer\nthroughout to the INS.\n     2\n      Ang claims to have received a death threat from a local\npolice officer due to his political activities, but he never\nreported such a threat to the authorities.      At any rate, an\nisolated twelve-year-old threat, made under circumstances that no\nlonger obtain, would be immaterial.\n\n                                   -3-\n\f              To earn a living, Ang secured employment at the United\n\nStates embassy.           His job was to protect the Americans who worked\n\nthere.       He steadily moved up the ranks and, by the time that the\n\nFUNCINPEC came to power, he was in charge of sixty guards.                        A few\n\nyears    later,      he     was    promoted     and   given    responsibility         for\n\nsupervising 250 guards.\n\n              In    1997,    a    coup   engineered    by     Hun    Sen    toppled   the\n\nFUNCINPEC government.              Hun Sen's party, the Cambodian People's\n\nParty (CPP), assumed control.                 Ang transported Americans to the\n\nsafety of the embassy during the insurrection.                         In his asylum\n\naffidavit, he declared that he was not afraid of dying during this\n\nperiod because Hun Sen's supporters \"would not dare to harm those\n\nwho worked with the Americans.\"\n\n              General elections were held in 1998.                   John Keo, Ang's\n\nboss    at    the   embassy,      asked   him    to   report    on    any    shootings,\n\nkidnapings, or other acts of violence connected with the voting.\n\nAng says that he received a number of veiled threats during this\n\ninterlude (e.g., \"[y]ou will see [what happens] when the U.S.\n\nleaves Cambodia\"; the United States \"cannot protect you all the\n\ntime\").\n\n              On March 8, 2000, Ang and other embassy staffers heard a\n\nthreat that came over their security radios.                         The unidentified\n\nspeaker stated: \"I will kill John [Keo] and Try [Ang] before they\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\ftake the airplane.\"   Keo asked all guards on duty to write reports\n\nabout the incident.   Ang completed his report nine days later.\n\n          Ang's departure followed on the heels of this incident.\n\nUsing a tourist visa issued a few days before the broadcasted\n\nthreat, Ang left Cambodia.    On April 7 — five days after arriving\n\nin the United States — he notified the embassy by facsimile\n\ntransmission of his resignation.       He claims that police officers\n\nvisited his wife twice in the following two days and threatened to\n\nkill her if she did not reveal his whereabouts.       In roughly two\n\nmonths time, Mean, using a bogus passport that she purchased for\n\n$15,000, joined her husband.\n\n          Ang testified that he fears he will be killed if he were\n\nto return to Cambodia.      This fear relates both to his political\n\nactivities and his past employment.       The immigration judge (IJ)\n\ndisagreed, based partially on a finding that Ang had worked at the\n\nAmerican embassy, but that a significant credibility gap marred\n\nmost of the other aspects of his testimony.\n\n          Chronologically, the IJ found that the early threats of\n\nwhich Ang complained, to the extent that they occurred at all, were\n\ndue to his FUNCINPEC membership.         The IJ characterized these\n\nthreats as unsubstantiated allegations; he deemed them neither\n\nconvincing nor compelling, especially given Ang's boast that he was\n\nnot concerned about them.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f             The IJ attributed the broadcasted death threat to a\n\ndisgruntled former security guard who had been dismissed from his\n\npost.      In this regard, the IJ cited Ang's own testimony as\n\ndemonstrating that he (Ang) did not take the threat seriously.\n\n             Moving    to   Ang's    departure,    the      IJ   spotted     a    flat\n\ninconsistency in Ang's stated reason for leaving Cambodia.                        Ang\n\ninitially vouchsafed that he left to save his life; he later\n\nclaimed, however, that he had intended to return after a visit to\n\nthe United States, but that the subsequent threats reported by his\n\nwife convinced him to change his mind.            As to those threats, the IJ\n\nfound Ang's testimony unworthy of credence.              In the IJ's view, it\n\nwas not plausible that Ang's absence would have been noticed so\n\nquickly.\n\n             Finally, the IJ found that Ang had failed to provide\n\nobjective facts sufficient to establish a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n             Based    on    these   findings,    the   IJ    denied    the       joint\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe   CAT,   but     granted   a    right   of   voluntary       departure.       The\n\npetitioners appealed and, on November 2, 2004, the BIA summarily\n\naffirmed.     This timely petition for judicial review followed.\n\n             When the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's decision, the\n\nfocus, for purposes of judicial review, is on the IJ's decision.\n\nWe review that determination as if it were the BIA's.                 See Olujoke\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fv. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2005).                   In that process, we\n\nassay    the        IJ's     findings   of     fact,     including        credibility\n\ndeterminations, under a highly deferential \"substantial evidence\"\n\nstandard.      See id.       That standard demands that we uphold the IJ's\n\ndecision as long as it is \"supported by reasonable, substantial,\n\nand probative evidence on the record as a whole.\"                       INS v. Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).              Absent a mistake of law, the\n\nIJ's decision must stand unless a reasonable factfinder would be\n\ncompelled      to    reach    a   contrary    conclusion.         See    8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B); see also Negeya v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 78, 82 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn to Ang's asylum claim. To\n\nqualify for asylum, an alien must demonstrate that he is a refugee\n\nas defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1101-1537.           Id. § 1158(b)(1).        According to the Act, a\n\nrefugee is a person who cannot or will not return to his country of\n\nnationality or avail himself of that country's protections \"because\n\nof persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup,   or     political         opinion.\"     Id.     §   1101(a)(42)(A);        see\n\nHarutyunyan v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir. 2005); Aguilar-\n\nSolis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            The      alien     may   carry    this     burden    by     proving   past\n\npersecution based on one of the five enumerated grounds and, thus,\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fanimating a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.                   See\n\nHarutyunyan, 421 F.3d at 67.          If the alien succeeds in making this\n\nshowing, the burden shifts to the government to prove either \"a\n\nfundamental change in circumstances such that the [alien] no longer\n\nhas    a   well-founded   fear   of    persecution   in   [his]   country    of\n\nnationality\" or that the alien \"could avoid future persecution by\n\nrelocating to another part of [his] country of nationality.\"                 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B).\n\n              There is another avenue to asylum.          If an alien cannot\n\nestablish past persecution, he may prove a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution independent of any presumption.            See Rodriguez-\n\nRamirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              In the case at hand, Ang presents a hybrid claim of past\n\npersecution. This claim implicates both his political opinion (his\n\nsupport for the FUNCINPEC) and his membership in a putative social\n\ngroup (Cambodian supporters of the United States).                While it is\n\nclear that past persecution based on the former ground would, if\n\nproven, confer refugee status, see, e.g., Bocova v. Gonzales, 412\n\nF.3d   257,    262-63   (1st   Cir.    2005),   determining   whether   Ang's\n\nemployment at the American embassy and his assistance to Americans\n\nmake him a member of a social group within the meaning of the Act\n\nis less clear-cut.\n\n              Persecution on account of membership in a social group\n\nturns on whether the claimed persecution is directed at a person\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fbecause of that person's interactions with a band of individuals\n\nwho share a \"common, immutable characteristic.\" Da Silva, 394 F.3d\n\nat 5.       Membership may stem from an innate characteristic or a\n\nshared experience. Compare, e.g., Gebremichael v. INS, 10 F.3d 28,\n\n36   (1st     Cir.    1993)      (concluding     that     family   membership        can\n\nconstitute membership in a social group), with, e.g., Mediouni v.\n\nINS,    314   F.3d    24,   28    (1st    Cir.   2002)    (concluding         that   past\n\nemployment as a police officer could satisfy the social group\n\nmembership      requirement).            Regardless      of   whether    the     shared\n\ncharacteristic is genetic or experiential, it must be one that\n\nindividuals \"either cannot change, or should not be required to\n\nchange because it is fundamental to their individual identities or\n\nconsciences.\"        Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 5.\n\n              Ang asserts that he is a member of a social group that\n\nshares    the   common      characteristic       of     supporting      the    American\n\npresence in Cambodia.         Support for the Americans, his thesis runs,\n\nis an identifiable characteristic that he should not be forced to\n\nchange due to the actions of individuals who are hostile to the\n\ninterests of the United States.             We agree with Ang's premise that\n\nhis work at the embassy and his support for Americans potentially\n\ncould form the basis for a claim of membership in a social group.\n\nSee id. at 6 (explaining that \"characteristics relating to current\n\nor former employment status can . . . form the linchpin for\n\nassembling a protected social group\").                   Accordingly, we turn to\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fAng's contention that the IJ erred by not factoring both political\n\nopinion and social group membership into the past persecution\n\ncalculus.\n\n            We have examined the record with care and find Ang's\n\ncontention to be unfounded.        Although the IJ focused primarily on\n\nAng's political opinion claim, he also took account of Ang's social\n\ngroup membership claim.     For example, the IJ noted, in his bench\n\ndecision, Ang's assertion that \"threats were issued against him\n\nbecause he was a security guard for the United States Embassy.\"\n\nIndeed,     Ang's   pro-American    stance   and   the   possibility   of\n\npersecution arising therefrom comprise one of the few parts of\n\nAng's testimony that the IJ believed.\n\n            That the IJ's bench decision contained a heavier emphasis\n\non the political opinion claim than on the social group membership\n\nclaim is understandable.      Both Ang's asylum application and his\n\ntrial testimony stressed the former claim. In these materials, Ang\n\nmade many more references to his participation in the FUNCINPEC and\n\nto his fear that followers of Hun Sen might retaliate against him\n\nthan to the consequences of his work at the embassy.         It would be\n\nabsurd to allow an asylum applicant to profit by emphasizing one\n\naspect of a hybrid claim and then complaining when the IJ devotes\n\nmost of his attention to that aspect.         We will not condone that\n\nsort of bait-and-switch tactic.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f              To say more on this point would be supererogatory.          On\n\nthis record, we conclude, without serious question, that the IJ\n\nadequately      considered   both   aspects   of    Ang's   hybrid    claim.\n\nConsequently, we reject Ang's first assignment of error.\n\n              Ang next complains that the IJ \"misinterpreted\" the\n\nevidence of past persecution.        This complaint is utterly without\n\nmerit.   Ang testified to a series of vaguely menacing statements\n\nand the IJ rejected those statements as unsubstantiated and lacking\n\nin probative value.\n\n              The baseline rule is that past persecution requires \"more\n\nthan   mere    discomfiture,   unpleasantness,     harassment,   or   unfair\n\ntreatment.\"      Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   Given that baseline, hollow threats, such as \"[y]ou will\n\nsee [what happens] when the U.S. leaves Cambodia\" or the United\n\nStates \"cannot protect you all the time,\" without more, certainly\n\ndo not compel a finding of past persecution.                There was no\n\nmisinterpretation here.\n\n              To be sure, the broadcasted threat that occurred on March\n\n8, 2002 is cut from different cloth.               A direct threat to an\n\nindividual's life can constitute past persecution.            See Aguilar-\n\nSolis, 168 F.3d at 569-70.          Withal, an asylum applicant must\n\ndemonstrate a nexus between such a threat and one of the five\n\nstatutorily protected grounds.       See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); see\n\nalso Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 124. Here, the record supports\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthe IJ's finding that no such connection was forged with respect to\n\nthe broadcasted death threat.\n\n            On this issue, the parties talk past each other.                       The\n\nproblem,    as    we   see   it,     is   that    Ang     misapprehends     the   IJ's\n\nreasoning.       In his bench decision, the IJ did not take the view\n\nthat the broadcasted threat never happened but, rather, attributed\n\nthe threat to a disgruntled former subordinate.                          Because the\n\ngenesis of this threat reasonably can be seen as something other\n\nthan the petitioner's political views or support of the United\n\nStates, there is no principled way we can set aside the IJ's\n\ndetermination.\n\n            There      is   one    last   piece    to     the    question   of   threat\n\nevidence.    Ang calumnizes the IJ's determination that the supposed\n\nthreats to Mean did not occur.               Ang did not advance this claim\n\nbefore the BIA, so we will not consider it.                     See, e.g., Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft,    387    F.3d     75,    80    (1st    Cir.    2004)     (explaining    that\n\n\"theories not advanced before the BIA may not be surfaced for the\n\nfirst time in a petition for judicial review of the BIA's final\n\norder\").     In all events, were this claim properly before us, we\n\nwould defer to the IJ's credibility finding.                     See, e.g., Olujoke,\n\n411 F.3d at 21-22 (noting that an appellate court should treat an\n\nIJ's adverse credibility determinations with \"great respect\").\n\n            Our rejection of these arguments makes manifest that Ang\n\nhas not demonstrated past persecution.                   Hence, he is not entitled\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fto a rebuttable presumption that a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution exists.           This brings us to Ang's third assignment of\n\nerror: the asseveration that the IJ incorrectly rejected his claim\n\nthat, unaided by any presumption, he had proved a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution.\n\n                 To travel this avenue, Ang must show, by a preponderance\n\nof   the    evidence,       that   he     has   a    well-founded     fear   of   future\n\npersecution.           See Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n2004). This showing encompasses both subjective and objective\n\ncomponents.            See Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, ___ F.3d ___, ___\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) [No. 05-1330, slip op. at 7].                          We assume, for\n\nargument's sake, that Ang has satisfied the subjective component,\n\nthat is that he genuinely fears persecution were he to return to\n\nCambodia.        Even so, Ang still must satisfy the objective component\n\nof the test.            See Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 125 (explaining\n\nthat \"the alien must not only harbor a genuine fear of future\n\npersecution, but also must establish an objectively reasonable\n\nbasis      for    that    fear\"    (citation        and   internal    quotation   marks\n\nomitted)).         Ang cannot clear this hurdle.\n\n                 Ang    concedes   that    a    regime     change    has   occurred   in\n\nCambodia.        The FUNCINPEC and the CPP are both integral parts of the\n\ncoalition government that now rules Cambodia.                        This circumstance\n\neffectively eliminates any argument that Ang would be persecuted in\n\nCambodia for his pro-FUNCINPEC political opinion. Moreover, he has\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fresigned from the embassy and is no longer a visible member of the\n\nsocial group that he claimed might be the object of persecution.\n\nTo cinch matters, the record is devoid of any convincing evidence\n\nof animus directed at pro-American citizens in Cambodia today.\n\nGiven this evidentiary mosaic, Ang is powerless to assail the IJ's\n\nconclusion that no well-founded fear of future persecution exists.\n\nCf. Palma-Mazariegos, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 11] (finding\n\nthat the lack of reported violence directed toward a protected\n\ngroup helps to refute a claimed fear of future persecution).\n\n           As a last-ditch effort, Ang points with legitimate pride\n\nto a commendation that he received from the U.S. Ambassador to\n\nCambodia, Kenneth Quinn, and posits that he is entitled to asylum\n\nfor humanitarian reasons because of the support that he provided to\n\nthe Americans, especially during the 1997 coup.       Ang has cited no\n\nauthority that suggests the Attorney General's decision to grant or\n\nwithhold humanitarian asylum is judicially reviewable, and there is\n\nreason to believe that it is not.    Cf. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S.\n\n821, 830 (1985) (explaining that judicial review of an agency's\n\ndecision would be precluded when \"a court [has] no meaningful\n\nstandard   against   which   to   judge   the   agency's   exercise   of\n\ndiscretion\").   Assuming, for argument's sake, that the decision is\n\njudicially reviewable, Ang's importuning for humanitarian asylum\n\nhere asks us to do too much with too little.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f           While the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum\n\nfor   humanitarian      reasons,    see    8   U.S.C.    §   1182(d)(5)(A),\n\nestablishing a judge-made rule that requires the use of this power\n\nto grant asylum to aliens who provide aid and succor to the\n\nAmerican government anywhere in the world would rip a mammoth hole\n\nin the fabric of the immigration laws. That would usurp Congress's\n\nprovince, and we decline to take so audacious a step.\n\n           We add, moreover, that Ang's reliance on the Attorney\n\nGeneral's opinion in In re Bassel Marshi, No. A26-980-386 (Op.\n\nAtt'y Gen. Feb. 13, 2004), is misplaced for another reason as well.\n\nThere, a Lebanese national was offered asylum because he had\n\nprovided heroic support to injured marines after the 1983 bombing\n\nof a military barracks in Beirut.              See id. at 10-11.       As an\n\nunpublished opinion, Bassel Marshi has no precedential force.              See\n\nLeal-Rodriguez v. INS, 990 F.2d 939, 946 (7th Cir. 1993) (\"We will\n\nnot bind the BIA with a single non-precedential, unpublished\n\ndecision   any   more   than   we   ourselves    are    bound   by   our   own\n\nunpublished orders.\"); see also 1st Cir. R. 32.3(a)(2).3\n\n           At this point, we have considered and rejected each of\n\nAng's four remonstrances with respect to his asylum claim.                 We\n\nproceed, therefore to address his withholding of removal claim. We\n\ncan dispose of that claim with relative ease.\n\n\n      3\n      We also point out that the Attorney General issued the Bassel\nMarshi opinion several months after the IJ's decision (though\nbefore the BIA's). That fact reinforces our conclusions here.\n\n                                    -15-\n\f            A claim for withholding of removal imposes \"a more\n\nstringent burden of proof on an alien than does a counterpart claim\n\nfor asylum.\"      Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 123.   Withholding of\n\nremoval requires that an alien establish a clear probability of\n\npersecution, rather than merely a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nSee Palma-Mazariegos, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 13].       Hence, the\n\nfact that Ang's claim for asylum falls short necessarily dooms his\n\ncounterpart claim for withholding of removal.\n\n            In a similar vein, we need not tarry over Ang's CAT\n\nclaim.      Under the CAT, the United States is prohibited from\n\nreturning an alien to a country if \"there are substantial grounds\n\nfor believing the [alien] would be in danger of being subjected to\n\ntorture.\"    Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822\n\n(1998).    To trigger this protection, an alien must show that it is\n\nmore likely than not that he will be tortured upon returning to his\n\nhomeland.     See Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).     \"Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or\n\nsuffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted\n\non a person . . . when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at\n\nthe instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\n\nofficial or other person acting in an official capacity.\" 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.18(a)(1).      Torture does not include \"lesser forms of cruel,\n\ninhumane     or   degrading   treatment   or   punishment.\"      Id.   §\n\n208.18(a)(2).\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f          Ang has provided no evidence that he has ever been\n\nphysically harmed by political adversaries.            The vague threats by\n\nHun Sen's supporters clearly do not rise to the level of torture.\n\nSee, e.g., Ambartsoumian v. Ashcroft, 388 F.3d 85, 94 (3d Cir.\n\n2004) (concluding that \"sporadic veiled threats\" did not establish\n\na founded fear of prospective torture).           The broadcasted death\n\nthreat does not satisfy the definition of torture because the IJ\n\nsupportably attributed that threat to a disgruntled ex-employee and\n\nnot to a public official.        See 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1); see also\n\nKasneci   v.   Gonzales,   415    F.3d    202,   205    (1st   Cir.   2005).\n\nConsequently, we hold that the IJ appropriately refused to grant\n\nrelief under the CAT.4\n\n          We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold the BIA's final order.\n\n          The petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      We do not consider whether the alleged threats to Mean\nconstitute the basis for a claim of torture because the IJ\nsupportably found Ang's testimony about those threats to be\nimplausible.\n\n                                   -17-\n\f",

Finding these\n\nclaims of error unpersuasive, we deny the petition.\n\n           The record reflects that Ang, armed with a tourist visa,\n\nentered the United States on April 2, 2000.       His wife, Mean, joined\n\nhim two months later (having entered the country illegally).              On\n\nNovember 6, they sought asylum.\n\n           The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged\n\nthe   couple   with   remaining   in   the   United   States    longer   than\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fpermitted.1     See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).      The INS scheduled a\n\nhearing   for    October   20,   2002.    The    petitioners   conceded\n\nremovability and cross-applied for asylum, withholding of removal,\n\nrelief under the CAT, and in the alternative, voluntary departure.\n\n           At an evidentiary hearing held on August 20, 2003, Ang\n\ntestified about his political activities and employment in Cambodia\n\nand the circumstances that brought him and his wife to the United\n\nStates.   Mean did not testify.\n\n           The story, insofar as it is relevant here, began in 1988,\n\nwhen Ang fled to a Cambodian refugee camp in order to escape forced\n\nconscription by the reigning government.        The camp was located in\n\nan area controlled by a minority political party, the National\n\nUnited Front for a Neutral, Peaceful, Cooperative, and Independent\n\nCambodia (FUNCINPEC).      Ang began working for this party as a\n\nvolunteer.    He played an active role in the campaign leading up to\n\nthe 1993 national elections.2       The   FUNCINPEC prevailed in the\n\nelections and ascended to power.\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, §\n471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. §\n291(a)), abolished the INS and transferred its duties to the\nDepartment of Homeland Security. See Lattab v.

For simplicity's sake, we refer\nthroughout to the INS.\n     2\n      Ang claims to have received a death threat from a local\npolice officer due to his political activities, but he never\nreported such a threat to the authorities.      At any rate, an\nisolated twelve-year-old threat, made under circumstances that no\nlonger obtain, would be immaterial.\n\n                                   -3-\n\f              To earn a living, Ang secured employment at the United\n\nStates embassy.           His job was to protect the Americans who worked\n\nthere.       He steadily moved up the ranks and, by the time that the\n\nFUNCINPEC came to power, he was in charge of sixty guards.                        A few\n\nyears    later,      he     was    promoted     and   given    responsibility         for\n\nsupervising 250 guards.\n\n              In    1997,    a    coup   engineered    by     Hun    Sen    toppled   the\n\nFUNCINPEC government.              Hun Sen's party, the Cambodian People's\n\nParty (CPP), assumed control.                 Ang transported Americans to the\n\nsafety of the embassy during the insurrection.                         In his asylum\n\naffidavit, he declared that he was not afraid of dying during this\n\nperiod because Hun Sen's supporters \"would not dare to harm those\n\nwho worked with the Americans.\"\n\n              General elections were held in 1998.                   John Keo, Ang's\n\nboss    at    the   embassy,      asked   him    to   report    on    any    shootings,\n\nkidnapings, or other acts of violence connected with the voting.\n\nAng says that he received a number of veiled threats during this\n\ninterlude (e.g., \"[y]ou will see [what happens] when the U.S.\n\nleaves Cambodia\"; the United States \"cannot protect you all the\n\ntime\").\n\n              On March 8, 2000, Ang and other embassy staffers heard a\n\nthreat that came over their security radios.                         The unidentified\n\nspeaker stated: \"I will kill John [Keo] and Try [Ang] before they\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\ftake the airplane.\"   Keo asked all guards on duty to write reports\n\nabout the incident.   Ang completed his report nine days later.\n\n          Ang's departure followed on the heels of this incident.\n\nUsing a tourist visa issued a few days before the broadcasted\n\nthreat, Ang left Cambodia.    On April 7 — five days after arriving\n\nin the United States — he notified the embassy by facsimile\n\ntransmission of his resignation.       He claims that police officers\n\nvisited his wife twice in the following two days and threatened to\n\nkill her if she did not reveal his whereabouts.       In roughly two\n\nmonths time, Mean, using a bogus passport that she purchased for\n\n$15,000, joined her husband.\n\n          Ang testified that he fears he will be killed if he were\n\nto return to Cambodia.      This fear relates both to his political\n\nactivities and his past employment.       The immigration judge (IJ)\n\ndisagreed, based partially on a finding that Ang had worked at the\n\nAmerican embassy, but that a significant credibility gap marred\n\nmost of the other aspects of his testimony.\n\n          Chronologically, the IJ found that the early threats of\n\nwhich Ang complained, to the extent that they occurred at all, were\n\ndue to his FUNCINPEC membership.         The IJ characterized these\n\nthreats as unsubstantiated allegations; he deemed them neither\n\nconvincing nor compelling, especially given Ang's boast that he was\n\nnot concerned about them.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f             The IJ attributed the broadcasted death threat to a\n\ndisgruntled former security guard who had been dismissed from his\n\npost.      In this regard, the IJ cited Ang's own testimony as\n\ndemonstrating that he (Ang) did not take the threat seriously.\n\n             Moving    to   Ang's    departure,    the      IJ   spotted     a    flat\n\ninconsistency in Ang's stated reason for leaving Cambodia.                        Ang\n\ninitially vouchsafed that he left to save his life; he later\n\nclaimed, however, that he had intended to return after a visit to\n\nthe United States, but that the subsequent threats reported by his\n\nwife convinced him to change his mind.            As to those threats, the IJ\n\nfound Ang's testimony unworthy of credence.              In the IJ's view, it\n\nwas not plausible that Ang's absence would have been noticed so\n\nquickly.\n\n             Finally, the IJ found that Ang had failed to provide\n\nobjective facts sufficient to establish a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.\n\n             Based    on    these   findings,    the   IJ    denied    the       joint\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe   CAT,   but     granted   a    right   of   voluntary       departure.       The\n\npetitioners appealed and, on November 2, 2004, the BIA summarily\n\naffirmed.     This timely petition for judicial review followed.\n\n             When the BIA summarily affirms an IJ's decision, the\n\nfocus, for purposes of judicial review, is on the IJ's decision.\n\nWe review that determination as if it were the BIA's.

Regardless      of   whether    the     shared\n\ncharacteristic is genetic or experiential, it must be one that\n\nindividuals \"either cannot change, or should not be required to\n\nchange because it is fundamental to their individual identities or\n\nconsciences.\"        Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 5.\n\n              Ang asserts that he is a member of a social group that\n\nshares    the   common      characteristic       of     supporting      the    American\n\npresence in Cambodia.         Support for the Americans, his thesis runs,\n\nis an identifiable characteristic that he should not be forced to\n\nchange due to the actions of individuals who are hostile to the\n\ninterests of the United States.             We agree with Ang's premise that\n\nhis work at the embassy and his support for Americans potentially\n\ncould form the basis for a claim of membership in a social group.\n\nSee id. at 6 (explaining that \"characteristics relating to current\n\nor former employment status can . . . form the linchpin for\n\nassembling a protected social group\").                   Accordingly, we turn to\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fAng's contention that the IJ erred by not factoring both political\n\nopinion and social group membership into the past persecution\n\ncalculus.\n\n            We have examined the record with care and find Ang's\n\ncontention to be unfounded.        Although the IJ focused primarily on\n\nAng's political opinion claim, he also took account of Ang's social\n\ngroup membership claim.     For example, the IJ noted, in his bench\n\ndecision, Ang's assertion that \"threats were issued against him\n\nbecause he was a security guard for the United States Embassy.\"\n\nIndeed,     Ang's   pro-American    stance   and   the   possibility   of\n\npersecution arising therefrom comprise one of the few parts of\n\nAng's testimony that the IJ believed.\n\n            That the IJ's bench decision contained a heavier emphasis\n\non the political opinion claim than on the social group membership\n\nclaim is understandable.      Both Ang's asylum application and his\n\ntrial testimony stressed the former claim. In these materials, Ang\n\nmade many more references to his participation in the FUNCINPEC and\n\nto his fear that followers of Hun Sen might retaliate against him\n\nthan to the consequences of his work at the embassy.         It would be\n\nabsurd to allow an asylum applicant to profit by emphasizing one\n\naspect of a hybrid claim and then complaining when the IJ devotes\n\nmost of his attention to that aspect.         We will not condone that\n\nsort of bait-and-switch tactic.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f              To say more on this point would be supererogatory.          On\n\nthis record, we conclude, without serious question, that the IJ\n\nadequately      considered   both   aspects   of    Ang's   hybrid    claim.\n\nConsequently, we reject Ang's first assignment of error.\n\n              Ang next complains that the IJ \"misinterpreted\" the\n\nevidence of past persecution.        This complaint is utterly without\n\nmerit.   Ang testified to a series of vaguely menacing statements\n\nand the IJ rejected those statements as unsubstantiated and lacking\n\nin probative value.\n\n              The baseline rule is that past persecution requires \"more\n\nthan   mere    discomfiture,   unpleasantness,     harassment,   or   unfair\n\ntreatment.\"      Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 120 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   Given that baseline, hollow threats, such as \"[y]ou will\n\nsee [what happens] when the U.S. leaves Cambodia\" or the United\n\nStates \"cannot protect you all the time,\" without more, certainly\n\ndo not compel a finding of past persecution.                There was no\n\nmisinterpretation here.\n\n              To be sure, the broadcasted threat that occurred on March\n\n8, 2002 is cut from different cloth.               A direct threat to an\n\nindividual's life can constitute past persecution.            See Aguilar-\n\nSolis, 168 F.3d at 569-70.          Withal, an asylum applicant must\n\ndemonstrate a nexus between such a threat and one of the five\n\nstatutorily protected grounds.       See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1); see\n\nalso Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 124. Here, the record supports\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthe IJ's finding that no such connection was forged with respect to\n\nthe broadcasted death threat.\n\n            On this issue, the parties talk past each other.                       The\n\nproblem,    as    we   see   it,     is   that    Ang     misapprehends     the   IJ's\n\nreasoning.       In his bench decision, the IJ did not take the view\n\nthat the broadcasted threat never happened but, rather, attributed\n\nthe threat to a disgruntled former subordinate.                          Because the\n\ngenesis of this threat reasonably can be seen as something other\n\nthan the petitioner's political views or support of the United\n\nStates, there is no principled way we can set aside the IJ's\n\ndetermination.\n\n            There      is   one    last   piece    to     the    question   of   threat\n\nevidence.    Ang calumnizes the IJ's determination that the supposed\n\nthreats to Mean did not occur.               Ang did not advance this claim\n\nbefore the BIA, so we will not consider it.                     See, e.g., Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201313\"><a href=\"/opinion/201313/makhoul-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>     <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    80    (1st    Cir.    2004)     (explaining    that\n\n\"theories not advanced before the BIA may not be surfaced for the\n\nfirst time in a petition for judicial review of the BIA's final\n\norder\").     In all events, were this claim properly before us, we\n\nwould defer to the IJ's credibility finding.                     See, e.g., Olujoke,\n\n411 F.3d at 21-22 (noting that an appellate court should treat an\n\nIJ's adverse credibility determinations with \"great respect\").\n\n            Our rejection of these arguments makes manifest that Ang\n\nhas not demonstrated past persecution.                   Hence, he is not entitled\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fto a rebuttable presumption that a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution exists.           This brings us to Ang's third assignment of\n\nerror: the asseveration that the IJ incorrectly rejected his claim\n\nthat, unaided by any presumption, he had proved a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution.\n\n                 To travel this avenue, Ang must show, by a preponderance\n\nof   the    evidence,       that   he     has   a    well-founded     fear   of   future\n\npersecution.           See Laurent v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n2004). This showing encompasses both subjective and objective\n\ncomponents.            See Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales, ___ F.3d ___, ___\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) [No. 05-1330, slip op. at 7].                          We assume, for\n\nargument's sake, that Ang has satisfied the subjective component,\n\nthat is that he genuinely fears persecution were he to return to\n\nCambodia.        Even so, Ang still must satisfy the objective component\n\nof the test.            See Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 125 (explaining\n\nthat \"the alien must not only harbor a genuine fear of future\n\npersecution, but also must establish an objectively reasonable\n\nbasis      for    that    fear\"    (citation        and   internal    quotation   marks\n\nomitted)).         Ang cannot clear this hurdle.\n\n                 Ang    concedes   that    a    regime     change    has   occurred   in\n\nCambodia.        The FUNCINPEC and the CPP are both integral parts of the\n\ncoalition government that now rules Cambodia.                        This circumstance\n\neffectively eliminates any argument that Ang would be persecuted in\n\nCambodia for his pro-FUNCINPEC political opinion. Moreover, he has\n\n\n                                            -13-\n\fresigned from the embassy and is no longer a visible member of the\n\nsocial group that he claimed might be the object of persecution.\n\nTo cinch matters, the record is devoid of any convincing evidence\n\nof animus directed at pro-American citizens in Cambodia today.\n\nGiven this evidentiary mosaic, Ang is powerless to assail the IJ's\n\nconclusion that no well-founded fear of future persecution exists.\n\nCf. Palma-Mazariegos, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 11] (finding\n\nthat the lack of reported violence directed toward a protected\n\ngroup helps to refute a claimed fear of future persecution).\n\n           As a last-ditch effort, Ang points with legitimate pride\n\nto a commendation that he received from the U.S. Ambassador to\n\nCambodia, Kenneth Quinn, and posits that he is entitled to asylum\n\nfor humanitarian reasons because of the support that he provided to\n\nthe Americans, especially during the 1997 coup.       Ang has cited no\n\nauthority that suggests the Attorney General's decision to grant or\n\nwithhold humanitarian asylum is judicially reviewable, and there is\n\nreason to believe that it is not.    Cf. Heckler v. Chaney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830 (1985) (explaining that judicial review of an agency's\n\ndecision would be precluded when \"a court [has] no meaningful\n\nstandard   against   which   to   judge   the   agency's   exercise   of\n\ndiscretion\").   Assuming, for argument's sake, that the decision is\n\njudicially reviewable, Ang's importuning for humanitarian asylum\n\nhere asks us to do too much with too little.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\f           While the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum\n\nfor   humanitarian      reasons,    see    8   U.S.C.    §   1182(d)(5)(A),\n\nestablishing a judge-made rule that requires the use of this power\n\nto grant asylum to aliens who provide aid and succor to the\n\nAmerican government anywhere in the world would rip a mammoth hole\n\nin the fabric of the immigration laws. That would usurp Congress's\n\nprovince, and we decline to take so audacious a step.\n\n           We add, moreover, that Ang's reliance on the Attorney\n\nGeneral's opinion in In re Bassel Marshi, No. A26-980-386 (Op.\n\nAtt'y Gen. Feb. 13, 2004), is misplaced for another reason as well.\n\nThere, a Lebanese national was offered asylum because he had\n\nprovided heroic support to injured marines after the 1983 bombing\n\nof a military barracks in Beirut.              See id. at 10-11.       As an\n\nunpublished opinion, Bassel Marshi has no precedential force.              See\n\nLeal-Rodriguez v.

We\n\nproceed, therefore to address his withholding of removal claim. We\n\ncan dispose of that claim with relative ease.\n\n\n      3\n      We also point out that the Attorney General issued the Bassel\nMarshi opinion several months after the IJ's decision (though\nbefore the BIA's).

Withholding of\n\nremoval requires that an alien establish a clear probability of\n\npersecution, rather than merely a well-founded fear of persecution.\n\nSee Palma-Mazariegos, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 13].       Hence, the\n\nfact that Ang's claim for asylum falls short necessarily dooms his\n\ncounterpart claim for withholding of removal.\n\n            In a similar vein, we need not tarry over Ang's CAT\n\nclaim.      Under the CAT, the United States is prohibited from\n\nreturning an alien to a country if \"there are substantial grounds\n\nfor believing the [alien] would be in danger of being subjected to\n\ntorture.\"    Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822\n\n(1998).    To trigger this protection, an alien must show that it is\n\nmore likely than not that he will be tortured upon returning to his\n\nhomeland.     See Elien v.
