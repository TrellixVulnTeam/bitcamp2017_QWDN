BRAGA and DEBRA BRAGA,\n\n                      Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                 v.\n\n                        GENLYTE GROUP, INC.,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                       Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n\n              and Oberdorfer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Brian Cunha, with whom Brian Cunha & Associates, P.C. were on\nbrief, for appellants.\n     Timothy P. Van Dyck, with whom Brian H. Lamkin and Edwards &\nAngell, LLP, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                          August 25, 2005\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the District of the District of Columbia, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f           OBERDORFER, Senior District Judge.              This case tests the\n\nline between the workers’ compensation rights of an employee\n\ninjured on a job in Massachusetts and the immunity from tort suit\n\nprovided   to     the     injured   employee’s      employer     by    the     same\n\nMassachusetts workers’ compensation law that benefitted the injured\n\nemployee, where the employer has participated in a series of\n\nmergers during which the employee’s job status remained unaffected.\n\nOn the unique and relatively complex facts here, we find and\n\nconclude   that    this    plaintiff’s      tort   claim   is   barred    by    the\n\nMassachusetts workers’ compensation law, pursuant to which one of\n\ndefendant’s merger successors has previously compensated plaintiff.\n\n\n\n           Plaintiff-appellant       Antonio       Braga   (“Braga”)     received\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits for an injury he sustained while an\n\nemployee of Genlyte-Thomas Group, LLC (“Genlyte-Thomas”).                    He and\n\nhis wife are suing in tort for that same injury Genlyte Group, Inc.\n\n(“Genlyte”).      Braga had worked as an employee of Genlyte before it\n\ncontributed substantially all of its assets (along with those\n\ncontributed by Thomas Industries, Inc.) to create Genlyte-Thomas.\n\nThe Bragas claim that defects in a hydraulic press Braga was\n\noperating while working for Genlyte-Thomas before that merger\n\ncaused his injury. The Bragas base their claims against Genlyte on\n\nits status as successor, by merger, to Lightolier Incorporated\n\n(“Lightolier”); it had owned the allegedly defective press when it\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fmerged   with    Braga’s   then-employer.     The   Bragas   claim   that\n\nLightolier knew the press was defective at the time of its merger,\n\nbut that it did not disclose or remedy the defects.\n\n           The Bragas allege that this knowledge of the defect\n\ncreated inchoate liability for Lightolier that carried over in the\n\nmerger, giving the Bragas a cause of action against Genlyte.\n\nGenlyte argues essentially that any liability was satisfied, and\n\nany tort claims barred, by Massachusetts workers’ compensation law\n\n– the privileges and immunities of which also carried forward in\n\nthe merger.     The Bragas counter that those immunities do not apply\n\nhere because their tort claims, based on Lightolier’s conduct,\n\narose    independently     from   Genlyte’s    workers’      compensation\n\nobligations.\n\n           This is the second time this case has come up on appeal.\n\nThe district court initially dismissed the Bragas’ claims as barred\n\nby workers’ compensation in a one-sentence order that cited no\n\nMassachusetts law.     Finding that the case presented a “complex and\n\nfact-bound” question of state law, a previous panel of this court\n\nreversed and remanded for “analysis of a more fully developed\n\nfactual scenario under Massachusetts law.” Braga v. Genlyte, Inc.,\n\n57 Fed. Appx. 451, 454 (1st Cir. 2003) (unpublished) (“Braga I”).\n\nOn remand, the district court granted summary judgment for Genlyte,\n\nagain holding that “plaintiffs’ claims are barred by workers’\n\ncompensation.”\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f            The Bragas contend that the changes in Braga’s employer’s\n\ncorporate structure over time relieve him of the barrier to tort\n\nclaims generally applicable to those enjoying the benefits of\n\nworkers’    compensation.        Genlyte   argues   that   its   workers’\n\ncompensation tort immunity survived the mergers.       The key question\n\nis whether, but for the mergers, Lightolier would have been liable\n\nto the Bragas.   We hold that it would not have been.       Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude that the workers’ compensation barrier was not lifted\n\nby the transactions involved here and we affirm summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the defendant, albeit on a theory different from that\n\nemployed by the court below.\n\n                            I.    BACKGROUND\n\n            On November 18, 1998, Braga was injured while operating\n\na hydraulic press (the “Press”) at a Genlyte-Thomas manufacturing\n\nfacility in Fall River, Massachusetts (the “Fall River facility”).\n\nThe Press became activated while Braga was trying to remove a piece\n\nof metal jammed in it.      It slammed down on Braga’s hand, causing\n\nsevere and permanent damage.          He alleges that the Press was\n\ndefective in that it lacked adequate guards to prevent an operator\n\nfrom unintentionally activating it, and that this defect caused his\n\naccident.\n\nA.   Corporate History\n\n            In January 1980, Braga began working as a press operator\n\nat the Fall River facility for Aluminum Processing Corporation\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f(“APC”).   APC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lightolier, operated\n\nthe Fall River facility at that time.\n\n           In   September,     1980,    Lightolier   purchased the Press,\n\nsecond-hand, for use in its manufacturing facility in Norwich,\n\nConnecticut (the “Norwich facility”).\n\n           On Friday, January 15, 1982, APC (along with all then-\n\nexisting subsidiaries of Lightolier) merged into Lightolier. Three\n\ndays later, on Monday, January 18, 1982, Lightolier merged into BZ\n\nHoldings Corporation (“BZ Holdings”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of\n\nBZ Acquisition Corporation (“BZ Acquisition”).           That same day, BZ\n\nHoldings changed its name to “Lightolier Incorporated.”1              Braga’s\n\nemployment status continued unchanged, save that his employer was\n\nnow Lightolier/BZ rather than APC.\n\n           In   1985,   BZ   Acquisition,    which   owned    Lightolier/BZ,\n\nmerged into Genlyte.         Lightolier/BZ thus became a wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary of Genlyte.\n\n           In   January   1991,   Lightolier/BZ      merged   into   Genlyte.\n\nGenlyte continued to operate the former Lightolier/BZ business\n\nunder the name “Lightolier.”       Braga’s employment again continued\n\nunchanged, save that his employer was now Genlyte.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          To distinguish among the various Lightolier entities, we\nrefer only to the original, pre-January 15, 1982, company as\n“Lightolier.”   We refer to the corporation that existed from\nJanuary 15-18, 1982, as “Lightolier/APC,” and to the post-January\n18, 1982, entity as “Lightolier/BZ.”\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           Around this time, the Norwich facility was converted from\n\nmanufacturing    to    warehousing    use.        In   June   1991,     Genlyte\n\ntransferred the Press from its Norwich facility to its Fall River\n\nfacility, where Braga worked.\n\n           On April 28, 1998, Genlyte and Thomas Industries each\n\ncontributed substantially all of its corporate assets to create a\n\nnew entity, Genlyte-Thomas.        Genlyte became the majority owner of\n\nGenlyte-Thomas and Thomas became the minority owner.                  Genlyte-\n\nThomas continued to do business under the “Lightolier” name.\n\nBraga’s   employment    again     continued     unchanged,    save    that   his\n\nemployer was now Genlyte-Thomas.           Braga was still an employee of\n\nGenlyte-Thomas when his accident occurred on November 18, 1998.\n\n           After that accident, the Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration inspected the Press and cited Genlyte-Thomas for a\n\nviolation because the “operating buttons of the [Press] were not\n\nadequately guarded to prevent unintentional operation.”\n\nB.         Litigation History\n\n           The   Bragas   first    filed    a   “Complaint    for    Discovery”\n\nagainst Lightolier in state court in 1999.              That complaint was\n\ndismissed without prejudice after some discovery.\n\n           The   Bragas   next     filed    a   substantive    suit    against\n\nLightolier in state court on September 6, 2001.          After the case was\n\nremoved to federal court on diversity grounds, plaintiffs amended\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fthe complaint to name Genlyte, one of Lightolier’s successors by\n\nmerger, as the defendant.\n\n           On November 21, 2001, Genlyte moved to dismiss the\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim on the ground that it was\n\nbarred by the workers’ compensation law.            On January 4, 2002, the\n\ndistrict court granted that motion to dismiss in a one-sentence\n\nendorsement on the face of the motion:             “Allowed, as Lightolier,\n\nInc. would also be an employer for this purpose.              Herbolsheimer v.\n\nSMS Holding Co., 608 N.W.2d 487 (Mich[. Ct. App.] 2000).”                     The\n\nBragas appealed.\n\n           On February 13, 2003, a panel of this court reversed and\n\nremanded for further proceedings.           The court was “reluctant to\n\naffirm an order of dismissal where the district court neglected to\n\nanalyze   the   questions   raised   by    the    complaint    under    the   law\n\ngoverning the case,” that is, Massachusetts state law. Braga I, 57\n\nFed. Appx. at 454.   The court noted that the Supreme Judicial Court\n\nof   Massachusetts   had    addressed     the    “questions    raised   by    the\n\nintersection of the immunity of an employer under the workers’\n\ncompensation scheme and successor liability” in Gurry v. Cumberland\n\nFarms, 550 N.E.2d 127 (Mass. 1990), which should be “central” to\n\nthe analysis of this issue.      Braga I, 57 Fed. Appx. at 454.\n\n           On remand, following limited discovery, plaintiffs filed\n\nan amended complaint.       The Bragas asserted claims of negligence\n\nbased on “(Old) ‘Lightolier’ . . . negligently transferring by\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fmeans   of   the   merger,    to    BZ    Holdings/(New)     ‘Lightolier’      the\n\ndefective    [Press]”   and   of    breach     of   the   implied   warranty    of\n\nmerchantability.     His wife asserted a claim of loss of consortium.\n\n             On February 13, 2004, Genlyte moved for summary judgment\n\non the basis of an Agreed Statement of Undisputed Facts.\n\n             On October 5, 2004, the district court granted that\n\nmotion and again dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims.                  The district\n\ncourt’s analysis centered, as directed, on Gurry.                   The district\n\ncourt noted that Gurry permitted a suit in tort to proceed against\n\nan   employer   as   successor      of    a    corporation   that    “was   never\n\ndecedent’s employer and would have been susceptible to a third-\n\nparty claim outside of the workers’ compensation protection.”                  On\n\nthe other hand, the court recognized that, in Gurry, claims based\n\non the conduct of a predecessor that had employed Gurry “failed\n\nbecause ‘all [the] acts and omissions alleged against [it] arose\n\nout of the direct employment relationship.’” (Citing Gurry, 550\n\nN.E.2d at 131.) The district court framed the dispositive question\n\nas whether Braga had been “an employee of Lightolier, the allegedly\n\nnegligent predecessor corporation.”             The court focused on whether\n\nBraga was employed by Lightolier/APC from its creation on Friday,\n\nJanuary 15, 1982, through its merger with BZ Holdings three days\n\nlater, on Monday, January 18, 1982.             The district court held that\n\nBraga’s having “performed no work over the weekend is irrelevant to\n\nhis employment status.”            Because Braga’s employment was never\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fterminated, it was “clear that [Lightolier/APC] did employ him,\n\nalthough it only had a brief existence.”      Based on this reasoning,\n\nthe district court concluded that plaintiffs’ claims were barred by\n\nthe workers’ compensation statute.\n\n                           II.   DISCUSSION\n\n            We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.    Burke v. Town of Walpole, 405 F.3d 66, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   Like the lower court, we are to “constru[e] the record in\n\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party and resolv[e] all\n\nreasonable inferences in that party’s favor.”        Whitlock v. Mac-\n\nGray, Inc., 345 F.3d 44, 45 (1st Cir. 2003).       Summary judgment is\n\nproper only if the record establishes that “there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.”      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).    We are\n\nnot bound by the district court’s rationale, but may affirm its\n\ngrant of summary judgment “on any ground supported by the record.”\n\nCimon v. Gaffney, 401 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nA.          The Massachusetts Workers’ Compensation Scheme\n\n            The Massachusetts workers’ compensation statute generally\n\nprovides the exclusive remedy for employees who suffer work-related\n\ninjuries.    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 24.      A non-employer third\n\nparty tortfeasor, however, is not protected by the immunity from\n\nsuit by an injured worker that workers’ compensation law affords\n\nthat worker’s employer.    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, § 15.         Injured\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\femployees are thus free to sue third party tortfeasors whose\n\nnegligence caused or contributed to their work-place injuries.\n\n            Where a third party whose actions might subject it to a\n\ntort suit by an injured worker later merges with the injured\n\nworker’s employer – so that the employer and the “third party”\n\nbecome one and the same – a dilemma arises.                 After a merger, the\n\nsurviving      corporation    is    “liable      for[]    all       liabilities   and\n\nobligations of each of the constituent corporations in the same\n\nmanner   and    to   the   same    extent   as    if     such   .    .   .   surviving\n\ncorporation had itself incurred such liabilities or obligations.”\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B, § 80(b).               As successor to the alleged\n\ntortfeasor, the surviving entity should ordinarily be subject to\n\nsuit by the injured employee to the same extent the third party\n\nwould have been absent the merger.               On the other hand, under the\n\ncircumstances here, neither the plaintiffs, nor the state decisions\n\non which they rely, explain to our satisfaction why the injured\n\nemployee’s employer is not immunized from tort liability by the\n\nsame law that provided compensation administratively to the injured\n\nemployees.     See, e.g., infra Part II.D.3.\n\nB.          The Dual Persona Doctrine\n\n            The Bragas claim that they should be able to sue Genlyte\n\nas successor to the original Lightolier despite the otherwise\n\napplicable workers’ compensation immunity.                 They rely on what is\n\ncommonly referred to as the “dual persona” doctrine.                     According to\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fthat concept an “employer may become a third person, vulnerable to\n\ntort suit by an employee, if – and only if – it possesses a second\n\npersona so completely independent from and unrelated to its status\n\nas employer that by established standards the law recognizes that\n\npersona as a separate legal person.”     6 Arthur Larson & Lex K.\n\nLarson, Larson’s Workers’ Compensation Law § 113.01[1], at 113-2\n\n(2005) (“Larson”); see also Gurry, 550 N.E.2d at 131 (citing this\n\ndefinition from an earlier edition of the Larson treatise).   Where\n\nsuch a “dual persona” exists, the dual persona doctrine may permit\n\na tort suit only if the “nonemployer persona” owed the injured\n\nemployee duties “totally separate from and unrelated to” duties\n\narising out of the employment relationship.   Larson, § 113.01[4],\n\nat 113-10 (emphasis in original).\n\n            Gurry is the leading Massachusetts case on the “dual\n\npersona” doctrine.     The facts in Gurry, as here, are somewhat\n\ninvolved.    Gurry worked for United Cranberry Growers Associates,\n\nInc. (“Cranberry”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delaware Food\n\nStore, Inc. (“DFS”).     Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc. (“Dairy”),\n\nanother DFS subsidiary, sold managerial services to Cranberry.   As\n\npart of these duties, Dairy designed, and commissioned a contractor\n\nto build, buggies for Cranberry.      The next year, Cranberry and\n\nDairy merged into DFS, which in turn merged into Cumberland Farms,\n\nInc. (“Cumberland”).   Gurry continued at his job, with Cumberland\n\nbecoming his employer as a result of the mergers.   Gurry was killed\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fwhile   working   for    Cumberland,    operating    one   of    the   buggies.\n\nGurry’s beneficiaries received workers’ compensation payments. The\n\nGurry   plaintiffs      nonetheless    sued    Cumberland,      alleging   that\n\nnegligent design, manufacture and maintenance of the buggy by its\n\npredecessors, Cranberry and Dairy, caused Gurry’s death.\n\n           The question thus presented was one of first impression\n\nin Massachusetts: could an employee injured on the job sue an\n\nemployer for negligence on the part of the employer’s corporate\n\npredecessors?     The Supreme Judicial Court found that the “answer\n\ndepends on the interrelationship of two statutes: the business\n\ncorporation law and the workers’ compensation act.”                Gurry, 550\n\nN.E.2d at 130 (citations omitted).           The Gurry court observed that,\n\nunder Massachusetts business corporation law, “Cumberland stood in\n\nthe shoes of Cranberry [] and Dairy . . . , inheriting any\n\nliabilities for tortious conduct, as well as any privileges in the\n\nform of statutory immunities, that those predecessors would have\n\nhad.”   Id. at 131 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B § 80(a)).\n\n           The court held that Cumberland could not be sued for\n\nCranberry’s alleged negligence because Cranberry itself “would have\n\nbeen immune from suit since all the acts and omissions alleged\n\nagainst [it] arose out of the direct employment relationship”\n\nbetween it and Gurry.       Id.   On the other hand, “Dairy was never\n\nKevin Gurry’s employer, and would have been susceptible to a third-\n\nparty claim as a tortfeasor outside of the protection of workers’\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fcompensation” if not for the merger.               Id. (citing Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 152 § 15 (1988 ed.)).            Had the merger not occurred, plaintiffs\n\nwould have been able to bring a third party suit against Dairy, the\n\ncompany that designed and supervised the manufacture of defective\n\nequipment for the decedent’s then-employer, Cranberry.                    The Gurry\n\ncourt   emphasized      that    “the    workers’    compensation        statute   was\n\nintended to deal with injuries and liability occurring in the\n\ncourse of the employer-employee relationship.”               Id.       Since a claim\n\nbased   on   Dairy’s     conduct       did   not   arise   from    an    employment\n\nrelationship,     but     “from       the    negligence    of     an    independent\n\ncorporation,” allowing it to go forward would not interfere with\n\nthe purpose of the workers’ compensation statute.                         The court\n\nconcluded that “insulat[ing] Cumberland from liability it acquired,\n\nas a result of its merger with Dairy[,] because [Cumberland]\n\nhappened to be Kevin Gurry’s employer, would subvert the important\n\naims of both the workers’ compensation system and the business\n\ncorporation statute.”          Id.\n\nC.           Braga’s Employment Status\n\n             The district court held that workers’ compensation bars\n\nthis suit because Braga was employed by Lightolier/APC during its\n\n“brief existence.”       Braga’s employment status during the three-day\n\nperiod from January 15-18, 1982 is the primary issue the parties\n\naddress on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\f               Plaintiffs argue that this question cannot be resolved as\n\na matter of law but requires a detailed, fact-specific inquiry into\n\nthe relationship between Braga and Lightolier/APC.                      As explained\n\nbelow, we disagree.\n\n               Massachusetts business corporation law provides that “all\n\nof the estate, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises\n\nof    the   constituent        corporations”      automatically         vest   in   the\n\nsurviving corporation upon merger “without further act or deed.”\n\nMass.    Gen.    Laws    ch.   156B,   §    80(a)(5).         Despite    the   Bragas’\n\nhyperbolic claim that treating employees as assets that transfer by\n\nlaw     upon    merger    means    viewing        them   as    “chattels       of   the\n\ncorporation,” a corporation’s employment contracts are counted\n\namong its assets.          See, e.g., Modis, Inc. v. Revolution Group,\n\nLtd., 11 Mass. L. Rptr. 246, 1999 WL 1441918, at *6 (Mass. Super.\n\nCt. Dec. 29, 1999) (describing “employment contracts and employment\n\n‘arrangements’” as “assets [that] became the property of [the\n\nsurviving corporation] after the merger”); cf. Dickson v. Riverside\n\nIron Works, Inc., 372 N.E.2d 1302, 1304-05 (Mass. App. Ct. 1978)\n\n(plaintiff      may     enforce   employment       contract     against     surviving\n\ncorporation after merger).\n\n               The Bragas argue that employees do not automatically\n\ncontinue working for a surviving corporation after a merger but\n\nmust establish employment relationships anew with that entity. Cf.\n\nHolliday v. Pers. Prods. Co., 939 F. Supp. 402, 405-07 (E.D. Pa.\n\n\n                                           -14-\n\f1996) (rejecting argument that workers’ compensation immunity would\n\nnot apply after employer’s merger with third party tortfeasor\n\nunless employee consented to be employed by new corporate entity).\n\nIf that were the law, employees of merging corporations would lose\n\ntheir jobs instantaneously upon a merger, absent some affirmative\n\nconduct showing that they now worked for the surviving corporation.\n\nSimilarly, the employment status of those in otherwise identical\n\npositions would vary with their awareness of, and view toward,\n\nchanges in corporate status that did not affect the conduct of\n\ntheir jobs in any way.   None of the cases plaintiffs cite, however,\n\nsupports such odd results.    See, e.g., Langevin’s Case, 91 N.E.2d\n\n920, 921 (Mass. 1950); Abbott v. Link-Belt Co., 88 N.E.2d 551, 554\n\n(Mass. 1949).   Indeed, none even addresses the relevant question,\n\nnamely, how a merger affects continuity of employment.     We see no\n\nbasis for holding that there was a gap in Braga’s employment during\n\nthe January 15-18, 1982, period.       He simply continued as an\n\nemployee of the corporate entity that succeeded his employer, first\n\nLightolier/APC, then Lightolier/BZ.\n\n          However, the question of whether Lightolier/APC employed\n\nBraga is not dispositive, but merely a red herring here.    This can\n\nbe seen by moving the analysis back one level, thus framing it in\n\nterms of the initial merger of Lightolier and APC (Braga’s original\n\nemployer) rather than the merger of Lightolier/APC and BZ Holdings\n\nthree days later.   Whether or not Lightolier/APC employed Braga\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fduring its three-day existence, Lightolier – which it succeeded –\n\nunquestionably never employed him.               Since Lightolier owned the\n\nallegedly    defective     Press    when    it   merged   with    Braga’s   then-\n\nemployer, APC, Lightolier’s merger with APC appears to raise the\n\nsame   liability    issues    that    the    Bragas   claim      are   raised    by\n\nLightolier/APC’s merger with BZ Holdings.             But the mere fact that\n\nLightolier did not employ Braga would not establish successorship\n\nliability.     Lightolier/APC can inherit Lightolier’s third-party\n\nliability only if such liability would have existed absent the\n\nmerger.     The plaintiffs in Gurry were able to sue the decedent’s\n\nemployer    not   merely   because    its    predecessor,     Dairy,     had    not\n\nemployed him, but because Dairy “would have been susceptible to a\n\nthird-party claim as a tortfeasor outside of the protection of\n\nworkers’ compensation” if not for the merger.               550 N.E.2d at 131\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n            The foregoing considered, the question we must answer is\n\nwhether Lightolier “would have been susceptible to a third-party\n\nclaim” but for the merger.         If so, Genlyte may be sued.         If not, it\n\nmay not.\n\nD.          Could the Bragas Have Brought a Third Party Claim Against\n            Lightolier?\n\n            Although Gurry provides the question, it does not provide\n\nthe answer.       While the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts\n\n“alluded favorably to the [dual persona] theory” in Gurry, it has\n\n“never explicitly adopted” it, much less established its scope or\n\n                                      -16-\n\fset parameters for it.        Barrett v. Rodgers, 562 N.E.2d 480, 482\n\n(Mass. 1990).       No Massachusetts court has considered whether Gurry\n\nshould be extended to circumstances like these, where an employer’s\n\npredecessor merely owned defective equipment when it merged with\n\nthe employer and an employee was later injured by that equipment.\n\n            1.        Preliminary   Issues     on   Applying   Massachusetts\n                      Law\n\n            A federal court that faces an unresolved state law\n\nquestion is to “‘ascertain the rule the state court would most\n\nlikely follow under the circumstances.’” Braga I, 57 Fed. Appx. at\n\n453 (quoting Blinzler v. Marriott Int’l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1151\n\n(1st Cir. 1996)).      It is reasonable to “assume that the state court\n\nwill follow the rule that appears best to effectuate relevant\n\npolicies.”       Moores v. Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (internal quotation and modification omitted).             “We may seek\n\nguidance     ‘in     analogous    state     court   decisions,    persuasive\n\nadjudications by courts of sister states, learned treatises, and\n\npublic policy considerations identified in state decisional law.’”\n\nBraga I, 57 Fed. Appx. at 453 (quoting Blinzler, 81 F.3d at 1151).\n\nIn   so    doing,    “we   must   exercise    considerable     caution   when\n\nconsidering the adoption of a new application” of state law that\n\ncould “expand [its] present reach.”            Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc., 103\n\nF.3d 186, 192 (1st Cir. 1996).               A federal court sitting in\n\ndiversity must “take care not to extend state law beyond its well-\n\nmarked boundaries in an area . . . that is quintessentially the\n\n                                     -17-\n\fprovince of state courts.”    Markham v. Fay, 74 F.3d 1347, 1356 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n           Extrapolating from analogous decisions in sister states\n\nand policy pronouncements of Massachusetts courts, we conclude that\n\nGurry should not be extended to permit suit here.\n\n           2.       Relevant Massachusetts Policy\n\n           The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has described\n\nthe “very broad” exclusivity provision of the workers’ compensation\n\nscheme as its “cornerstone.” Berger v. H.P. Hood, Inc., 624 N.E.2d\n\n947, 949 (Mass. 1993).       It has also cautioned courts against\n\ncreating “[a]ny change in compensation law which would permit a\n\ncovered employee to recover compensation benefits and, in addition,\n\npermit litigation by the employee against his employer to recover\n\nfor an injury clearly covered by the Workmen’s Compensation Act.”\n\nLongever v. Revere Copper & Brass Inc., 408 N.E.2d 857, 860 (Mass.\n\n1980).   “The instances in which a single legal entity . . . will be\n\nliable under both the workers’ compensation scheme and in a lawsuit\n\nfor a single injury arising out of a single workplace incident are\n\nvery rare.”     Barrett, 562 N.E.2d at 483.\n\n           3.       Analogous Decisions from our Sister States\n\n           With this Massachusetts background in mind, we turn to\n\nanalogous decisions of our sister states.      Any exception to the\n\nimmunity that workers’ compensation schemes provide employers “must\n\nbe narrowly construed to fit only the policy reasons that give rise\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fto its inception, and not allowed to expand to envelop situations\n\nthat [workers’ compensation] was otherwise intended to cover.”\n\nHerbolsheimer v. SMS Holding Co., 608 N.W.2d 487, 495 (Mich. Ct.\n\nApp. 2000); see id. (“dual-persona doctrine should be interpreted\n\nmore   narrowly   rather   than   more    broadly”   where   its   scope   is\n\nunclear).   It is important that the dual persona doctrine “not be\n\nused for the purpose of simply evading the exclusivity provision of\n\nthe Workmen’s Compensation Act.”          Kimzey v. Interpace Corp., 694\n\nP.2d 907, 912 (Kan. Ct. App. 1985); cf. Gurry, 550 N.E.2d at 131\n\n(evaluating how suit would affect “important aims” of workers’\n\ncompensation and corporate successorship principles).\n\n            The majority – and, we conclude, better-reasoned – view\n\namong courts that have considered circumstances akin to those here\n\nis that an employer cannot be held liable on the basis of a\n\npredecessor’s mere ownership of defective equipment when it merged\n\nwith the employer.    See Corr v. Willamette Indus., Inc., 713 P.2d\n\n92, 96 (Wash. 1986) (“No obligation or liability would have existed\n\nprior to the merger, and none should be created by the merger that\n\ncould not have existed independently.”); Vega v. Standard Mach.\n\nCo., 675 A.2d 1194, 1197-98 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1996)\n\n(predecessor’s ownership of defective machine at merger did not\n\ncreate liability, when merger did not render predecessor a “seller”\n\nor “supplier” and consequently predecessor had no duty to warn).\n\nThe key question is whether the employer had a separate duty to the\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\femployee-claimant outside of the employment relationship.                    See\n\nHatch v. Lido Co. of New Eng., 609 A.2d 1155, 1157 (Me. 1992)\n\n(predecessor’s negligent pre-merger installation or maintenance of\n\nequipment in its own facility for its own use did not implicate a\n\n“separate and unrelated duty” for the post-merger entity, beyond\n\nthat of an employer to its own employees); Herbolsheimer, 608\n\nN.W.2d   at    496-97    (question   of     liability    hinged    on   whether\n\npredecessor had “separate obligations” to claimant).\n\n           The   flaws    in   plaintiffs’    approach    are     clearer   when\n\nconsidering the continuity of the corporate entities.               Plaintiffs\n\nare arguing in effect that, on the one hand, Genlyte-Thomas is a\n\ncontinuation of Lightolier/APC for the purpose of holding the\n\nsuccessor corporation liable.        On the other hand, plaintiffs argue\n\nthat Lightolier/APC is so distinct and separate from its successors\n\nthat its “transfer” of the Press via merger created new duties and\n\nliabilities.     The latter view is inconsistent not only with the\n\nformer, but with the very nature of a corporate merger:                 “[T]he\n\nconsolidation of two or more corporations is like the uniting of\n\ntwo or more rivers, neither stream is annihilated, but all continue\n\nin existence.    A new river is formed, but it is a river composed of\n\nthe old rivers, which still exist, though in a different form.”\n\nAtlantic & B. Ry. v. Johnson, 56 S.E. 482, 484 (Ga. 1907) (quoting\n\nThompson on Corporations § 8341). “The object of the consolidation\n\nof two or more solvent corporations into one is not usually to wind\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fup the business of the old corporations but to continue as a unit\n\nthat which theretofore had been separate.”   Proprietors of Locks &\n\nCanals on Merrimack River v. Boston & M.R.R., 139 N.E. 839, 841\n\n(Mass. 1923). It is the continuity of the constituent corporations\n\nthat plaintiffs apparently fail to grasp in theorizing that the\n\ntransfer of equipment through a merger can itself create third\n\nparty liability.    Where the “transferor [] and transferee []\n\nbec[o]me one and the same as of the moment of transfer,” there is\n\n“[i]n effect, . . . no transfer (and therefore no duty owed) from\n\none entity to another, since at the moment of transfer there was\n\nonly one entity, the surviving corporation.”    Duvon   v. Rockwell\n\nInt’l, 807 P.2d 876, 881 (Wash. 1991) (describing rationale of\n\nCorr).\n\n          Although the cases discussed above represent the majority\n\nview, the states have not taken a uniform approach to the present\n\nfactual scenario.   Plaintiffs rely heavily on Billy v. Consol.\n\nMach. Tool Corp., 412 N.E.2d 934 (N.Y. 1980), in which the New York\n\nCourt of Appeals permitted suit to go forward against an employer\n\nbased on its status as successor to corporations that had designed\n\nand manufactured allegedly defective equipment for their own use.2\n\nThe equipment passed to the successor corporation through a series\n\nof mergers.   The court held that, but for the merger, plaintiff\n\n\n     2\n          As plaintiffs point out, Gurry cites Billy favorably.\nHowever, it does so only in general terms that sheds no light on\nthe instant dispute. Gurry, 550 N.E.2d at 131.\n\n                               -21-\n\fcould have sued the predecessor corporations based on their design\n\nand manufacture of the defective equipment.           The court concluded\n\nthat this potential liability survived the merger, “since the\n\nobligation upon which [the successor] is being sued arose not out\n\nof the employment relation, but rather out of [the] independent\n\nbusiness transaction” of the merger itself.          Id. at 940; see also\n\nSchweiner v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 354 N.W.2d 767, 772-73\n\n(Wis. 1984) (holding that, but for merger, plaintiff could have\n\nsued predecessor that manufactured defective equipment as third\n\nparty, but not analyzing basis for such a suit).\n\n            A strong dissent in Billy exposed the flaws in the\n\nmajority’s reasoning.         The dissent noted that the inchoate tort\n\nliability    the   predecessor    incurred   after   installation   of   the\n\ndefective equipment for its own use was “to anyone injured by the\n\ndefect other than an employee, as to whom [workers’] compensation\n\nlaw immunized it from common-law liability.”         Billy, 412 N.E.2d at\n\n942 (Meyer, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original).             The Billy\n\ndissent     reasoned   that    the   successor   company   inherited     the\n\npredecessor’s immunity from liability, including immunity from an\n\nemployee’s suit.       As a result, the merger provided no basis for\n\nliability; it was not the equivalent of a sale or transfer of\n\nassets (with the concomitant legal obligations this would entail),\n\nand the act of merging itself did not, as a matter of law, create\n\nliability.    Id. at 942-44; see id. at 942 (“[E]ven under the most\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fliberal application of the [dual persona] doctrine a manufacturer-\n\nemployer is held protected by compensation immunity when the\n\nproduct was manufactured solely for his own use and not for\n\ndistribution to the general public.”).\n\n                               III.     CONCLUSION\n\n             We are persuaded that the Supreme Judicial Court of\n\nMassachusetts would adopt the reasoning of those courts that have\n\ndeclined to extend the dual persona theory to circumstances like\n\nthose here.       Lightolier purchased the Press for its own use.               It\n\ndid not sell the Press or allow non-employees to use it.                    (It is\n\nnot even alleged to have modified the Press.)                 In the hypothetical\n\nworld in which no merger occurred, the Press could have caused an\n\ninjury      for   which     plaintiff     would        have   received     workers’\n\ncompensation only if he worked for Lightolier.                      See supra Part\n\nII.A.      In such a case, plaintiff would obviously have no third-\n\nparty claim.      It is the merger itself on which plaintiff relies to\n\nstake his present claim.         Allowing a merger to increase, rather\n\nthan preserve, inchoate liability is not consistent with the policy\n\nof   the    workers’      compensation    act     or    the   law    of   corporate\n\nsuccessorship.      We are reluctant to expand the dual persona theory\n\nto any application beyond that which Massachusetts has already\n\napproved, particularly since the policy reasons on which the Gurry\n\ncourt relied are not implicated here.             We are even more reluctant\n\n\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fwhere, as here, the better reasoned cases from other jurisdictions\n\nhold that such an expansion would not be warranted.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s decision\n\nis AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -24-\n\f",

On the unique and relatively complex facts here, we find and conclude that this plaintiff's tort claim is barred by the Massachusetts workers' compensation law, pursuant to which one of defendant's merger successors has previously compensated plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Antonio Braga (\"Braga\") received workers' compensation benefits for an injury he sustained while an employee of Genlyte-Thomas Group, LLC (\"Genlyte-Thomas\"). He and his wife are suing in tort for that same injury Genlyte Group, Inc. (\"Genlyte\"). Braga had worked as an employee of Genlyte before it contributed substantially all of its assets (along with those contributed by Thomas Industries, Inc.) to create Genlyte-Thomas. The Bragas claim that defects in a hydraulic press Braga was operating while working for Genlyte-Thomas before that merger caused his injury. The Bragas base their claims against Genlyte on its status as successor, by merger, to Lightolier Incorporated (\"Lightolier\"); it had owned the allegedly defective press when it merged with Braga's then-employer.

Genlyte argues essentially that any liability was satisfied, and any tort claims barred, by Massachusetts workers' compensation law &#8212; the privileges and immunities of which also carried forward in the merger. The Bragas counter that those immunities do not apply here because their tort claims, based on Lightolier's conduct, arose independently from Genlyte's workers' compensation obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the second time this case has come up on appeal.

On remand, the district court granted summary judgment for Genlyte, again holding that \"plaintiffs' claims are barred by workers' compensation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas contend that the changes in Braga's employer's corporate structure over time relieve him of the barrier to tort claims generally applicable to those enjoying the benefits of workers' compensation. Genlyte argues that its workers' compensation tort immunity survived the mergers. The key question is whether, but for the mergers, Lightolier would have been liable to the Bragas. We hold that it would not have been. Accordingly, we conclude that the workers' compensation barrier was not lifted by the transactions involved here and we affirm summary judgment in favor of the defendant, albeit on a theory different from that employed by the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 18, 1998, Braga was injured while operating a hydraulic press (the \"Press\") at a Genlyte-Thomas manufacturing facility in Fall River, Massachusetts (the \"Fall River facility\"). The Press became activated while Braga was trying to remove a piece of metal jammed in it. It slammed down on Braga's hand, causing severe and permanent damage. He alleges that the Press was defective in that it lacked adequate guards to prevent an operator from unintentionally activating it, and that this defect caused his accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Corporate History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1980, Braga began working as a press operator at the Fall River facility for Aluminum Processing Corporation (\"APC\"). APC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lightolier, operated the Fall River facility at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September, 1980, Lightolier purchased the Press, second-hand, for use in its manufacturing facility in Norwich, Connecticut (the \"Norwich facility\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Friday, January 15, 1982, APC (along with all then-existing subsidiaries of Lightolier) merged into Lightolier. Three days later, on Monday, January 18, 1982, Lightolier merged into BZ Holdings Corporation (\"BZ Holdings\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of BZ Acquisition Corporation (\"BZ Acquisition\"). That same day, BZ Holdings changed its name to \"Lightolier Incorporated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Braga's employment status continued unchanged, save that his employer was now Lightolier/BZ rather than APC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, BZ Acquisition, which owned Lightolier/BZ, merged into Genlyte. Lightolier/BZ thus became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Genlyte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1991, Lightolier/BZ merged into Genlyte. Genlyte continued to operate the former Lightolier/BZ business under the name \"Lightolier.\" Braga's employment again continued unchanged, save that his employer was now Genlyte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around this time, the Norwich facility was converted from manufacturing to warehousing use. In June 1991, Genlyte transferred the Press from its Norwich facility to its Fall River facility, where Braga worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 28, 1998, Genlyte and Thomas Industries each contributed substantially all of its corporate assets to create a new entity, Genlyte-Thomas. Genlyte became the majority owner of Genlyte-Thomas and Thomas became the minority owner. Genlyte-Thomas continued to do business under the \"Lightolier\" name. Braga's employment again continued unchanged, save that his employer was now Genlyte-Thomas. Braga was still an employee of Genlyte-Thomas when his accident occurred on November 18, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After that accident, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspected the Press and cited Genlyte-Thomas for a violation because the \"operating buttons of the [Press] were not adequately guarded to prevent unintentional operation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Litigation History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas first filed a \"Complaint for Discovery\" against Lightolier in state court in 1999. That complaint was dismissed without prejudice after some discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas next filed a substantive suit against Lightolier in state court on September 6, 2001. After the case was removed to federal court on diversity grounds, plaintiffs amended the complaint to name Genlyte, one of Lightolier's successors by merger, as the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 2001, Genlyte moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on the ground that it was barred by the workers' compensation law. On January 4, 2002, the district court granted that motion to dismiss in a one-sentence endorsement on the face of the motion: \"Allowed, as Lightolier, Inc. would also be an employer for this purpose. <i>Herbolsheimer v. SMS Holding Co.,</i> 239 Mich.App. 236, 608 N.W.2d 487 ([Mich.Ct.App.] 2000).\" The Bragas appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 13, 2003, a panel of this court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The court was \"reluctant to affirm an order of dismissal where the district court neglected to analyze the questions raised by the complaint under the law governing the case,\" that is, Massachusetts state law. <i>Braga I,</i> 57 Fed.Appx. at 454. The court noted that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had addressed the \"questions raised by the intersection of the immunity of an employer under the workers' compensation scheme and successor liability\" in <i>Gurry v. Cumberland Farms,</i> 406 Mass. 615, 550 N.E.2d 127 (1990), which should be \"central\" to the analysis of this issue. <i>Braga I,</i> 57 Fed.Appx. at 454.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, following limited discovery, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The Bragas asserted claims of negligence based on \"(Old) `Lightolier' ... negligently transferring by means of the merger, to BZ Holdings/(New) `Lightolier' the defective [Press]\" and of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. His wife asserted a claim of loss of consortium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 13, 2004, Genlyte moved for summary judgment on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Undisputed Facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 2004, the district court granted that motion and again dismissed the plaintiffs' claims. The district court's analysis centered, as directed, on <i>Gurry.</i> The district court noted that <i>Gurry</i> permitted a suit in tort to proceed against an employer as successor of a corporation that \"was never decedent's employer and would have been susceptible to a third-party claim outside of the workers' compensation protection.\" On the other hand, the court recognized that, in <i>Gurry,</i> claims based on the conduct of a predecessor that had employed Gurry \"failed because `all [the] acts and omissions alleged against [it] arose out of the direct employment relationship.'\" (Citing <i>Gurry,</i> 550 N.E.2d at 131.) The district court framed the dispositive question as whether Braga had been \"an employee of Lightolier, the allegedly negligent predecessor corporation.\" The court focused on whether Braga was employed by Lightolier/APC from its creation on Friday, January 15, 1982, through its merger with BZ Holdings three days later, on Monday, January 18, 1982. The district court held that Braga's having \"performed no work over the weekend is irrelevant to his employment status.\" Because Braga's employment was never terminated, it was \"clear that [Lightolier/APC] did employ him, although it only had a brief existence.\" Based on this reasoning, the district court concluded that plaintiffs' claims were barred by the workers' compensation statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. Burke v. Town of Walpole,</i> 405 F.3d 66, 75 (1st Cir.2005). Like the lower court, we are to \"constru[e] the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and resolv[e] all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\" <i>Whitlock v. Mac-Gray, Inc.,</i> 345 F.3d 44, 45 (1st Cir.2003). Summary judgment is proper only if the record establishes that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We are not bound by the district court's rationale, but may affirm its grant of summary judgment \"on any ground supported by the record.\" <i>Cimon v. Gaffney,</i> 401 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Scheme</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts workers' compensation statute generally provides the exclusive remedy for employees who suffer work-related injuries. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 24. A non-employer third party tortfeasor, however, is not protected by the immunity from suit by an injured worker that workers' compensation law affords that worker's employer. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 15. Injured employees are thus free to sue third party tortfeasors whose negligence caused or contributed to their work-place injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a third party whose actions might subject it to a tort suit by an injured worker later merges with the injured worker's employer &#8212; so that the employer and the \"third party\" become one and the same &#8212; a dilemma arises. After a merger, the surviving corporation is \"liable for[] all liabilities and obligations of each of the constituent corporations in the same manner and to the same extent as if such ... surviving corporation had itself incurred such liabilities or obligations.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B, &#167; 80(b). As successor to the alleged tortfeasor, the surviving entity should ordinarily be subject to suit by the injured employee to the same extent the third party would have been absent the merger. On the other hand, under the circumstances here, neither the plaintiffs, nor the state decisions on which they rely, explain to our satisfaction why the injured employee's employer is not immunized from tort liability by the same law that provided compensation administratively to the injured employees. <i>See, e.g., infra</i> Part II.D.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Dual Persona Doctrine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas claim that they should be able to sue Genlyte as successor to the original Lightolier despite the otherwise applicable workers' compensation immunity. They rely on what is commonly referred to as the \"dual persona\" doctrine. According to that concept an \"employer may become a third person, vulnerable to tort suit by an employee, if &#8212; and only if &#8212; it possesses a second persona so completely independent from and unrelated to its status as employer that by established standards the law recognizes that persona as a separate legal person.\" 6 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <i>Larson's Workers' Compensation Law</i> &#167; 113.01[1], at 113-2 (2005) (\"<i>Larson</i>\"); <i>see also Gurry,</i> 550 N.E.2d at 131 (citing this definition from an earlier edition of the <i>Larson</i> treatise). Where such a \"dual persona\" exists, the dual persona doctrine may permit a tort suit only if the \"<i>nonemployer</i> persona\" owed the injured employee duties \"totally separate from and unrelated to\" duties arising out of the employment relationship. <i>Larson,</i> &#167; 113.01[4], at 113-10 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gurry</i> is the leading Massachusetts case on the \"dual persona\" doctrine. The facts in <i>Gurry,</i> as here, are somewhat involved. Gurry worked for United Cranberry Growers Associates, Inc. (\"Cranberry\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delaware Food Store, Inc. (\"DFS\"). Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc. (\"Dairy\"), another DFS subsidiary, sold managerial services to Cranberry. As part of these duties, Dairy designed, and commissioned a contractor to build, buggies for Cranberry. The next year, Cranberry and Dairy merged into DFS, which in turn merged into Cumberland Farms, Inc. (\"Cumberland\"). Gurry continued at his job, with Cumberland becoming his employer as a result of the mergers. Gurry was killed while working for Cumberland, operating one of the buggies. Gurry's beneficiaries received workers' compensation payments. The <i>Gurry</i> plaintiffs nonetheless sued Cumberland, alleging that negligent design, manufacture and maintenance of the buggy by its predecessors, Cranberry and Dairy, caused Gurry's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question thus presented was one of first impression in Massachusetts: could an employee injured on the job sue an employer for negligence on the part of the employer's corporate predecessors? The Supreme Judicial Court found that the \"answer depends on the interrelationship of two statutes: the business corporation law and the workers' compensation act.\" <i>Gurry,</i> 550 N.E.2d at 130 (citations omitted). The <i>Gurry</i> court observed that, under Massachusetts business corporation law, \"Cumberland stood in the shoes of Cranberry [] and Dairy ..., inheriting any liabilities for tortious conduct, as well as any privileges in the form of statutory immunities, that those predecessors would have had.\" <i>Id.</i> at 131 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B &#167; 80(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held that Cumberland could not be sued for Cranberry's alleged negligence because Cranberry itself \"would have been immune from suit since all the acts and omissions alleged against [it] arose out of the direct employment relationship\" between it and Gurry. <i>Id.</i> On the other hand, \"Dairy was never Kevin Gurry's employer, and would have been susceptible to a third-party claim as a tortfeasor outside of the protection of workers' compensation\" if not for the merger. <i>Id.</i> (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152 &#167; 15 (1988 ed.)). Had the merger not occurred, plaintiffs would have been able to bring a third party suit against Dairy, the company that designed and supervised the manufacture of defective equipment for the decedent's then-employer, Cranberry. The <i>Gurry</i> court emphasized that \"the workers' compensation statute was intended to deal with injuries and liability occurring in the course of the employer-employee relationship.\" <i>Id.</i> Since a claim based on Dairy's conduct did not arise from an employment relationship, but \"from the negligence of an independent corporation,\" allowing it to go forward would not interfere with the purpose of the workers' compensation statute. The court concluded that \"insulat[ing] Cumberland from liability it acquired, as a result of its merger with Dairy[,] because [Cumberland] happened to be Kevin Gurry's employer, would subvert the important aims of both the workers' compensation system and the business corporation statute.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Braga's Employment Status</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that workers' compensation bars this suit because Braga was employed by Lightolier/APC during its \"brief existence.\" Braga's employment status during the three-day period from January 15-18, 1982 is the primary issue the parties address on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that this question cannot be resolved as a matter of law but requires a detailed, fact-specific inquiry into the relationship between Braga and Lightolier/APC. As explained below, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts business corporation law provides that \"all of the estate, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the constituent corporations\" automatically vest in the surviving corporation upon merger \"without further act or deed.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B, &#167; 80(a)(5). Despite the Bragas' hyperbolic claim that treating employees as assets that transfer by law upon merger means viewing them as \"chattels of the corporation,\" a corporation's employment contracts are counted among its assets. <i>See, e.g., Modis, Inc. v.</i> <i>Revolution Group, Ltd.,</i> 11 Mass. L. Rptr. 246, 1999 WL 1441918, at *6 (Mass.Super.Ct. Dec. 29, 1999) (describing \"employment contracts and employment `arrangements'\" as \"assets [that] became the property of [the surviving corporation] after the merger\"); <i>cf. Dickson v. Riverside Iron Works, Inc.,</i> 6 Mass.App.Ct. 53, 372 N.E.2d 1302, 1304-05 (1978) (plaintiff may enforce employment contract against surviving corporation after merger).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas argue that employees do not automatically continue working for a surviving corporation after a merger but must establish employment relationships anew with that entity. <i>Cf. Holliday v. Pers. Prods. Co.,</i> 939 F.Supp. 402, 405-07 (E.D.Pa.1996) (rejecting argument that workers' compensation immunity would not apply after employer's merger with third party tortfeasor unless employee consented to be employed by new corporate entity). If that were the law, employees of merging corporations would lose their jobs instantaneously upon a merger, absent some affirmative conduct showing that they now worked for the surviving corporation. Similarly, the employment status of those in otherwise identical positions would vary with their awareness of, and view toward, changes in corporate status that did not affect the conduct of their jobs in any way. None of the cases plaintiffs cite, however, supports such odd results. <i>See, e.g., Langevin's Case,</i> 326 Mass. 43, 91 N.E.2d 920, 921 (1950); <i>Abbott v. Link-Belt Co.,</i> 324 Mass. 673, 88 N.E.2d 551, 554 (1949). Indeed, none even addresses the relevant question, namely, how a merger affects continuity of employment. We see no basis for holding that there was a gap in Braga's employment during the January 15-18, 1982, period. He simply continued as an employee of the corporate entity that succeeded his employer, first Lightolier/APC, then Lightolier/BZ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the question of whether Lightolier/APC employed Braga is not dispositive, but merely a red herring here. This can be seen by moving the analysis back one level, thus framing it in terms of the initial merger of Lightolier and APC (Braga's original employer) rather than the merger of Lightolier/APC and BZ Holdings three days later. Whether or not Lightolier/APC employed Braga during its three-day existence, Lightolier &#8212; which it succeeded&#8212;unquestionably never employed him. Since Lightolier owned the allegedly defective Press when it merged with Braga's then-employer, APC, Lightolier's merger with APC appears to raise the same liability issues that the Bragas claim are raised by Lightolier/APC's merger with BZ Holdings. But the mere fact that Lightolier did not employ Braga would not establish successorship liability. Lightolier/APC can inherit Lightolier's third-party liability only if such liability would have existed absent the merger. The plaintiffs in <i>Gurry</i> were able to sue the decedent's employer not merely because its predecessor, Dairy, had not employed him, but because Dairy \"<i>would have been susceptible to a third-party claim</i> as a tortfeasor outside of the protection of workers' compensation\" if not for the merger. 550 N.E.2d at 131 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing considered, the question we must answer is whether Lightolier \"would have been susceptible to a third-party claim\" but for the merger. If so, Genlyte may be sued. If not, it may not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Could the Bragas Have Brought a Third Party Claim Against Lightolier?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Gurry</i> provides the question, it does not provide the answer. While the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts \"alluded favorably to the [dual persona] theory\" in <i>Gurry,</i> it has \"never explicitly adopted\" it, much less established its scope or set parameters for it. <i>Barrett v. Rodgers,</i> 408 Mass. 614, 562 N.E.2d 480, 482 (1990). No Massachusetts court has considered whether <i>Gurry</i> should be extended to circumstances like these, where an employer's predecessor merely owned defective equipment when it merged with the employer and an employee was later injured by that equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

Gurry,</i> 550 N.E.2d at 131 (evaluating how suit would affect \"important aims\" of workers' compensation and corporate successorship principles).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority &#8212; and, we conclude, better-reasoned &#8212; view among courts that have considered circumstances akin to those here is that an employer cannot be held liable on the basis of a predecessor's mere ownership of defective equipment when it merged with the employer. <i>See Corr v. Willamette Indus., Inc.,</i> 105 Wash.2d 217, 713 P.2d 92, 96 (1986) (\"No obligation or liability would have existed prior to the merger, and none should be created by the merger that could not have existed independently.\"); <i>Vega v. Standard Mach. Co.,</i> 290 N.J.Super. 434, 675 A.2d 1194, 1197-98 (1996) (predecessor's ownership of defective machine at merger did not create liability, when merger did not render predecessor a \"seller\" or \"supplier\" and consequently predecessor had no duty to warn). The key question is whether the employer had a separate duty to the employee-claimant outside of the employment relationship. <i>See Hatch v. Lido Co. of New Eng.,</i> 609 A.2d 1155, 1157 (1992) (predecessor's negligent pre-merger installation or maintenance of equipment in its own facility for its own use did not implicate a \"separate and unrelated duty\" for the post-merger entity, beyond that of an employer to its own employees); <i>Herbolsheimer,</i> 608 N.W.2d at 496-97 (question of liability hinged on whether predecessor had \"separate obligations\" to claimant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaws in plaintiffs' approach are clearer when considering the continuity of the corporate entities. Plaintiffs are arguing in effect that, on the one hand, Genlyte-Thomas is a continuation of Lightolier/APC for the purpose of holding the successor corporation liable. On the other hand, plaintiffs argue that Lightolier/APC is so distinct and separate from its successors that its \"transfer\" of the Press via merger created new duties and liabilities. The latter view is inconsistent not only with the former, but with the very nature of a corporate merger: \"[T]he consolidation of two or more corporations is like the uniting of two or more rivers, neither stream is annihilated, but all continue in existence. A new river is formed, but it is a river composed of the old rivers, which still exist, though in a different form.\" <i>Atlantic &amp; B. Ry. v. Johnson,</i> 127 Ga. 392, 56 S.E. 482, 484 (1907) (quoting <i>Thompson on Corporations</i> &#167; 8341). \"The object of the consolidation of two or more solvent corporations into one is not usually to wind up the business of the old corporations but to continue as a unit that which theretofore had been separate.\" <i>Proprietors of Locks &amp; Canals on Merrimack River v. Boston &amp; M.R.R.,</i> 245 Mass. 52, 139 N.E. 839, 841 (1923). It is the continuity of the constituent corporations that plaintiffs apparently fail to grasp in theorizing that the transfer of equipment through a merger can itself create third party liability. Where the \"transferor [] and transferee [] bec[o]me one and the same as of the moment of transfer,\" there is \"[i]n effect, ... no transfer (and therefore no duty owed) from one entity to another, since at the moment of transfer there was only one entity, the surviving corporation.\" <i>Duvon v. Rockwell Int'l,</i> 116 Wash.2d 749, 807 P.2d 876, 881 (1991) (describing rationale of <i>Corr</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the cases discussed above represent the majority view, the states have not taken a uniform approach to the present factual scenario. Plaintiffs rely heavily on <i>Billy v. Consol. Mach. Tool Corp.,</i> 51 N.Y.2d 152, 432 N.Y.S.2d 879, 412 N.E.2d 934 (1980), in which the New York Court of Appeals permitted suit to go forward against an employer based on its status as successor to corporations that had designed and manufactured allegedly defective equipment for their own use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The equipment passed to the successor corporation through a series of mergers. The court held that, but for the merger, plaintiff could have sued the predecessor corporations based on their design and manufacture of the defective equipment. The court concluded that this potential liability survived the merger, \"since the obligation upon which [the successor] is being sued arose not out of the employment relation, but rather out of [the] independent business transaction\" of the merger itself. <i>Id.</i> at 161, 432 N.Y.S.2d at 885, 412 N.E.2d at 940; <i>see also Schweiner v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co.,</i> 120 Wis.2d 344, 354 N.W.2d 767, 772-73 (1984) (holding that, but for merger, plaintiff could have sued predecessor that manufactured defective equipment as third party, but not analyzing basis for such a suit).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A strong dissent in <i>Billy</i> exposed the flaws in the majority's reasoning. The dissent noted that the inchoate tort liability the predecessor incurred after installation of the defective equipment for its own use was \"to anyone injured by the defect <i>other than an employee,</i> as to whom [workers'] compensation law immunized it from common-law liability.\" <i>Billy,</i> 432 N.Y.S.2d 879, 412 N.E.2d at 942 (Meyer, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). The <i>Billy</i> dissent reasoned that the successor company inherited the predecessor's immunity from liability, including immunity from an employee's suit. As a result, the merger provided no basis for liability; it was not the equivalent of a sale or transfer of assets (with the concomitant legal obligations this would entail), and the act of merging itself did not, as a matter of law, create liability. <i>Id.</i> at 163-168, 432 N.Y.S.2d at 886-889, 412 N.E.2d at 942-44; <i>see id.</i> at 164, 432 N.Y.S.2d at 886, 412 N.E.2d at 942 (\"[E]ven under the most liberal application of the [dual persona] doctrine a manufacturer-employer is held protected by compensation immunity when the product was manufactured solely for his own use and not for distribution to the general public.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are persuaded that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts would adopt the reasoning of those courts that have declined to extend the dual persona theory to circumstances like those here. Lightolier purchased the Press for its own use. It did not sell the Press or allow non-employees to use it. (It is not even alleged to have modified the Press.) In the hypothetical world in which no merger occurred, the Press could have caused an injury for which plaintiff would have received workers' compensation only if he worked for Lightolier. <i>See supra</i> Part II.A. In such a case, plaintiff would obviously have no third-party claim. It is <i>the merger itself</i> on which plaintiff relies to stake his present claim. Allowing a merger to <i>increase,</i> rather than preserve, inchoate liability is not consistent with the policy of the workers' compensation act or the law of corporate successorship. We are reluctant to expand the dual persona theory to any application beyond that which Massachusetts has already approved, particularly since the policy reasons on which the <i>Gurry</i> court relied are not implicated here. We are even more reluctant where, as here, the better reasoned cases from other jurisdictions hold that such an expansion would not be warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To distinguish among the various Lightolier entities, we refer only to the original, pre-January 15, 1982, company as \"Lightolier.\" We refer to the corporation that existed from January 15-18, 1982, as \"Lightolier/APC,\" and to the post-January 18, 1982, entity as \"Lightolier/BZ.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As plaintiffs point out,<i>Gurry</i> cites <i>Billy</i> favorably.

On the unique and relatively complex facts here, we find and conclude that this plaintiff's tort claim is barred by the Massachusetts workers' compensation law, pursuant to which one of defendant's merger successors has previously compensated plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellant Antonio Braga (\"Braga\") received workers' compensation benefits for an injury he sustained while an employee of Genlyte-Thomas Group, LLC (\"Genlyte-Thomas\"). He and his wife are suing in tort for that same injury Genlyte Group, Inc. (\"Genlyte\"). Braga had worked as an employee of Genlyte before it contributed substantially all of its assets (along with those contributed by Thomas Industries, Inc.) to create Genlyte-Thomas. The Bragas claim that defects in a hydraulic press Braga was operating while working for Genlyte-Thomas before that merger caused his injury. The Bragas base their claims against Genlyte on its status as successor, by merger, to Lightolier Incorporated (\"Lightolier\"); it had owned the allegedly defective press when it merged with Braga's then-employer. The Bragas claim that Lightolier knew the press was defective at the time of its merger, but that it did not disclose or remedy the defects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas allege that this knowledge of the defect created inchoate liability for Lightolier that carried over in the merger, giving the Bragas a cause of action against Genlyte. Genlyte argues essentially that any liability was satisfied, and any tort claims barred, by Massachusetts workers' compensation law &#8212; the privileges and immunities of which also carried forward in the merger. The Bragas counter that those immunities do not apply here because their tort claims, based on Lightolier's conduct, arose independently from Genlyte's workers' compensation obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the second time this case has come up on appeal. The district court initially dismissed the Bragas' claims as barred by workers' compensation in a one-sentence order that cited no Massachusetts law. Finding that the case presented a \"complex and fact-bound\" question of state law, a previous panel of this court reversed and remanded for \"analysis of a more fully developed factual scenario under Massachusetts law.\" <i>Braga v. Genlyte, Inc.,</i> 57 Fed.Appx. 451, 454 (1st Cir.2003) (unpublished) (\"<i>Braga I</i>\"). On remand, the district court granted summary judgment for Genlyte, again holding that \"plaintiffs' claims are barred by workers' compensation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas contend that the changes in Braga's employer's corporate structure over time relieve him of the barrier to tort claims generally applicable to those enjoying the benefits of workers' compensation. Genlyte argues that its workers' compensation tort immunity survived the mergers. The key question is whether, but for the mergers, Lightolier would have been liable to the Bragas. We hold that it would not have been. Accordingly, we conclude that the workers' compensation barrier was not lifted by the transactions involved here and we affirm summary judgment in favor of the defendant, albeit on a theory different from that employed by the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 18, 1998, Braga was injured while operating a hydraulic press (the \"Press\") at a Genlyte-Thomas manufacturing facility in Fall River, Massachusetts (the \"Fall River facility\"). The Press became activated while Braga was trying to remove a piece of metal jammed in it. It slammed down on Braga's hand, causing severe and permanent damage. He alleges that the Press was defective in that it lacked adequate guards to prevent an operator from unintentionally activating it, and that this defect caused his accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Corporate History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1980, Braga began working as a press operator at the Fall River facility for Aluminum Processing Corporation (\"APC\"). APC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lightolier, operated the Fall River facility at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September, 1980, Lightolier purchased the Press, second-hand, for use in its manufacturing facility in Norwich, Connecticut (the \"Norwich facility\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Friday, January 15, 1982, APC (along with all then-existing subsidiaries of Lightolier) merged into Lightolier. Three days later, on Monday, January 18, 1982, Lightolier merged into BZ Holdings Corporation (\"BZ Holdings\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of BZ Acquisition Corporation (\"BZ Acquisition\"). That same day, BZ Holdings changed its name to \"Lightolier Incorporated.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Braga's employment status continued unchanged, save that his employer was now Lightolier/BZ rather than APC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, BZ Acquisition, which owned Lightolier/BZ, merged into Genlyte. Lightolier/BZ thus became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Genlyte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1991, Lightolier/BZ merged into Genlyte. Genlyte continued to operate the former Lightolier/BZ business under the name \"Lightolier.\" Braga's employment again continued unchanged, save that his employer was now Genlyte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around this time, the Norwich facility was converted from manufacturing to warehousing use. In June 1991, Genlyte transferred the Press from its Norwich facility to its Fall River facility, where Braga worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 28, 1998, Genlyte and Thomas Industries each contributed substantially all of its corporate assets to create a new entity, Genlyte-Thomas. Genlyte became the majority owner of Genlyte-Thomas and Thomas became the minority owner. Genlyte-Thomas continued to do business under the \"Lightolier\" name. Braga's employment again continued unchanged, save that his employer was now Genlyte-Thomas. Braga was still an employee of Genlyte-Thomas when his accident occurred on November 18, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After that accident, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspected the Press and cited Genlyte-Thomas for a violation because the \"operating buttons of the [Press] were not adequately guarded to prevent unintentional operation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Litigation History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas first filed a \"Complaint for Discovery\" against Lightolier in state court in 1999. That complaint was dismissed without prejudice after some discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas next filed a substantive suit against Lightolier in state court on September 6, 2001. After the case was removed to federal court on diversity grounds, plaintiffs amended the complaint to name Genlyte, one of Lightolier's successors by merger, as the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 2001, Genlyte moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on the ground that it was barred by the workers' compensation law. On January 4, 2002, the district court granted that motion to dismiss in a one-sentence endorsement on the face of the motion: \"Allowed, as Lightolier, Inc. would also be an employer for this purpose. <i>Herbolsheimer v. SMS Holding Co.,</i> 239 Mich.App. 236, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1746580\"><a href=\"/opinion/1746580/herbolsheimer-v-sms-holding-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">487</span></a></span> ([Mich.Ct.App.] 2000).\" The Bragas appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 13, 2003, a panel of this court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The court was \"reluctant to affirm an order of dismissal where the district court neglected to analyze the questions raised by the complaint under the law governing the case,\" that is, Massachusetts state law. <i>Braga I,</i> 57 Fed.Appx. at 454.

The Bragas asserted claims of negligence based on \"(Old) `Lightolier' ... negligently transferring by means of the merger, to BZ Holdings/(New) `Lightolier' the defective [Press]\" and of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. His wife asserted a claim of loss of consortium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 13, 2004, Genlyte moved for summary judgment on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Undisputed Facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 5, 2004, the district court granted that motion and again dismissed the plaintiffs' claims. The district court's analysis centered, as directed, on <i>Gurry.</i> The district court noted that <i>Gurry</i> permitted a suit in tort to proceed against an employer as successor of a corporation that \"was never decedent's employer and would have been susceptible to a third-party claim outside of the workers' compensation protection.\" On the other hand, the court recognized that, in <i>Gurry,</i> claims based on the conduct of a predecessor that had employed Gurry \"failed because `all [the] acts and omissions alleged against [it] arose out of the direct employment relationship.'\" (Citing <i>Gurry,</i> 550 N.E.2d at 131.) The district court framed the dispositive question as whether Braga had been \"an employee of Lightolier, the allegedly negligent predecessor corporation.\" The court focused on whether Braga was employed by Lightolier/APC from its creation on Friday, January 15, 1982, through its merger with BZ Holdings three days later, on Monday, January 18, 1982. The district court held that Braga's having \"performed no work over the weekend is irrelevant to his employment status.\" Because Braga's employment was never terminated, it was \"clear that [Lightolier/APC] did employ him, although it only had a brief existence.\" Based on this reasoning, the district court concluded that plaintiffs' claims were barred by the workers' compensation statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. Burke v.

Summary judgment is proper only if the record establishes that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

The Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Scheme</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts workers' compensation statute generally provides the exclusive remedy for employees who suffer work-related injuries. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 24. A non-employer third party tortfeasor, however, is not protected by the immunity from suit by an injured worker that workers' compensation law affords that worker's employer. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152, &#167; 15. Injured employees are thus free to sue third party tortfeasors whose negligence caused or contributed to their work-place injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a third party whose actions might subject it to a tort suit by an injured worker later merges with the injured worker's employer &#8212; so that the employer and the \"third party\" become one and the same &#8212; a dilemma arises. After a merger, the surviving corporation is \"liable for[] all liabilities and obligations of each of the constituent corporations in the same manner and to the same extent as if such ... surviving corporation had itself incurred such liabilities or obligations.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B, &#167; 80(b). As successor to the alleged tortfeasor, the surviving entity should ordinarily be subject to suit by the injured employee to the same extent the third party would have been absent the merger. On the other hand, under the circumstances here, neither the plaintiffs, nor the state decisions on which they rely, explain to our satisfaction why the injured employee's employer is not immunized from tort liability by the same law that provided compensation administratively to the injured employees. <i>See, e.g., infra</i> Part II.D.3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Dual Persona Doctrine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bragas claim that they should be able to sue Genlyte as successor to the original Lightolier despite the otherwise applicable workers' compensation immunity. They rely on what is commonly referred to as the \"dual persona\" doctrine. According to that concept an \"employer may become a third person, vulnerable to tort suit by an employee, if &#8212; and only if &#8212; it possesses a second persona so completely independent from and unrelated to its status as employer that by established standards the law recognizes that persona as a separate legal person.\" 6 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <i>Larson's Workers' Compensation Law</i> &#167; 113.01[1], at 113-2 (2005) (\"<i>Larson</i>\"); <i>see also Gurry,</i> 550 N.E.2d at 131 (citing this definition from an earlier edition of the <i>Larson</i> treatise). Where such a \"dual persona\" exists, the dual persona doctrine may permit a tort suit only if the \"<i>nonemployer</i> persona\" owed the injured employee duties \"totally separate from and unrelated to\" duties arising out of the employment relationship. <i>Larson,</i> &#167; 113.01[4], at 113-10 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gurry</i> is the leading Massachusetts case on the \"dual persona\" doctrine. The facts in <i>Gurry,</i> as here, are somewhat involved. Gurry worked for United Cranberry Growers Associates, Inc. (\"Cranberry\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delaware Food Store, Inc. (\"DFS\"). Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc. (\"Dairy\"), another DFS subsidiary, sold managerial services to Cranberry. As part of these duties, Dairy designed, and commissioned a contractor to build, buggies for Cranberry. The next year, Cranberry and Dairy merged into DFS, which in turn merged into Cumberland Farms, Inc. (\"Cumberland\"). Gurry continued at his job, with Cumberland becoming his employer as a result of the mergers. Gurry was killed while working for Cumberland, operating one of the buggies. Gurry's beneficiaries received workers' compensation payments. The <i>Gurry</i> plaintiffs nonetheless sued Cumberland, alleging that negligent design, manufacture and maintenance of the buggy by its predecessors, Cranberry and Dairy, caused Gurry's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question thus presented was one of first impression in Massachusetts: could an employee injured on the job sue an employer for negligence on the part of the employer's corporate predecessors? The Supreme Judicial Court found that the \"answer depends on the interrelationship of two statutes: the business corporation law and the workers' compensation act.\" <i>Gurry,</i> 550 N.E.2d at 130 (citations omitted). The <i>Gurry</i> court observed that, under Massachusetts business corporation law, \"Cumberland stood in the shoes of Cranberry [] and Dairy ..., inheriting any liabilities for tortious conduct, as well as any privileges in the form of statutory immunities, that those predecessors would have had.\" <i>Id.</i> at 131 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B &#167; 80(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held that Cumberland could not be sued for Cranberry's alleged negligence because Cranberry itself \"would have been immune from suit since all the acts and omissions alleged against [it] arose out of the direct employment relationship\" between it and Gurry. <i>Id.</i> On the other hand, \"Dairy was never Kevin Gurry's employer, and would have been susceptible to a third-party claim as a tortfeasor outside of the protection of workers' compensation\" if not for the merger. <i>Id.</i> (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 152 &#167; 15 (1988 ed.)). Had the merger not occurred, plaintiffs would have been able to bring a third party suit against Dairy, the company that designed and supervised the manufacture of defective equipment for the decedent's then-employer, Cranberry. The <i>Gurry</i> court emphasized that \"the workers' compensation statute was intended to deal with injuries and liability occurring in the course of the employer-employee relationship.\" <i>Id.</i> Since a claim based on Dairy's conduct did not arise from an employment relationship, but \"from the negligence of an independent corporation,\" allowing it to go forward would not interfere with the purpose of the workers' compensation statute. The court concluded that \"insulat[ing] Cumberland from liability it acquired, as a result of its merger with Dairy[,] because [Cumberland] happened to be Kevin Gurry's employer, would subvert the important aims of both the workers' compensation system and the business corporation statute.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Braga's Employment Status</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that workers' compensation bars this suit because Braga was employed by Lightolier/APC during its \"brief existence.\" Braga's employment status during the three-day period from January 15-18, 1982 is the primary issue the parties address on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs argue that this question cannot be resolved as a matter of law but requires a detailed, fact-specific inquiry into the relationship between Braga and Lightolier/APC.

Gen. Laws ch. 156B, &#167; 80(a)(5). Despite the Bragas' hyperbolic claim that treating employees as assets that transfer by law upon merger means viewing them as \"chattels of the corporation,\" a corporation's employment contracts are counted among its assets. <i>See, e.g., Modis, Inc. v.</i> <i>Revolution Group, Ltd.,</i> 11 Mass.

Holliday v. Pers. Prods. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1511518\"><a href=\"/opinion/1511518/holliday-v-personal-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 405-07 (E.D.Pa.1996) (rejecting argument that workers' compensation immunity would not apply after employer's merger with third party tortfeasor unless employee consented to be employed by new corporate entity). If that were the law, employees of merging corporations would lose their jobs instantaneously upon a merger, absent some affirmative conduct showing that they now worked for the surviving corporation. Similarly, the employment status of those in otherwise identical positions would vary with their awareness of, and view toward, changes in corporate status that did not affect the conduct of their jobs in any way. None of the cases plaintiffs cite, however, supports such odd results. <i>See, e.g., Langevin's Case,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2207499\"><a href=\"/opinion/2207499/langevins-case/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2207499\"><a href=\"/opinion/2207499/langevins-case/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 921 (1950); <i>Abbott v.

Indeed, none even addresses the relevant question, namely, how a merger affects continuity of employment. We see no basis for holding that there was a gap in Braga's employment during the January 15-18, 1982, period. He simply continued as an employee of the corporate entity that succeeded his employer, first Lightolier/APC, then Lightolier/BZ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the question of whether Lightolier/APC employed Braga is not dispositive, but merely a red herring here. This can be seen by moving the analysis back one level, thus framing it in terms of the initial merger of Lightolier and APC (Braga's original employer) rather than the merger of Lightolier/APC and BZ Holdings three days later. Whether or not Lightolier/APC employed Braga during its three-day existence, Lightolier &#8212; which it succeeded&#8212;unquestionably never employed him. Since Lightolier owned the allegedly defective Press when it merged with Braga's then-employer, APC, Lightolier's merger with APC appears to raise the same liability issues that the Bragas claim are raised by Lightolier/APC's merger with BZ Holdings. But the mere fact that Lightolier did not employ Braga would not establish successorship liability. Lightolier/APC can inherit Lightolier's third-party liability only if such liability would have existed absent the merger. The plaintiffs in <i>Gurry</i> were able to sue the decedent's employer not merely because its predecessor, Dairy, had not employed him, but because Dairy \"<i>would have been susceptible to a third-party claim</i> as a tortfeasor outside of the protection of workers' compensation\" if not for the merger. 550 N.E.2d at 131 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The foregoing considered, the question we must answer is whether Lightolier \"would have been susceptible to a third-party claim\" but for the merger.

While the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts \"alluded favorably to the [dual persona] theory\" in <i>Gurry,</i> it has \"never explicitly adopted\" it, much less established its scope or set parameters for it. <i>Barrett v.

On the other hand, plaintiffs argue that Lightolier/APC is so distinct and separate from its successors that its \"transfer\" of the Press via merger created new duties and liabilities. The latter view is inconsistent not only with the former, but with the very nature of a corporate merger: \"[T]he consolidation of two or more corporations is like the uniting of two or more rivers, neither stream is annihilated, but all continue in existence.

The dissent noted that the inchoate tort liability the predecessor incurred after installation of the defective equipment for its own use was \"to anyone injured by the defect <i>other than an employee,</i> as to whom [workers'] compensation law immunized it from common-law liability.\" <i>Billy,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">879</span></span>, 412 N.E.2d at 942 (Meyer, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). The <i>Billy</i> dissent reasoned that the successor company inherited the predecessor's immunity from liability, including immunity from an employee's suit. As a result, the merger provided no basis for liability; it was not the equivalent of a sale or transfer of assets (with the concomitant legal obligations this would entail), and the act of merging itself did not, as a matter of law, create liability. <i>Id.</i> at 163-168, 432 N.Y.S.2d at 886-889, 412 N.E.2d at 942-44; <i>see id.</i> at 164, 432 N.Y.S.2d at 886, 412 N.E.2d at 942 (\"[E]ven under the most liberal application of the [dual persona] doctrine a manufacturer-employer is held protected by compensation immunity when the product was manufactured solely for his own use and not for distribution to the general public.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are persuaded that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts would adopt the reasoning of those courts that have declined to extend the dual persona theory to circumstances like those here. Lightolier purchased the Press for its own use. It did not sell the Press or allow non-employees to use it. (It is not even alleged to have modified the Press.) In the hypothetical world in which no merger occurred, the Press could have caused an injury for which plaintiff would have received workers' compensation only if he worked for Lightolier. <i>See supra</i> Part II.A. In such a case, plaintiff would obviously have no third-party claim. It is <i>the merger itself</i> on which plaintiff relies to stake his present claim. Allowing a merger to <i>increase,</i> rather than preserve, inchoate liability is not consistent with the policy of the workers' compensation act or the law of corporate successorship. We are reluctant to expand the dual persona theory to any application beyond that which Massachusetts has already approved, particularly since the policy reasons on which the <i>Gurry</i> court relied are not implicated here. We are even more reluctant where, as here, the better reasoned cases from other jurisdictions hold that such an expansion would not be warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To distinguish among the various Lightolier entities, we refer only to the original, pre-January 15, 1982, company as \"Lightolier.\" We refer to the corporation that existed from January 15-18, 1982, as \"Lightolier/APC,\" and to the post-January 18, 1982, entity as \"Lightolier/BZ.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As plaintiffs point out,<i>Gurry</i> cites <i>Billy</i> favorably.
