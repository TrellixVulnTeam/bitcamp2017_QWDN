ROSSITER,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                v.\n\n              JOHN E.

William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Richard C. Biller, with whom Goguen, McLaughlin, Richards &\nMahaney, LLP was on brief, for appellant.\n     Christopher R. Donato, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         January 27, 2004\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge.             This appeal involves a unique\n\nprovision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 621-634.   A federal employee or a disappointed applicant\n\nfor federal    employment   —   we    use    the   term   \"federal   employee\"\n\nthroughout this opinion as a shorthand to cover both classes of\n\npersons — who wishes to pursue an ADEA claim has a right, not\n\navailable to other ADEA claimants, to bypass the administrative\n\nprocess and go directly to a federal district court.                 See id. §\n\n633a(c)-(d).   The sole issue to be decided in this appeal concerns\n\nthe limitations period that applies to such actions.\n\n          The only appellate court to have addressed this issue\n\nthus far chose to borrow the limitations period used for Title VII\n\nactions. See Edwards v. Shalala, 64 F.3d 601, 606 (11th Cir. 1995)\n\n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 20000e-16(c)).             Reluctant though we are to\n\ncreate a circuit split, we part company with the Edwards court and\n\nhold that when a federal employee opts to bypass the administrative\n\nprocess and pursue an ADEA claim directly in the district court,\n\nthe applicable limitations period should be borrowed from the Fair\n\nLabor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. § 255(a). That period, which\n\nextends for at least two years from the date of the allegedly\n\ndiscriminatory act or practice, is longer than either the 90-day\n\nlimitations period contained in Title VII or the hybrid period\n\nfashioned by the lower court.        See Rossiter v. Potter, 257 F. Supp.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f2d 440, 445 (D. Mass. 2003).1         Accordingly, we reverse the order\n\ndismissing the plaintiff's complaint as time-barred and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                                      I.\n\n                                Background\n\n           Since this appeal deals primarily with matters of timing,\n\na thumbnail sketch of the facts will suffice.             We draw that sketch\n\nmindful that an appellate court reviews a dismissal for failure to\n\nstate a claim de novo, applying the same legal standards that bind\n\nthe trial court.     Banco Santander v. López-Stubbe (In re Colonial\n\nMortgage   Bankers   Corp.),    324    F.3d   12,    15   (1st   Cir.    2003).\n\nConsequently,   we   assume    the    truth   of    all   well-pleaded   facts\n\ncontained in the complaint and indulge all reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom to the plaintiff's behoof.          Id.\n\n           In or around 2000, plaintiff-appellant Paul Rossiter\n\nsought employment with the United States Postal Service (USPS).\n\nAfter passing the USPS's preliminary screens (including a written\n\nexamination and a drug test), Rossiter was interviewed by Steve\n\n\n     1\n      The district court, in a failed attempt to reconcile Edwards\nwith pertinent Supreme Court precedent, devised a complicated\nalgorithm. It concluded that \"the statute of limitations under the\nADEA for federal employees such as Rossiter who go directly to\nfederal court is the longer of (a) 120 days after filing notice\nwith the [Equal Employment Opportunity] Commission (the statutory\nthirty-day waiting period plus Title VII's ninety-day limitations\nperiod) or (b) one year and six days after the alleged\ndiscriminatory incident, pursuant to the Supreme Court's statement\nin Stevens [v. Dep't of Treasury, 500 U.S. 1 (1991)].\" Rossiter,\n257 F. Supp. 2d at 445.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fFroio,   a   USPS    hierarch.        Although    Rossiter       had    20    years   of\n\nexperience    in     the    service   industry,       the    USPS   refrained     from\n\ncontacting any of his references.                This did not bode well for\n\nRossiter's prospects, and in early January he received a letter\n\nstating that he would not be hired.\n\n             Rossiter pursued the matter.             On January 29, 2001, Froio\n\ntold him that he had been rejected because he seemed nervous during\n\nthe interview.        Froio added that \"[i]f [Rossiter] were 20 years\n\nyounger, being nervous would have been acceptable.\"                     When Rossiter\n\nsuggested that he was being denied employment on account of his\n\nage, Froio replied:         \"It didn't help you any.\"           Rossiter requested\n\nthat his application be reconsidered, but Froio told him that\n\nreconsideration       was     impracticable      as    no    more   positions     were\n\navailable.     Less than ten days later, however, Rossiter received\n\ncorrespondence announcing that the USPS was still seeking to hire\n\npeople in the job category for which he had unsuccessfully applied.\n\n             At age 46, Rossiter was a member of the class protected\n\nby the ADEA.      See 29 U.S.C. § 633a(a).            Convinced that he had been\n\ndenied employment by reason of age discrimination, he contacted the\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in mid-February.\n\nFollowing    an     initial    meeting,   Rossiter          submitted    an   informal\n\ncomplaint. He later agreed to participate in mediation, which took\n\nplace on May 21, 2001.          Nothing was resolved.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f           On July 26, 2001, Rossiter filed a notice of intent to\n\nsue with the EEOC.    From that point forward, the matter lay fallow\n\nuntil November 28, 2002.    Rossiter then filed a civil action in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\n\nagainst the Postmaster General and the USPS.          In it, he alleged\n\nviolations of the ADEA and its state counterpart, Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 151B, § 4(1).     The defendants (collectively, the government)\n\nmoved to dismiss the action, arguing (i) that the state-law claim\n\nwas preempted by the ADEA, and (ii) that the ADEA claim was time-\n\nbarred.\n\n           Rossiter did not contest the preemption argument, and the\n\ndistrict court dismissed the state-law claim.               Rossiter's ADEA\n\nclaim proved to be a knottier problem.         The district court took\n\nthis aspect of the case under advisement and ultimately ruled, in\n\na written rescript, that the claim was time-barred.           Rossiter, 257\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 445.    This appeal ensued.\n\n                                    II.\n\n                                 Discussion\n\n           The path that we must travel has been well-marked.          When\n\nCongress creates a cause of action but is silent as to the\n\nlimitations period that should apply to the right created — as is\n\nthe case in 29 U.S.C. § 633a — the judicial task is to borrow the\n\nmost   appropriate   rule   of   timeliness   from   some    other   source.\n\nDelCostello v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 158 (1983).\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fAfter careful review of the evolution of the ADEA and its various\n\nenforcement schemes, we conclude that the FLSA provides the most\n\nanalogous rule of timeliness for ADEA actions brought by federal\n\nemployees who opt to bypass the administrative process.\n\n                                       A.\n\n                    A Guide to the Statutory Scheme\n\n            Every journey is best understood if it begins with a\n\nroadmap.      Congress passed the ADEA with a view toward ending\n\nworkplace discrimination based on age.            As originally enacted in\n\n1967, the statute reached only private employers.            See Pub. L. No.\n\n90-202, § 11(b), 81 Stat. 602 (1967); see also Lehman v. Nakshian,\n\n453 U.S. 156, 166 (1981).          Seven years later, Congress elongated\n\nthe ADEA's reach to include governmental employers (federal, state,\n\nand local).    See Pub. L. No. 93-259, § 28, 88 Stat. 55 (1974); see\n\nalso Nakshian, 453 U.S. at 166.          To accomplish this augmentation,\n\nCongress broadened the ADEA's stock definition of \"employer\" to\n\ninclude    state   and    local    governments,   thereby   subjecting   such\n\nemployers to the enforcement mechanisms contained in the general\n\nstatutory scheme.        See Pub. L. No. 93-259, § 28(a)(2), 88 Stat. 55\n\n(1974); see also Nakshian, 453 U.S. at 166.             Federal employers,\n\nhowever, were treated differently:           they were added in an entirely\n\nnew and distinct statutory section — one that contained its own\n\nenforcement mechanisms.           See Fair Labor Standards Amendments of\n\n1974, Pub. L. No. 93-259, § 28(b), 88 Stat. 74, codified at 29\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fU.S.C. § 633a; see also Nakshian, 453 U.S. at 166.           This dichotomy\n\npersists.\n\n            The general provisions of the ADEA (applicable to private\n\nemployers and to state and local governments) originally embodied\n\nan enforcement scheme that resembled the FLSA's.              See Lavery v.\n\nMarsh,   918   F.2d   1022,   1024   (1st   Cir.   1990).     This   included\n\nincorporation of the FLSA's statute of limitations.             29 U.S.C. §\n\n626(e) (amended 1991) (incorporating by reference 29 U.S.C. § 255).\n\nThe FLSA model set a limitations period of two years after the date\n\nof injury for general violations and three years for willful\n\nviolations.    See id. § 255(a).\n\n            In 1991, Congress removed the FLSA's incorporated statute\n\nof limitations from this portion of the ADEA and inserted a\n\nlimitations scheme akin to that governing Title VII actions.              See\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, § 115, 105 Stat.\n\n1071, 1079, codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. § 626(e).           Under this\n\nreconstructed framework, there is no external requirement that a\n\nfederal civil action predicated on an ADEA violation be filed\n\nwithin a specified time following the date of the discriminatory\n\nact or practice; rather, the applicable timing requirements relate\n\nto, and derive from, the administrative process.            An employee must\n\nfile an administrative complaint within 180 days of the alleged\n\ndiscrimination in order to preserve his or her claim.            29 U.S.C. §\n\n626(d)(1).     This filing vivifies the administrative process, and\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fthe date of injury has no further bearing on the question of\n\ntimeliness. The applicable limitations period begins to run at the\n\nend of the administrative process:        from that point, the employee\n\nhas 90 days within which to bring suit.        Id. § 626(e).\n\n           The legislative scheme for ADEA claims brought by federal\n\nemployees is materially different. Congress provided dual means of\n\nenforcement for federal workers and left the choice between them to\n\nthe claimant.     On the one hand, a federal employee may invoke the\n\nEEOC's administrative process and thereafter file suit if he or she\n\nis   dissatisfied   with   the   administrative   outcome.     See id. §\n\n633a(b)-(c); see also Stevens v. Dep't of Treasury, 500 U.S. 1, 5\n\n(1991).    On the other hand, a federal employee may bypass the\n\nadministrative process altogether and file a civil action directly\n\nin the federal district court.       See 29 U.S.C. § 633a(c)-(d); see\n\nalso Stevens, 500 U.S. at 6.      In that event, the only preconditions\n\nare (i) that \"no civil action may be commenced by any individual\n\nunder this section until the individual has given the [EEOC] not\n\nless than thirty days' notice of an intent to file such action,\"\n\nand (ii) that \"[s]uch notice shall be filed within one hundred and\n\neighty days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred.\"            29\n\nU.S.C. § 633a(d); see Stevens, 500 U.S. at 6-7 (reaffirming these\n\npreconditions).\n\n           The bottom line is that the hand-painted section of the\n\nADEA limning the rights of federal employees contains no express\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fstatute of limitations.       Indeed, that section says nothing about\n\nthe outside date for the filing of suit (regardless of whether an\n\nemployee has elected to undergo or to bypass the administrative\n\nprocess).   Courts have been left to intuit the rules of timeliness\n\napplicable to such ADEA actions, and those rules must be borrowed\n\nfrom an exogenous source.     See Stevens, 500 U.S. at 7.      Devising an\n\nappropriate limitations period is rarely easy — and here, the\n\nduality of the means of enforcement exacerbates the difficulty of\n\nthe task.\n\n                                    B.\n\n        ADEA Bypass Actions:      Why Title VII's Limitations\n\n                          Period Does Not Fit\n\n            The   borrowing   equation   differs   in   each   of   the   two\n\nconfigurations that Congress has provided.          In cases in which a\n\nfederal employee opts for the administrative process, courts —\n\nincluding this one — have most often agreed that the Title VII\n\nlimitations period is the most analogous and, therefore, have\n\nelected to import it.     See, e.g., Burzynski v. Cohen, 264 F.3d 611,\n\n619 (6th Cir. 2001); Jones v. Runyon, 32 F.3d 1454, 1456 (10th Cir.\n\n1994); Long v. Frank, 22 F.3d 54, 56 (2d Cir. 1994); Lavery, 918\n\nF.2d at 1027.     But see Lubniewski v. Lehman, 891 F.2d 216, 221 (9th\n\nCir. 1989) (applying six-year limitations period borrowed from 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2401(a)).     This importation makes good sense because when\n\na federal employee elects to enter the administrative process, the\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fADEA and Title VII enforcement schemes are homologous.             Moreover,\n\nin such a situation the federal employee is pursuing essentially\n\nthe   same   route     that   Congress   has   prescribed   for   non-federal\n\nemployees, and, thus, there is every reason to borrow a compatible\n\nrule of timeliness.\n\n             This relatively straightforward answer does not resolve\n\nthe materially different question of where to derive an appropriate\n\nrule of timeliness when a federal employee elects to bypass the\n\nadministrative process and file an ADEA suit directly in the\n\ndistrict     court.2     In   that   situation,   Stevens   forecloses    the\n\nimportation of Title VII's limitations period. We explain briefly.\n\n             In Stevens, the Supreme Court observed that the statutory\n\nprovision authorizing the bypass option, 29 U.S.C. § 633a(d),\n\n\"calls for a notice of not less than 30 days to the [EEOC] of an\n\nintent to sue,\" and \"that the notice shall be filed with the [EEOC]\n\nwithin 180 days of the alleged unlawful practice.\"            500 U.S. at 6.\n\n\n      2\n      Lavery does not assist in answering this question. Although\nwe held there that Title VII's statute of limitations should be\napplied to ADEA actions against federal employers, the case\ninvolved an employee who had elected to undergo the administrative\nprocess. See Lavery, 918 F.2d at 1022-23 (\"We are asked to decide\n. . . what period of limitations following a final agency decision\napplies to an action alleging age discrimination brought by a\nfederal employee pursuant to the [ADEA].\") (emphasis supplied). In\nall events, the Supreme Court decided Stevens after Lavery, and the\nrationale of Stevens precludes us from applying Lavery to bypass\ncases.    See text infra.     By like token, Stevens effectively\nabrogated our earlier decision in Castro v. United States, 775 F.2d\n399, 403 (1st Cir. 1985) (per curiam), insofar as that decision\npertains to the interpretation of the ADEA's temporal requirements.\nSee Stevens, 500 U.S. at 7.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fFinding these two requirements satisfied, the Court asked whether\n\nthere were any other bases upon which the suit could be considered\n\ntime-barred.          Id. at 7.        Noting that the \"statute does not\n\nexpressly impose any additional limitations period for a complaint\n\nof   age    discrimination,\"      the    Justices    concluded        that   Congress\n\nintended that an appropriate limitations period should be borrowed\n\nfrom state or federal law.             Id.   Although poised to decide which\n\nrule of timeliness should be borrowed for use in connection with 29\n\nU.S.C.      §    633a(c)-(d),    the    Court   refrained      from    making       that\n\ndecision.         It explained that there was no need to decide the\n\nquestion because Stevens had filed his suit one year and six days\n\nafter the allegedly discriminatory event — an interval that was\n\n\"well within whatever statute of limitations might apply to the\n\naction.\"        Id. at 8 (quoting respondents' brief).\n\n                We think that this decision can only be read as a\n\ndefinitive rejection of the importation of Title VII's limitations\n\nperiod into the framework established by 29 U.S.C. § 633a(c)-(d).\n\nWe base this conclusion on two principal lines of reasoning.\n\nFirst, the entire focus of the Stevens Court's inquiry was on the\n\ndate   of       the   alleged   discrimination      as   the   accrual       date   for\n\nlimitations purposes.           Under Title VII, the relevant date would\n\nhave borne some relation to final agency action, or at least to the\n\nexpiration of the 30-day notice period.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f           Second — and perhaps more important — if Title VII's\n\ntemporal   requirements   were    to   be   applied   to   bypass   actions,\n\nStevens's claim would have been time-barred.               Stevens served a\n\nnotice of intent to sue on October 19, 1987, and filed suit on May\n\n3, 1988.   Stevens, 500 U.S. at 4.      Were Title VII to be the source\n\nof the borrowing, a federal employee who elected to bypass the\n\nadministrative process would have no more than 120 days from the\n\nfiling of his notice within which to commence a civil action.           See\n\nEdwards, 64 F.3d at 605-06 (finding that Title VII's limitations\n\nperiod would begin to run no later than the expiration of the 30-\n\nday waiting period following the filing of a notice of intent to\n\nsue);   Rossiter, 257 F. Supp. 2d at 445 (same).              Since Stevens\n\nstarted suit more than 120 days after he filed his notice of intent\n\nto sue, the Supreme Court could not have found his suit timely\n\nunless it rejected the proposed incorporation of Title VII's\n\nlimitations period into the ADEA's bypass scheme.\n\n           To be sure, the government resists this conclusion.           It\n\nsuggests that the Court's comment — that Stevens's suit had been\n\nbrought \"well within whatever statute of limitations might apply,\"\n\n500 U.S. at 8 — was mere dictum and that, in all events, the point\n\nwas never fully litigated.       We reject these importunings.\n\n           First and foremost, when a statement in a judicial\n\ndecision is essential to the result reached in the case, it becomes\n\npart of the court's holding.       See Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fU.S. 44, 66-67 (1996) (defining as binding both the court's result\n\nand \"those portions of the opinion necessary to that result\").\n\nConsequently, the Stevens Court's statement was not dictum.3\n\n              We also dismiss the government's attempt to sidestep\n\nStevens on the basis that the statute of limitations issue was\n\nnever fully litigated.       That asseveration depends on the premise\n\nthat the Court's statement that Stevens's suit had been brought\n\n\"well within whatever statute of limitations might apply to the\n\naction,\" 500 U.S. at 8, was merely a recitation of the government's\n\nconcession.       That premise is faulty.           Although the government\n\naccepted Stevens's position on the question, the Supreme Court did\n\nnot stop there but chose to decide the issue, recognizing that a\n\nfinal       determination   was   essential    to     the   outcome   of   the\n\nlitigation.4      See 500 U.S. at 7-8.        In other words, the Supreme\n\nCourt resolved that the limitations issue was properly before it —\n\nand we decline to second-guess the legal effect of that resolution.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We hasten to add that even if one were to categorize the\nCourt's statement as dictum — a proposition to which we do not\nsubscribe — that categorization would not shift our view.       See\nMcCoy v. MIT, 950 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1991) (concluding that\n\"federal appellate courts are bound by the Supreme Court's\nconsidered dicta almost as firmly as by the Court's outright\nholdings, particularly when . . . a dictum is of recent vintage and\nnot enfeebled by any subsequent statement\").\n        4\n      In point of fact, the government's only ground of opposition\nin Stevens was that the Court should not hear the case, and, thus,\nthe Court's choice to decide the merits is telling.\n\n                                    -13-\n\f            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — sound\n\npolicy considerations support the result reached by the Stevens\n\nCourt.    Title VII's limitations period is entirely derivative of,\n\nand dictated by, the administrative process.                     The limitations\n\nperiod   begins   to    run   upon    final   agency      action.     The   bypass\n\nprocedure, however, is a horse of a vastly different hue.                       See\n\nBurnett v. Grattan, 468 U.S. 42, 50-51 (1984) (discussing how going\n\nthrough an administrative process differs from filing a claim\n\ndirectly in     court   and    noting,    inter    alia,    that    borrowing    an\n\nadministrative     statute     of    limitations    for    use   in   the   latter\n\nsituation ignores the congressional determination that the claim\n\nbelongs in court).      Because bypass actions involve no final agency\n\naction, it would be anomalous to impress them with a Title VII-like\n\nrule of timeliness.\n\n            The government attempts to parry this thrust by noting\n\nthat the EEOC must receive notice of a federal employee's intent to\n\nsue in a bypass case.         That is indisputably true, see 29 U.S.C. §\n\n633a(d), but it is beside the point.               This notice is a one-time\n\nevent    that   bears   no    real   resemblance     to    the   processing     and\n\nresolution of an administrative complaint.                In a traditional ADEA\n\ncase, the administrative process, once begun, takes center stage\n\nuntil an administrative outcome is reached. By that time, the case\n\nis likely to be fully developed.              Permitting a short window of\n\nopportunity within which to file suit makes sense when that window\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\ffollows a final agency determination.    In that context, the short\n\nwindow of time is actually more like a right to appeal than a\n\nstatute of limitations — and rights of appeal often have a severely\n\nlimited shelf life.    See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a) (delineating a\n\n30-day appeal period); Sup. Ct. R. 13 (requiring petitions for\n\ncertiorari to be filed within 90 days after judgment); Fed. R.\n\nBankr. P. 8002 (requiring generally that a notice of appeal be\n\nfiled within ten days of a bankruptcy court order).   Moreover, the\n\nadministrative process is often lengthy and, thus, starting the\n\nlimitations period from the date of injury would run the risk of\n\nallowing the expiration of the time for suit despite best efforts\n\non the employee's part.\n\n            These justifications are utterly absent in ADEA bypass\n\ncases.     There is no required agency action and no persuasive\n\nrationale for linking a rule of timeliness to the time of agency\n\nnotification.     Viewed holistically, bypass cases are more like\n\ntraditional civil suits, in which limitations periods begin to run\n\nat the time of the injury. We think it is hardly coincidental that\n\nthis is the precise locus on which the Stevens Court focused.\n\n            Edwards does not persuade us to the opposite view.\n\nThere, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the applicable\n\nlimitations period for ADEA actions brought pursuant to section\n\n633a(c)-(d) should be imported from Title VII. Edwards, 64 F.3d at\n\n606.     Although the panel paid lip service to Stevens, it nowhere\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fexplained how the result that it reached was permissible under\n\nStevens.    Because we do not see any principled way to square\n\nEdwards    with   Stevens,   we   regard   the   Edwards   decision   as\n\nfundamentally flawed and respectfully decline to follow it.5\n\n                                   C.\n\n   ADEA Bypass Actions:      What Limitations Period Should Apply\n\n           Having determined that Title VII does not furnish the\n\napplicable rule of timeliness for ADEA bypass actions, we are left\n\nwith the question of what limitations period should apply.            The\n\ninquiry that we must undertake requires us to determine, first,\n\nwhether a federal or state rule of timeliness should be imported.\n\nSee Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assocs., Inc., 483 U.S.\n\n143, 147 (1987). Given both the longstanding practice of borrowing\n\nstate periods of limitations when federal rights-creating statutes\n\ncontain no built-in timeliness rules and Congress's awareness of\n\nthat practice, courts ought generally to assume that Congress\n\nintends by its silence that state law be borrowed.         Id.   But this\n\nis a default rule — a \"fallback rule of thumb,\" DelCostello, 462\n\nU.S. at 158 n.12 — not a hard-and-fast mandate. See Communications\n\n\n\n     5\n      Without exception, the cases cited by the Edwards court in\nsupport of importing Title VII's limitations period into the\nframework of section 633a(c)-(d) are inapposite.     All of them\ninvolve federal employees who opted to undergo the administrative\nprocess. See, e.g., Jones, 32 F.3d at 1455; Long, 22 F.3d at 55-\n56; Lavery, 918 F.2d at 1023.       As we explained above, the\nlimitations period applicable to \"administrative process\" cases\nsimply cannot be transplanted blindly into the bypass scheme.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fWorkers of Am. v. Western Elec. Co., 860 F.2d 1137, 1139 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (explaining that \"the glance in the direction of the state-\n\nlaw cupboard should not be an automatic or reflexive one\").               That\n\ndefault rule must give way \"when a rule from elsewhere in federal\n\nlaw   clearly   provides    a    closer    analogy   than   available   state\n\nstatutes,    and   when    the   federal    policies   at   stake   and    the\n\npracticalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more\n\nappropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.\" Del Costello, 462\n\nU.S. at 172; accord Agency Holding Corp., 483 U.S. at 147-48.             This\n\nis such a case.\n\n            The closest analogy to an ADEA bypass action logically is\n\nto be found in anti-discrimination or employment legislation.\n\nAlthough there are a myriad of federal statutes that fall under\n\nthose rubrics, most of them require exhaustion of an administrative\n\nprocess as a precondition to court action.           See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e-5(e)(1) & (f)(1) (Title VII); id. § 12117 (Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act).    This renders their rules of timeliness useless\n\nfor our purpose:    after all, the search for the most analogous rule\n\nof timeliness places a high premium on both parallel enforcement\n\nstructures and congruent statutory goals. See Burnett, 468 U.S. at\n\n49-50. The same disqualifier negates the possible use of a network\n\nof state anti-discrimination statutes as a source for borrowed\n\nrules of timeliness.       See id. at 51 (noting that \"some 30 states\"\n\nhave administrative remedies modeled after Title VII).\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f            Of   course,   analogies   need   not   be   \"perfect,\"   Agency\n\nHolding Corp., 483 U.S. at 147, and the search for an appropriate\n\nstate-law analogue leads naturally to a consideration of rules of\n\ntimeliness generally applicable to claims for personal injury.           On\n\nreflection, however, this seems an unsatisfactory alternative. One\n\nconcern is that these statutes tend to be very general and, thus,\n\nfurnish only a loose fit for ADEA bypass actions.          Another concern\n\narises out of the existence and availability of a more sharply\n\nfocused federal analogue.6        See Norman J. Singer, Statutes and\n\nStatutory Construction 702 (2003 rev. ed.) (\"When two or more\n\nstatutes of limitations deal with the same subject matter, the\n\nstatute which is more recent and specific will prevail over the\n\nolder and more general one.\").\n\n            Our chief concern, however, is that the importation of\n\nstate rules of timeliness into the framework established for ADEA\n\nbypass   actions     would     \"frustrate     or    interfere    with   the\n\nimplementation of national policies.\"         Occidental Life Ins. Co. v.\n\nEEOC, 432 U.S. 355, 367 (1977).        That concern reflects two basic\n\npremises.    First, because section 633a applies only to federal\n\nemployers, the interest in uniformity is manifest.           We think that\n\nthis interest matters.       See Board of Regents v. Tomanio, 446 U.S.\n\n\n     6\n      Although not dispositive, we find it compelling that not one\ncourt of appeals to have considered what limitations period to\nborrow in an ADEA action against a federal employer has imported a\nstate rule of decision. See, e.g., Jones, 32 F.3d at 1455; Lavery,\n918 F.2d at 1025.\n\n                                   -18-\n\f478, 489 (1980) (observing that uniformity is \"a federal policy\n\nwhich sometimes necessitates the displacement of an otherwise\n\napplicable state rule of law\"); see also Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S.\n\n14, 23-24 (1980) (creating a federal common law of survivorship\n\nrights for use in actions brought under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named\n\nAgents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), based on the need for uniformity and\n\nnoting that \"uniformity cannot be achieved if courts are limited to\n\n. . . state law\").7\n\n          Courts might have to swallow hard and tolerate these\n\nseveral concerns if state law were the only source reasonably\n\navailable for borrowing.    DelCostello, 462 U.S. at 169.    Here,\n\nhowever, that is not the case. Having considered and discarded the\n\nfull range of alternatives, we believe that the FLSA, a federal\n\nstatute, offers the closest analogy to ADEA bypass actions (and,\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      We note that courts generally have applied state statutes of\nlimitations to Bivens actions notwithstanding the fact that such\nactions lie only against federal officers. See, e.g., Polanco v.\nU.S. DEA, 158 F.3d 647, 653 (2d Cir. 1998); Delgado-Brunet v.\nClark, 93 F.3d 339, 342 (7th Cir. 1996); Matthews v. Macanas, 990\nF.2d 467, 468 (9th Cir. 1993).       But ADEA bypass actions are\ndistinguishable from Bivens actions for a variety of reasons.\nFirst, the ADEA has been interpreted to preempt state causes of\naction for age discrimination in employment. See, e.g., Britt v.\nGrocers Supply Co., 978 F.2d 1441, 1448 (5th Cir. 1992).         We\nbelieve that this fact        evinces Congress's preference for\nuniformity of application.     Second, Bivens is a court-created\nremedy that serves as an analogue to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. It would\nmake little sense to apply different limitations periods to section\n1983 claims and Bivens claims, both of which are \"constitutional\ntort\" actions that allow vindication of personal interests. See\nPolanco, 158 F.3d at 653.\n\n                               -19-\n\fthus, constitutes the most appropriate source for borrowing a rule\n\nof timeliness).\n\n          The FLSA's goals are congruent with the ADEA's: like the\n\nADEA, the FLSA was designed to protect individual workers.                  See\n\nBarrentine v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 450 U.S. 728, 739\n\n(1981).   The FLSA's enforcement mechanism also parallels the\n\nenforcement mechanism characteristic of ADEA bypass actions, that\n\nis, it creates private rights of action that do not depend upon a\n\nregime of administrative enforcement.           See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. §\n\n216(b).   Moreover, the FLSA's limitations period is designed to\n\naccommodate a balance of interests similar to those at stake in\n\nADEA bypass actions.     The importance of this fact is obvious.            See\n\nDelCostello, 462 U.S. at 169. And, finally, we deem it significant\n\nthat the very act that expanded the ADEA to include federal\n\nemployees was cast in the form of an amendment to the FLSA.            These\n\nconsiderations    lead   us   to   conclude   that   borrowing   a   rule    of\n\ntimeliness from the FLSA is the preferred course — and one that is\n\nentirely consistent with the congressional design.\n\n          To cinch matters, sound policy also supports resort to\n\nthe FLSA's limitations period.        A two-year statute of limitations8\n\n\n\n     8\n      In point of fact, the FLSA has a bifurcated limitations\nperiod. The basic period is two years. 29 U.S.C. § 255(a). This\nperiod can, however, be extended for an additional year if the\ncause of action arises out of a willful violation. Id. The case\nat bar does not require us to decide when, if ever, the latter\nperiod might apply in an ADEA bypass action.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fin no way undermines the salient interests served by timeliness\n\nrules in federal anti-discrimination laws, which are meant to\n\n\"protect employers from the burden of defending claims arising from\n\nemployment decisions that are long past.\"         Delaware State Coll. v.\n\nRicks, 449 U.S. 250, 256-57 (1980).          In a bypass case, a federal\n\nemployee must give notice of intent to sue within 180 days of the\n\nallegedly discriminatory act or practice, 29 U.S.C. § 633a(d), and\n\nthe federal employer thus will have an opportunity to investigate\n\nthe claim and preserve relevant records.         We hold, therefore, that\n\nthe FLSA's rule of timeliness, 29 U.S.C. § 255(a), is the correct\n\nrule of timeliness to apply to ADEA actions in which a federal\n\nemployee has elected to bypass the administrative process.\n\n           There is one loose end. As the government reminds us, 29\n\nU.S.C. §   633a(f)   says     that   personnel   actions   of    any   federal\n\nemployer to which section 633a applies should not be \"subject to,\n\nor affected by, any provision of this chapter.\"                   This is a\n\npotential obstacle to our holding because, at the time that section\n\n633a(f) was added, see Pub. L. No. 95-256, § 5(e), 92 Stat. 191\n\n(1978), the FLSA's limitations period applied, by statute, to the\n\nmine-run of ADEA cases, see 29 U.S.C. § 626(e) (amended 1991).\n\nWith this in mind, the suggestion is that section 633a(f) should be\n\nconstrued to preclude application of the FLSA's rule of timeliness.\n\n           This   reasoning    is    both   convoluted   and    disingenuous.\n\nAlthough it is true that section 633a(f) makes clear that federal\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\femployers are only bound by the specific provisions of section\n\n633a, looking to the FLSA to borrow a rule of timeliness in no way\n\ncompromises that principle.           The FLSA's statute of limitations is\n\nno   longer     applicable      to    ADEA     litigation   involving        private\n\nemployers.       Consequently,        our    choice   to    import     the   FLSA's\n\ntimeliness rule into the framework of ADEA bypass actions does not\n\nimplicate any other provision of the ADEA.              We merely refer to an\n\nanalogous statutory scheme to fill a void that must be filled\n\n(i.e., to determine the appropriate limitations period for use in\n\nbypass actions).       This is an exercise in statutory interpretation,\n\nnot an application of forbidden provisions to the case at hand.                   In\n\nthe last analysis, then, section 633a(f) has no bearing on our\n\nimportation decision.\n\n                                        III.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n             We need go no further.           To reiterate, we hold that the\n\ncorrect rule of timeliness to be used in conjunction with bypass\n\nactions brought under 29 U.S.C. § 633a is the FLSA's limitations\n\nperiod.    Applying this rule to Rossiter's ADEA claim, we find that\n\nhis suit — filed one year and ten months after the occurrence of\n\nthe allegedly discriminatory act — is timely.               See Ricks, 449 U.S.\n\nat 258-59 (holding that the appropriate focus in determining the\n\nstarting      point    of   a    limitations      period    in    an    employment\n\ndiscrimination        action    is   the    communication    of   the    allegedly\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fdiscriminatory decision); Morris v.

Potter,</i> 257 F.Supp.2d 440, 445 (D.Mass.2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Accordingly, we reverse the order dismissing the plaintiff's complaint as time-barred and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this appeal deals primarily with matters of timing, a thumbnail sketch of the facts will suffice.

After passing the USPS's preliminary screens (including a written examination and a drug test), Rossiter was interviewed by Steve Froio, a USPS hierarch. Although Rossiter had 20 years of experience in the service industry, the USPS refrained from contacting any of his references. This did not bode well for Rossiter's prospects, and in early January he received a letter stating that he would not be hired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rossiter pursued the matter. On January 29, 2001, Froio told him that he had been rejected because he seemed nervous during the interview. Froio added that \"[i]f [Rossiter] were 20 years younger, being nervous would have been acceptable.\" When Rossiter suggested that he was being denied employment on account of his age, Froio replied: \"It didn't help you any.\" Rossiter requested that his application be reconsidered, but Froio told him that reconsideration was impracticable as no more positions were available. Less than ten days later, however, Rossiter received correspondence announcing that the USPS was still seeking to hire people in the job category for which he had unsuccessfully applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At age 46, Rossiter was a member of the class protected by the ADEA. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(a). Convinced that he had been denied employment by reason of age discrimination, he contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in mid-February. Following an initial meeting, Rossiter submitted an informal complaint. He later agreed to participate in mediation, which took place on May 21, 2001. Nothing was resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 2001, Rossiter filed a notice of intent to sue with the EEOC. From that point forward, the matter lay fallow until November 28, 2002. Rossiter then filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Postmaster General and the USPS. In it, he alleged violations of the ADEA and its state counterpart, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1). The defendants (collectively, the government) moved to dismiss the action, arguing (i) that the state-law claim was preempted by the ADEA, and (ii) that the ADEA claim was time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rossiter did not contest the preemption argument, and the district court dismissed the state-law claim. Rossiter's ADEA claim proved to be a knottier problem. The district court took this aspect of the case under advisement and ultimately ruled, in a written rescript, that the claim was time-barred. <i>Rossiter,</i> 257 F.Supp.2d at 445.

When Congress creates a cause of action but is silent as to the limitations period that should apply to the right created &#8212; as is the case in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a &#8212; the judicial task is to borrow the most appropriate rule of timeliness from some other source. <i>DelCostello v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters,</i> 462 U.S. 151, 158, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983). After careful review of the evolution of the ADEA and its various enforcement schemes, we conclude that the FLSA provides the most analogous rule of timeliness for ADEA actions brought by federal employees who opt to bypass the administrative process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A Guide to the Statutory Scheme</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every journey is best understood if it begins with a roadmap. Congress passed the ADEA with a view toward ending workplace discrimination based on age. As originally enacted in 1967, the statute reached only private employers. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 90-202, &#167; 11(b), 81 Stat. 602 (1967); <i>see also Lehman v. Nakshian,</i> 453 U.S. 156, 166, 101 S.Ct. 2698, 69 L.Ed.2d 548 (1981). Seven years later, Congress elongated the ADEA's reach to include governmental employers (federal, state, and local). <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 93-259, &#167; 28, 88 Stat. 55 (1974); <i>see also Nakshian,</i> 453 U.S. at 166, 101 S.Ct. 2698. To accomplish this augmentation, Congress broadened the ADEA's stock definition of \"employer\" to include state and local governments, thereby subjecting such employers to the enforcement mechanisms contained in the general statutory scheme. <i>See</i> Pub.L. No. 93-259, &#167; 28(a)(2), 88 Stat. 55 (1974); <i>see also Nakshian,</i> 453 U.S. at 166, 101 S.Ct. 2698. Federal employers, however, were treated differently: they were added in an entirely new and distinct statutory section &#8212; one that contained its own enforcement mechanisms. <i>See</i> Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-259, &#167; 28(b), 88 Stat. 74, <i>codified at</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a; <i>see also Nakshian,</i> 453 U.S. at 166, 101 S.Ct. 2698. This dichotomy persists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general provisions of the ADEA (applicable to private employers and to state and local governments) originally embodied an enforcement scheme that resembled the FLSA's. <i>See Lavery v. Marsh,</i> 918 F.2d 1022, 1024 (1st Cir.1990). This included incorporation of the FLSA's statute of limitations. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(e) (amended 1991) (incorporating by reference 29 U.S.C. &#167; 255). The FLSA model set a limitations period of two years after the date of injury for general violations and three years for willful violations. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 255(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, Congress removed the FLSA's incorporated statute of limitations from this portion of the ADEA and inserted a limitations scheme akin to that governing Title VII actions. <i>See</i> Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, &#167; 115, 105 Stat. 1071, 1079, <i>codified as amended at</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(e). Under this reconstructed framework, there is no external requirement that a federal civil action predicated on an ADEA violation be filed within a specified time following the date of the discriminatory act or practice; rather, the applicable timing requirements relate to, and derive from, the administrative process. An employee must file an administrative complaint within 180 days of the alleged discrimination in order to preserve his or her claim. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(d)(1). This filing vivifies the administrative process, and the date of injury has no further bearing on the question of timeliness. The applicable limitations period begins to run at the end of the administrative process: from that point, the employee has 90 days within which to bring suit. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 626(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative scheme for ADEA claims brought by federal employees is materially different. Congress provided dual means of enforcement for federal workers and left the choice between them to the claimant. On the one hand, a federal employee may invoke the EEOC's administrative process and thereafter file suit if he or she is dissatisfied with the administrative outcome. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 633a(b)-(c); <i>see also Stevens v. Dep't of Treasury,</i> 500 U.S. 1, 5, 111 S.Ct. 1562, 114 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991). On the other hand, a federal employee may bypass the administrative process altogether and file a civil action directly in the federal district court. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(c)-(d); <i>see also Stevens,</i> 500 U.S. at 6, 111 S.Ct. 1562. In that event, the only preconditions are (i) that \"no civil action may be commenced by any individual under this section until the individual has given the [EEOC] not less than thirty days' notice of an intent to file such action,\" and (ii) that \"[s]uch notice shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful practice occurred.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(d); <i>see Stevens,</i> 500 U.S. at 6-7, 111 S.Ct. 1562 (reaffirming these preconditions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that the hand-painted section of the ADEA limning the rights of federal employees contains no express statute of limitations. Indeed, that section says nothing about the outside date for the filing of suit (regardless of whether an employee has elected to undergo or to bypass the administrative process). Courts have been left to intuit the rules of timeliness applicable to such ADEA actions, and those rules must be borrowed from an exogenous source. <i>See Stevens,</i> 500 U.S. at 7, 111 S.Ct. 1562. Devising an appropriate limitations period is rarely easy &#8212; and here, the duality of the means of enforcement exacerbates the difficulty of the task.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>ADEA Bypass Actions: Why Title VII's Limitations Period Does Not Fit</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The borrowing equation differs in each of the two configurations that Congress has provided. In cases in which a federal employee opts for the administrative process, courts &#8212; including this one &#8212; have most often agreed that the Title VII limitations period is the most analogous and, therefore, have elected to import it. <i>See, e.g., Burzynski v. Cohen,</i> 264 F.3d 611, 619 (6th Cir.2001); <i>Jones v. Runyon,</i> 32 F.3d 1454, 1456 (10th Cir.1994); <i>Long v. Frank,</i> 22 F.3d 54, 56 (2d Cir.1994); <i>Lavery,</i> 918 F.2d at 1027. <i>But see Lubniewski v. Lehman,</i> 891 F.2d 216, 221 (9th Cir.1989) (applying six-year limitations period borrowed from 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2401(a)). This importation makes good sense because when a federal employee elects to enter the administrative process, the ADEA and Title VII enforcement schemes are homologous. Moreover, in such a situation the federal employee is pursuing essentially the same route that Congress has prescribed for non-federal employees, and, thus, there is every reason to borrow a compatible rule of timeliness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This relatively straightforward answer does not resolve the materially different question of where to derive an appropriate rule of timeliness when a federal employee elects to bypass the administrative process and file an ADEA suit directly in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In that situation, <i>Stevens</i> forecloses the importation of Title VII's limitations period. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Stevens,</i> the Supreme Court observed that the statutory provision authorizing the bypass option, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(d), \"calls for a notice of not less than 30 days to the [EEOC] of an intent to sue,\" and \"that the notice shall be filed with the [EEOC] within 180 days of the alleged unlawful practice.\" 500 U.S. at 6, 111 S.Ct. 1562. Finding these two requirements satisfied, the Court asked whether there were any other bases upon which the suit could be considered time-barred. <i>Id.</i> at 7, 111 S.Ct. 1562. Noting that the \"statute does not expressly impose any additional limitations period for a complaint of age discrimination,\" the Justices concluded that Congress intended that an appropriate limitations period should be borrowed from state or federal law. <i>Id.</i> Although poised to decide which rule of timeliness should be borrowed for use in connection with 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(c)-(d), the Court refrained from making that decision. It explained that there was no need to decide the question because Stevens had filed his suit one year and six days after the allegedly discriminatory event &#8212; an interval that was \"well within whatever statute of limitations might apply to the action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8, 111 S.Ct. 1562 (quoting respondents' brief).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that this decision can only be read as a definitive rejection of the importation of Title VII's limitations period into the framework established by 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(c)-(d). We base this conclusion on two principal lines of reasoning. First, the entire focus of the <i>Stevens</i> Court's inquiry was on the date of the alleged discrimination as the accrual date for limitations purposes. Under Title VII, the relevant date would have borne some relation to final agency action, or at least to the expiration of the 30-day notice period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second &#8212; and perhaps more important &#8212; if Title VII's temporal requirements were to be applied to bypass actions, Stevens's claim would have been time-barred. Stevens served a notice of intent to sue on October 19, 1987, and filed suit on May 3, 1988. <i>Stevens,</i> 500 U.S. at 4, 111 S.Ct. 1562. Were Title VII to be the source of the borrowing, a federal employee who elected to bypass the administrative process would have no more than 120 days from the filing of his notice within which to commence a civil action. <i>See Edwards,</i> 64 F.3d at 605-06 (finding that Title VII's limitations period would begin to run no later than the expiration of the 30-day waiting period following the filing of a notice of intent to sue); <i>Rossiter,</i> 257 F.Supp.2d at 445 (same). Since Stevens started suit more than 120 days after he filed his notice of intent to sue, the Supreme Court could not have found his suit timely <i>unless</i> it rejected the proposed incorporation of Title VII's limitations period into the ADEA's bypass scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the government resists this conclusion. It suggests that the Court's comment &#8212; that Stevens's suit had been brought \"well within whatever statute of limitations might apply,\" 500 U.S. at 8, 111 S.Ct. 1562 &#8212; was mere dictum and that, in all events, the point was never fully litigated. We reject these importunings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First and foremost, when a statement in a judicial decision is essential to the result reached in the case, it becomes part of the court's holding. <i>See Seminole Tribe v. Florida,</i> 517 U.S. 44, 66-67, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996) (defining as binding both the court's result and \"those portions of the opinion necessary to that result\"). Consequently, the <i>Stevens</i> Court's statement was not dictum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also dismiss the government's attempt to sidestep <i>Stevens</i> on the basis that the statute of limitations issue was never fully litigated. That asseveration depends on the premise that the Court's statement that Stevens's suit had been brought \"well within whatever statute of limitations might apply to the action,\" 500 U.S. at 8, 111 S.Ct. 1562, was merely a recitation of the government's concession. That premise is faulty. Although the government accepted Stevens's position on the question, the Supreme Court did not stop there but chose to decide the issue, recognizing that a final determination was essential to the outcome of the litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See</i> 500 U.S. at 7-8, 111 S.Ct. 1562. In other words, the Supreme Court resolved that the limitations issue was properly before it &#8212; and we decline to second-guess the legal effect of that resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; sound policy considerations support the result reached by the <i>Stevens</i> Court. Title VII's limitations period is entirely derivative of, and dictated by, the administrative process. The limitations period begins to run upon final agency action. The bypass procedure, however, is a horse of a vastly different hue. <i>See Burnett v. Grattan,</i> 468 U.S. 42, 50-51, 104 S.Ct. 2924, 82 L.Ed.2d 36 (1984) (discussing how going through an administrative process differs from filing a claim directly in court and noting, inter alia, that borrowing an administrative statute of limitations for use in the latter situation ignores the congressional determination that the claim belongs in court). Because bypass actions involve no final agency action, it would be anomalous to impress them with a Title VII-like rule of timeliness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government attempts to parry this thrust by noting that the EEOC must receive notice of a federal employee's intent to sue in a bypass case. That is indisputably true, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(d), but it is beside the point. This notice is a one-time event that bears no real resemblance to the processing and resolution of an administrative complaint. In a traditional ADEA case, the administrative process, once begun, takes center stage until an administrative outcome is reached. By that time, the case is likely to be fully developed. Permitting a short window of opportunity within which to file suit makes sense when that window follows a final agency determination. In that context, the short window of time is actually more like a right to appeal than a statute of limitations &#8212; and rights of appeal often have a severely limited shelf life. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2107(a) (delineating a 30-day appeal period); Sup.Ct. R. 13 (requiring petitions for certiorari to be filed within 90 days after judgment); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002 (requiring generally that a notice of appeal be filed within ten days of a bankruptcy court order). Moreover, the administrative process is often lengthy and, thus, starting the limitations period from the date of injury would run the risk of allowing the expiration of the time for suit despite best efforts on the employee's part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These justifications are utterly absent in ADEA bypass cases. There is no required agency action and no persuasive rationale for linking a rule of timeliness to the time of agency notification. Viewed holistically, bypass cases are more like traditional civil suits, in which limitations periods begin to run at the time of the injury. We think it is hardly coincidental that this is the precise locus on which the <i>Stevens</i> Court focused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Edwards</i> does not persuade us to the opposite view. There, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the applicable limitations period for ADEA actions brought pursuant to section 633a(c)-(d) should be imported from Title VII. <i>Edwards,</i> 64 F.3d at 606. Although the panel paid lip service to <i>Stevens,</i> it nowhere explained how the result that it reached was permissible under <i>Stevens.</i> Because we do not see any principled way to square <i>Edwards</i> with <i>Stevens,</i> we regard the <i>Edwards</i> decision as fundamentally flawed and respectfully decline to follow it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>C.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>ADEA Bypass Actions: What Limitations Period Should Apply</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that Title VII does not furnish the applicable rule of timeliness for ADEA bypass actions, we are left with the question of what limitations period should apply. The inquiry that we must undertake requires us to determine, first, whether a federal or state rule of timeliness should be imported. <i>See Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff &amp; Assocs., Inc.,</i> 483 U.S. 143, 147, 107 S.Ct. 2759, 97 L.Ed.2d 121 (1987). Given both the longstanding practice of borrowing state periods of limitations when federal rights-creating statutes contain no built-in timeliness rules and Congress's awareness of that practice, courts ought generally to assume that Congress intends by its silence that state law be borrowed. <i>Id.</i> But this is a default rule &#8212; a \"fallback rule of thumb,\" <i>DelCostello,</i> 462 U.S. at 158 n. 12, 103 S.Ct. 2281 &#8212; not a hard-and-fast mandate. <i>See Communications Workers of Am. v. Western Elec. Co.,</i> 860 F.2d 1137, 1139 (1st Cir.1988) (explaining that \"the glance in the direction of the state-law cupboard should not be an automatic or reflexive one\"). That default rule must give way \"when a rule from elsewhere in federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes, and when the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.\" <i>DelCostello,</i> 462 U.S. at 172, 103 S.Ct. 2281; <i>accord Agency Holding Corp.,</i> 483 U.S. at 147-48, 107 S.Ct. 2759. This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closest analogy to an ADEA bypass action logically is to be found in anti-discrimination or employment legislation. Although there are a myriad of federal statutes that fall under those rubrics, most of them require exhaustion of an administrative process as a precondition to court action. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1) &amp; (f)(1) (Title VII); <i>id.</i> &#167; 12117 (Americans with Disabilities Act). This renders their rules of timeliness useless for our purpose: after all, the search for the most analogous rule of timeliness places a high premium on both parallel enforcement structures and congruent statutory goals. <i>See Burnett,</i> 468 U.S. at 49-50, 104 S.Ct. 2924. The same disqualifier negates the possible use of a network of state anti-discrimination statutes as a source for borrowed rules of timeliness. <i>See id.</i> at 51, 104 S.Ct. 2924 (noting that \"some 30 states\" have administrative remedies modeled after Title VII).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, analogies need not be \"perfect,\" <i>Agency Holding Corp.,</i> 483 U.S. at 147, 107 S.Ct. 2759, and the search for an appropriate state-law analogue leads naturally to a consideration of rules of timeliness generally applicable to claims for personal injury. On reflection, however, this seems an unsatisfactory alternative. One concern is that these statutes tend to be very general and, thus, furnish only a loose fit for ADEA bypass actions. Another concern arises out of the existence and availability of a more sharply focused federal analogue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See</i> Norman J.

(\"When two or more statutes of limitations deal with the same subject matter, the statute which is more recent and specific will prevail over the older and more general one.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our chief concern, however, is that the importation of state rules of timeliness into the framework established for ADEA bypass actions would \"frustrate or interfere with the implementation of national policies.\" <i>Occidental Life Ins. Co. v. EEOC,</i> 432 U.S. 355, 367, 97 S.Ct. 2447, 53 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977). That concern reflects two basic premises. First, because section 633a applies only to federal employers, the interest in uniformity is manifest. We think that this interest matters. <i>See Board of Regents v. Tomanio,</i> 446 U.S. 478, 489, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980) (observing that uniformity is \"a federal policy which sometimes necessitates the displacement of an otherwise applicable state rule of law\"); <i>see also Carlson v. Green,</i> 446 U.S. 14, 23-24, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980) (creating a federal common law of survivorship rights for use in actions brought under <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), based on the need for uniformity and noting that \"uniformity cannot be achieved if courts are limited to ... state law\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts might have to swallow hard and tolerate these several concerns if state law were the only source reasonably available for borrowing. <i>DelCostello,</i> 462 U.S. at 169, 103 S.Ct. 2281. Here, however, that is not the case. Having considered and discarded the full range of alternatives, we believe that the FLSA, a federal statute, offers the closest analogy to ADEA bypass actions (and, thus, constitutes the most appropriate source for borrowing a rule of timeliness).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FLSA's goals are congruent with the ADEA's: like the ADEA, the FLSA was designed to protect individual workers. <i>See Barrentine v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc.,</i> 450 U.S. 728, 739, 101 S.Ct. 1437, 67 L.Ed.2d 641 (1981). The FLSA's enforcement mechanism also parallels the enforcement mechanism characteristic of ADEA bypass actions, that is, it creates private rights of action that do not depend upon a regime of administrative enforcement. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b). Moreover, the FLSA's limitations period is designed to accommodate a balance of interests similar to those at stake in ADEA bypass actions. The importance of this fact is obvious. <i>See DelCostello,</i> 462 U.S. at 169, 103 S.Ct. 2281. And, finally, we deem it significant that the very act that expanded the ADEA to include federal employees was cast in the form of an amendment to the FLSA. These considerations lead us to conclude that borrowing a rule of timeliness from the FLSA is the preferred course &#8212; and one that is entirely consistent with the congressional design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, sound policy also supports resort to the FLSA's limitations period. A two-year statute of limitations<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> in no way undermines the salient interests served by timeliness rules in federal anti-discrimination laws, which are meant to \"protect employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions that are long past.\" <i>Delaware State Coll. v. Ricks,</i> 449 U.S. 250, 256-57, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980). In a bypass case, a federal employee must give notice of intent to sue within 180 days of the allegedly discriminatory act or practice, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(d), and the federal employer thus will have an opportunity to investigate the claim and preserve relevant records. We hold, therefore, that the FLSA's rule of timeliness, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 255(a), is the correct rule of timeliness to apply to ADEA actions in which a federal employee has elected to bypass the administrative process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one loose end. As the government reminds us, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(f) says that personnel actions of any federal employer to which section 633a applies should not be \"subject to, or affected by, any provision of this chapter.\" This is a potential obstacle to our holding because, at the time that section 633a(f) was added, <i>see</i> Pub.L. No. 95-256, &#167; 5(e), 92 Stat. 191 (1978), the FLSA's limitations period applied, by statute, to the mine-run of ADEA cases, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(e) (amended 1991). With this in mind, the suggestion is that section 633a(f) should be construed to preclude application of the FLSA's rule of timeliness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning is both convoluted and disingenuous. Although it is true that section 633a(f) makes clear that federal employers are only bound by the specific provisions of section 633a, looking to the FLSA to borrow a rule of timeliness in no way compromises that principle. The FLSA's statute of limitations is no longer applicable to ADEA litigation involving private employers. Consequently, our choice to import the FLSA's timeliness rule into the framework of ADEA bypass actions does not implicate any other provision of the ADEA. We merely refer to an analogous statutory scheme to fill a void that must be filled (i.e., to determine the appropriate limitations period for use in bypass actions). This is an exercise in statutory interpretation, not an application of forbidden provisions to the case at hand. In the last analysis, then, section 633a(f) has no bearing on our importation decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To reiterate, we hold that the correct rule of timeliness to be used in conjunction with bypass actions brought under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a is the FLSA's limitations period. Applying this rule to Rossiter's ADEA claim, we find that his suit &#8212; filed one year and ten months after the occurrence of the allegedly discriminatory act &#8212; is timely. <i>See Ricks,</i> 449 U.S. at 258-59, 101 S.Ct. 498 (holding that the appropriate focus in determining the starting point of a limitations period in an employment discrimination action is the communication of the allegedly discriminatory decision); <i>Morris v. Gov't Dev. Bank,</i> 27 F.3d 746, 749-50 (1st Cir.1994) (explaining that the limitations period begins to run when the claimant receives notice of the discriminatory act). The district court erred in concluding otherwise and in dismissing Rossiter's action as time-barred. Accordingly, we reverse the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court, in a failed attempt to reconcile<i>Edwards</i> with pertinent Supreme Court precedent, devised a complicated algorithm.

Dep't of Treasury,</i> 500 U.S. 1, 111 S.Ct. 1562, 114 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991)].\" <i>Rossiter,</i> 257 F.Supp.2d at 445.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> <i>Lavery</i> does not assist in answering this question. Although we held there that Title VII's statute of limitations should be applied to ADEA actions against federal employers, the case involved an employee who had elected to undergo the administrative process. <i>See Lavery,</i> 918 F.2d at 1022-23 (\"We are asked to decide ... what period of limitations <i>following a final agency decision</i> applies to an action alleging age discrimination brought by a federal employee pursuant to the [ADEA].\") (emphasis supplied). In all events, the Supreme Court decided <i>Stevens</i> after <i>Lavery,</i> and the rationale of <i>Stevens</i> precludes us from applying <i>Lavery</i> to bypass cases. <i>See</i> text <i>infra.</i> By like token, <i>Stevens</i> effectively abrogated our earlier decision in <i>Castro v. United States,</i> 775 F.2d 399, 403 (1st Cir.1985) (per curiam), insofar as that decision pertains to the interpretation of the ADEA's temporal requirements. <i>See Stevens,</i> 500 U.S. at 7, 111 S.Ct. 1562.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We hasten to add that even if one were to categorize the Court's statement as dictum &#8212; a proposition to which we do not subscribe &#8212; that categorization would not shift our view<i>See McCoy v. MIT,</i> 950 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1991) (concluding that \"federal appellate courts are bound by the Supreme Court's considered dicta almost as firmly as by the Court's outright holdings, particularly when... a dictum is of recent vintage and not enfeebled by any subsequent statement\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In point of fact, the government's only ground of opposition in<i>Stevens</i> was that the Court should not hear the case, and, thus, the Court's choice to decide the merits is telling.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Without exception, the cases cited by the<i>Edwards</i> court in support of importing Title VII's limitations period into the framework of section 633a(c)-(d) are inapposite. All of them involve federal employees who opted to undergo the administrative process. <i>See, e.g., Jones,</i> 32 F.3d at 1455; <i>Long,</i> 22 F.3d at 55-56; <i>Lavery,</i> 918 F.2d at 1023. As we explained above, the limitations period applicable to \"administrative process\" cases simply cannot be transplanted blindly into the bypass scheme.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although not dispositive, we find it compelling that not one court of appeals to have considered what limitations period to borrow in an ADEA action against a federal employer has imported a state rule of decision<i>See, e.g., Jones,</i> 32 F.3d at 1455; <i>Lavery,</i> 918 F.2d at 1025.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We note that courts generally have applied state statutes of limitations to<i>Bivens</i> actions notwithstanding the fact that such actions lie only against federal officers. <i>See, e.g., Polanco v. U.S. DEA,</i> 158 F.3d 647, 653 (2d Cir. 1998); <i>Delgado-Brunet v. Clark,</i> 93 F.3d 339, 342 (7th Cir.1996); <i>Matthews v. Macanas,</i> 990 F.2d 467, 468 (9th Cir.1993). But ADEA bypass actions are distinguishable from <i>Bivens</i> actions for a variety of reasons. First, the ADEA has been interpreted to preempt state causes of action for age discrimination in employment. <i>See, e.g., Britt v. Grocers Supply Co.,</i> 978 F.2d 1441, 1448 (5th Cir.1992). We believe that this fact evinces Congress's preference for uniformity of application. Second, <i>Bivens</i> is a court-created remedy that serves as an analogue to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. It would make little sense to apply different limitations periods to section 1983 claims and <i>Bivens</i> claims, both of which are \"constitutional tort\" actions that allow vindication of personal interests. <i>See Polanco,</i> 158 F.3d at 653.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In point of fact, the FLSA has a bifurcated limitations period.

A federal employee or a disappointed applicant for federal employment &#8212; we use the term \"federal employee\" throughout this opinion as a shorthand to cover both classes of persons &#8212; who wishes to pursue an ADEA claim has a right, not available to other ADEA claimants, to bypass the administrative process and go directly to a federal district court. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 633a(c)-(d).

Reluctant though we are to create a circuit split, we part company with the <i>Edwards</i> court and hold that when a federal employee opts to bypass the administrative process and pursue an ADEA claim directly in the district court, the applicable limitations period should be borrowed from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 255(a). That period, which extends for at least two years from the date of the allegedly discriminatory act or practice, is longer than either the 90-day limitations period contained in Title VII or the hybrid period fashioned by the lower court. <i>See Rossiter v.

After passing the USPS's preliminary screens (including a written examination and a drug test), Rossiter was interviewed by Steve Froio, a USPS hierarch. Although Rossiter had 20 years of experience in the service industry, the USPS refrained from contacting any of his references. This did not bode well for Rossiter's prospects, and in early January he received a letter stating that he would not be hired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rossiter pursued the matter. On January 29, 2001, Froio told him that he had been rejected because he seemed nervous during the interview. Froio added that \"[i]f [Rossiter] were 20 years younger, being nervous would have been acceptable.\" When Rossiter suggested that he was being denied employment on account of his age, Froio replied: \"It didn't help you any.\" Rossiter requested that his application be reconsidered, but Froio told him that reconsideration was impracticable as no more positions were available. Less than ten days later, however, Rossiter received correspondence announcing that the USPS was still seeking to hire people in the job category for which he had unsuccessfully applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At age 46, Rossiter was a member of the class protected by the ADEA. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(a). Convinced that he had been denied employment by reason of age discrimination, he contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in mid-February. Following an initial meeting, Rossiter submitted an informal complaint. He later agreed to participate in mediation, which took place on May 21, 2001. Nothing was resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 2001, Rossiter filed a notice of intent to sue with the EEOC. From that point forward, the matter lay fallow until November 28, 2002. Rossiter then filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Postmaster General and the USPS. In it, he alleged violations of the ADEA and its state counterpart, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4(1). The defendants (collectively, the government) moved to dismiss the action, arguing (i) that the state-law claim was preempted by the ADEA, and (ii) that the ADEA claim was time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rossiter did not contest the preemption argument, and the district court dismissed the state-law claim. Rossiter's ADEA claim proved to be a knottier problem. The district court took this aspect of the case under advisement and ultimately ruled, in a written rescript, that the claim was time-barred. <i>Rossiter,</i> 257 F.Supp.2d at 445.

This included incorporation of the FLSA's statute of limitations. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(e) (amended 1991) (incorporating by reference 29 U.S.C. &#167; 255). The FLSA model set a limitations period of two years after the date of injury for general violations and three years for willful violations. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 255(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, Congress removed the FLSA's incorporated statute of limitations from this portion of the ADEA and inserted a limitations scheme akin to that governing Title VII actions. <i>See</i> Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L.

Under this reconstructed framework, there is no external requirement that a federal civil action predicated on an ADEA violation be filed within a specified time following the date of the discriminatory act or practice; rather, the applicable timing requirements relate to, and derive from, the administrative process. An employee must file an administrative complaint within 180 days of the alleged discrimination in order to preserve his or her claim. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(d)(1). This filing vivifies the administrative process, and the date of injury has no further bearing on the question of timeliness. The applicable limitations period begins to run at the end of the administrative process: from that point, the employee has 90 days within which to bring suit. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 626(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative scheme for ADEA claims brought by federal employees is materially different. Congress provided dual means of enforcement for federal workers and left the choice between them to the claimant. On the one hand, a federal employee may invoke the EEOC's administrative process and thereafter file suit if he or she is dissatisfied with the administrative outcome. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 633a(b)-(c); <i>see also Stevens v.

On the other hand, a federal employee may bypass the administrative process altogether and file a civil action directly in the federal district court. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(c)-(d); <i>see also Stevens,</i> 500 U.S. at 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, that section says nothing about the outside date for the filing of suit (regardless of whether an employee has elected to undergo or to bypass the administrative process). Courts have been left to intuit the rules of timeliness applicable to such ADEA actions, and those rules must be borrowed from an exogenous source. <i>See Stevens,</i> 500 U.S. at 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In cases in which a federal employee opts for the administrative process, courts &#8212; including this one &#8212; have most often agreed that the Title VII limitations period is the most analogous and, therefore, have elected to import it. <i>See, e.g., Burzynski v.

This importation makes good sense because when a federal employee elects to enter the administrative process, the ADEA and Title VII enforcement schemes are homologous. Moreover, in such a situation the federal employee is pursuing essentially the same route that Congress has prescribed for non-federal employees, and, thus, there is every reason to borrow a compatible rule of timeliness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This relatively straightforward answer does not resolve the materially different question of where to derive an appropriate rule of timeliness when a federal employee elects to bypass the administrative process and file an ADEA suit directly in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In that situation, <i>Stevens</i> forecloses the importation of Title VII's limitations period. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Stevens,</i> the Supreme Court observed that the statutory provision authorizing the bypass option, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(d), \"calls for a notice of not less than 30 days to the [EEOC] of an intent to sue,\" and \"that the notice shall be filed with the [EEOC] within 180 days of the alleged unlawful practice.\" 500 U.S. at 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1562</span></a></span>. Finding these two requirements satisfied, the Court asked whether there were any other bases upon which the suit could be considered time-barred. <i>Id.</i> at 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1562</span></a></span>. Noting that the \"statute does not expressly impose any additional limitations period for a complaint of age discrimination,\" the Justices concluded that Congress intended that an appropriate limitations period should be borrowed from state or federal law. <i>Id.</i> Although poised to decide which rule of timeliness should be borrowed for use in connection with 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(c)-(d), the Court refrained from making that decision. It explained that there was no need to decide the question because Stevens had filed his suit one year and six days after the allegedly discriminatory event &#8212; an interval that was \"well within whatever statute of limitations might apply to the action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We base this conclusion on two principal lines of reasoning. First, the entire focus of the <i>Stevens</i> Court's inquiry was on the date of the alleged discrimination as the accrual date for limitations purposes. Under Title VII, the relevant date would have borne some relation to final agency action, or at least to the expiration of the 30-day notice period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second &#8212; and perhaps more important &#8212; if Title VII's temporal requirements were to be applied to bypass actions, Stevens's claim would have been time-barred. Stevens served a notice of intent to sue on October 19, 1987, and filed suit on May 3, 1988. <i>Stevens,</i> 500 U.S. at 4, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1562</span></a></span>. Were Title VII to be the source of the borrowing, a federal employee who elected to bypass the administrative process would have no more than 120 days from the filing of his notice within which to commence a civil action. <i>See Edwards,</i> 64 F.3d at 605-06 (finding that Title VII's limitations period would begin to run no later than the expiration of the 30-day waiting period following the filing of a notice of intent to sue); <i>Rossiter,</i> 257 F.Supp.2d at 445 (same). Since Stevens started suit more than 120 days after he filed his notice of intent to sue, the Supreme Court could not have found his suit timely <i>unless</i> it rejected the proposed incorporation of Title VII's limitations period into the ADEA's bypass scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the government resists this conclusion. It suggests that the Court's comment &#8212; that Stevens's suit had been brought \"well within whatever statute of limitations might apply,\" 500 U.S. at 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We reject these importunings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First and foremost, when a statement in a judicial decision is essential to the result reached in the case, it becomes part of the court's holding. <i>See Seminole Tribe v. Florida,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118011\"><a href=\"/opinion/118011/seminole-tribe-of-fla-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 66-67, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118011\"><a href=\"/opinion/118011/seminole-tribe-of-fla-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span> (1996) (defining as binding both the court's result and \"those portions of the opinion necessary to that result\"). Consequently, the <i>Stevens</i> Court's statement was not dictum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also dismiss the government's attempt to sidestep <i>Stevens</i> on the basis that the statute of limitations issue was never fully litigated. That asseveration depends on the premise that the Court's statement that Stevens's suit had been brought \"well within whatever statute of limitations might apply to the action,\" 500 U.S. at 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1562</span></a></span>, was merely a recitation of the government's concession. That premise is faulty. Although the government accepted Stevens's position on the question, the Supreme Court did not stop there but chose to decide the issue, recognizing that a final determination was essential to the outcome of the litigation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See</i> 500 U.S. at 7-8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In other words, the Supreme Court resolved that the limitations issue was properly before it &#8212; and we decline to second-guess the legal effect of that resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; sound policy considerations support the result reached by the <i>Stevens</i> Court. Title VII's limitations period is entirely derivative of, and dictated by, the administrative process. The limitations period begins to run upon final agency action. The bypass procedure, however, is a horse of a vastly different hue. <i>See Burnett v. Grattan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111237\"><a href=\"/opinion/111237/burnett-v-grattan/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 50-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111237\"><a href=\"/opinion/111237/burnett-v-grattan/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span> (1984) (discussing how going through an administrative process differs from filing a claim directly in court and noting, inter alia, that borrowing an administrative statute of limitations for use in the latter situation ignores the congressional determination that the claim belongs in court). Because bypass actions involve no final agency action, it would be anomalous to impress them with a Title VII-like rule of timeliness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government attempts to parry this thrust by noting that the EEOC must receive notice of a federal employee's intent to sue in a bypass case. That is indisputably true, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(d), but it is beside the point. This notice is a one-time event that bears no real resemblance to the processing and resolution of an administrative complaint. In a traditional ADEA case, the administrative process, once begun, takes center stage until an administrative outcome is reached. By that time, the case is likely to be fully developed. Permitting a short window of opportunity within which to file suit makes sense when that window follows a final agency determination. In that context, the short window of time is actually more like a right to appeal than a statute of limitations &#8212; and rights of appeal often have a severely limited shelf life. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2107(a) (delineating a 30-day appeal period); Sup.Ct. R. 13 (requiring petitions for certiorari to be filed within 90 days after judgment); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002 (requiring generally that a notice of appeal be filed within ten days of a bankruptcy court order). Moreover, the administrative process is often lengthy and, thus, starting the limitations period from the date of injury would run the risk of allowing the expiration of the time for suit despite best efforts on the employee's part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These justifications are utterly absent in ADEA bypass cases. There is no required agency action and no persuasive rationale for linking a rule of timeliness to the time of agency notification. Viewed holistically, bypass cases are more like traditional civil suits, in which limitations periods begin to run at the time of the injury. We think it is hardly coincidental that this is the precise locus on which the <i>Stevens</i> Court focused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Edwards</i> does not persuade us to the opposite view. There, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the applicable limitations period for ADEA actions brought pursuant to section 633a(c)-(d) should be imported from Title VII. <i>Edwards,</i> 64 F.3d at 606. Although the panel paid lip service to <i>Stevens,</i> it nowhere explained how the result that it reached was permissible under <i>Stevens.</i> Because we do not see any principled way to square <i>Edwards</i> with <i>Stevens,</i> we regard the <i>Edwards</i> decision as fundamentally flawed and respectfully decline to follow it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>C.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>ADEA Bypass Actions: What Limitations Period Should Apply</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that Title VII does not furnish the applicable rule of timeliness for ADEA bypass actions, we are left with the question of what limitations period should apply. The inquiry that we must undertake requires us to determine, first, whether a federal or state rule of timeliness should be imported. <i>See Agency Holding Corp. v.

Having considered and discarded the full range of alternatives, we believe that the FLSA, a federal statute, offers the closest analogy to ADEA bypass actions (and, thus, constitutes the most appropriate source for borrowing a rule of timeliness).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FLSA's goals are congruent with the ADEA's: like the ADEA, the FLSA was designed to protect individual workers. <i>See Barrentine v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span> (1981). The FLSA's enforcement mechanism also parallels the enforcement mechanism characteristic of ADEA bypass actions, that is, it creates private rights of action that do not depend upon a regime of administrative enforcement. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b). Moreover, the FLSA's limitations period is designed to accommodate a balance of interests similar to those at stake in ADEA bypass actions. The importance of this fact is obvious. <i>See DelCostello,</i> 462 U.S. at 169, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110956\"><a href=\"/opinion/110956/delcostello-v-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2281</span></a></span>. And, finally, we deem it significant that the very act that expanded the ADEA to include federal employees was cast in the form of an amendment to the FLSA. These considerations lead us to conclude that borrowing a rule of timeliness from the FLSA is the preferred course &#8212; and one that is entirely consistent with the congressional design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, sound policy also supports resort to the FLSA's limitations period. A two-year statute of limitations<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> in no way undermines the salient interests served by timeliness rules in federal anti-discrimination laws, which are meant to \"protect employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions that are long past.\" <i>Delaware State Coll. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span> (1980). In a bypass case, a federal employee must give notice of intent to sue within 180 days of the allegedly discriminatory act or practice, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(d), and the federal employer thus will have an opportunity to investigate the claim and preserve relevant records. We hold, therefore, that the FLSA's rule of timeliness, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 255(a), is the correct rule of timeliness to apply to ADEA actions in which a federal employee has elected to bypass the administrative process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one loose end. As the government reminds us, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a(f) says that personnel actions of any federal employer to which section 633a applies should not be \"subject to, or affected by, any provision of this chapter.\" This is a potential obstacle to our holding because, at the time that section 633a(f) was added, <i>see</i> Pub.L. No. 95-256, &#167; 5(e), 92 Stat. 191 (1978), the FLSA's limitations period applied, by statute, to the mine-run of ADEA cases, <i>see</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(e) (amended 1991). With this in mind, the suggestion is that section 633a(f) should be construed to preclude application of the FLSA's rule of timeliness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning is both convoluted and disingenuous. Although it is true that section 633a(f) makes clear that federal employers are only bound by the specific provisions of section 633a, looking to the FLSA to borrow a rule of timeliness in no way compromises that principle. The FLSA's statute of limitations is no longer applicable to ADEA litigation involving private employers. Consequently, our choice to import the FLSA's timeliness rule into the framework of ADEA bypass actions does not implicate any other provision of the ADEA. We merely refer to an analogous statutory scheme to fill a void that must be filled (i.e., to determine the appropriate limitations period for use in bypass actions). This is an exercise in statutory interpretation, not an application of forbidden provisions to the case at hand. In the last analysis, then, section 633a(f) has no bearing on our importation decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To reiterate, we hold that the correct rule of timeliness to be used in conjunction with bypass actions brought under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 633a is the FLSA's limitations period. Applying this rule to Rossiter's ADEA claim, we find that his suit &#8212; filed one year and ten months after the occurrence of the allegedly discriminatory act &#8212; is timely. <i>See Ricks,</i> 449 U.S. at 258-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110367\"><a href=\"/opinion/110367/delaware-state-college-v-ricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court erred in concluding otherwise and in dismissing Rossiter's action as time-barred. Accordingly, we reverse the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Reversed and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The district court, in a failed attempt to reconcile<i>Edwards</i> with pertinent Supreme Court precedent, devised a complicated algorithm.

But ADEA bypass actions are distinguishable from <i>Bivens</i> actions for a variety of reasons. First, the ADEA has been interpreted to preempt state causes of action for age discrimination in employment. <i>See, e.g., Britt v. Grocers Supply Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594405\"><a href=\"/opinion/594405/richard-l-britt-and-timothy-jackson-jr-v-the-grocers-supply-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1441</span></a></span>, 1448 (5th Cir.1992). We believe that this fact evinces Congress's preference for uniformity of application. Second, <i>Bivens</i> is a court-created remedy that serves as an analogue to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. It would make little sense to apply different limitations periods to section 1983 claims and <i>Bivens</i> claims, both of which are \"constitutional tort\" actions that allow vindication of personal interests. <i>See Polanco,</i> 158 F.3d at 653.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In point of fact, the FLSA has a bifurcated limitations period.
