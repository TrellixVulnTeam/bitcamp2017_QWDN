Petitioner Shengli Zhang, a\n\nnative and citizen of China, petitions for review of a final order\n\nof removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),\n\naffirming the immigration judge’s (IJ’s) denial of his requests for\n\nasylum and for withholding of removal, and review of the BIA’s\n\nsubsequent denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider.    For the\n\nreasons that follow, Zhang’s petition for review of the BIA’s order\n\ndenying asylum and withholding of removal is DISMISSED as untimely,\n\nand his petition regarding the BIA’s subsequent order denying\n\nreopening and reconsideration is DENIED.\n\n                          I.   BACKGROUND\n\n     Zhang is a promoter of democracy for his native land of China.\n\nIn 1982, he scaled the wall of the U.S. Embassy in China seeking\n\nasylum.   U.S. Embassy Official Charles Martin delivered Zhang to\n\nthe Chinese authorities, who put him in a labor camp from which he\n\nescaped a year later.     Twenty days into his escape, Chinese\n\nauthorities recaptured Zhang and gave him three more years at hard\n\nlabor for “counter-communist behaviors.”      After prison, Zhang\n\nreceived a license to sell cloth from the Chinese government and\n\neventually obtained a visa to travel to the United States.\n\n     In 1996, Zhang came to the United States to seek asylum, but\n\nreturned unsuccessful to China ten days later. Without incident of\n\npersecution, Zhang stayed in China until he returned to the United\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fStates in 1997.        Since his arrival in the United States, Zhang has\n\nbeen active in pro-China-democracy protests.\n\n     Zhang       overstayed          his    visa,        and    the      Immigration       and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS) filed a deportation action.                                 Zhang\n\nsought    relief       from    deportation          in    the    form     of    asylum     and\n\nwithholding of removal. On November 7, 2000, the IJ denied asylum,\n\nfinding Zhang “not a credible witness,” but even in the most\n\nfavorable light, also found Zhang failed to meet his burden of\n\nproof.    Zhang filed a timely notice of appeal with the BIA, but\n\nfailed to refile his brief after it was disallowed for lack of\n\nservice on the INS.           The BIA affirmed the IJ, on the basis that the\n\nIJ “provided specific reasons” for finding Zhang failed to meet his\n\nburden of proof and that “significant doubts were cast” on Zhang’s\n\ncorroborative evidence.\n\n     On April 29, 2002, Zhang filed a timely motion with the BIA to\n\nreopen and reconsider its decision. The BIA denied reconsideration\n\nbecause Zhang was trying to “correct his failure to file a brief\n\nand to further expand on the summary statements provided on the\n\nNotice    of   Appeal,”        and    because       Zhang       raised       “arguments    not\n\npreviously articulated on appeal.”                        The BIA denied reopening\n\nbecause    all    of    Zhang’s       new    evidence          was    supportive      of   his\n\ncredibility,      which       the    BIA    found    immaterial         in    light   of   the\n\nalternative ground that, even assuming Zhang’s credibility, he had\n\nfailed to sustain his burden of proof.\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f                              II. DISCUSSION\n\n                     The Original BIA Denial of Asylum\n\n     Zhang spends most of his brief attacking the IJ’s denial of\n\nasylum and the BIA’s subsequent affirmance on March 28, 2002.\n\nCiting the correct “substantial evidence” standard of review, see\n\nGailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 1998), Zhang appeals the\n\ncredibility     determinations1     of     the   IJ   and    BIA,    and    their\n\napplications of the “well founded fear” of future persecution\n\nstandard.     Unfortunately for Zhang, his petition to this court on\n\nAugust 13, 2002, for review of these initial determinations came\n\nwell after     the    thirty-day   time    limit   imposed    by    the    Illegal\n\nImmigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.\n\nL. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-3546 (codified in scattered sections\n\nof Title 8 and 18) (IIRIRA).\n\n     Under the IIRIRA,       all final BIA orders must be appealed to\n\nthis court within thirty days.           8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1).       This need\n\nto timely appeal is a strict jurisdictional requirement.                       See\n\nSankarpillai v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 1004, 1005-06 (7th Cir. 2003)\n\n(collecting cases).       Moreover, this time to appeal asylum orders\n\ncontinues to run despite Zhang’s motions to reopen and reconsider;\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Specifically, Zhang challenges the IJ’s use of Zhang’s\ndemeanor in court (laughing), lack of education and employment,\npolitical beliefs, as well as failing to take cultural differences\ninto account when making the credibility determination.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthese motions are appealed separately.           See Stone v. INS, 514 U.S.\n\n386, 405-06 (1995).2\n\n     In this case, because Zhang appealed the BIA’s March 28, 2002,\n\ndenial    of   asylum   well    over    the    thirty-day   limit,   we   lack\n\njurisdiction to review the underlying denial.                However, Zhang\n\ntimely appealed the BIA’s denial of his motion to reopen and\n\nreconsider.\n\n               The BIA’s Denial of the Motion to Reopen\n\n     A motion to reopen must “state the new facts that will be\n\nproven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall\n\nbe supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.”                   8\n\nC.F.R. § 3.2(c).        Courts recognize two independent, but non-\n\nexclusive grounds on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen: (1)\n\nfailure to establish a prima facie case, and (2) failure to\n\nintroduce previously unavailable, material evidence.             See Fesseha\n\nv. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).           Even if Zhang meets\n\nthese requirements, the BIA may still use its discretion to deny\n\nrelief.    Id.; 8 C.F.R. § 3.2(a).           We can only overturn the BIA’s\n\ndecision for an abuse of discretion. Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d\n\n68, 70 (1st Cir. 2003).        Because Zhang failed to introduce any new\n\n\n     2\n      Stone interpreted a different version of the Immigration and\nNaturalization Act, much of which was repealed by the IIRIRA.\nHowever, Congress reenacted the central provision that the Stone\nCourt used to make its determination, and the circuits continue to\ncite Stone for the proposition that filing a motion to reopen or\nreconsider does not toll the time for appealing a denial of asylum.\nSee Nascimento v. INS, 274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fmaterial evidence, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nZhang’s motion to reopen.\n\n     The BIA has rationally explained and supported why it denied\n\nZhang’s motion to reopen.       It found the only new evidence Zhang\n\noffered simply corroborated his testimony about scaling a wall of\n\nthe U.S. Embassy and his time spent in a labor camp.3         While this\n\nevidence lent credit to his previous testimony, the BIA accepted\n\nZhang’s testimony as credible in its determination, thus making\n\nthis evidence superfluous.      Even Zhang frames this evidence in his\n\nbrief as “corroborating” his earlier testimony.\n\n     The BIA accepted all of Zhang’s testimony as credible, but\n\nbased its denial on the alternative ground that Zhang failed to\n\nsustain his burden of proof.       Particularly, it found Zhang failed\n\nto meet his burden of proof because he had gone back to China\n\nwithout incident and had been able to secure employment after his\n\nrelease from the labor camp.         Since Zhang’s new evidence does\n\nnothing   to   contradict   this    alternative    ground,   and    simply\n\ncorroborates    his   earlier   testimony   of    events   prior   to   his\n\nemployment and travel back to China, the BIA did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Zhang’s motion to reopen.\n\n               The BIA’s Denial of Motion to Reconsider\n\n\n\n     3\n      Specifically, Zhang submitted an affidavit from embassy\nemployee Martin corroborating his scaling the embassy wall and a\ndocument (verdict of extending Laogai) evidencing his time spent in\na labor camp.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f     Zhang’s motion for reconsideration does not fare any better.\n\nMotions for reconsideration shall state “the reasons for the motion\n\nby specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision\n\nand shall be supported by pertinent authority.”                      8 C.F.R. §\n\n3.2(b)(1).       The purpose of a motion to reconsider is not to raise\n\nnew facts, but to demonstrate that the BIA erred as a matter of law\n\nor fact.        We again review the BIA determination for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.       Nascimento v. INS, 274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nIn the reconsideration context, we will find an abuse of discretion\n\nif   the    denial     was   made     without    a     “rational    explanation,\n\ninexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an\n\nimpermissible basis” (such as race).             Id.\n\n     In his notice of appeal to the BIA, appealing the original IJ\n\ndenial     of    asylum,   Zhang    asserted    that    the   IJ   erred   in   her\n\ndeterminations on (1) Zhang’s credibility, (2) his failure to\n\nestablish past persecution, (3) his well founded fear based upon\n\nhis U.S. political activities, and (4) the insufficiency of his\n\nexplanation of why the Chinese government did not harm him when he\n\nreturned to China. The BIA subsequently rejected Zhang’s brief for\n\nlack of service on the INS.          Although given the opportunity, Zhang\n\nfailed to refile any brief with the BIA.\n\n     After the BIA denied Zhang’s appeal of the original asylum\n\ndetermination, Zhang’s timely motion to reconsider asserted that\n\nthe IJ erred in determining his credibility and had failed to\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fconsider his current political demonstrations against the Chinese\n\ngovernment in her “well founded fear” analysis.             The BIA denied\n\nreconsideration,   stating   that    Zhang   was    using   the   motion   to\n\n“correct his failure to file a brief and to further expand on the\n\nsummary statements provided on the Notice of Appeal,” and thus\n\ndeclined   to   reconsider   because      Zhang    raised   “arguments     not\n\npreviously articulated on appeal.”\n\n     The abuse of discretion standard simply requires a rational\n\nexplanation, and the BIA explained that it denied the motion\n\nbecause it raised previously undeveloped arguments.            This circuit\n\nhas a similar rule, refusing to consider arguments raised but not\n\nbriefed.   See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990) (documenting “settled appellate rule that issues averted to\n\nin a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived”).          Moreover, we have recently\n\nupheld a BIA denial for reconsideration, because the BIA found the\n\nalien’s reasons for reconsideration (not appeal, like Zhang) to be\n\n“conclusory” and “insufficiently detailed” to serve as a basis for\n\nreconsideration. Nascimento, 274 F.3d at 28. Here, because he had\n\nno brief, Zhang had only made the conclusory assertions in his\n\noriginal notice of appeal. The BIA did not abuse its discretion by\n\nrefusing to consider arguments developed for the first time on the\n\nreconsideration appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f                        III.   CONCLUSION\n\n     We affirm the BIA’s denial of Zhang’s motion to reopen and\n\nreconsider, and dismiss Zhang’s appeal of the BIA’s denial of\n\nasylum for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

The purpose of a motion to reconsider is not to raise new facts, but to demonstrate that the BIA erred as a matter of law or fact. We again review the BIA determination for an abuse of discretion. <i>Nascimento v. INS,</i> 274 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.2001). In the reconsideration context, we will find an abuse of discretion if the denial was made without a \"rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis\" (such as race). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his notice of appeal to the BIA, appealing the original IJ denial of asylum, Zhang asserted that the IJ erred in her determinations on (1) Zhang's credibility, (2) his failure to establish past persecution, (3) his well founded fear based upon his U.S. political activities, and (4) the insufficiency of his explanation of why the Chinese government did not harm him when he returned to China. The BIA subsequently rejected Zhang's brief for lack of service on the INS. Although given the opportunity, Zhang failed to refile any brief with the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the BIA denied Zhang's appeal of the original asylum determination, Zhang's timely motion to reconsider asserted that the IJ erred in determining his credibility and had failed to consider his current political demonstrations against the Chinese government in her \"well founded fear\" analysis. The BIA denied reconsideration, stating that Zhang was using the motion to \"correct his failure to file a brief and to further expand on the summary statements provided on the Notice of Appeal,\" and thus declined to reconsider because Zhang raised \"arguments not previously articulated on appeal.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The abuse of discretion standard simply requires a rational explanation, and the BIA explained that it denied the motion because it raised previously undeveloped arguments. This circuit has a similar rule, refusing to consider arguments raised but not briefed. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (documenting \"settled appellate rule that issues averted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\"). Moreover, we have recently upheld a BIA denial for reconsideration, because the BIA found the alien's reasons for reconsideration (not appeal, like Zhang) to be \"conclusory\" and \"insufficiently detailed\" to serve as a basis for reconsideration. <i>Nascimento,</i> 274 F.3d at 28. Here, because he had no brief, Zhang had only made the conclusory assertions in his original notice of appeal. The BIA did not abuse its discretion by refusing to consider arguments developed for the first time on the reconsideration appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.

For the reasons that follow, Zhang's petition for review of the BIA's order denying asylum and withholding of removal is DISMISSED as untimely, and his petition regarding the BIA's subsequent order denying reopening and reconsideration is DENIED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zhang is a promoter of democracy for his native land of China. In 1982, he scaled the wall of the U.S. Embassy in China seeking asylum. U.S. Embassy Official Charles Martin delivered Zhang to the Chinese authorities, who put him in a labor camp from which he escaped a year later. Twenty days into his escape, Chinese authorities recaptured Zhang and gave him three more years at hard labor for \"counter-communist behaviors.\" After prison, Zhang received a license to sell cloth from the Chinese government and eventually obtained a visa to travel to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Zhang came to the United States to seek asylum, but returned unsuccessful to China ten days later. Without incident of persecution, Zhang stayed in China until he returned to the United States in 1997. Since his arrival in the United States, Zhang has been active in pro-China-democracy protests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zhang overstayed his visa, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) filed a deportation action. Zhang sought relief from deportation in the form of asylum and withholding of removal. On November 7, 2000, the IJ denied asylum, finding Zhang \"not a credible witness,\" but even in the most favorable light, also found Zhang failed to meet his burden of proof. Zhang filed a timely notice of appeal with the BIA, but failed to refile his brief after it was disallowed for lack of service on the INS. The BIA affirmed the IJ, on the basis that the IJ \"provided specific reasons\" for finding Zhang failed to meet his burden of proof and that \"significant doubts were cast\" on Zhang's corroborative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 29, 2002, Zhang filed a timely motion with the BIA to reopen and reconsider its decision. The BIA denied reconsideration because Zhang was trying to \"correct his failure to file a brief and to further expand on the summary statements provided on the Notice of Appeal,\" and because Zhang raised \"arguments not previously articulated on appeal.\" The BIA denied reopening because all of Zhang's new evidence was supportive of his credibility, which the BIA found immaterial in light of the alternative ground that, even assuming Zhang's credibility, he had failed to sustain his burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>The Original BIA Denial of Asylum</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zhang spends most of his brief attacking the IJ's denial of asylum and the BIA's subsequent affirmance on March 28, 2002. Citing the correct \"substantial evidence\" standard of review, <i>see Gailius v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198026\"><a href=\"/opinion/198026/ins-v-gailius/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1998), Zhang appeals the credibility determinations<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> of the IJ and BIA, and their applications of the \"well founded fear\" of future persecution standard. Unfortunately for Zhang, his petition to this court on August 13, 2002, for review of these initial determinations came well after the thirty-day time limit imposed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-3546 (codified in scattered sections of Title 8 and 18) (IIRIRA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the IIRIRA, all final BIA orders must be appealed to this court within thirty days. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(1). This need to timely appeal is a strict jurisdictional requirement. <i>See Sankarapillai v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782156\"><a href=\"/opinion/782156/kukarajah-sankarapillai-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1005-06 (7th Cir.2003) (collecting cases). Moreover, this time to appeal asylum orders continues to run despite Zhang's motions to reopen and reconsider; these motions are appealed separately. <i>See Stone v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 405-06, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span> (1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, because Zhang appealed the BIA's March 28, 2002, denial of asylum well over the thirty-day limit, we lack jurisdiction to review the underlying denial. However, Zhang timely appealed the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The BIA's Denial of the Motion to Reopen</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion to reopen must \"state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(c). Courts recognize two independent, but non-exclusive grounds on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen: (1) failure to establish a prima facie case, and (2) failure to introduce previously unavailable, material evidence. <i>See Fesseha v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2003). Even if Zhang meets these requirements, the BIA may still use its discretion to deny relief. <i>Id.</i>; 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(a). We can only overturn the BIA's decision for an abuse of discretion. <i>Herbert v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200420\"><a href=\"/opinion/200420/herbert-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir.2003). Because Zhang failed to introduce any new material evidence, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zhang's motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA has rationally explained and supported why it denied Zhang's motion to reopen. It found the only new evidence Zhang offered simply corroborated his testimony about scaling a wall of the U.S. Embassy and his time spent in a labor camp.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While this evidence lent credit to his previous testimony, the BIA accepted Zhang's testimony as credible in its determination, thus making this evidence superfluous. Even Zhang frames this evidence in his brief as \"corroborating\" his earlier testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA accepted all of Zhang's testimony as credible, but based its denial on the alternative ground that Zhang failed to sustain his burden of proof. Particularly, it found Zhang failed to meet his burden of proof because he had gone back to China without incident and had been able to secure employment after his release from the labor camp. Since Zhang's new evidence does nothing to contradict this alternative ground, and simply corroborates his earlier testimony of events prior to his employment and travel back to China, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zhang's motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The BIA's Denial of Motion to Reconsider</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zhang's motion for reconsideration does not fare any better. Motions for reconsideration shall state \"the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(b)(1). The purpose of a motion to reconsider is not to raise new facts, but to demonstrate that the BIA erred as a matter of law or fact. We again review the BIA determination for an abuse of discretion. <i>Nascimento v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199734\"><a href=\"/opinion/199734/nascimento-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2001). In the reconsideration context, we will find an abuse of discretion if the denial was made without a \"rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis\" (such as race). <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his notice of appeal to the BIA, appealing the original IJ denial of asylum, Zhang asserted that the IJ erred in her determinations on (1) Zhang's credibility, (2) his failure to establish past persecution, (3) his well founded fear based upon his U.S. political activities, and (4) the insufficiency of his explanation of why the Chinese government did not harm him when he returned to China.
