On July 12, 2004, a jury\n\nconvicted Rafael A. González-Vélez (\"González\") and José A. Ramos-\n\nRomero   (\"Ramos\")   of   one    count   of       conspiracy   to   distribute   a\n\ncontrolled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. In addition,\n\nRamos was convicted of distribution of a controlled substance in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(2).           Ramos and González now appeal\n\ntheir convictions and their sentences.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n           Between    2000   and     2002,    a    drug   point   known   as   \"Las\n\nMalvinas\" was operated in the Luis Lloréns Torres housing project\n\nin Puerto Rico.      José Luis Rivera González (\"Rivera\") headed the\n\ndrug point until his death in 2002.           Between the summer of 2001 and\n\nOctober 2002, the FBI and the Police of Puerto Rico conducted an\n\ninvestigation of the drug point.         This investigation culminated in\n\na grand jury indictment on February 13, 2003 against nine persons\n\nincluding González and Ramos.         The indictment charged González and\n\nRamos with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances including\n\ncocaine, crack cocaine, heroin and marijuana in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846.   The indictment also charged Ramos with distribution\n\nof a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(2).\n\nFive of the seven other defendants charged in the indictment\n\npleaded guilty; two others were tried separately.                   González and\n\nRamos proceeded to trial on June 30, 2004.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f                            A.    Jury Selection\n\n            Fifty-six jurors were summoned and appeared for trial.\n\nDuring voir dire, González requested and the district court agreed\n\nto ask potential jurors whether they lived or had lived in a public\n\nhousing project. No juror answered affirmatively. After voir dire\n\nconcluded   and    the   jury    was   announced,     Ramos    objected    to   the\n\ncomposition of the jury, arguing that it had \"probably no poor\n\nclass or anybody relating to the public housing residence\" and that\n\npublic   housing    residents     formed      a   distinct    class.1     González\n\nconcurred in Ramos' objection. The court overruled the defendants'\n\nobjection to jury composition.\n\n                                 B.    The Trial\n\n            At trial, the Government presented testimony from FBI\n\nAgent William Ortiz regarding his surveillance of the Malvinas drug\n\npoint.   The Government also presented four hours and thirty-five\n\nminutes of videotapes from a surveillance camera placed near the\n\ndrug point that showed numerous drug transactions.                      Police of\n\nPuerto Rico Officer Felipe Casiano Caraballo (\"Casiano\") testified\n\nthat he had observed both Ramos and González near the drug point\n\nand had \"intervened\" with Ramos on a number of occasions.                        On\n\ncross-examination, Casiano admitted that he had never observed\n\n\n\n1\n  Counsel for Ramos stated \"[The] percentage of people who live in\npublic housing, this is maybe thirty or forty percent of the\ngeneral population, and [Ramos] is being excluded and prejudiced\nbecause of this.\"\n\n                                        -4-\n\fGonzález committing a crime.           Jesús Matías Cruz (\"Matías\"), a\n\ncooperating witness, testified that he had observed drug sales at\n\nthe drug point and had observed Ramos with two weapons while in the\n\ncompany of Rivera.    Matías also testified that he and Ramos \"cut\"\n\na \"baseball-sized\" rock of crack for packaging, during which Ramos\n\ntold him that the rock had been provided by González.               Matías\n\nfurther testified that he had overheard Rivera asking González for\n\n\"pepper,\" which was purportedly a code-word for cocaine, and that\n\nhe later observed González providing Rivera with a large plastic\n\nbag with \"stones\" or \"bricks\" inside. Matías also made a recording\n\nof a conversation between Rivera and González about the packaging,\n\nprocessing, and payment for cocaine.          In addition, Angel Obregón\n\nFontánez   (\"Obregón\"),   one    of    the   defendants   charged   in    the\n\nindictment who pleaded guilty, testified that he had observed\n\nGonzález   selling   between    one-eighth    and   one-half   kilogram   of\n\ncocaine on credit to Rivera.2         Obregón also testified that Ramos\n\nwas a processor of drugs and a \"triggerman\" for the enterprise.\n\nLastly, the Government offered physical evidence, including a\n\nnotebook (the \"ledger\") containing records of cocaine transactions\n\ninvolving a person named \"Junito,\" which was González's nickname.\n\n\n2\n  The number and scope of transactions is in dispute. After being\nasked whether he had observed González engage in more than ten drug\nsales to Rivera, Obregón said \"Yes.\"          However, on cross-\nexamination, Obregón said that he had seen \"a couple.\"           In\naddition, Obregón could not explain the difference in quantity\nbetween \"an eighth\" and \"a half\" kilogram of cocaine, but stated\nthat he knew they were different quantities.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fAt the conclusion of the Government's case, González and Ramos\n\nmoved for judgments of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a)3.\n\nThe court denied the motions.\n\n          González    presented   four   character   witnesses   on   his\n\nbehalf, all of whom testified that González was law-abiding and had\n\ngood character.    González and Ramos again moved for judgments of\n\nacquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a) after the defense case\n\nconcluded; the motions were denied.\n\n              C.     The Jury Charge and Verdict Form\n\n          At the conclusion of the trial, all parties attended a\n\njury charge conference.    At the conference, Ramos objected to the\n\nverdict form and requested a bifurcated verdict which would have\n\nrequired the jury to find the specific amount of drugs attributable\n\nto each defendant.    The court denied the request.     The court gave\n\nthe jury, in part, the following charge:\n\n          Count one of the indictment charges that the\n          defendants conspired with one another to\n          distribute controlled substances, that is to\n          say, five kilograms or more of cocaine and a\n          detectable amount of cocaine base, both\n          Schedule   II   narcotic   drug   controlled\n          substances. . . .     To find any defendant\n\n\n3\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a) provides: \"After the government closes\nits evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on\nthe defendant's motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any\noffense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a\nconviction. The court may on its own consider whether the evidence\nis insufficient to sustain a conviction. If the court denies a\nmotion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's\nevidence, the defendant may offer evidence without having reserved\nthe right to do so.\"\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          guilty of conspiracy to distribute controlled\n          [sic]   you  must   be   convinced  that   the\n          government has proven each of the following\n          things beyond a reasonable doubt: First, that\n          the agreement specified in the indictment, and\n          not some other agreement or agreements,\n          existed between at least two people to\n          distribute controlled substances; and Second,\n          that the defendants knowingly and willfully\n          joined in that agreement. . . .     To find a\n          defendant guilty of the offense charged in the\n          indictment, you do not have to find that the\n          defendant conspired to distribute the specific\n          amount of controlled substances alleged in the\n          indictment. To find a defendant guilty, you\n          need only find that he conspired to distribute\n          some quantity of controlled substances as\n          alleged in count one.     If you find that a\n          defendant   conspired   to   distribute   some\n          quantity of controlled substance, you will be\n          asked to make a special finding as to the\n          quantity of controlled substance that he\n          conspired to distribute. . . .            Both\n          defendants are named in count one of the\n          indictment. The evidence pertaining to each\n          defendant should be considered separately and\n          individually. The fact that you may find of\n          [sic] the defendants guilty or not guilty,\n          should not control your verdict as to the\n          other defendant.\n\n          Neither party objected to the jury charge.   The jury was\n\ngiven a verdict form which asked the jury to determine the guilt of\n\neach defendant and included a special interrogatory which asked the\n\njury to find if the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fwas five kilograms or more.4     At the request of the Government, the\n\nverdict form was read to the jury.\n\n           On July 12, 2004, the jury returned a verdict finding\n\nboth defendants guilty of the charged offenses and a special\n\nverdict   finding   that   the   amount   of     cocaine   involved   in   the\n\nconspiracy was five kilograms or more. After the verdict, González\n\nmade a renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal under Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29(c)(1),5 which was denied.             Ramos filed a motion to\n\nvacate the conviction and for a new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n33(a).6   The court denied the motion.\n\n\n\n\n4\n    The special interrogatory read, in part:\n\n\"3. A.    If you find either of the defendants guilty as to Count\nOne, do you find that the amount of cocaine involved in the\nconspiracy was five (5) kilograms or more:\n\n           ____                           ____\n           YES                             NO\n\n     If you answered YES to question 3(A), sign and date the\nverdict form. If you answered NO to question 3(A), then proceed to\nquestion 3(B).\"\n5\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c)(1) provides: \"A defendant may move for\na judgment of acquittal, or renew such a motion, within 7 days\nafter a guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury,\nwhichever is later.\"\n6\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a) provides: \"Upon the defendant's motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the\ninterest of justice so requires. If the case was tried without a\njury, the court may take additional testimony and enter a new\njudgment.\"\n\n                                   -8-\n\f                             D.   Sentencing\n\n            Pre-sentencing    reports    were   transmitted   to   both\n\ndefendants.     On December 23, 2004, the court held a sentencing\n\nhearing for González. During the hearing, González argued that the\n\ncourt needed to make an individualized finding of drug quantity.\n\nThe court responded that this was a matter reserved to the jury,\n\nand that the jury had already rendered a sufficient finding.       The\n\ncourt determined an offense level of thirty-two based on the\n\nminimum of five kilograms of cocaine involved in the conspiracy and\n\na criminal history category of I.          The sentencing guidelines\n\nrecommended a range of 121 to 151 months of imprisonment; González\n\nwas sentenced to 135 months in prison.\n\n            On April 8, 2005, the court held a sentencing hearing for\n\nRamos. The court determined that Ramos was a career offender under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, which gave him a criminal history category of VI.\n\nFor the conspiracy charge, the court determined an offense level of\n\nthirty-seven based on the minimum of five kilograms of cocaine\n\ninvolved in the conspiracy and the fact that Ramos was a career\n\noffender.     The sentencing guidelines recommended a range of 360\n\nmonths to life imprisonment; Ramos was sentenced to 365 months of\n\nimprisonment on the conspiracy charge. On the distribution charge,\n\nRamos was sentenced to sixty months of imprisonment to be served\n\nconsecutively with the sentence for conspiracy. González and Ramos\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fnow present various challenges to their convictions and sentences\n\non appeal.\n\n                                II.   Discussion\n\n              We will first address the claims made jointly by González\n\nand Ramos regarding the jury instructions and special verdict form,\n\nand then proceed to González's and Ramos' individual claims.\n\n         A.    The Jury Instructions and Special Verdict Form\n\n              The essence of González's and Ramos' appeals as to the\n\njury instructions and special verdict form can be boiled down to\n\ntwo arguments.       First, González and Ramos argue that to be found\n\nguilty of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, the jury\n\ninstructions and the special verdict form should have required the\n\njury to make individualized findings of the amount of cocaine\n\nattributable to each defendant rather than to the conspiracy as a\n\nwhole.   Second, González and Ramos argue that the Supreme Court's\n\nholdings in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), required individualized\n\nfindings as to drug quantity for the purposes of sentencing.               We\n\nfind both claims to be meritless.\n\n              In   order   to   determine    whether   \"all   factual   issues\n\nessential to the judgment . . . were fairly presented to the jury,\"\n\nwe review properly preserved objections to the trial court's jury\n\ninstructions and verdict forms de novo.            Sánchez-López v. Fuentes-\n\nPujols, 375 F.3d 121, 134 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fand citation omitted).              If the objection to jury instructions or\n\nverdict forms has not been properly preserved by the defendants, we\n\nreview newly raised objections using a plain error standard.7                     Id.\n\nTo satisfy the plain error standard, a criminal defendant must\n\nshow: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious\n\nand which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights,\n\nbut also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"               United States v. Duarte, 246\n\nF.3d   56,    60    (1st     Cir.    2001).      This   standard   is   exceedingly\n\ndifficult to satisfy in jury instruction cases: \"[T]he plain error\n\nhurdle, high in all events, nowhere looms larger than in the\n\ncontext      of    alleged    instructional       errors.\"    United     States   v.\n\nPaniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                             1.     The Jury Instructions\n\n              Neither González nor Ramos entered any objections to the\n\njury instructions.           Thus, we will look to see if the instructions\n\nconstituted plain error.               Our examination of jury instructions\n\nfocuses on \"whether they adequately explained the law or whether\n\n\n7\n    The Government suggests that by failing to raise their\nobjections at the time the jury was charged, González and Ramos\nhave waived, rather than forfeited their objections and that we may\nnot review their claims. However, as we noted in United States v.\nNelson-Rodríguez, for an objection based on Apprendi, \"[W]e think\nit sufficient if the defendant raises the issue at sentencing.\"\n319 F.3d 12, 47 (1st Cir. 2003).          Although there is some\ndiscrepancy between the parties as to whether the objection was\nraised by either or both parties during sentencing, \"we prefer to\nassume rather than decide that the issue was preserved in these\ncircumstances.\" Id. at 48.\n\n                                          -11-\n\fthey tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling\n\nissues.\"    Federico v. Order of Saint Benedict, 64 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).\n\n            González   and   Ramos       were   charged    with    conspiracy       to\n\ndistribute controlled substances under 21 U.S.C. § 846.                            The\n\nelements of a conspiracy are \"the existence of a conspiracy, the\n\ndefendant's   knowledge      of    the    conspiracy,     and    the     defendant's\n\nvoluntary   participation         in   the   conspiracy.\"       United    States   v.\n\nGómez-Pabón, 911 F.2d 847, 852 (1st Cir. 1990).                   The quantity of\n\ndrugs is not an element of conspiracy under § 846, nor is it an\n\nelement of the underlying controlled substances offense under § 841\n\n(a)(2).    See United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1160 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).8    The district court's instructions plainly instructed the\n\njury to consider the aforementioned elements of conspiracy for each\n\ndefendant, explicitly stating that, \"[T]he evidence pertaining to\n\neach defendant should be considered separately and individually.\"\n\n\n\n8\n   Some courts have suggested that, post-Apprendi, distinctions\nbetween sentencing factors and substantive elements of § 841 are\nsomewhat untenable. See, e.g., United States v. Westmoreland, 240\nF.3d 618, 632 (7th Cir. 2001) (\"In light of Apprendi, we could no\nlonger look to the clear demarcation between the elements of the\ncrime defined by § 841 and the penalty provisions of that section\nas a means of avoiding the constitutional issues raised by the\nplacement of drug quantity determination in the hands of the\nsentencing judge.\").    However, as we emphasize throughout this\nopinion, regardless of whether drug quantity is a sentencing factor\nor a substantive element, the drug quantity that determines the\nmaximum sentence for a drug conspiracy charge under § 846 is the\nconspiracy-wide quantity, which the jury did determine in the\npresent case.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fIt was only after each defendant's culpability was determined\n\nindividually that the jury was asked to find the conspiracy-wide\n\ndrug quantity--a finding that the court would need for sentencing.\n\nAs we have stated, \"the maximum statutory penalty available to the\n\ndistrict court at sentencing for a defendant convicted of a drug\n\nconspiracy is based on the drug quantity and amount reflected in\n\nthe jury verdict attributable to the conspiracy as a whole.\"\n\nUnited States v. Irizarry, 404 F.3d 497, 504 (1st Cir. 2005).9\n\nBecause the jury was instructed to consider the charges against\n\neach defendant individually, the instructions did not constitute\n\nerror as to the finding of guilt.\n\n          Furthermore, the jury instructions did not constitute\n\nerror under Apprendi or Blakely, which require a jury to make a\n\nfactual finding for any element which increases a defendant's\n\nsentence beyond the statutory maximum penalty.    530 U.S. at 490;\n\n542 U.S. at 301.   The district court instructed the jury to find\n\nthe amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy as a whole.10   The\n\n\n9\n   This is also clear from the language of the statute, which,\nwithout any reference to an individual's role in a conspiracy, says\nthat \"[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit [a\ncontrolled substance offense] shall be subject to the same\npenalties as those prescribed for the offense.\" 21 U.S.C. § 846\n(2006).\n10\n   We do not see any merit to Ramos' claim that the instructions\nwere flawed because they make reference only to cocaine.\nParticipation in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine alone would be\nsufficient to sustain a conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 846, and much\nevidence regarding to Ramos' involvement in the processing and\nselling of cocaine was presented at trial. The fact that Ramos was\n\n                               -13-\n\famount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy sets the statutory\n\nmaximum penalty for § 846.      Irizarry, 404 F.3d at 504.     Thus, the\n\ninstructions   to   determine   only   the   conspiracy-wide   amount   of\n\ncocaine posed no risk that the jury would fail to find an element\n\nof the offense that increased the statutory maximum penalty.\n\nAccordingly, the jury instructions did not constitute error as to\n\nsentencing.\n\n                     2.   The Special Verdict Form\n\n            Because Ramos made a timely objection to the verdict\n\nform, we will review the verdict form de novo as to his claims.\n\nGonzález made no such objection; his claims will be reviewed for\n\nplain error.    The purpose of a special verdict form is to allow\n\n\"juries to specifically identify the predicates for the general\n\nverdict.\"     United States v. Cianci, 378 F.3d 71, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   In the present case, the verdict form asked the jury to\n\nmake a finding of guilty or not guilty as to each defendant for\n\neach charge and then, if either defendant was found guilty, asked\n\nthe jury to determine the amount of cocaine involved in the\n\nconspiracy.    As we have already stated, neither the offense of\n\nconspiracy, Lindia, 82 F.3d at 1160, nor the determination of the\n\nmaximum penalty for conspiracy, Irizarry, 404 F.3d at 504, requires\n\nan individualized finding of the amount of drugs attributable to a\n\n\n\nalso involved in trafficking of heroin and marijuana would not\nchange the outcome of the case.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fspecific defendant.         Rather, the amount of drugs involved in the\n\nconspiracy as a whole is a predicate for sentencing purposes.               See\n\nid.    Because the special verdict form provided for individualized\n\nfindings of guilt on each charge, the special verdict form would\n\nnot have misled or confused the jury as to their determination of\n\nguilt.    Thus, the special verdict form did not constitute error as\n\nto the finding of guilt.\n\n              Furthermore, there were no Apprendi or Blakely errors in\n\nthe special verdict form.         The jury used the special verdict form\n\nto make a finding of conspiracy-wide drug quantity.              The quantity\n\nof    drugs   in    the   conspiracy   determines    the   statutory   maximum\n\nsentence.11        See Irizarry, 404 F.3d at 504.           Thus, because the\n\nstatutory     maximum     was   determined    by   the   conspiracy-wide   drug\n\nquantity, there was no need under Apprendi or Blakely for the\n\nspecial verdict form to allow jurors to make an individualized\n\ndetermination of drug quantity for each defendant.               Accordingly,\n\nthe special verdict form did not constitute error as to sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n11\n    González suggests that jurors were \"puzzled\" at the special\ninterrogatories asking them to determine \"artificial floors\"\ncorresponding to the amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy.\nThese floors determine the maximum sentences prescribed in 21\nU.S.C. § 841(b).     Given the extensive testimony in the case\nregarding the quantity of drugs flowing through the Malvinas drug\npoint, we think the jury was up to the task of determining whether\nthe conspiracy involved more or less than five kilograms of\ncocaine.\n\n                                       -15-\n\f                         B.   Claims Raised by González\n\n            González raises two claims: that there was insufficient\n\nevidence    to    find     him    guilty      of    conspiracy    to     commit   drug\n\ntrafficking under 21 U.S.C. § 846 and that the sentence he received\n\nwas not issued in accordance with our decisions in United States v.\n\nColón-Solís,      354    F.3d    101   (1st    Cir.    2004),    United    States   v.\n\nVásquez-Molina, 389 F.3d 54 (1st Cir. 2004), or the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).\n\n                         1.   Insufficiency of Evidence\n\n            González argues that the evidence presented at trial was\n\ninsufficient for a jury to find him guilty of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute cocaine.           We will review de novo a district court's\n\ndenial of a defendant's motion for acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n29.   United States v. Rivera Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 266 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   The standard is whether the evidence, \"taken in the light\n\nmost amicable to the prosecution, together with all reasonable\n\ninferences favorable to it, would allow a rational fact-finder to\n\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty as\n\ncharged.\"    United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 523 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).      The    Government       \"need     not     exclude    every    reasonable\n\nhypothesis of innocence, provided the record as a whole supports a\n\nconclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"                   United States v.\n\nVictoria-Peguero, 920 F.2d 77, 86-87 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f            González    was    charged     with    conspiracy      to    distribute\n\ncocaine under 21 U.S.C. § 846.           To prove that González was guilty\n\nof conspiracy to distribute cocaine, the Government needed to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt \"that an agreement existed to commit the\n\nunderlying substantive offense (here, the distribution of drugs),\n\nthat the defendant knew of the agreement, and that he opted to join\n\nin it, intending to commit the substantive offense.\" United States\n\nv. Gómez, 255 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2001).                 During the trial, the\n\nGovernment offered testimony from an FBI agent, a Police of Puerto\n\nRico officer, two cooperating witnesses, as well as hours of\n\nvideotape     that,    taken   in    the   light      most    favorable     to   the\n\nprosecution, shows that Rivera and others agreed to distribute\n\ncocaine and other drugs at the Malvinas drug point.                    A jury could\n\nreasonably    infer    from    the   testimony        of   the   two    cooperating\n\nwitnesses regarding the sales of cocaine by González to Rivera, the\n\naudiotape recordings of González's conversations, and the presence\n\nof González's name in the ledger, that González was aware of the\n\nconspiracy to distribute controlled substances.                  See United States\n\nv. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[F]actfinders may\n\ndraw reasonable inferences from the evidence based on shared\n\nperceptions    and    understandings       of   the    habits,     practices,    and\n\ninclinations of human beings.\").           A jury could further infer from\n\nthe testimony about González's regular sales of cocaine to Rivera\n\nthat González joined the agreement for the purpose of and with the\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\fintent to distribute cocaine.        In light of the substantial amount\n\nof evidence presented, the fact that one witness could not explain\n\nthe difference between an eighth and a half kilogram of cocaine or\n\nthat another witness described the drugs as \"stones\" or \"bricks\"\n\ndoes not make irrational the jury's conclusion that González was\n\nguilty of conspiracy.    See United States v. Nishnianidze, 342 F.3d\n\n6, 14 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[T]he jury's duty is to assess credibility,\n\nand it may accept or reject, in whole or in part, any testimony.\").\n\nAccordingly,   we   believe   that    the   court   was   correct   to   deny\n\nGonzález's motion for acquittal.\n\n                         2.   Sentencing Errors\n\n          González challenges his sentence on the ground that the\n\ndistrict court refused to make an individualized finding of the\n\nquantity of drugs that could be attributed to his participation in\n\nthe conspiracy.     Since González challenges the sentencing court's\n\nconclusion of law that such a finding was unnecessary, we will\n\nreview it de novo.     United States v. Brennick, 337 F.3d 107, 110\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          In Colón-Solís, we held that \"when a district court\n\ndetermines drug quantity for the purpose of sentencing a defendant\n\nconvicted of participating in a drug-trafficking conspiracy, the\n\ncourt is required to make an individualized finding as to drug\n\namounts attributable to, or foreseeable by, that defendant.\"             354\n\nF.3d at 103.   A defendant can only be sentenced on the basis of\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fdrugs he handled, anticipated handling, or for drugs he could\n\nreasonably foresee being used in the conspiracy; all of the drugs\n\nin a conspiracy may not be automatically assigned to an individual\n\ndefendant.    United States v. Sepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1197 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n          Both    González   and   the     Government   agree   that   the\n\nsentencing court failed to make such an individualized finding and\n\nthat this constitutes error.        Their only difference is remedy:\n\nGonzález believes that the jury needed to determine drug quantity\n\nand thus a new trial is merited, whereas the Government believes\n\nthat a judge could make the determination without the jury and\n\nresentencing would be sufficient.         On this subject, we have been\n\nquite clear: \"[O]nce the jury has determined that the conspiracy\n\ninvolved a type and quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a\n\nsentence above the default statutory maximum and has found a\n\nparticular defendant guilty of participation in the conspiracy, the\n\njudge lawfully may determine the drug quantity attributable to that\n\ndefendant and sentence him accordingly.\"       Derman v. United States,\n\n298 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 2002).           The principal enunciated in\n\nDerman survives the Supreme Court's subsequent decisions in Blakely\n\nand Booker.    See United States v. Malouf, No. 05-2245 (1st Cir.\n\nOct. 13, 2006).      Consequently, we remand González's case for\n\nresentencing in accordance with our decisions.          Because we have\n\nremanded González's case for resentencing on this ground, we do not\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fneed to decide now the merits of González's other sentencing\n\nclaims.\n\n                        C.    Claims Raised by Ramos\n\n              Ramos makes two claims.        First, Ramos argues that the\n\ntrial   was    flawed   because     jury   selection   violated   the   Sixth\n\nAmendment and the Supreme Court's decisions in Taylor v. Louisiana,\n\n419 U.S. 522 (1975), and Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357 (1979),\n\nrequiring that juries be selected from a pool representative of the\n\ncommunity at large.          Ramos argues that the jury pool was flawed\n\nbecause it did not include persons who lived in public housing.\n\nSecond, Ramos argues that his sentence was flawed under Apprendi,\n\n530 U.S. 366, and United States v. Vaughn, 430 F.3d 518 (2d Cir.\n\n2005), because the jury did not find that Ramos was individually\n\ninvolved in the distribution of five kilograms of cocaine and thus\n\nthe court could not sentence him using the maximum penalty set by\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).\n\n                              1.   Jury Selection\n\n              We review de novo a district court's rulings of law.\n\nUnited States v. Royal, 174 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).                    The\n\ndistrict court denied Ramos' motion for a new trial on the ground\n\nthat the jury pool was unfairly composed.           In order to establish a\n\nclaim that the jury selection process violates the constitutional\n\nrequirement that the jury be selected from a pool representative of\n\nthe community at large, the challenging party must establish: \"(1)\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fthat the group alleged to be excluded is a 'distinctive' group in\n\nthe community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires\n\nfrom which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in\n\nrelation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3)\n\nthat this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the\n\ngroup in the jury-selection process.\"    United States v. Benjamin,\n\n252 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing Duren, 439 U.S. at 364).\n\nThe burden is on the challenging party to establish a case of\n\nunconstitutional underrepresentation.    United States v. Pion, 25\n\nF.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n          Ramos has presented no evidence that would establish any\n\none of the three prongs of the Duren test.   As for the first prong,\n\nRamos admits that there is no case law supporting the argument that\n\npublic housing residents are a distinctive group.      Ramos argues\n\nthat public housing residents form a distinctive group because the\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development restricts eligibility\n\nfor public housing.    This argument is clearly insufficient -- it\n\nwould allow a defendant to make a constitutional claim out of the\n\nfact that a jury pool lacked a person from any group that limits\n\nits membership.   See United States v. Lynch, 792 F.2d 269, 271 (1st\n\nCir. 1986) (\"[I]f this grouping qualifies as a 'cognizable group'\n\nfor purposes of Duren v. Missouri analysis, it is hard to see what\n\ngrouping will not similarly qualify. The result could soon be that\n\nany defendant showing that the venire deviated statistically from\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fa perfect community cross-section would have established a prima\n\nfacie violation of the Sixth Amendment.\").\n\n            Furthermore, Ramos has presented no evidence that the\n\nrepresentation of public housing residents in the jury pool is\n\nunfairly or unreasonably disproportionate.       Counsel for Ramos told\n\nthe court that he estimated that public housing residents formed\n\nbetween 30% and 40% of Puerto Rico's population but offered no\n\nsupport for this contention. Ramos now uses the population of just\n\none of ten public housing projects in Caguas, a town of 142,161\n\nresidents, to conclude that 10% is a \"fair estimate\" of the\n\nproportion of the population of Puerto Rico living in public\n\nhousing.    No reasonable person would find this evidence sufficient\n\nto establish that, because a jury pool of fifty-six persons had no\n\npublic   housing   residents,   they   are   unfairly   or   unreasonably\n\nunderrepresented in juries.\n\n            Lastly, Ramos presents no evidence that there has been a\n\nsystematic exclusion of public housing residents. To the contrary,\n\nas the Government points out, the Jury Plan for the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico forms its jury pool\n\nfrom voter registration lists, a method previously upheld by this\n\ncourt.     See United States v. Butera, 420 F.2d 564, 573 (1st Cir.\n\n1970) (\"It has become well-established that voter registration\n\nlists are appropriate for use in jury selection systems.\"). Jurors\n\nare also required to be United States citizens, at least eighteen\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fyears old, and residents of Puerto Rico for at least one year, none\n\nof which would suggest systematic exclusion of public housing\n\nresidents.    Last, jurors are required to be proficient in English,\n\na requirement we have held to be justified by \"the overwhelming\n\nnational interest served by the use of English in a United States\n\ncourt.\"   United States v. Aponte-Suárez, 905 F.2d 483, 492 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).    Accordingly, we do not find that Ramos has sustained\n\nhis Sixth Amendment claim regarding jury selection.\n\n                        2.   Sentencing Error\n\n          We review the legal conclusions of a sentencing court de\n\nnovo but apply a clear error standard to the factual determinations\n\nof the court.    United States v. Mateo, 271 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n2001). Ramos argues that his sentence violates the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Apprendi, 530 U.S. 466, as interpreted by United States\n\nv. Vaughn, 430 F.2d 518, 525 (2d Cir. 2005), because the jury did\n\nnot make an individualized finding that he was involved with more\n\nthan five kilograms of cocaine.12   Specifically, Ramos argues that,\n\n\n12\n   Because he was sentenced as a career offender, Ramos does not\nmake the argument, as González did, that his sentence was flawed\nunder Colón-Solís, 354 F.3d 101.      Under Sentencing Guidelines\n§ 4B1.1, a career offender, such as Ramos, convicted of an offense\nfor which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, such as\nconspiracy to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, is\nassigned an offense level of 37. Based on an offense level of 37\nand a criminal history category of VI, the sentencing guidelines\nrecommend a sentence range of 360 months to life imprisonment.\nU.S.S.G. § 5A. Thus, unlike González, for whom sentencing required\nan individualized determination of drug quantity under U.S.S.G.\n§§ 1B1.3 and 2D1.1(c), the determination of Ramos' sentence was\nbased solely on his prior criminal history.\n\n                                 -23-\n\fbecause the jury did not find that he was individually involved\n\nwith all five kilograms of cocaine, the maximum sentence should be\n\ndictated by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(c), which provides a maximum\n\nsentence of twenty years for the distribution of any amount of a\n\ncontrolled substance.\n\n            In Apprendi, the Supreme Court stated that \"any fact that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum must be submitted to a jury.\"            530 U.S. at 490.      A jury\n\nfound Ramos guilty of conspiracy to distribute cocaine under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846.    Section 846 provides that a person found guilty of\n\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine shall be subject to the penalties\n\nfor the offense that was the subject of the conspiracy.                    Thus,\n\nregardless of the amount of cocaine that he was individually\n\ninvolved in distributing, Ramos was subject to the penalty imposed\n\nfor   the   conspiracy-wide      amount   of   cocaine.     After    extensive\n\ntestimony by multiple witnesses about the precise quantities of\n\ncocaine that passed through the Las Malvinas drug point on a weekly\n\nbasis, the jury found in its special verdict that the conspiracy\n\ninvolved the distribution of five or more kilograms of cocaine.\n\nUnder 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(1), the maximum penalty for the\n\ndistribution    of   five   or    more    kilograms   of   cocaine    is   life\n\nimprisonment.    Accordingly, life imprisonment is also the maximum\n\npenalty for participation in a conspiracy to distribute five or\n\nmore kilograms of cocaine.         Ramos was sentenced to 365 months of\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fimprisonment for his participation in the conspiracy.                       Because\n\nRamos' sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum penalty, there\n\ncan be no Apprendi error.        See United States v. Johnstone, 251 F.3d\n\n281, 285 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"No Apprendi violation occurs, however,\n\nwhen the district court sentences a defendant below the statutory\n\nmaximum.\").      The district court sentenced Ramos to 365 months of\n\nimprisonment because it found that Ramos was a career offender\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, and the sentencing guidelines recommended\n\na sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment.                 As we have\n\nstated previously, a sentence that is less than the statutory\n\nmaximum   penalty       does   not    violate    Apprendi     \"even    if   a   fact\n\ndetermined by the court under a preponderance standard lengthens\n\nthe sentence imposed.\"           Johnstone, 251 F.3d at 285; see also\n\nVaughn, 430 F.2d at 525 (\"[D]istrict courts' authority to determine\n\nsentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence endures and\n\ndoes not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\").\n\nAccordingly, Ramos' claim of improper sentencing is meritless.\n\n                                III. Conclusion\n\n           For    the    reasons     stated     above,   we   vacate   González's\n\nsentence and remand the matter of González's sentencing to the\n\ndistrict court for an individualized determination of drug quantity\n\nattributable to González.            With respect to all other matters, we\n\naffirm the decisions of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\f          The conviction and sentence in No. 05-1758 is affirmed.\n\nThe conviction in No. 05-1184 is affirmed.   The sentence in No. 05-\n\n1184 is vacated and that case is remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f",

On July 12, 2004, a jury\n\nconvicted Rafael A. González-Vélez (\"González\") and José A. Ramos-\n\nRomero   (\"Ramos\")   of   one    count   of       conspiracy   to   distribute   a\n\ncontrolled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846. In addition,\n\nRamos was convicted of distribution of a controlled substance in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(2).           Ramos and González now appeal\n\ntheir convictions and their sentences.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n           Between    2000   and     2002,    a    drug   point   known   as   \"Las\n\nMalvinas\" was operated in the Luis Lloréns Torres housing project\n\nin Puerto Rico.      José Luis Rivera González (\"Rivera\") headed the\n\ndrug point until his death in 2002.           Between the summer of 2001 and\n\nOctober 2002, the FBI and the Police of Puerto Rico conducted an\n\ninvestigation of the drug point.         This investigation culminated in\n\na grand jury indictment on February 13, 2003 against nine persons\n\nincluding González and Ramos.         The indictment charged González and\n\nRamos with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances including\n\ncocaine, crack cocaine, heroin and marijuana in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846.   The indictment also charged Ramos with distribution\n\nof a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(2).\n\nFive of the seven other defendants charged in the indictment\n\npleaded guilty; two others were tried separately.                   González and\n\nRamos proceeded to trial on June 30, 2004.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f                            A.    Jury Selection\n\n            Fifty-six jurors were summoned and appeared for trial.\n\nDuring voir dire, González requested and the district court agreed\n\nto ask potential jurors whether they lived or had lived in a public\n\nhousing project. No juror answered affirmatively. After voir dire\n\nconcluded   and    the   jury    was   announced,     Ramos    objected    to   the\n\ncomposition of the jury, arguing that it had \"probably no poor\n\nclass or anybody relating to the public housing residence\" and that\n\npublic   housing    residents     formed      a   distinct    class.1     González\n\nconcurred in Ramos' objection. The court overruled the defendants'\n\nobjection to jury composition.\n\n                                 B.    The Trial\n\n            At trial, the Government presented testimony from FBI\n\nAgent William Ortiz regarding his surveillance of the Malvinas drug\n\npoint.   The Government also presented four hours and thirty-five\n\nminutes of videotapes from a surveillance camera placed near the\n\ndrug point that showed numerous drug transactions.                      Police of\n\nPuerto Rico Officer Felipe Casiano Caraballo (\"Casiano\") testified\n\nthat he had observed both Ramos and González near the drug point\n\nand had \"intervened\" with Ramos on a number of occasions.                        On\n\ncross-examination, Casiano admitted that he had never observed\n\n\n\n1\n  Counsel for Ramos stated \"[The] percentage of people who live in\npublic housing, this is maybe thirty or forty percent of the\ngeneral population, and [Ramos] is being excluded and prejudiced\nbecause of this.\"\n\n                                        -4-\n\fGonzález committing a crime.           Jesús Matías Cruz (\"Matías\"), a\n\ncooperating witness, testified that he had observed drug sales at\n\nthe drug point and had observed Ramos with two weapons while in the\n\ncompany of Rivera.    Matías also testified that he and Ramos \"cut\"\n\na \"baseball-sized\" rock of crack for packaging, during which Ramos\n\ntold him that the rock had been provided by González.               Matías\n\nfurther testified that he had overheard Rivera asking González for\n\n\"pepper,\" which was purportedly a code-word for cocaine, and that\n\nhe later observed González providing Rivera with a large plastic\n\nbag with \"stones\" or \"bricks\" inside. Matías also made a recording\n\nof a conversation between Rivera and González about the packaging,\n\nprocessing, and payment for cocaine.          In addition, Angel Obregón\n\nFontánez   (\"Obregón\"),   one    of    the   defendants   charged   in    the\n\nindictment who pleaded guilty, testified that he had observed\n\nGonzález   selling   between    one-eighth    and   one-half   kilogram   of\n\ncocaine on credit to Rivera.2         Obregón also testified that Ramos\n\nwas a processor of drugs and a \"triggerman\" for the enterprise.\n\nLastly, the Government offered physical evidence, including a\n\nnotebook (the \"ledger\") containing records of cocaine transactions\n\ninvolving a person named \"Junito,\" which was González's nickname.\n\n\n2\n  The number and scope of transactions is in dispute. After being\nasked whether he had observed González engage in more than ten drug\nsales to Rivera, Obregón said \"Yes.\"          However, on cross-\nexamination, Obregón said that he had seen \"a couple.\"           In\naddition, Obregón could not explain the difference in quantity\nbetween \"an eighth\" and \"a half\" kilogram of cocaine, but stated\nthat he knew they were different quantities.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fAt the conclusion of the Government's case, González and Ramos\n\nmoved for judgments of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a)3.\n\nThe court denied the motions.\n\n          González    presented   four   character   witnesses   on   his\n\nbehalf, all of whom testified that González was law-abiding and had\n\ngood character.    González and Ramos again moved for judgments of\n\nacquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a) after the defense case\n\nconcluded; the motions were denied.\n\n              C.     The Jury Charge and Verdict Form\n\n          At the conclusion of the trial, all parties attended a\n\njury charge conference.    At the conference, Ramos objected to the\n\nverdict form and requested a bifurcated verdict which would have\n\nrequired the jury to find the specific amount of drugs attributable\n\nto each defendant.    The court denied the request.     The court gave\n\nthe jury, in part, the following charge:\n\n          Count one of the indictment charges that the\n          defendants conspired with one another to\n          distribute controlled substances, that is to\n          say, five kilograms or more of cocaine and a\n          detectable amount of cocaine base, both\n          Schedule   II   narcotic   drug   controlled\n          substances. . . .     To find any defendant\n\n\n3\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a) provides: \"After the government closes\nits evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on\nthe defendant's motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any\noffense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a\nconviction. The court may on its own consider whether the evidence\nis insufficient to sustain a conviction. If the court denies a\nmotion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government's\nevidence, the defendant may offer evidence without having reserved\nthe right to do so.\"\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          guilty of conspiracy to distribute controlled\n          [sic]   you  must   be   convinced  that   the\n          government has proven each of the following\n          things beyond a reasonable doubt: First, that\n          the agreement specified in the indictment, and\n          not some other agreement or agreements,\n          existed between at least two people to\n          distribute controlled substances; and Second,\n          that the defendants knowingly and willfully\n          joined in that agreement. . . .     To find a\n          defendant guilty of the offense charged in the\n          indictment, you do not have to find that the\n          defendant conspired to distribute the specific\n          amount of controlled substances alleged in the\n          indictment. To find a defendant guilty, you\n          need only find that he conspired to distribute\n          some quantity of controlled substances as\n          alleged in count one.     If you find that a\n          defendant   conspired   to   distribute   some\n          quantity of controlled substance, you will be\n          asked to make a special finding as to the\n          quantity of controlled substance that he\n          conspired to distribute. . . .            Both\n          defendants are named in count one of the\n          indictment. The evidence pertaining to each\n          defendant should be considered separately and\n          individually. The fact that you may find of\n          [sic] the defendants guilty or not guilty,\n          should not control your verdict as to the\n          other defendant.\n\n          Neither party objected to the jury charge.   The jury was\n\ngiven a verdict form which asked the jury to determine the guilt of\n\neach defendant and included a special interrogatory which asked the\n\njury to find if the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fwas five kilograms or more.4     At the request of the Government, the\n\nverdict form was read to the jury.\n\n           On July 12, 2004, the jury returned a verdict finding\n\nboth defendants guilty of the charged offenses and a special\n\nverdict   finding   that   the   amount   of     cocaine   involved   in   the\n\nconspiracy was five kilograms or more. After the verdict, González\n\nmade a renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal under Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29(c)(1),5 which was denied.             Ramos filed a motion to\n\nvacate the conviction and for a new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n33(a).6   The court denied the motion.\n\n\n\n\n4\n    The special interrogatory read, in part:\n\n\"3. A.    If you find either of the defendants guilty as to Count\nOne, do you find that the amount of cocaine involved in the\nconspiracy was five (5) kilograms or more:\n\n           ____                           ____\n           YES                             NO\n\n     If you answered YES to question 3(A), sign and date the\nverdict form. If you answered NO to question 3(A), then proceed to\nquestion 3(B).\"\n5\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c)(1) provides: \"A defendant may move for\na judgment of acquittal, or renew such a motion, within 7 days\nafter a guilty verdict or after the court discharges the jury,\nwhichever is later.\"\n6\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a) provides: \"Upon the defendant's motion,\nthe court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the\ninterest of justice so requires. If the case was tried without a\njury, the court may take additional testimony and enter a new\njudgment.\"\n\n                                   -8-\n\f                             D.   Sentencing\n\n            Pre-sentencing    reports    were   transmitted   to   both\n\ndefendants.     On December 23, 2004, the court held a sentencing\n\nhearing for González. During the hearing, González argued that the\n\ncourt needed to make an individualized finding of drug quantity.\n\nThe court responded that this was a matter reserved to the jury,\n\nand that the jury had already rendered a sufficient finding.       The\n\ncourt determined an offense level of thirty-two based on the\n\nminimum of five kilograms of cocaine involved in the conspiracy and\n\na criminal history category of I.          The sentencing guidelines\n\nrecommended a range of 121 to 151 months of imprisonment; González\n\nwas sentenced to 135 months in prison.\n\n            On April 8, 2005, the court held a sentencing hearing for\n\nRamos. The court determined that Ramos was a career offender under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, which gave him a criminal history category of VI.\n\nFor the conspiracy charge, the court determined an offense level of\n\nthirty-seven based on the minimum of five kilograms of cocaine\n\ninvolved in the conspiracy and the fact that Ramos was a career\n\noffender.     The sentencing guidelines recommended a range of 360\n\nmonths to life imprisonment; Ramos was sentenced to 365 months of\n\nimprisonment on the conspiracy charge. On the distribution charge,\n\nRamos was sentenced to sixty months of imprisonment to be served\n\nconsecutively with the sentence for conspiracy. González and Ramos\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fnow present various challenges to their convictions and sentences\n\non appeal.\n\n                                II.   Discussion\n\n              We will first address the claims made jointly by González\n\nand Ramos regarding the jury instructions and special verdict form,\n\nand then proceed to González's and Ramos' individual claims.\n\n         A.    The Jury Instructions and Special Verdict Form\n\n              The essence of González's and Ramos' appeals as to the\n\njury instructions and special verdict form can be boiled down to\n\ntwo arguments.       First, González and Ramos argue that to be found\n\nguilty of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, the jury\n\ninstructions and the special verdict form should have required the\n\njury to make individualized findings of the amount of cocaine\n\nattributable to each defendant rather than to the conspiracy as a\n\nwhole.   Second, González and Ramos argue that the Supreme Court's\n\nholdings in Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), and\n\nBlakely v.

We\n\nfind both claims to be meritless.\n\n              In   order   to   determine    whether   \"all   factual   issues\n\nessential to the judgment . . . were fairly presented to the jury,\"\n\nwe review properly preserved objections to the trial court's jury\n\ninstructions and verdict forms de novo.

If the objection to jury instructions or\n\nverdict forms has not been properly preserved by the defendants, we\n\nreview newly raised objections using a plain error standard.7                     Id.\n\nTo satisfy the plain error standard, a criminal defendant must\n\nshow: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious\n\nand which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights,\n\nbut also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"               United States v.

Thus, we will look to see if the instructions\n\nconstituted plain error.               Our examination of jury instructions\n\nfocuses on \"whether they adequately explained the law or whether\n\n\n7\n    The Government suggests that by failing to raise their\nobjections at the time the jury was charged, González and Ramos\nhave waived, rather than forfeited their objections and that we may\nnot review their claims.

However, as we emphasize throughout this\nopinion, regardless of whether drug quantity is a sentencing factor\nor a substantive element, the drug quantity that determines the\nmaximum sentence for a drug conspiracy charge under § 846 is the\nconspiracy-wide quantity, which the jury did determine in the\npresent case.\n\n                                         -12-\n\fIt was only after each defendant's culpability was determined\n\nindividually that the jury was asked to find the conspiracy-wide\n\ndrug quantity--a finding that the court would need for sentencing.\n\nAs we have stated, \"the maximum statutory penalty available to the\n\ndistrict court at sentencing for a defendant convicted of a drug\n\nconspiracy is based on the drug quantity and amount reflected in\n\nthe jury verdict attributable to the conspiracy as a whole.\"\n\nUnited States v.

The district court instructed the jury to find\n\nthe amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy as a whole.10   The\n\n\n9\n   This is also clear from the language of the statute, which,\nwithout any reference to an individual's role in a conspiracy, says\nthat \"[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit [a\ncontrolled substance offense] shall be subject to the same\npenalties as those prescribed for the offense.\" 21 U.S.C. § 846\n(2006).\n10\n   We do not see any merit to Ramos' claim that the instructions\nwere flawed because they make reference only to cocaine.\nParticipation in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine alone would be\nsufficient to sustain a conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 846, and much\nevidence regarding to Ramos' involvement in the processing and\nselling of cocaine was presented at trial. The fact that Ramos was\n\n                               -13-\n\famount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy sets the statutory\n\nmaximum penalty for § 846.      Irizarry, 404 F.3d at 504.     Thus, the\n\ninstructions   to   determine   only   the   conspiracy-wide   amount   of\n\ncocaine posed no risk that the jury would fail to find an element\n\nof the offense that increased the statutory maximum penalty.\n\nAccordingly, the jury instructions did not constitute error as to\n\nsentencing.\n\n                     2.   The Special Verdict Form\n\n            Because Ramos made a timely objection to the verdict\n\nform, we will review the verdict form de novo as to his claims.\n\nGonzález made no such objection; his claims will be reviewed for\n\nplain error.    The purpose of a special verdict form is to allow\n\n\"juries to specifically identify the predicates for the general\n\nverdict.\"     United States v. Cianci, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787192\"><a href=\"/opinion/787192/united-states-v-vincent-a-cianci-jr-frank-e-corrente-and-richard-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   In the present case, the verdict form asked the jury to\n\nmake a finding of guilty or not guilty as to each defendant for\n\neach charge and then, if either defendant was found guilty, asked\n\nthe jury to determine the amount of cocaine involved in the\n\nconspiracy.    As we have already stated, neither the offense of\n\nconspiracy, Lindia, 82 F.3d at 1160, nor the determination of the\n\nmaximum penalty for conspiracy, Irizarry, 404 F.3d at 504, requires\n\nan individualized finding of the amount of drugs attributable to a\n\n\n\nalso involved in trafficking of heroin and marijuana would not\nchange the outcome of the case.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fspecific defendant.         Rather, the amount of drugs involved in the\n\nconspiracy as a whole is a predicate for sentencing purposes.               See\n\nid.    Because the special verdict form provided for individualized\n\nfindings of guilt on each charge, the special verdict form would\n\nnot have misled or confused the jury as to their determination of\n\nguilt.    Thus, the special verdict form did not constitute error as\n\nto the finding of guilt.\n\n              Furthermore, there were no Apprendi or Blakely errors in\n\nthe special verdict form.         The jury used the special verdict form\n\nto make a finding of conspiracy-wide drug quantity.              The quantity\n\nof    drugs   in    the   conspiracy   determines    the   statutory   maximum\n\nsentence.11        See Irizarry, 404 F.3d at 504.           Thus, because the\n\nstatutory     maximum     was   determined    by   the   conspiracy-wide   drug\n\nquantity, there was no need under Apprendi or Blakely for the\n\nspecial verdict form to allow jurors to make an individualized\n\ndetermination of drug quantity for each defendant.               Accordingly,\n\nthe special verdict form did not constitute error as to sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n11\n    González suggests that jurors were \"puzzled\" at the special\ninterrogatories asking them to determine \"artificial floors\"\ncorresponding to the amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy.\nThese floors determine the maximum sentences prescribed in 21\nU.S.C. § 841(b).     Given the extensive testimony in the case\nregarding the quantity of drugs flowing through the Malvinas drug\npoint, we think the jury was up to the task of determining whether\nthe conspiracy involved more or less than five kilograms of\ncocaine.\n\n                                       -15-\n\f                         B.

Ramos argues\n\nthat public housing residents form a distinctive group because the\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development restricts eligibility\n\nfor public housing.    This argument is clearly insufficient -- it\n\nwould allow a defendant to make a constitutional claim out of the\n\nfact that a jury pool lacked a person from any group that limits\n\nits membership.

Counsel for Ramos told\n\nthe court that he estimated that public housing residents formed\n\nbetween 30% and 40% of Puerto Rico's population but offered no\n\nsupport for this contention. Ramos now uses the population of just\n\none of ten public housing projects in Caguas, a town of 142,161\n\nresidents, to conclude that 10% is a \"fair estimate\" of the\n\nproportion of the population of Puerto Rico living in public\n\nhousing.

Vaughn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525 (2d Cir. 2005), because the jury did\n\nnot make an individualized finding that he was involved with more\n\nthan five kilograms of cocaine.12   Specifically, Ramos argues that,\n\n\n12\n   Because he was sentenced as a career offender, Ramos does not\nmake the argument, as González did, that his sentence was flawed\nunder Colón-Solís, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200804\"><a href=\"/opinion/200804/united-states-v-colon-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.      Under Sentencing Guidelines\n§ 4B1.1, a career offender, such as Ramos, convicted of an offense\nfor which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, such as\nconspiracy to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, is\nassigned an offense level of 37. Based on an offense level of 37\nand a criminal history category of VI, the sentencing guidelines\nrecommend a sentence range of 360 months to life imprisonment.\nU.S.S.G. § 5A. Thus, unlike González, for whom sentencing required\nan individualized determination of drug quantity under U.S.S.G.\n§§ 1B1.3 and 2D1.1(c), the determination of Ramos' sentence was\nbased solely on his prior criminal history.\n\n                                 -23-\n\fbecause the jury did not find that he was individually involved\n\nwith all five kilograms of cocaine, the maximum sentence should be\n\ndictated by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(c), which provides a maximum\n\nsentence of twenty years for the distribution of any amount of a\n\ncontrolled substance.\n\n            In Apprendi, the Supreme Court stated that \"any fact that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum must be submitted to a jury.\"            530 U.S. at 490.      A jury\n\nfound Ramos guilty of conspiracy to distribute cocaine under 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846.    Section 846 provides that a person found guilty of\n\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine shall be subject to the penalties\n\nfor the offense that was the subject of the conspiracy.                    Thus,\n\nregardless of the amount of cocaine that he was individually\n\ninvolved in distributing, Ramos was subject to the penalty imposed\n\nfor   the   conspiracy-wide      amount   of   cocaine.     After    extensive\n\ntestimony by multiple witnesses about the precise quantities of\n\ncocaine that passed through the Las Malvinas drug point on a weekly\n\nbasis, the jury found in its special verdict that the conspiracy\n\ninvolved the distribution of five or more kilograms of cocaine.\n\nUnder 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(1), the maximum penalty for the\n\ndistribution    of   five   or    more    kilograms   of   cocaine    is   life\n\nimprisonment.    Accordingly, life imprisonment is also the maximum\n\npenalty for participation in a conspiracy to distribute five or\n\nmore kilograms of cocaine.         Ramos was sentenced to 365 months of\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fimprisonment for his participation in the conspiracy.                       Because\n\nRamos' sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum penalty, there\n\ncan be no Apprendi error.        See United States v. Johnstone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199430\"><a href=\"/opinion/199430/united-states-v-johnstone/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"No Apprendi violation occurs, however,\n\nwhen the district court sentences a defendant below the statutory\n\nmaximum.\").      The district court sentenced Ramos to 365 months of\n\nimprisonment because it found that Ramos was a career offender\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, and the sentencing guidelines recommended\n\na sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment.                 As we have\n\nstated previously, a sentence that is less than the statutory\n\nmaximum   penalty       does   not    violate    Apprendi     \"even    if   a   fact\n\ndetermined by the court under a preponderance standard lengthens\n\nthe sentence imposed.\"           Johnstone, 251 F.3d at 285; see also\n\nVaughn, 430 F.2d at 525 (\"[D]istrict courts' authority to determine\n\nsentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence endures and\n\ndoes not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\").\n\nAccordingly, Ramos' claim of improper sentencing is meritless.\n\n                                III. Conclusion\n\n           For    the    reasons     stated     above,   we   vacate   González's\n\nsentence and remand the matter of González's sentencing to the\n\ndistrict court for an individualized determination of drug quantity\n\nattributable to González.            With respect to all other matters, we\n\naffirm the decisions of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -25-\n\f          The conviction and sentence in No. 05-1758 is affirmed.\n\nThe conviction in No. 05-1184 is affirmed.   The sentence in No. 05-\n\n1184 is vacated and that case is remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\f</pre>",
