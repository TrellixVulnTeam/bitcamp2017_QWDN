Pro se plaintiff-appellant John Toolin, a\n\nprisoner, appeals from the district court's sua sponte dismissal of\n\nhis civil rights complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915A(b)(1). We\n\nreview the dismissal of Toolin's complaint de novo, accepting all\n\nof the well-pleaded factual allegations as true and drawing all\n\nreasonable        inferences   in   the   plaintiff's   favor.     Calhoun   v.\n\nDeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 939 (7th Cir. 2003); see Soto-Negron v.\n\nTaber Partners I, 339 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir. 2003).                    We have\n\nreviewed Toolin's brief and the record on appeal.                We affirm the\n\ndismissal of Toolin's complaint, but on a basis different from the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                In his complaint, Toolin alleges that he was deprived of\n\nadditional, discretionary \"administrative days\" which would have\n\nshortened the length of his sentence.1             The district court said\n\nthat Toolin's claims are not cognizable under Heck v. Humphrey, 512\n\nU.S. 477 (1994), because they would imply the invalidity of the\n\nsentence--a position supported by Heck's extension in Edwards v.\n\nBalisok, 520 U.S. 641 (1997), to cover disciplinary determinations\n\nthat affect the length of a sentence.\n\n                There is some division of views as to whether the Heck\n\nand Edwards bar applies after release of the prisoner, when habeas\n\nis no longer available.         But Toolin does not argue this point and\n\n\n\n        1\n            Toolin is currently incarcerated, apparently for an unrelated\ncase.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fwe see no reason to address it since, in any event, the complaint\n\ndoes not   allege   deprivation   of    a   constitutional    right.     The\n\nmaterials that Toolin has himself submitted show that the credits\n\nsought were   discretionary   and,     in   the   absence   of   a   specific\n\nunconstitutional motive, there is no due process violation.               Cf.\n\nOlsen v. Correiro, 189 F.3d 52, 66 n.16 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting\n\nthat, to prevail in ยง 1983 suit, plaintiff must establish that\n\ndefendants deprived him of constitutional right).\n\n           The judgment of the district court is summarily affirmed\n\non this alternative basis.
