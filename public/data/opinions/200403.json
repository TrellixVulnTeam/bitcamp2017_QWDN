William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n              Coffin and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Aziz Safar for appellant Molloy.\n     Mark L. Stevens for appellant Zawadzki.\n     John T. McNeil, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                           March 31, 2003\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    In this appeal we confront the\n\nnarrow question of whether the district court clearly erred in\n\nimposing a four-level sentencing enhancement for two defendants\n\npursuant to section 2K2.1(b)(5) of the United States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines (the \"Guidelines\").     This provision requires courts to\n\nincrease a defendant's base offense level by four points if the\n\ndefendant \"possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with\n\nknowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or\n\npossessed in connection with another felony offense.\" The items at\n\nissue are two live, high-explosive M-67 military fragmentation hand\n\ngrenades that were stolen from a United States military facility\n\nand delivered to defendant Jason Zawadzki.\n\n           Zawadzki and co-defendant David Molloy were apprehended\n\nby federal law enforcement officials after attempting to sell the\n\nhand grenades to a government informant.     Both subsequently pled\n\nguilty to one count of possession of unregistered destructive\n\ndevices and one count of transferring unregistered destructive\n\ndevices.   Zawadzki, who at the time was serving a state sentence of\n\nhome confinement, also pled guilty to a third count of felon-in-\n\npossession of firearms and ammunition.        For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we conclude that the district court's decision to impose\n\nthe four-level enhancement for both defendants is well grounded in\n\nthe factual record and the relevant case law.       Accordingly, we\n\nreject the appellants' claims and affirm the decision below.\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f                                 I.\n\n             In December 1999, Zawadzki arranged to obtain two M-67\n\nhand grenades from David Joseph, a convicted felon who had earlier\n\nbeen deported to Canada.       Joseph instructed his girlfriend to\n\ndeliver the hand grenades to Zawadzki, who was confined to his home\n\nand required to wear an electronic monitoring device under the\n\nterms of his sentence for a prior state felony conviction.    As part\n\nof his sentence, Zawadzki was also required to attend Alcoholics\n\nAnonymous meetings at the Essex County House of Correction Farm\n\nprogram.      At one meeting, Zawadzki offered to sell the hand\n\ngrenades to another convicted felon named David Santiago (a.k.a.\n\n\"Tucky\") whom the defendant knew to be a member of a street gang in\n\nLawrence, Massachusetts, called the Outlaws.\n\n             After Tucky declined to purchase the grenades, Zawadzki\n\ncontacted Molloy to request his assistance in finding a buyer.\n\nMolloy informed Zawadzki that he knew a member of the \"Latin\n\nGangsta Disciples\" street gang named Luis Colon (a.k.a. \"Slot\") who\n\nwould potentially be interested in purchasing the grenades for up\n\nto $1,000.    The Disciples were declared enemies of the Outlaws who\n\ntrafficked drugs and stolen weapons in North Lawrence.       Molloy's\n\nknowledge of Slot's involvement with the Disciples stemmed from a\n\nseveral-month friendship between the two, during which time Molloy\n\nassisted Slot in selling a 9 mm handgun to a friend of Molloy's\n\nnamed \"LaPoint.\"      Molloy was also aware that Slot frequently\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fsocialized with Victor Laboy (a.k.a. \"Papito Bosero\"), a known\n\nleader of the Disciples, and that Slot had been shot by Leslie\n\nCarabello,    a   member      of   the   Outlaws.     Unbeknownst        to   Molloy,\n\nhowever, Slot had recently become a cooperating witness for the\n\nMassachusetts State Police.\n\n           On January 23, 2000, Molloy approached Slot at a party in\n\nLawrence and offered to sell him the two hand grenades.                        Molloy\n\nappeared   anxious       to   unload     the    grenades,    and    attempted     to\n\naccelerate the pace of negotiations by informing Slot that if he\n\ncould not commit to purchasing the hand grenades quickly, Molloy\n\nwould instead sell them to Tucky, whom both parties knew to be\n\ninvolved   with    the     rival    Outlaws.        Slot   left    the   party   and\n\ntelephoned Massachusetts State Trooper Frank Hughes, who instructed\n\nSlot to make the purchase the next day.              On January 24, 2000, Slot\n\ncontacted Molloy and, in a telephone conversation that was recorded\n\nby law enforcement agents, elicited from Molloy that the hand\n\ngrenades belonged to a third party and that Molloy would need to\n\nretrieve them before the sale.                 During the conversation Molloy\n\nagreed to sell the grenades for $1200 -- $700 due at the time of\n\npurchase, and $500 to be paid once Slot verified the authenticity\n\nof the grenades.         Slot agreed to meet Molloy at a location near\n\nMolloy's residence later that evening to complete the transaction.\n\n             After the phone conversation, the police provided Slot\n\nwith $700 in marked bills and equipped him with a wire.                          That\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fevening, after several follow-up phone conversations, Slot drove to\n\nthe agreed location, which turned out to be Zawadzki's residence.\n\nMolloy obtained the grenades from Zawadzki and gave them to Slot in\n\nexchange for the initial $700 payment.            On January 25, after law\n\nenforcement officials confirmed that the hand grenades were \"live\"\n\nand authentic, Slot met with Molloy and paid him the outstanding\n\nbalance of $500.      The next day, Molloy approached Slot and offered\n\nto sell him other stolen weapons, including a pump-action shotgun\n\nand two handguns.\n\n            Between    January 27 and February 1, Slot and Molloy had\n\nseveral    conversations      monitored    by   law   enforcement     agents   to\n\nnegotiate the price of the weapons and to make arrangements for the\n\nexchange.     These recorded conversations, coupled with the earlier\n\nrecorded discussions regarding the hand grenades, are the main\n\nsubject matter of the dispute. The conversations reveal that Slot,\n\nprior to his purchase of the hand grenades, invented a fictitious\n\nthird-party    buyer    for   whom   he   was   supposedly      purchasing     the\n\nweapons.      Slot    portrayed   this    fictitious    buyer    as   a   hostile\n\nindividual with substantial knowledge of hand grenades, ostensibly\n\nto convince Molloy that the buyer would react negatively if Molloy\n\nattempted to sell him fake grenades.            In one January 24 telephone\n\nconversation, Slot remarked that the fictitious buyer \"don't want\n\nto get stiffed for that bullshit cuz he already got stiffed once,\"\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fand represented that \"this guy wants them you know . . . . He\n\ncollects them shits I guess.\"\n\n           On the basis of these conversations and the recovered\n\nhand grenades, the police obtained a search warrant for Zawadzki's\n\nresidence.        While executing the warrant, the police recovered a\n\npump-action shotgun, two handguns, and $200 of the cash payment\n\nthat Slot made to Molloy.            Molloy was subsequently arrested, and\n\nthe two co-defendants eventually pled guilty to the aforementioned\n\ncharges.\n\n                                        II.\n\n             To    impose   the   four-level     sentencing     enhancement      for\n\nMolloy   and      Zawadzki,    the   court    was    required      to   find,   by   a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, that the recorded conversations\n\nrevealed that the co-defendants had \"knowledge, intent, or reason\n\nto believe\" that the hand grenades sold to Slot would \"be used or\n\npossessed in connection with another felony offense.\"                    U.S.S.G.\n\nÂ§ 2K2.1(b)(5).           The court concluded that the requirements of\n\nsection 2K2.1(b)(5) were satisfied as to Molloy: \"The tenor of the\n\ntranscripts and all the circumstances convince the Court by a fair\n\npreponderance       of   the   evidence   that      Mr.   Molloy    thought     these\n\ngrenades were going to be used in a felony.\"                The court similarly\n\nimposed a four-level enhancement for Zawadzki, concluding that\n\n\"there is significant evidence to warrant the inference that Mr.\n\nZawadzki . . . in fact had reason to believe that the grenades\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fwould be used or possessed in connection with another felony\n\noffense; and further, I find by a fair preponderance of the\n\nevidence that he did so believe.\"\n\n            Zawadzki and Molloy advance separate theories of error in\n\nthe district court's sentencing determinations. The government\n\nconcedes that Zawadzki had no knowledge of the fictitious third-\n\nparty buyer invented by Slot; Zawadzki, in turn, argues that the\n\ngovernment's proof that the defendants sold the grenades to a known\n\ngang member was by itself insufficient to trigger a four-level\n\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. Â§ 2K2.1(b)(5).             Molloy, on the other\n\nhand, insists that he had \"reason to believe\" that Slot would\n\nconvey the grenades to an ex-marine who did not intend to use them\n\nin   a   felony,    but   wished   to   purchase   them   for   his   personal\n\ncollection. We examine each of these arguments in turn, mindful of\n\nthe deference that we accord a district court's factual findings:\n\n\"If a party assigns error to a factual finding made at sentencing,\n\nwe review the finding for clear error.             In doing so, we ask only\n\nwhether the court clearly erred in finding that the government\n\nproved the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\n\nUnited States v. Powell, 50 F.3d 94, 102-03 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(internal citation omitted).\n\n            1.     Zawadzki's claim of error\n\n            At Zawadzki's sentencing hearing, the government conceded\n\nthat its \"best evidence\" supporting the court's application of\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fU.S.S.G. Â§ 2K2.1(b)(5) was \"that Mr. Zawadzki was selling to a gang\n\nmember in the Lawrence area with knowledge of what was going on in\n\nthe Lawrence    area   but     no   specific    knowledge   of   any   specific\n\nfelony.\"    Yet as Molloy and Zawadzki concede, we have previously\n\ninterpreted    section    2K2.1(b)(5)       as    requiring      a   four-level\n\nenhancement even where the defendant had no knowledge of a specific\n\nfelony involving the transferred weapons:\n\n            While appellant argues that the section\n            requires knowledge of some specific offense,\n            the use of the word \"another\" as the sole\n            modifier of \"felony offense\" does not command\n            such a narrow reading . . . . The First\n            Circuit has looked at U.S.S.G. Â§ 2K2.1(b)(5)\n            and interpreted it to require an enhancement\n            where the defendant was not aware of a\n            specific felony offense to be committed with\n            transferred guns.\n\nUnited States v. Cutler, 36 F.3d 406, 408 (4th Cir. 1994) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 1993)); see also\n\nUnited States v. Nunez, 146 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            However, Zawadzki insists that Slot's purported status as\n\na   gang   member,   without    more,    does    not   permit    a   four-level\n\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. Â§ 2K2.1(b)(5) as a matter of law.\n\nSuperficially, he finds some support for this proposition in our\n\nprior cases.     In Nunez, for instance, we upheld the district\n\ncourt's imposition of a four-level enhancement where the buyer\n\napproached the defendant and explicitly told him that he needed\n\nsome pipe bombs \"to blow up\" a rival gang.             Nunez, 146 F.3d at 37.\n\nSimilarly, we determined in Brewster that the court was justified\n\n                                      -8-\n\fin levying a four-level enhancement where the defendant sold an\n\nundercover police officer a handgun, and, within the hour, sold the\n\nsame officer a small amount of crack cocaine.         Brewster, 1 F.3d at\n\n52. There we concluded that \"appellant sold the gun with reason to\n\nbelieve that his customer planned to use it in connection with drug\n\ntrafficking, and a sufficient nexus exist[ed] between the weapon\n\nand the drug trafficking to warrant imposition of the enhancement.\"\n\nId. at 54.    Here, only Slot's history of gang activity connects the\n\nsale of the grenades to the commission of a future felony.\n\n             Significantly, however, Nunez and Brewster do not purport\n\nto establish minimum evidentiary requirements for the application\n\nof section 2K2.1(b)(5). As the government persuasively argues, the\n\nsimple fact that Zawadzki and Molloy were selling lethal explosive\n\ndevices with almost no non-felonious uses distinguishes this case\n\nfrom much of the authority cited by appellants.               Indeed,    the\n\nSupreme Court observed in another context that \"one would hardly be\n\nsurprised to learn that possession of hand grenades is not an\n\ninnocent act.       They are highly dangerous offensive weapons.\"\n\nUnited   States   v.   Freed,   401   U.S.   601,   609   (1971)   (footnote\n\nomitted).     Accordingly, one could hardly fault the district court\n\nfor its common sense conclusion that individuals who transfer\n\n\"offensive\" and \"dangerous\" M-67 hand grenades to a known gang\n\nmember have reason to believe that the weapons will be used in a\n\nsubsequent felony.     See United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 112\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f(1st Cir. 1990) (\"The law is not so struthious as to compel a\n\njudge, in making factbound determinations under the sentencing\n\nguidelines, to divorce himself or herself from common sense or to\n\nignore what is perfectly obvious.\").\n\n           The defendants point to nothing in the record that\n\ncounters the validity of this inference.              In fact, Zawadzki's\n\ncounsel conceded at oral argument that the defendant attempted to\n\npeddle the grenades to members of two rival street gangs in the\n\nLawrence   area   with   a   history   of   violent    interaction.   The\n\ndefendants' efforts to solicit buyers with a predilection for\n\nviolent behavior further vindicate the court's U.S.S.G.\n\nÂ§ 2K2.1(b)(5) determination.     In the end, we find no clear error in\n\nthe judge's reliance on circumstantial evidence and common sense to\n\nsupport the four-level enhancement.1\n\n\n     1\n      Zawadzki briefly challenges his sentence on due process\ngrounds, arguing that the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), requires the government to \"allege\nin the indictment and prove to the jury each fact that supports an\nenhancement under the sentencing guidelines.\"         According to\nZawadzki, the district court violated the rule of Apprendi by\nexposing him to a greater statutory maximum sentence based on\nfactual findings (made pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2K2.1(b)(5)) that\nwere not submitted to a jury.      Frankly, in the absence of any\nelaboration of this argument, we fail to understand how the\ndistrict court's application of the four-level enhancement exposed\nZawadzki to a greater statutory maximum sentence.\n     In any event, the defendant concedes that on numerous\noccasions we have rejected Apprendi challenges in cases like this\none, \"where the sentencing enhancements do not result in a sentence\nin excess of the statutory maximum.\" See United States v. Lopez-\nLopez, 282 F.3d 1, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2002); United States v.\nRobinson, 241 F.3d 115, 121-22 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\nCaba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001). Cognizant of this binding\n\n                                  -10-\n\f           2.       Molloy's claim of error\n\n           Molloy asserts that \"[l]eading up to the hand grenades'\n\nsale, [Slot] continually maintained that the third party purchaser\n\nwas   merely    a    collector   who   was    an   ex-marine   .   .   .   .   His\n\nrepresentation to the appellant was that as a collector, the\n\npurchaser dismantled them.\"            At sentencing the judge expressly\n\nrejected this argument:\n\n           I base the finding on this fictitious\n           character that the undercover informant Slot\n           made up. It just strains credulity in these\n           circumstances, where these grenades are being\n           passed about among street gangs, that Mr.\n           Molloy in good faith thought some sort of out-\n           of-state collector was going to get the\n           grenades.\n\n           On appeal, Molloy attempts to resuscitate the \"ex-marine\"\n\ntheory by pointing to two recorded conversations in which Slot\n\nindicated to Molloy that the fictitious buyer was an ex-marine. The\n\nrecord indicates that Slot did not even convey the fictitious\n\nbuyer's identity until he picked up the hand grenades. Molloy then\n\nseemed apathetic about the prospect of selling the grenades to a\n\ncollector as opposed to a gang member, exclaiming \"big deal\" before\n\nchanging the subject of the conversation.           The second conversation,\n\nwhich occurred on January 28 after the completion of the hand\n\ngrenade sale, is more illuminating:\n\n\n\n\nadverse precedent, Zawadzki expressly raises the Apprendi issue\nbefore us only to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f           Molloy:     I want to see that dude use the grenades . .\n                       . That would be shit to see someone throw\n                       the grenades . . . Boom\n\n           Slot:       Yeah but . . . you know what I'm saying he\n                       just grabs them . . . That's what he does he\n                       got four of them dog . . . All different\n                       kinds\n\n           Molloy:     Are the other ones he has different than\n                       those ones?\n\n           Slot:       Yeah he got two of those same and he got\n                       some other ones are different they look like\n                       the fuckin they got like carbine in the\n                       middle in shit you know what I'm saying\n\n           Molloy:     That dude will he buy pipe bombs and shit\n\n           Slot:       Nigga yo this motherfucker be making his own\n                       shit yo\n\n           Molloy:     Oh he make pipe bombs and stuff\n\n           Slot:       He makes yo, yo whatever pipes . . . You\n                       know what I'm saying they're ready to blow\n                       shit up . . . This guy's a freakin used to\n                       be an ex-marine\n\n           Molloy:     He's one of those fucking army nuts\n\n           Slot:       He's a fucking nut dude . . . I'm afraid to\n                       be around that motherfucker, dog\n\n           As a threshold matter, Molloy argues that because this\n\nconversation occurred after the sale of the hand grenades, \"the\n\ncomments on use were inadequate indicators of the appellant's state\n\nof mind at the time of the sale.\"     We disagree.   As the government\n\nobserves, \"the enhancement focuses on the defendant's state of mind\n\nat the time he possessed or transferred the grenades.\"      See Nunez,\n\n146 F.3d at 40; United States v. Gilmore, 60 F.3d 392, 394 (7th Cir.\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f1995).   To the extent that Molloy's state of mind at the time of\n\nsale was ambiguous, his post-sale comments are a useful and relevant\n\nindicator of whether, prior to the sale, he had reason to believe\n\nthat Slot would convey the grenades to a collector who never\n\nintended to use or possess them in connection with another felony\n\noffense. Cf. James v. Marshall, No. 02-1352, slip op. at 11-12 (1st\n\nCir. March 14, 2003) (where defendant's alleged invocation of\n\nMiranda rights is ambiguous, court may consider defendant's post-\n\ninvocation statements to discern his state of mind at the time of\n\nthe initial request).   The district court is entitled to scrutinize\n\nthe record in its totality to determine whether a four-level\n\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. Â§ 2K2.1(b)(5) is warranted.   See United\n\nStates v. James, 172 F.3d 588, 594 (8th Cir. 1999).   Hence, we find\n\nno clear error in the district court's consideration of Molloy's\n\npost-sale statements during sentencing.\n\n           Those statements, along with numerous others in the\n\nrecord, provide ample support for the district court's conclusion\n\nthat Molloy had reason to believe that the grenades would be used\n\nin connection with another felony offense. Slot did not portray the\n\nfictitious ex-marine as a benign hobbyist with an academic interest\n\nin military artifacts, but as \"a fucking nut\" who manufactured pipe\n\nbombs and other weapons and was \"ready to blow shit up.\"    Indeed,\n\nSlot's characterization of the ex-marine seemed to persuade Molloy\n\nthat the third-party buyer might detonate the weapons, prompting\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fMolloy to exclaim that he \"want[ed] to see that dude use the\n\ngrenades.\"       In the end, the violent persona of the fictitious ex-\n\nmarine and Slot's dogged persistence in ensuring that the hand\n\ngrenades were live and authentic provided Molloy with a reason to\n\nbelieve that the grenades would be used in a subsequent felony --\n\na   belief    evidenced   by   Molloy's     documented    excitement    at   the\n\npossibility that the grenades would be detonated.\n\n              Molloy also asserts for the first time on appeal that\n\nbecause Slot portrayed the fictitious purchaser as the owner of\n\nnumerous     explosive    devices,   the     buyer's     procurement   of    two\n\nadditional grenades could not have been \"causally or logically\"\n\nrelated to a future felony offense.          We review for plain error.       As\n\nthe government recognizes, Molloy            is essentially arguing that\n\nU.S.S.G.     Â§   2K2.1(b)(5)   \"is   inapplicable      unless   the    evidence\n\nestablishes that the defendant has reason to believe that the 'other\n\nfelony offense' would not be committed absent the transfer.\"                  We\n\nagree with the government that this position is indefensible in\n\nlight of our prior decisions construing the phrase \"in connection\n\nwith\" broadly: \"Although there must be a causal or logical relation\n\nor sequence between the possession and the related offense . . . we\n\nwill find that a firearm has been used in connection with an offense\n\nif the possession has the potential to aid or facilitate the other\n\ncrime.\"      United States v. Peterson, 233 F.3d 101, 111 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Molloy's excited comments\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fto Slot reveal that he had reason to believe that the M-67 grenades\n\nwould   be   detonated   in   the   commission   of   a   subsequent   felony\n\nnotwithstanding the ex-marine's existing collection of grenades.\n\nHence there was no error, let alone plain error, in the district\n\ncourt's implicit determination that sufficient causation existed to\n\nwarrant the four-level enhancement for Molloy.\n\n                                    III.\n\n             For the foregoing reasons, we decline to overturn the\n\ndistrict court's imposition of four-level sentencing enhancements\n\nfor both defendants.

This provision requires courts to increase a defendant's base offense level by four points if the defendant \"possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\" The items at issue are two live, high-explosive M-67 military fragmentation hand grenades that were stolen from a United States military facility and delivered to defendant Jason Zawadzki.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zawadzki and co-defendant David Molloy were apprehended by federal law enforcement officials after attempting to sell the hand grenades to a government informant. Both subsequently pled guilty to one count of possession of unregistered destructive devices and one count of transferring unregistered destructive devices. Zawadzki, who at the time was serving a state sentence of home confinement, also pled guilty to a third count of felon-in-possession of firearms and ammunition. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court's decision to impose the four-level enhancement for both defendants is well grounded in the factual record and the relevant case law. Accordingly, we reject the appellants' claims and affirm the decision below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1999, Zawadzki arranged to obtain two M-67 hand grenades from David Joseph, a convicted felon who had earlier been deported to Canada. Joseph instructed his girlfriend to deliver the hand grenades to Zawadzki, who was confined to his home and required to wear an electronic monitoring device under the terms of his sentence for a prior state felony conviction. As part of his sentence, Zawadzki was also required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings at the Essex County House of Correction Farm program. At one meeting, Zawadzki offered to sell the hand grenades to another convicted felon named David Santiago (a.k.a. \"Tucky\") whom the defendant knew to be a member of a street gang in Lawrence, Massachusetts, called the Outlaws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Tucky declined to purchase the grenades, Zawadzki contacted Molloy to request his assistance in finding a buyer. Molloy informed Zawadzki that he knew a member of the \"Latin Gangsta Disciples\" street gang named Luis Colon (a.k.a. \"Slot\") who would potentially be interested in purchasing the grenades for up to $1,000. The Disciples were declared enemies of the Outlaws who trafficked drugs and stolen weapons in North Lawrence. Molloy's knowledge of Slot's involvement with the Disciples stemmed from a several-month friendship between the two, during which time Molloy assisted Slot in selling a 9 mm handgun to a friend of Molloy's named \"LaPoint.\" Molloy was also aware that Slot frequently socialized with Victor Laboy (a.k.a. \"Papito Bosero\"), a known leader of the Disciples, and that Slot had been shot by Leslie Carabello, a member of the Outlaws. Unbeknownst to Molloy, however, Slot had recently become a cooperating witness for the Massachusetts State Police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 23, 2000, Molloy approached Slot at a party in Lawrence and offered to sell him the two hand grenades. Molloy appeared anxious to unload the grenades, and attempted to accelerate the pace of negotiations by informing Slot that if he could not commit to purchasing the hand grenades quickly, Molloy would instead sell them to Tucky, whom both parties knew to be involved with the rival Outlaws. Slot left the party and telephoned Massachusetts State Trooper Frank Hughes, who instructed Slot to make the purchase the next day. On January 24, 2000, Slot contacted Molloy and, in a telephone conversation that was recorded by law enforcement agents, elicited from Molloy that the hand grenades belonged to a third party and that Molloy would need to retrieve them before the sale. During the conversation Molloy agreed to sell the grenades for $1200 &#8212; $700 due at the time of purchase, and $500 to be paid once Slot verified the authenticity of the grenades. Slot agreed to meet Molloy at a location near Molloy's residence later that evening to complete the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the phone conversation, the police provided Slot with $700 in marked bills and equipped him with a wire. That evening, after several follow-up phone conversations, Slot drove to the agreed location, which turned out to be Zawadzki's residence. Molloy obtained the grenades from Zawadzki and gave them to Slot in exchange for the initial $700 payment. On January 25, after law enforcement officials confirmed that the hand grenades were \"live\" and authentic, Slot met with Molloy and paid him the outstanding balance of $500. The next day, Molloy approached Slot and offered to sell him other stolen weapons, including a pump-action shotgun and two handguns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between January 27 and February 1, Slot and Molloy had several conversations monitored by law enforcement agents to negotiate the price of the weapons and to make arrangements for the exchange. These recorded conversations, coupled with the earlier recorded discussions regarding the hand grenades, are the main subject matter of the dispute. The conversations reveal that Slot, prior to his purchase of the hand grenades, invented a fictitious third-party buyer for whom he was supposedly purchasing the weapons. Slot portrayed this fictitious buyer as a hostile individual with substantial knowledge of hand grenades, ostensibly to convince Molloy that the buyer would react negatively if Molloy attempted to sell him fake grenades. In one January 24 telephone conversation, Slot remarked that the fictitious buyer \"don't want to get stiffed for that bullshit cuz he already got stiffed once,\" and represented that \"this guy wants them you know.... He collects them shits I guess.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of these conversations and the recovered hand grenades, the police obtained a search warrant for Zawadzki's residence. While executing the warrant, the police recovered a pump-action shotgun, two handguns, and $200 of the cash payment that Slot made to Molloy. Molloy was subsequently arrested, and the two co-defendants eventually pled guilty to the aforementioned charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To impose the four-level sentencing enhancement for Molloy and Zawadzki, the court was required to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the recorded conversations revealed that the co-defendants had \"knowledge, intent, or reason to believe\" that the hand grenades sold to Slot would \"be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5). The court concluded that the requirements of section 2K2.1(b)(5) were satisfied as to Molloy: \"The tenor of the transcripts and all the circumstances convince the Court by a fair preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Molloy thought these grenades were going to be used in a felony.\" The court similarly imposed a four-level enhancement for Zawadzki, concluding that \"there is significant evidence to warrant the inference that Mr. Zawadzki ... in fact had reason to believe that the grenades would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense; and further, I find by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he did so believe.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zawadzki and Molloy advance separate theories of error in the district court's sentencing determinations. The government concedes that Zawadzki had no knowledge of the fictitious third-party buyer invented by Slot; Zawadzki, in turn, argues that the government's proof that the defendants sold the grenades to a known gang member was by itself insufficient to trigger a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5). Molloy' on the other hand, insists that he had \"reason to believe\" that Slot would convey the grenades to an ex-marine who did not intend to use them in a felony, but wished to purchase them for his personal collection. We examine each of these arguments in turn, mindful of the deference that we accord a district court's factual findings: \"If a party assigns error to a factual finding made at sentencing, we review the finding for clear error. In doing so, we ask only whether the court clearly erred in finding that the government proved the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Powell,</i> 50 F.3d 94, 102-03 (1st Cir.1995) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Zawadzki's claim of error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Zawadzki's sentencing hearing, the government conceded that its \"best evidence\" supporting the court's application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) was \"that Mr. Zawadzki was selling to a gang member in the Lawrence area with knowledge of what was going on in the Lawrence area but no specific knowledge of any specific felony.\" Yet as Molloy and Zawadzki concede, we have previously interpreted section 2K2.1(b)(5) as requiring a four-level enhancement even where the defendant had no knowledge of a specific felony involving the transferred weapons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While appellant argues that the section requires knowledge of some specific offense, the use of the word \"another\" as the sole modifier of \"felony offense\" does not command such a narrow reading.... The First Circuit has looked at U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) and interpreted it to require an enhancement where the defendant was not aware of a specific felony offense to be committed with transferred guns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Cutler,</i> 36 F.3d 406, 408 (4th Cir.1994) (citing <i>United States v. Brewster,</i> 1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir.1993)); <i>see also United States v. Nunez,</i> 146 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Zawadzki insists that Slot's purported status as a gang member, without more, does not permit a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) as a matter of law. Superficially, he finds some support for this proposition in our prior cases. In <i>Nunez,</i> for instance, we upheld the district court's imposition of a four-level enhancement where the buyer approached the defendant and explicitly told him that he needed some pipe bombs \"to blow up\" a rival gang. <i>Nunez,</i> 146 F.3d at 37. Similarly, we determined in <i>Brewster</i> that the court was justified in levying a four-level enhancement where the defendant sold an undercover police officer a handgun, and, within the hour, sold the same officer a small amount of crack cocaine. <i>Brewster,</i> 1 F.3d at 52. There we concluded that \"appellant sold the gun with reason to believe that his customer planned to use it in connection with drug trafficking, and a sufficient nexus exist[ed] between the weapon and the drug trafficking to warrant imposition of the enhancement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 54. Here, only Slot's history of gang activity connects the sale of the grenades to the commission of a future felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, however, <i>Nunez</i> and <i>Brewster</i> do not purport to establish minimum evidentiary requirements for the application of section 2K2.1(b)(5). As the government persuasively argues, the simple fact that Zawadzki and Molloy were selling lethal explosive devices with almost no non-felonious uses distinguishes this case from much of the authority cited by appellants. Indeed, the Supreme Court observed in another context that \"one would hardly be surprised to learn that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act. They are highly dangerous offensive weapons.\" <i>United States v. Freed,</i> 401 U.S. 601, 609, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, one could hardly fault the district court for its common sense conclusion that individuals who transfer \"offensive\" and \"dangerous\" M-67 hand grenades to a known gang member have reason to believe that the weapons will be used in a subsequent felony. <i>See United States v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 112 (1st Cir.1990) (\"The law is not so struthious as to compel a judge, in making factbound determinations under the sentencing guidelines, to divorce himself or herself from common sense or to ignore what is perfectly obvious.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants point to nothing in the record that counters the validity of this inference. In fact, Zawadzki's counsel conceded at oral argument that the defendant attempted to peddle the grenades to members of two rival street gangs in the Lawrence area with a history of violent interaction. The defendants' efforts to solicit buyers with a predilection for violent behavior further vindicate the court's U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) determination. In the end, we find no clear error in the judge's reliance on circumstantial evidence and common sense to support the four-level enhancement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Molloy's claim of error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy asserts that \"[l]eading up to the hand grenades' sale, [Slot] continually maintained that the third party purchaser was merely a collector who was an exmarine.... His representation to the appellant was that as a collector, the purchaser dismantled them.\" At sentencing the judge expressly rejected this argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I base the finding on this fictitious character that the undercover informant Slot made up. It just strains credulity in these circumstances, where these grenades are being passed about among street gangs, that Mr. Molloy in good faith thought some sort of out-of-state collector was going to get the grenades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Molloy attempts to resuscitate the \"ex-marine\" theory by pointing to two recorded conversations in which Slot indicated to Molloy that the fictitious buyer was an ex-marine. The record indicates that Slot did not even convey the fictitious buyer's identity until he picked up the hand grenades. Molloy then seemed apathetic about the prospect of selling the grenades to a collector as opposed to a gang member, exclaiming \"big deal\" before changing the subject of the conversation. The second conversation, which occurred on January 28 after the completion of the hand grenade sale, is more illuminating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: I want to see that dude use the grenades ... That would be shit to see someone throw the grenades ... Boom</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Slot: Yeah but ... you know what I'm saying he just grabs them ... That's what he does he got four of them dog... All different kinds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: Are the other ones he has different than those ones?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Slot: Yeah he got two of those same and he got some other ones are different they look like the fuckin they got like carbine in the middle in shit you know what I'm saying</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: That dude will he buy pipe bombs and shit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Slot: Nigga yo this motherfucker be making his own shit yo</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: Oh he make pipe bombs and stuff</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Slot: He makes yo, yo whatever pipes... You know what I'm saying they're ready to blow shit up ... This guy's a freakin used to be an ex-marine</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: He's one of those fucking army nuts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Slot: He's a fucking nut dude ... I'm afraid to be around that motherfucker, dog</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, Molloy argues that because this conversation occurred after the sale of the hand grenades, \"the comments on use were inadequate indicators of the appellant's state of mind at the time of the sale.\" We disagree. As the government observes, \"the enhancement focuses on the defendant's state of mind at the time he possessed or transferred the grenades.\" <i>See Nunez,</i> 146 F.3d at 40; <i>United States v. Gilmore,</i> 60 F.3d 392, 394 (7th Cir.1995). To the extent that Molloy's state of mind at the time of sale was ambiguous, his post-sale comments are a useful and relevant indicator of whether, prior to the sale, he had reason to believe that Slot would convey the grenades to a collector who never intended to use or possess them in connection with another felony offense. <i>Cf. James v. Marshall,</i> 322 F.3d 103, 108-09 (1st Cir.2003) (where defendant's alleged invocation of <i>Miranda</i> rights is ambiguous, court may consider defendant's post-invocation statements to discern his state of mind at the time of the initial request). The district court is entitled to scrutinize the record in its totality to determine whether a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) is warranted. <i>See United States v. James,</i> 172 F.3d 588, 594 (8th Cir.1999). Hence, we find no clear error in the district court's consideration of Molloy's post-sale statements during sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those statements, along with numerous others in the record, provide ample support for the district court's conclusion that Molloy had reason to believe that the grenades would be used in connection with another felony offense. Slot did not portray the fictitious ex-marine as a benign hobbyist with an academic interest in military artifacts, but as \"a fucking nut\" who manufactured pipe bombs and other weapons and was \"ready to blow shit up.\" Indeed, Slot's characterization of the ex-marine seemed to persuade Molloy that the third-party buyer might detonate the weapons, prompting Molloy to exclaim that he \"want[ed] to see that dude use the grenades.\" In the end, the violent persona of the fictitious ex-marine and Slot's dogged persistence in ensuring that the hand grenades were live and authentic provided Molloy with a reason to believe that the grenades would be used in a subsequent felony-a belief evidenced by Molloy's documented excitement at the possibility that the grenades would be detonated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy also asserts for the first time on appeal that because Slot portrayed the fictitious purchaser as the owner of numerous explosive devices, the buyer's procurement of two additional grenades could not have been \"causally or logically\" related to a future felony offense. We review for plain error. As the government recognizes, Molloy is essentially arguing that U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) \"is inapplicable unless the evidence establishes that the defendant has reason to believe that the `other felony offense' would not be committed absent the transfer.\" We agree with the government that this position is indefensible in light of our prior decisions construing the phrase \"in connection with\" broadly: \"Although there must be a causal or logical relation or sequence between the possession and the related offense ... we will find that a firearm has been used in connection with an offense if the possession has the potential to aid or facilitate the other crime.\" <i>United States v. Peterson,</i> 233 F.3d 101, 111 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Molloy's excited comments to Slot reveal that he had reason to believe that the M-67 grenades would be detonated in the commission of a subsequent felony notwithstanding the ex-marine's existing collection of grenades. Hence there was no error, let alone plain error, in the district court's implicit determination that sufficient causation existed to warrant the four-level enhancement for Molloy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we decline to overturn the district court's imposition of four-level sentencing enhancements for both defendants.

This provision requires courts to increase a defendant's base offense level by four points if the defendant \"possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\" The items at issue are two live, high-explosive M-67 military fragmentation hand grenades that were stolen from a United States military facility and delivered to defendant Jason Zawadzki.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zawadzki and co-defendant David Molloy were apprehended by federal law enforcement officials after attempting to sell the hand grenades to a government informant. Both subsequently pled guilty to one count of possession of unregistered destructive devices and one count of transferring unregistered destructive devices. Zawadzki, who at the time was serving a state sentence of home confinement, also pled guilty to a third count of felon-in-possession of firearms and ammunition. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court's decision to impose the four-level enhancement for both defendants is well grounded in the factual record and the relevant case law. Accordingly, we reject the appellants' claims and affirm the decision below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1999, Zawadzki arranged to obtain two M-67 hand grenades from David Joseph, a convicted felon who had earlier been deported to Canada. Joseph instructed his girlfriend to deliver the hand grenades to Zawadzki, who was confined to his home and required to wear an electronic monitoring device under the terms of his sentence for a prior state felony conviction. As part of his sentence, Zawadzki was also required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings at the Essex County House of Correction Farm program. At one meeting, Zawadzki offered to sell the hand grenades to another convicted felon named David Santiago (a.k.a. \"Tucky\") whom the defendant knew to be a member of a street gang in Lawrence, Massachusetts, called the Outlaws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Tucky declined to purchase the grenades, Zawadzki contacted Molloy to request his assistance in finding a buyer. Molloy informed Zawadzki that he knew a member of the \"Latin Gangsta Disciples\" street gang named Luis Colon (a.k.a. \"Slot\") who would potentially be interested in purchasing the grenades for up to $1,000. The Disciples were declared enemies of the Outlaws who trafficked drugs and stolen weapons in North Lawrence. Molloy's knowledge of Slot's involvement with the Disciples stemmed from a several-month friendship between the two, during which time Molloy assisted Slot in selling a 9 mm handgun to a friend of Molloy's named \"LaPoint.\" Molloy was also aware that Slot frequently socialized with Victor Laboy (a.k.a. \"Papito Bosero\"), a known leader of the Disciples, and that Slot had been shot by Leslie Carabello, a member of the Outlaws. Unbeknownst to Molloy, however, Slot had recently become a cooperating witness for the Massachusetts State Police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 23, 2000, Molloy approached Slot at a party in Lawrence and offered to sell him the two hand grenades. Molloy appeared anxious to unload the grenades, and attempted to accelerate the pace of negotiations by informing Slot that if he could not commit to purchasing the hand grenades quickly, Molloy would instead sell them to Tucky, whom both parties knew to be involved with the rival Outlaws. Slot left the party and telephoned Massachusetts State Trooper Frank Hughes, who instructed Slot to make the purchase the next day. On January 24, 2000, Slot contacted Molloy and, in a telephone conversation that was recorded by law enforcement agents, elicited from Molloy that the hand grenades belonged to a third party and that Molloy would need to retrieve them before the sale. During the conversation Molloy agreed to sell the grenades for $1200 &#8212; $700 due at the time of purchase, and $500 to be paid once Slot verified the authenticity of the grenades. Slot agreed to meet Molloy at a location near Molloy's residence later that evening to complete the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the phone conversation, the police provided Slot with $700 in marked bills and equipped him with a wire. That evening, after several follow-up phone conversations, Slot drove to the agreed location, which turned out to be Zawadzki's residence. Molloy obtained the grenades from Zawadzki and gave them to Slot in exchange for the initial $700 payment. On January 25, after law enforcement officials confirmed that the hand grenades were \"live\" and authentic, Slot met with Molloy and paid him the outstanding balance of $500. The next day, Molloy approached Slot and offered to sell him other stolen weapons, including a pump-action shotgun and two handguns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between January 27 and February 1, Slot and Molloy had several conversations monitored by law enforcement agents to negotiate the price of the weapons and to make arrangements for the exchange. These recorded conversations, coupled with the earlier recorded discussions regarding the hand grenades, are the main subject matter of the dispute. The conversations reveal that Slot, prior to his purchase of the hand grenades, invented a fictitious third-party buyer for whom he was supposedly purchasing the weapons. Slot portrayed this fictitious buyer as a hostile individual with substantial knowledge of hand grenades, ostensibly to convince Molloy that the buyer would react negatively if Molloy attempted to sell him fake grenades. In one January 24 telephone conversation, Slot remarked that the fictitious buyer \"don't want to get stiffed for that bullshit cuz he already got stiffed once,\" and represented that \"this guy wants them you know.... He collects them shits I guess.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of these conversations and the recovered hand grenades, the police obtained a search warrant for Zawadzki's residence. While executing the warrant, the police recovered a pump-action shotgun, two handguns, and $200 of the cash payment that Slot made to Molloy. Molloy was subsequently arrested, and the two co-defendants eventually pled guilty to the aforementioned charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To impose the four-level sentencing enhancement for Molloy and Zawadzki, the court was required to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the recorded conversations revealed that the co-defendants had \"knowledge, intent, or reason to believe\" that the hand grenades sold to Slot would \"be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5). The court concluded that the requirements of section 2K2.1(b)(5) were satisfied as to Molloy: \"The tenor of the transcripts and all the circumstances convince the Court by a fair preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Molloy thought these grenades were going to be used in a felony.\" The court similarly imposed a four-level enhancement for Zawadzki, concluding that \"there is significant evidence to warrant the inference that Mr. Zawadzki ... in fact had reason to believe that the grenades would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense; and further, I find by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he did so believe.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zawadzki and Molloy advance separate theories of error in the district court's sentencing determinations. The government concedes that Zawadzki had no knowledge of the fictitious third-party buyer invented by Slot; Zawadzki, in turn, argues that the government's proof that the defendants sold the grenades to a known gang member was by itself insufficient to trigger a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5). Molloy' on the other hand, insists that he had \"reason to believe\" that Slot would convey the grenades to an ex-marine who did not intend to use them in a felony, but wished to purchase them for his personal collection. We examine each of these arguments in turn, mindful of the deference that we accord a district court's factual findings: \"If a party assigns error to a factual finding made at sentencing, we review the finding for clear error. In doing so, we ask only whether the court clearly erred in finding that the government proved the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Powell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195990\"><a href=\"/opinion/195990/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 102-03 (1st Cir.1995) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Zawadzki's claim of error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Zawadzki's sentencing hearing, the government conceded that its \"best evidence\" supporting the court's application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) was \"that Mr. Zawadzki was selling to a gang member in the Lawrence area with knowledge of what was going on in the Lawrence area but no specific knowledge of any specific felony.\" Yet as Molloy and Zawadzki concede, we have previously interpreted section 2K2.1(b)(5) as requiring a four-level enhancement even where the defendant had no knowledge of a specific felony involving the transferred weapons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While appellant argues that the section requires knowledge of some specific offense, the use of the word \"another\" as the sole modifier of \"felony offense\" does not command such a narrow reading.... The First Circuit has looked at U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) and interpreted it to require an enhancement where the defendant was not aware of a specific felony offense to be committed with transferred guns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Superficially, he finds some support for this proposition in our prior cases. In <i>Nunez,</i> for instance, we upheld the district court's imposition of a four-level enhancement where the buyer approached the defendant and explicitly told him that he needed some pipe bombs \"to blow up\" a rival gang. <i>Nunez,</i> 146 F.3d at 37. Similarly, we determined in <i>Brewster</i> that the court was justified in levying a four-level enhancement where the defendant sold an undercover police officer a handgun, and, within the hour, sold the same officer a small amount of crack cocaine. <i>Brewster,</i> 1 F.3d at 52. There we concluded that \"appellant sold the gun with reason to believe that his customer planned to use it in connection with drug trafficking, and a sufficient nexus exist[ed] between the weapon and the drug trafficking to warrant imposition of the enhancement.\" <i>Id.</i> at 54. Here, only Slot's history of gang activity connects the sale of the grenades to the commission of a future felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, however, <i>Nunez</i> and <i>Brewster</i> do not purport to establish minimum evidentiary requirements for the application of section 2K2.1(b)(5). As the government persuasively argues, the simple fact that Zawadzki and Molloy were selling lethal explosive devices with almost no non-felonious uses distinguishes this case from much of the authority cited by appellants. Indeed, the Supreme Court observed in another context that \"one would hardly be surprised to learn that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act. They are highly dangerous offensive weapons.\" <i>United States v. Freed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108299\"><a href=\"/opinion/108299/united-states-v-freed/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 609, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108299\"><a href=\"/opinion/108299/united-states-v-freed/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span> (1971) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, one could hardly fault the district court for its common sense conclusion that individuals who transfer \"offensive\" and \"dangerous\" M-67 hand grenades to a known gang member have reason to believe that the weapons will be used in a subsequent felony. <i>See United States v. Sklar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 112 (1st Cir.1990) (\"The law is not so struthious as to compel a judge, in making factbound determinations under the sentencing guidelines, to divorce himself or herself from common sense or to ignore what is perfectly obvious.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants point to nothing in the record that counters the validity of this inference. In fact, Zawadzki's counsel conceded at oral argument that the defendant attempted to peddle the grenades to members of two rival street gangs in the Lawrence area with a history of violent interaction. The defendants' efforts to solicit buyers with a predilection for violent behavior further vindicate the court's U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) determination. In the end, we find no clear error in the judge's reliance on circumstantial evidence and common sense to support the four-level enhancement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Molloy's claim of error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy asserts that \"[l]eading up to the hand grenades' sale, [Slot] continually maintained that the third party purchaser was merely a collector who was an exmarine.... His representation to the appellant was that as a collector, the purchaser dismantled them.\" At sentencing the judge expressly rejected this argument:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I base the finding on this fictitious character that the undercover informant Slot made up. It just strains credulity in these circumstances, where these grenades are being passed about among street gangs, that Mr. Molloy in good faith thought some sort of out-of-state collector was going to get the grenades.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Molloy attempts to resuscitate the \"ex-marine\" theory by pointing to two recorded conversations in which Slot indicated to Molloy that the fictitious buyer was an ex-marine. The record indicates that Slot did not even convey the fictitious buyer's identity until he picked up the hand grenades. Molloy then seemed apathetic about the prospect of selling the grenades to a collector as opposed to a gang member, exclaiming \"big deal\" before changing the subject of the conversation. The second conversation, which occurred on January 28 after the completion of the hand grenade sale, is more illuminating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: I want to see that dude use the grenades ...

All different kinds</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: Are the other ones he has different than those ones?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Slot: Yeah he got two of those same and he got some other ones are different they look like the fuckin they got like carbine in the middle in shit you know what I'm saying</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: That dude will he buy pipe bombs and shit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Slot: Nigga yo this motherfucker be making his own shit yo</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: Oh he make pipe bombs and stuff</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Slot: He makes yo, yo whatever pipes... You know what I'm saying they're ready to blow shit up ... This guy's a freakin used to be an ex-marine</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy: He's one of those fucking army nuts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Slot: He's a fucking nut dude ... I'm afraid to be around that motherfucker, dog</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold matter, Molloy argues that because this conversation occurred after the sale of the hand grenades, \"the comments on use were inadequate indicators of the appellant's state of mind at the time of the sale.\" We disagree. As the government observes, \"the enhancement focuses on the defendant's state of mind at the time he possessed or transferred the grenades.\" <i>See Nunez,</i> 146 F.3d at 40; <i>United States v. Gilmore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699591\"><a href=\"/opinion/699591/united-states-v-marshall-gilmore-also-known-as-marshall-kidd/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 394 (7th Cir.1995). To the extent that Molloy's state of mind at the time of sale was ambiguous, his post-sale comments are a useful and relevant indicator of whether, prior to the sale, he had reason to believe that Slot would convey the grenades to a collector who never intended to use or possess them in connection with another felony offense. <i>Cf. James v. Marshall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200378\"><a href=\"/opinion/200378/james-v-marshal/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 108-09 (1st Cir.2003) (where defendant's alleged invocation of <i>Miranda</i> rights is ambiguous, court may consider defendant's post-invocation statements to discern his state of mind at the time of the initial request). The district court is entitled to scrutinize the record in its totality to determine whether a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) is warranted. <i>See United States v. James,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762800\"><a href=\"/opinion/762800/united-states-v-eddie-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 594 (8th Cir.1999). Hence, we find no clear error in the district court's consideration of Molloy's post-sale statements during sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those statements, along with numerous others in the record, provide ample support for the district court's conclusion that Molloy had reason to believe that the grenades would be used in connection with another felony offense. Slot did not portray the fictitious ex-marine as a benign hobbyist with an academic interest in military artifacts, but as \"a fucking nut\" who manufactured pipe bombs and other weapons and was \"ready to blow shit up.\" Indeed, Slot's characterization of the ex-marine seemed to persuade Molloy that the third-party buyer might detonate the weapons, prompting Molloy to exclaim that he \"want[ed] to see that dude use the grenades.\" In the end, the violent persona of the fictitious ex-marine and Slot's dogged persistence in ensuring that the hand grenades were live and authentic provided Molloy with a reason to believe that the grenades would be used in a subsequent felony-a belief evidenced by Molloy's documented excitement at the possibility that the grenades would be detonated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Molloy also asserts for the first time on appeal that because Slot portrayed the fictitious purchaser as the owner of numerous explosive devices, the buyer's procurement of two additional grenades could not have been \"causally or logically\" related to a future felony offense. We review for plain error. As the government recognizes, Molloy is essentially arguing that U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5) \"is inapplicable unless the evidence establishes that the defendant has reason to believe that the `other felony offense' would not be committed absent the transfer.\" We agree with the government that this position is indefensible in light of our prior decisions construing the phrase \"in connection with\" broadly: \"Although there must be a causal or logical relation or sequence between the possession and the related offense ... we will find that a firearm has been used in connection with an offense if the possession has the potential to aid or facilitate the other crime.\" <i>United States v.

Molloy's excited comments to Slot reveal that he had reason to believe that the M-67 grenades would be detonated in the commission of a subsequent felony notwithstanding the ex-marine's existing collection of grenades. Hence there was no error, let alone plain error, in the district court's implicit determination that sufficient causation existed to warrant the four-level enhancement for Molloy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we decline to overturn the district court's imposition of four-level sentencing enhancements for both defendants.

New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000), requires the government to \"allege in the indictment and prove to the jury each fact that supports an enhancement under the sentencing guidelines.\" According to Zawadzki, the district court violated the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> by exposing him to a greater statutory maximum sentence based on factual findings (made pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(b)(5)) that were not submitted to a jury. Frankly, in the absence of any elaboration of this argument, we fail to understand how the district court's application of the four-level enhancement exposed Zawadzki to a greater statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the defendant concedes that on numerous occasions we have rejected <i>Apprendi</i> challenges in cases like this one, \"where the sentencing enhancements do not result in a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum.\" <i>See United States v.
