Richard S. Arnold, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.     This appeal poses two questions,\n\nboth of first impression in this circuit, arising out of Congress's\n\n1996 revision of the immigration laws.        First, we must determine\n\nwhat standard the new law requires us to apply when considering\n\nwhether to grant stays of removal pending appeal (we use the terms\n\n\"removal\"    and   \"deportation\"   interchangeably   in   this   opinion).\n\nAfter studying the question, we hold that under the new law such\n\nstays are guided by essentially the same standard that informs the\n\ngrant or denial of preliminary injunctions. Second, we must decide\n\nwhether the neoteric statutory procedures for reinstating previous\n\nremoval orders can be applied retroactively to an illegal reentrant\n\nwho had requested discretionary relief before those procedures took\n\neffect.     We hold that they cannot.     Our reasoning follows.\n\nI.   STATUTORY FRAMEWORK\n\n             In laying the foundation for our consideration of this\n\npetition, we first limn the applicable statutory framework.             We\n\nthen undertake to describe the facts at hand.        Only after we have\n\nset the stage do we turn to the issues that confront us.\n\n             On September 30, 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal\n\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) in a\n\ncomprehensive effort to strengthen and tighten the immigration\n\nlaws.1    See Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996); see also\n\n\n     1\n      Courts frequently refer to the immigration statutes and the\namendments thereto by their Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\nand IIRIRA sections rather than by their United States Code\n\n                                    -2-\n\fINS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 317 (2001) (describing the overall\n\neffect of the IIRIRA); Bejjani v. INS, 271 F.3d 670, 683 (6th Cir.\n\n2001) (similar).          In doing so, Congress repealed and amended\n\nvarious     parts   of    the   Immigration    and   Nationality    Act   (INA),\n\nincluding the provision on reinstatement of orders of deportation\n\nfor those who illegally reenter the United States.                 See IIRIRA §\n\n305(a)(3) (codified as amended at INA § 241, 8 U.S.C. § 1231\n\n(2002)) (replacing INA § 242(f), 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)).                      These\n\nchanges became effective on April 1, 1997.             See IIRIRA § 309(a).\n\n             The    new   reinstatement      provision,   replicated      in   the\n\nmargin,2 differs from its predecessor in a number of material\n\nrespects.     Compare INA § 241(a)(5), with INA § 242(f) (repealed\n\n1996).      First, the current provision expands the category of\n\n\n\nsections. To mitigate confusion, all citations to INA and IIRIRA\nsections will therefore include initial cross-references to their\ncorresponding sections in the Code but will appear thereafter only\nas citations to their respective session laws.\n     2\n         The statute reads:\n\n             If the Attorney General finds that an alien\n             has reentered the United States illegally\n             after having been removed or having departed\n             voluntarily, under an order of removal, the\n             prior order of removal is reinstated from its\n             original date and is not subject to being\n             reopened or reviewed, the alien is not\n             eligible and may not apply for any relief\n             under this Act, and the alien shall be removed\n             under the prior order at any time after the\n             reentry.\n\nINA § 241(a)(5).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fillegal reentrants   who   may    be   subject   to    reinstatement   of   a\n\nprevious   deportation   order.        Whereas   its   immediate   ancestor\n\nauthorized reinstatement only for those who had been deported for\n\ncertain enumerated reasons (e.g., persons convicted of aggravated\n\nfelonies), the new provision authorizes reinstatement of prior\n\nremoval orders for all illegal reentrants previously deported for\n\nany reason. See Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft, 290 F.3d 292, 296 (5th\n\nCir. 2002) (describing operation of reinstatement procedures under\n\nthe IIRIRA); Alvarez-Portillo v. Ashcroft, 280 F.3d 858, 862-63\n\n(8th Cir. 2002) (same).\n\n           Second, persons subject to reinstatement of a previous\n\ndeportation order no longer are entitled to a hearing before an\n\nimmigration judge (with its concomitant right to counsel and\n\nopportunity to develop an administrative record). Compare 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 241.8(a)&(b) (2003), with 8 C.F.R. § 242.23 (removed 1997).\n\nInstead, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) may\n\nemploy a summary administrative procedure in which an immigration\n\nofficial, not a judge, makes all the necessary determinations\n\nconcerning the decision to recommence deportation.3            An alien is\n\n\n     3\n      Congress recently abolished the INS as an independent agency\nwithin the Department of Justice and transferred its functions to\nthe newly established Department of Homeland Security.          See\nHomeland Security Act, Pub. L. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205\n(codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)) (2002).         The INS\nfunctions relevant to this case, including the adjudication of\nasylum claims, now reside in the Bureau of Citizenship and\nImmigration Services within the Department of Homeland Security.\nBecause the petitioner was detained before this change took place,\n\n                                   -4-\n\fallowed only to \"make a written or oral statement contesting the\n\n[immigration official's] determination.\"             8 C.F.R. § 241.8(b).\n\n               Third,   a   person    facing   reinstatement   of   an   earlier\n\ndeportation order may neither attack the validity of the earlier\n\norder nor endeavor to avoid removal by obtaining discretionary\n\nrelief (apart from asylum).             INA § 241(a)(5).     By contrast, the\n\npre-IIRIRA regime allowed those in deportation proceedings to\n\nrequest an adjustment of status (although granting the request lay\n\nwithin the discretion of the Attorney General).                See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n242.17(a) (removed 1997).            Even those reentering the United States\n\nillegally could seek such an adjustment.                See INA § 245(i) (8\n\nU.S.C. § 1255(i)) (repealed 1996); 8 C.F.R. §§ 245.1, 245.10\n\n(1996).\n\nII.   THE FACTS\n\n               The petitioner in this case first arrived in the United\n\nStates    in    1986    under   the    pseudonym   \"Maria   Guadalupe    Sillas-\n\nMendoza.\"      She was soon apprehended by the INS and, because she had\n\nentered without the documentation necessary for legal admission, an\n\nimmigration judge ordered her deported to her native Guatemala. In\n\n1990, the petitioner illegally reentered the United States, this\n\ntime using the name \"Gloria Arevalo.\"              She has remained here from\n\n\nwe continue to refer to the agency as the INS. We note, however,\nthat our jurisdiction derives from INA § 242(b)(2) (8 U.S.C. §\n1252(b)(2)) (2003), so the proper respondent is the United States\nAttorney General, see INA § 242(b)(3)(A) (8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(3)(A))\n(2003).\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthat time forward and given birth to two children (both of whom are\n\nAmerican citizens).\n\n          In August of 1990, the petitioner's father, a legal\n\npermanent resident, filed a visa petition on her behalf.              The INS\n\napproved that petition and issued an employment authorization card\n\n(a so-called \"green card\") to the petitioner.              In March of 1996,\n\nthe petitioner applied for adjustment of status to become a legal\n\npermanent resident and tendered the requisite fee.                  See INA §\n\n245(i).   On her application, she falsely swore that she had never\n\nbeen deported from the United States.\n\n          Proceedings       on   the       petitioner's    application    for\n\nadjustment    of   status   lagged   for    almost   six   years.    Finally,\n\nfingerprint analysis revealed that she had previously been deported\n\nunder a different name.       The INS sent the petitioner a letter in\n\nJanuary of 2002, notifying her of its discovery and advising her\n\nthat it would not entertain her application for adjustment of\n\nstatus.   The INS did nothing further, however, until January 17,\n\n2003, when it detained the petitioner.               Acting under the INA's\n\ncurrent reinstatement provision, see supra note 2, the INS then\n\nresurrected the previous order of deportation and instructed the\n\npetitioner that she had no right either to seek a hearing before an\n\nimmigration judge or to apply for discretionary relief.\n\n             The petitioner repaired to the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts, challenging the Attorney\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fGeneral's authority summarily to reinstate the previous order of\n\ndeportation. The district court, concluding that it lacked subject\n\nmatter   jurisdiction    over   most    of    the     petitioner's    claims,\n\ntransferred the case to us.     See 28 U.S.C. § 1631 (allowing inter-\n\ncourt transfers to cure lack of jurisdiction).           Acting under INA §\n\n242(b)(3)(B) (8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(3)(B)) (2003), we temporarily\n\nstayed the petitioner's deportation and set a briefing schedule.\n\nWe heard oral argument on June 4, 2003, and took the matter under\n\nadvisement.\n\nIII.   THE STAY\n\n            The stay of the order of deportation remains in effect.\n\nThe INS challenges it, asserting that its issuance was predicated\n\nupon an improper legal standard.        We do not agree.\n\n            Before Congress enacted the IIRIRA, an alien seeking\n\nreview of a deportation order was entitled to an automatic stay\n\npending the completion of that review.              See INA § 106(a)(3) (8\n\nU.S.C. § 1105a(a)(3)) (repealed 1996).            The IIRIRA altered that\n\nparadigm:   INA § 242(b)(3)(B) requires a review-seeker to ask the\n\nreviewing court for a stay of removal.            But section 242(b)(3)(B)\n\ndoes not specify the standard that a court should use in deciding\n\nwhether to grant a stay.\n\n            To fill this vacuum, the INS invites us to turn to a\n\nneighboring   subsection,   namely,     INA   §     242(f)(2)   (8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1252(f)(2)) (2003).     That subsection provides:\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f            Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no\n            court shall enjoin the removal of any alien\n            pursuant to a final order under this section\n            unless the alien shows by clear and convincing\n            evidence that the entry or execution of such\n            order is prohibited as a matter of law.\n\nINA § 242(f)(2).       According to the INS, a stay is an injunction,\n\nand, thus, the review-seeker cannot obtain a stay unless she can\n\nshow the illegality of the removal order by clear and convincing\n\nevidence.    We decline the INS's invitation to treat a temporary\n\nstay on a par with a permanent injunction.\n\n            Although this is a matter of first impression in this\n\ncourt, the case law in other circuits provides a modicum of\n\nguidance.   In Andreiu v. Ashcroft, 253 F.3d 477 (9th Cir. 2001) (en\n\nbanc), the Ninth Circuit rejected the INS's proposal that the clear\n\nand convincing evidence standard should apply to a stay of removal\n\npendente    lite.      The    court   instead   adopted     the   preliminary\n\ninjunction standard.         Id. at 483.    Under this quadral standard, a\n\npetitioner must demonstrate (1) that she is likely to succeed on\n\nthe merits of her underlying objection; (2) that she will suffer\n\nirreparable harm absent the stay; (3) that this harm outweighs any\n\npotential harm fairly attributable to the granting of the stay; and\n\n(4) that the stay would not disserve the public interest.\n\n            The Ninth Circuit's holding has been embraced in opinions\n\npublished by both the Second and Sixth Circuits.             See Mohammed v.\n\nReno, 309 F.3d 95, 98-100 (2d Cir. 2002); Bejjani, 271 F.3d at 687-\n\n88.   The    Seventh    Circuit    reached    the   same   conclusion   in   an\n\n                                      -8-\n\funpublished opinion.         See Lal v. Reno, 221 F.3d 1338 (7th Cir.\n\n2000) (unpublished table opinion).            The Eleventh Circuit, however,\n\nhas adopted the clear and convincing evidence standard in this\n\ncontext.    See, e.g., Weng v. United States Atty. Gen., 287 F.3d\n\n1335, 1340 (11th Cir. 2002).             For the reasons that follow, we\n\nadhere to the majority view.\n\n            We start — as we must — with the language of the statute\n\nitself.     The subsection immediately preceding INA § 242(f)(2)\n\nestablishes the Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction \"to enjoin\n\nor restrain the operation of the provisions of [this subchapter].\"\n\nINA   §    242(f)(1)    (8     U.S.C.     §     1252(f)(1))        (2003).     In\n\ncontradistinction,     subsection        (f)(2)     employs    only    the   term\n\n\"enjoin.\" Even though courts frequently use the terms \"enjoin\" and\n\n\"restrain\" interchangeably, this linguistic shift makes it appear\n\nlikely that Congress intended the words \"enjoin\" and \"restrain\" to\n\nhave different meanings. Otherwise, the use of the word \"restrain\"\n\nin subsection (f)(1) would be pointless — a circumstance that would\n\nput the subsection at odds with the venerable rule that statutes\n\nshould be interpreted, whenever possible, to give every word and\n\nphrase    some   operative    effect.4        See   Walters   v.    Metro.   Educ.\n\n\n\n      4\n      In point of fact, subsection (b)(3) uses the word \"stay\"\nrather than either \"enjoin\" or \"restrain,\" see INA § 242(b)(3)(B)\n(stating that service of a petition for judicial review \"does not\nstay the removal of an alien\"), making it even less likely that\nthis subsection was intended to incorporate the language of\nsubsection (f)(2).\n\n                                     -9-\n\fEnters., 519 U.S. 202, 209 (1997) (explaining this point); United\n\nStates v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985)\n\n(same).   The most sensible way to give operative effect to both\n\nwords in this statutory scheme is to treat the word \"enjoin\" as\n\nreferring to permanent injunctions and the word \"restrain\" as\n\nreferring to temporary injunctive relief (such as a stay).                  This\n\ndistinction between \"enjoin\" and \"restrain\" mirrors an identical\n\ndistinction   expressly    made   in     the      Hobbs   Act,   28   U.S.C.   §\n\n2349(a)&(b)   —   a   statute     that      INA    §   242(a)(1)      explicitly\n\nincorporates. See Maharaj v. Ashcroft, 295 F.3d 963, 965 (9th Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n          Moreover, courts long have employed the conventional\n\npreliminary   injunction     test      in      considering       requests   for\n\ndiscretionary stays of deportation.          See, e.g., Michael v. INS, 48\n\nF.3d 657, 662 n.4 (2d Cir. 1995); Ignacio v. INS, 955 F.2d 295, 299\n\n& n.5 (5th Cir. 1992) (per curiam).            We believe that if Congress\n\nhad wanted to break from the routine of the past and apply a\n\nheightened standard to stays pending appeal, it most likely would\n\nhave included such a standard in INA § 242(b)(3) itself.                     Cf.\n\nPrecision Indus., Inc. v. Qualitech Steel SBQ, LLC (In re Qualitech\n\nSteel Corp.), 327 F.3d 537, 548 (7th Cir. 2003) (refusing to\n\ninterpolate limitations from one statutory section into a different\n\nsection when the legislature itself did not do so).              In the absence\n\nof such a specific directive, reading INA § 242(f)(2) in a more\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fcircumspect manner follows the path demarcated by the Supreme Court\n\nin Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, 525 U.S.\n\n471, 482-87 (1999), in which the Court indicated that section 242\n\nshould be construed narrowly (in part because the execution of\n\nremoval orders is juridically distinct from the merits of those\n\norders).\n\n             Perhaps   most    important,   we   recognize   that    extending\n\nsubsection     (f)(2)'s     stringent   clear    and    convincing    evidence\n\nstandard to stays pending appeal under subsection (b)(3)(B) would\n\nresult in a peculiar situation in which adjudicating a stay request\n\nwould necessitate full deliberation on the merits of the underlying\n\ncase and, in the bargain, require the alien to carry a burden of\n\nproof higher than she would have to carry on the merits.                     This\n\nKafkaesque    design   is     counterintuitive.        Typically,    stays    are\n\ngranted or denied without a full adjudication on the merits, based\n\nin part on the likelihood — not the certainty — of eventual\n\nsuccess.     See, e.g., Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig, 296 F.3d 13,\n\n16 (1st Cir. 2002); see generally 11A Charles Alan Wright et al.,\n\nFederal Practice & Procedure § 2947, at 122 (2d ed. 2003).                   The\n\nreading of the statute advanced by the petitioner and adopted in\n\nAndreiu and its progeny comports with this conventional approach.\n\nThe INS's reading, on the other hand, creates a severe anomaly.\n\n           The anomaly is magnified when one considers the barebones\n\nadministrative record from which appellate judges must work in\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fdeportation cases.         See INA § 242(b)(4)(A) (8 U.S.C. § 1252\n\n(b)(4)(A))    (2003)   (\"[T]he   court      of   appeals   shall   decide   the\n\npetition only on the administrative record on which the order of\n\nremoval is based.\").5      It is trite, but true, that courts are bound\n\nto interpret statutes whenever possible in ways that avoid absurd\n\nresults.     United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. 329, 334 (1992);\n\nAtlantic Fish Spotters Ass'n v. Evans, 321 F.3d 220, 225 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   That prudential rule seems apposite here.\n\n            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — a survey\n\nof the IIRIRA amendments reveals that INA § 242(b)(3)(B) employs\n\nlanguage identical to that used in IIRIRA § 309(c)(4)(F), which\n\nregulates stays pending appeal in so-called transitional cases\n\n(cases pending as of the IIRIRA's effective date). In acting under\n\nIIRIRA     309(c)(4)(F),    courts    unhesitatingly        have    used    the\n\npreliminary injunction standard in deciding whether to grant or\n\ndeny a stay.     See, e.g., Sofinet v. INS, 188 F.3d 703, 706 (7th\n\nCir. 1999); Abbassi v. INS, 143 F.3d 513, 514 (9th Cir. 1998).               We\n\nthink it highly probable that IIRIRA § 309(c)(4)(F) carries the\n\nlanguage and effect of INA § 242(b)(3)(B) backward in time.\n\n             In reaching these conclusions, we acknowledge that the\n\nEleventh Circuit has interpreted INA § 242(f)(2) in line with the\n\n\n\n     5\n      The administrative record may be particularly scanty in cases\nsuch as the petitioner's. Under INA § 241(a)(5), aliens are no\nlonger afforded an opportunity for a hearing. See Bejjani, 271\nF.3d at 675-76.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fINS's view, and that a tougher standard for obtaining stays while\n\nawaiting judicial review of removal orders may be philosophically\n\nin keeping with the overall goals of the IIRIRA amendments.                       See,\n\ne.g., Weng, 287 F.3d at 1340.         But the change from automatic stays\n\n(the pre-IIRIRA regime) to stays granted only upon making the four-\n\npart   preliminary      injunction    showing       is    itself   a     significant\n\ntightening of the law and, thus, is consistent with the fundamental\n\npolicies   undergirding       the    IIRIRA    amendments.         We     reject   an\n\ninterpretive rule that would require courts invariably to construe\n\nall immigration statutes in the most draconian manner that their\n\nwords conceivably could support.\n\n            In   sum,    we   hold   that     the   applicable         standard    for\n\nevaluating requests for stays pending review of final orders of\n\nremoval    is    the    four-part      algorithm         used   for      preliminary\n\ninjunctions.     See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,\n\n102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996) (describing the four-part standard\n\nfor    preliminary      injunctions);       Narragansett        Indian    Tribe     v.\n\nGuilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1991) (same).                 As can readily be\n\ngleaned from our ensuing discussion of the reinstatement provision,\n\nsee infra Part IV, the stay previously granted in this case easily\n\nmeet those requirements.\n\nIV.    THE MERITS\n\n            The petitioner claims that because she reentered the\n\nUnited States and applied for adjustment of status before the\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fIIRIRA's effective date, that statute cannot be used as a vehicle\n\nfor     reinstating    the    previous     deportation   order   (and,    thus,\n\nabrogating her right to seek an adjustment of status).                   Before\n\nconsidering the merits of the petitioner's claim, we pause to\n\nclarify certain threshold matters.\n\n               A.     Jurisdiction and Standard of Review.\n\n             There is little doubt that we have appellate jurisdiction\n\nover the reinstatement of an order to deport an illegal reentrant.\n\nThe reinstatement itself operates as the functional equivalent of\n\na final order of removal.        While we cannot revisit the validity of\n\nthe original deportation order, see INS § 241(a)(5), we do have the\n\nauthority to determine the appropriateness of its resurrection.\n\nSee Ojeda-Terrazas, 290 F.3d at 294-95 (collecting cases); see also\n\nINA § 242(b)(2).\n\n             The petitioner's claim is based on the theory that the\n\nINS's     invocation     of    the   new     reinstatement   provision      was\n\nimpermissibly retroactive.           That raises a question as to what\n\nstandard of review applies to our retroactivity analysis.                The INS\n\nasserts that we owe it deference as the agency in charge of\n\nadministering the INA.         See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415,\n\n425 (1999); see generally Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def.\n\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 865 (1984).            We disagree.\n\n             We defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute only\n\nwhen the statute is ambiguous.           See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.      But\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fwhen a statute is silent as to its temporal reach and a court is\n\ncalled upon to construe it, under legal precedents, in order to\n\ndecide   whether   it   should   be   interpreted      retrospectively    or\n\nprospectively with regard to a particular antecedent event, there\n\nis no occasion for Chevron deference.     See St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 320\n\nn.45 (explaining that for Chevron purposes, there is \"no ambiguity\n\n. . . for an agency to resolve\"); Bejjani, 271 F.3d at 679-80\n\n(rejecting the INS's claim of Chevron deference in interpreting\n\nsection 241(a)(5)); Velasquez-Gabriel v. Crocetti, 263 F.3d 102,\n\n106 n.2 (4th Cir. 2001) (same).        After all, courts, rather than\n\nagencies, are best equipped to make the constitutionally tinged\n\njudgment calls inherent in retroactivity determinations.             See Pak\n\nv. Reno, 196 F.3d 666, 675 n.10 (6th Cir. 1999); Sandoval v. Reno,\n\n166 F.3d 225, 239-40 (3d Cir. 1999); Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d\n\n110, 127 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           We note, moreover, that we do not review here an INS\n\ndecision to grant or deny the petitioner an adjustment of status.\n\nThe INS may be quite right that such decisionmaking is committed to\n\nthe   Attorney   General's   discretion   (and,   as    such,   is   largely\n\nunreviewable). See Jay v. Boyd, 351 U.S. 345, 353 (1956); Carranza\n\nv. INS, 277 F.3d 65, 71-72 (1st Cir. 2002).         Rather, we review in\n\nthis proceeding the INS's unilateral determination that Congress\n\nintended to make INA § 241(a)(5) effective even as to applications\n\nfor discretionary relief that were pending at the time of its\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fenactment   (and,   if   so,   whether    that   gives   the    statute   an\n\nimpermissibly    retroactive    cast).      This   inquiry     raises   pure\n\nquestions of law.    See Mattis v. Reno, 212 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); LaGuerre v. Reno, 164 F.3d 1035, 1041 (7th Cir. 1998).\n\nAccordingly, we proceed to the retroactivity issue, employing de\n\nnovo review.\n\n                          B.   Retroactivity.\n\n            The Supreme Court has prescribed the proper rubric by\n\nwhich a court should determine whether a statute enacted after a\n\nparticular event can nonetheless direct the legal consequences of\n\nthat event.6    See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 280\n\n(1994); see also St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 316, 320 (applying the\n\nLandgraf rubric in the immigration context).         As in all cases of\n\nstatutory construction, the initial question involves the extent to\n\nwhich the legislature has spoken to the matter.          Martin v. Hadix,\n\n527 U.S. 343, 352 (1999); Associated Fisheries, Inc. v. Daley, 127\n\nF.3d 104, 112 (1st Cir. 1997).      This is particularly apropos with\n\nrespect to retroactivity:      \"a requirement that Congress first make\n\n\n\n     6\n      In criminal cases, other rubrics may apply (e.g., the Double\nJeopardy Clause or the Ex Post Facto Clause). Despite its grave\nconsequences, however, deportation constitutes a matter of civil\nrather than criminal procedure.    Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342\nU.S. 580, 594-95 (1952); Seale v. INS, 323 F.3d 150, 159 (1st Cir.\n2003). Thus, neither the Double Jeopardy Clause nor the Ex Post\nFacto Clause are relevant to deportation proceedings. See Breed v.\nJones, 421 U.S. 519, 528 (1975) (discussing Double Jeopardy\nClause); Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 530-31 (1954) (discussing\nEx Post Facto Clause).\n\n                                   -16-\n\fits    intention   clear    helps   ensure   that   Congress    itself    has\n\ndetermined    that   the    benefits   of    retroactivity     outweigh   the\n\npotential for disruption or unfairness.\"            Landgraf, 511 U.S. at\n\n268.\n\n            In answering this question, courts should employ the\n\ncustomary rules of statutory construction, assaying the language of\n\nthe statute itself and then considering its structure and purpose.\n\nLindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 326 (1997); Landgraf, 511 U.S. at\n\n262.\n\n            If the statute itself does not sufficiently denote the\n\ntemporal reach of its provisions, further inquiry follows a well-\n\ntrod path.    When a new statute is silent as to how (if at all) it\n\napplies to antecedent conduct, an inquiring court must proceed to\n\nexamine whether application of the statute in that fashion would\n\ncreate an impermissibly retroactive effect, that is, whether such\n\nan application \"would impair rights a party possessed when he\n\nacted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new\n\nduties with respect to transactions already completed.\"            Landgraf,\n\n511 U.S. at 280.     If such ramifications loom, the default rule is\n\nthat the statute should not be construed to regulate the past\n\nconduct. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520\n\nU.S. 939, 946 (1997); United States v. Puerto Rico, 287 F.3d 212,\n\n217 (1st Cir. 2002).       Here, then, our retroactivity analysis must\n\nfocus on the repercussions of the recently enacted statute vis-à-\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fvis persons situated similarly to the petitioner in relevant\n\nrespects.     McAndrews v. Fleet Bank, 989 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n            The mere fact that a new statute has some retroactive\n\neffect   does    not   make    the     answer    to   this    inquiry   a   foregone\n\nconclusion.      A new law is not impermissibly retroactive simply\n\nbecause subsequent proceedings under that law's authority implicate\n\npast events.     Puerto Rico, 287 F.3d at 217.               \"[A]pplication of new\n\nstatutes passed after the events in suit is unquestionably proper\n\nin many situations.\"          Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273; accord St. Cyr,\n\n533 U.S. at 315. The statute's temporal reach becomes unacceptable\n\nonly when its retrospective application would significantly impair\n\nexisting substantive          rights    and     thereby    disappoint   legitimate\n\nexpectations.      Gen. Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 191\n\n(1992); McAndrews, 989 F.2d at 15.\n\n            Although     pristine       in      theory,    distinctions     between\n\npermissible and impermissible effects are often fuliginous in\n\npractice.     That potential difficulty argues for close scrutiny of\n\na new law in its diverse applications.                Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 270;\n\nPratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54, 59 n.4 (1st Cir. 1997).                   Such\n\nscrutiny demands \"a common sense, functional judgment about whether\n\nthe new provision attaches new legal consequences\" to a past event\n\n— a judgment \"informed and guided by familiar considerations of\n\nfair   notice,    reasonable      reliance,       and     settled   expectations.\"\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fMartin, 527 U.S. at 357-58 (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            In examining the text of a statute, we recognize that, as\n\na general rule, the benchmark for finding unambiguous temporal\n\nscope is quite high.    See id. at 354-55 (intimating that nothing\n\nless than phrases such as \"shall apply to all proceedings pending\n\non or commenced after the date of enactment\" can make a statute\n\nunambiguously retroactive); see also St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 316.     A\n\nseries of courts have ruled that the wording of section 241(a)(5)\n\nfails to achieve this benchmark.    See, e.g., Alvarez-Portillo, 280\n\nF.3d at 864; Bejjani, 271 F.3d at 680; Velasquez-Gabriel, 263 F.3d\n\nat 106.   Although IIRIRA § 309(a) establishes an effective date of\n\nApril 1, 1997 for Title III-A (the title in which section 241\n\nresides), it too fails to provide the necessary guidance.7   See St.\n\nCyr, 533 U.S. at 317 (\"[A] statement that a statute will become\n\neffective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it\n\nhas any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.\")\n\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Attempting to show congressional intent, the INS points\n\nto section 241(a)(5)'s use of the perfective participle \"has\n\nreentered\" rather than the present tense \"reenters or attempts to\n\n\n     7\n      The so-called savings clause, IIRIRA § 309(c)(1), is of\nlittle help. That clause states that the amendments promulgated\nunder Title III-A shall not control removal proceedings pending on\nApril 1, 1997.    Here, however, the INS did not reinstate the\nprevious deportation order until 2003.\n\n                                 -19-\n\freenter\" seen, for example, in INA § 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) (8 U.S.C. §\n\n1182(a)(9)(C)(ii)) (2003) (defining classes of aliens who are\n\ninadmissible).        This gambit fails for two reasons.          First, section\n\n212(a)(9)(C)(ii) regulates an alien's admissibility (i.e., her\n\nability to enter the country lawfully), whereas section 241(a)(5)\n\nrelates    to    an   alien's   removability      (i.e.,    her   liability   for\n\ndeportation). See Rosales-Garcia v. Holland, 322 F.3d 386, 391 n.1\n\n(6th Cir. 2003); Almon v. Reno, 192 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nFor that reason, it was logical for Congress to vary the tenses in\n\nthe statutes accordingly.           One cannot read anything further into\n\nthese contrasting linguistic choices.             Accord Ojeda-Terrazas, 290\n\nF.3d at 300 (finding that this difference in language \"is not so\n\nclear that it could sustain only one interpretation\") (citation and\n\ninternal    quotation     marks    omitted).      Second,    this   distinction\n\nbetween sections 241 and 212 addresses, if anything, the relative\n\neffects of time of reentry; it does not speak at all to the\n\npotential effect of when an application for discretionary relief\n\nwas filed.\n\n            For her part, the petitioner would have us read section\n\n241(a)(5)       prospectively     based   upon    its   legislative    history.\n\nSection     242(f),      the      reinstatement     provision's       pre-IIRIRA\n\nembodiment, contained an express retroactivity proviso permitting\n\nthe Attorney General to reinstate deportation orders for those\n\nillegally reentering the United States \"after having previously\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fdeparted or been deported . . . whether before or after June 27,\n\n1952.\"   In drafting the new reinstatement provision, Congress\n\ndeclined to carry forward this concept.                In that process, it\n\nrejected drafts that included explicit retroactivity language. See\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 104-469(I), at 416-17 (1996), 1996 WL 168955; S. Rep.\n\nNo. 104-249, at 118 (1996), 1996 WL 180026.              On this basis, the\n\npetitioner        asserts   that    Congress   must    have   meant    the   new\n\nreinstatement provision to apply only to reentries occurring after\n\nits effective date.\n\n             We    are   not   as   sanguine   about   this   theory    as   the\n\npetitioner. Although Congress is presumed to be aware of the law's\n\ngeneral aversion to retroactivity, see Castro-Cortez v. INS, 239\n\nF.3d 1037, 1052 (9th Cir. 2001), it must also be presumed to know\n\nthat some Landgraf inquiries come out the other way.                     Hence,\n\nCongress's failure to include explicit reach-back language in the\n\ncurrent version of the reinstatement provision, without more, lacks\n\ndecretory significance. Cf. Rivers v. Roadway Exp., Inc., 511 U.S.\n\n298, 307-09 (1994) (declining to attribute dispositive effect to\n\nthe pretermission of retroactivity language in the final draft of\n\nthe \"make and enforce contracts\" provision of the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1991); Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 262-63 (noting the same phenomenon\n\nwith respect to the damages provision of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1991).   At most, legislative histories of this type tell us that\n\nwhile Congress may have thought retroactivity to be an important\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\ftopic, it could not muster a clear consensus on the subject.                   See\n\nRivers, 511 U.S. at 309.\n\n           The petitioner also asseverates that we can draw a\n\nfavorable conclusion from a comparison of INA § 241(a)(5) with\n\nother sections of the IIRIRA.        She points out that some sections do\n\nprovide expressly for retroactive application to particular events\n\ntranspiring before April 1, 1997.                 See, e.g., IIRIRA § 321(b)\n\n(defining aggravated felony); id. § 342(b) (discussing incitement\n\nof terrorism as a ground for exclusion); id. § 347(c) (discussing\n\nunlawful   voting   as    a   ground    for       exclusion).      By    negative\n\nimplication, she asks that we assume that Congress intended section\n\n241(a)(5) to apply only in a prospective manner.                       See INS v.\n\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432 (1987) (\"Where Congress includes\n\nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it in\n\nanother section . . . it is generally presumed that Congress acts\n\nintentionally   and      purposely     in    the     disparate    inclusion     or\n\nexclusion.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).                  The\n\nproblem is that many other sections of the IIRIRA unequivocally\n\nstate that they will apply only prospectively.               See, e.g., IIRIRA\n\n§ 344(c) (dealing with false claims of citizenship as a ground for\n\nexclusion); id. § 352(b) (dealing with renouncing citizenship for\n\ntax purposes as a ground for exclusion).                    Thus, the negative\n\nimplication   argument     could     just    as    easily   run   in    the   other\n\ndirection.    Courts should be reluctant to impute any meaning to\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fdisparities between statutory sections that were not drafted with\n\neach other in mind.     Martin, 527 U.S. at 356-57; Lindh, 521 U.S. at\n\n330.    In this instance, then, we unhesitatingly endorse the wise\n\njudgment of the Fourth Circuit that \"the sometimes retrospective,\n\nsometimes     prospective   provisions      that    surround   [the   statute]\n\nunveil[] the Janus-like faces of Congress, but leave[] its mind\n\nconcealed.\"      Tasios v. Reno, 204 F.3d 544, 549 (4th Cir. 2000).\n\n              The parties make other arguments, but none is convincing.\n\nWhat comes through loud and clear is that Congress failed to\n\nspecify the temporal reach of the INA's reinstatement provision.\n\nNor did Congress seed the statute with telltale clues; after\n\ncareful perscrutation of section 241(a)(5)'s text, history, and\n\nstructure, we conclude that the statute leaves uncertain whether it\n\nshould be read to occupy the field even when an application for\n\nadjustment of status was already on record at the time the statute\n\ntook effect.      Although Congress devised the IIRIRA as a detailed\n\nand comprehensive plan to strengthen the immigration laws, see Am.-\n\nArab Anti-Discrim. Comm., 525 U.S. at 486; Bartoszewska-Zajac v.\n\nINS, 237 F.3d 710, 712 (6th Cir. 2001), the comprehensiveness of\n\nthe statutory scheme says very little about Congress's desires\n\nanent   the    retroactivity   vel   non    of     the   statute's   individual\n\nprovisions.\n\n              To sum up, section 241(a)(5) is hopelessly unclear as to\n\nwhether it applies to those who illegally reentered the United\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fStates before April 1, 1997.             A fortiori, it is all the more\n\ntenebrous as to whether it affects those who not only reentered but\n\nalso applied for adjustment of status before that crucial date. In\n\nview of this rampant uncertainty, we must proceed to the second\n\nhalf of the Landgraf model and assess whether the operation of\n\nsection 241(a)(5) in the instant case would impose new burdens or\n\nattach new legal consequences to the petitioner's illegal reentry\n\nand-or her pending application for adjustment of status.                            See\n\nLandgraf, 511 U.S. at 269-70.           This assessment depends on whether\n\nexecution of the reinstatement order \"takes away or impairs vested\n\nrights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation,\n\nimposes   a    new    duty,   or    attaches    a   new    disability\"       to     the\n\npetitioner's     actions      in   a   way   that   offends       the    fundamental\n\nprinciples     of     fair   notice    and   reasonable     expectation.            Id.\n\n(citation       and      internal       quotation         marks         omitted).\n\n              Perhaps the easiest place to start is to note that this\n\ncase does not entail a challenge to the Attorney General's raw\n\npower to disallow the petitioner access to a new deportation\n\nhearing; although aliens subject to reinstatement of a previous\n\ndeportation order had a right to such a hearing before the passage\n\nof the IIRIRA, see 8 C.F.R. § 242.23, that right was procedural,\n\nand, therefore, can be taken away retroactively.                          See Ojeda-\n\nTerrazas, 290 F.3d at 301-02 (explaining that illegal reentrants\n\ncannot entertain any reasonable expectation of having a hearing\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fbefore an immigration judge); Alvarez-Portillo, 280 F.3d at 865\n\n(similar); see also Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 275 (remarking \"the\n\ndiminished reliance interests in matters of procedure\"); United\n\nStates v. Thurston, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2003) [No. 02-1966,\n\nslip op. at 46] (stating that \"procedural changes that do not\n\naffect        substantial       rights      are     not     usually       considered\n\n[impermissibly] retroactive\").\n\n              What the petitioner can and does contest, however, is the\n\nsudden negation of her application for discretionary relief.                       The\n\navailability of relief (or, at least, the opportunity to seek it)\n\nis properly classified as a substantive right.                    See Carranza, 277\n\nF.3d    at    71-72       (holding   that   a     current   statutory     grant     of\n\nopportunity         for    discretionary    relief     from   deportation     is     a\n\nsubstantive right); Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 128 (finding loss of\n\nopportunity for discretionary relief from deportation under INA §\n\n212(c) (8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)) (repealed 1996) affected substantive\n\nrights); cf. Hughes Aircraft, 520 U.S. at 951 (stating that changes\n\nin whether a claim may be brought at all affect substantive\n\nrights).      We see no reason why the bar on applications for relief\n\nunder section 241(a)(5) should be deemed an exception to this\n\ngeneral rule.         Accord Alvarez-Portillo, 280 F.3d at 867; Castro-\n\nCortez, 239 F.3d at 1052 n.17.\n\n              The INS objects that, unlike the petitioner in St. Cyr,\n\n533    U.S.    at    321-23,   the   petitioner      here   can    show   neither    a\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fcognizable     reliance     interest     in   this     right   nor   a     settled\n\nexpectation based on it.       Warming to the task, the INS insists that\n\nthe petitioner had no protectible interest in applying for relief\n\nbecause an adjustment of status was never a vested right.                  We think\n\nthat the INS circumscribes the encincture of relevant interests too\n\ngrudgingly.\n\n             First,   the   array   of    pertinent     interests     listed    in\n\nLandgraf, Hughes Aircraft, and other influential precedents is not\n\nexhaustive but merely illustration by synecdoche.                  Such listings\n\n\"simply describe[] several 'sufficient,' as opposed to 'necessary,'\n\nconditions for finding retroactivity.\"               St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 320\n\nn.46.   Second, the presumption against statutory retroactivity is\n\nnot restricted to cases involving vested rights.                   Landgraf, 511\n\nU.S. at 275 n.29; Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 130.                  Third, and most\n\nimportant, the petitioner in this case applied for adjustment of\n\nstatus before April 1, 1997 — a fact that distinguishes her in a\n\nmaterial way from the mine run of persons who appeal from the\n\nreinstatement of previous removal orders.              See Velasquez-Gabriel,\n\n263   F.3d   at   109-10    (noting    that   no     application     for    status\n\nadjustment had been made before IIRIRA's effective date despite\n\nmore than adequate time to do so); see also Jurado-Gutierrez v.\n\nGreene, 190 F.3d 1135, 1147 n.11 (10th Cir. 1999) (noting that no\n\napplication    for    waiver   of   deportation       had   been   filed    before\n\neffective date of AEDPA); Wright v. Ouellette, 171 F.3d 8, 11 (1st\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fCir. 1999) (noting that motion to reopen was filed after AEDPA's\n\neffective date).      In the latter genus of cases, it is not possible\n\nto complain that section 241(a)(5) appends new legal consequences\n\nto an event (the filing of an application for discretionary relief)\n\noccurring before its effective date.            See Velasquez-Gabriel, 263\n\nF.3d at 110.      This is a salient distinction because applications\n\nfor discretionary relief, once made, often become a source of\n\nexpectation and even reliance.         See, e.g., Mattis, 212 F.3d at 37;\n\nBowen v. Hood, 202 F.3d 1211, 1220-22 (9th Cir. 2000) (per curiam);\n\nWallace v. Reno, 194 F.3d 279, 287 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n             While    aliens   like   the    petitioner   here,   unlike      the\n\npetitioner in St. Cyr, cannot reasonably rely on the availability\n\nof discretionary relief when pondering whether to reenter this\n\ncountry illegally, we nonetheless must look at the impact of the\n\nnew law on the specific individual.          See Hughes Aircraft, 520 U.S.\n\nat 947-48; Mattis, 212 F.3d at 37.             The petitioner already had\n\nfiled for relief when Congress amended the statute. Discarding her\n\napplication now would deprive her both of a right that she once had\n\nand    of   the   reasonable    expectation     that   she   would     have   the\n\nopportunity to convince the Attorney General to grant her relief.\n\nAs    the   Supreme   Court    recently     stated,    \"[t]here   is    a   clear\n\ndifference, for the purposes of retroactivity analysis, between\n\nfacing possible deportation and facing certain deportation.\"                  St.\n\nCyr, 533 U.S. at 325.\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\f          Contrary to the INS's position, we do not think it is\n\nsignificant that adjustment of status is a discretionary form of\n\nrelief.   A right to seek relief is analytically separate and\n\ndistinct from a right to the relief itself.    United States ex rel.\n\nAccardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Mayers v. INS,\n\n175 F.3d 1289, 1301 n.15 (11th Cir. 1999).    Consequently, an alien\n\nis not precluded from having a vested right in a form of relief\n\nmerely because the relief itself is ultimately at the discretion of\n\nthe Executive Branch.   Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 130.\n\n          As a final matter the INS pounces on the petitioner's use\n\nof an alias and posits that she cannot be heard to complain of her\n\nloss of the right to apply for discretionary relief because of her\n\n\"unclean hands.\"   This argument is wide of the mark.   \"The doctrine\n\nof unclean hands only applies when the claimant's misconduct is\n\ndirectly related to the merits of the controversy between the\n\nparties [and] 'in some measure affect[s] the equitable relations\n\nbetween the parties in respect of something brought before the\n\ncourt for adjudication.'\"   Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Dep't of Consumer\n\nAffairs, 60 F.3d 867, 880 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Keystone Driller\n\nCo. v. Gen. Excavator Co., 290 U.S. 240, 245 (1933)).   Although the\n\npetitioner's dissembling may very well come back to haunt her when\n\nthe merits of her application for an adjustment of status are\n\nconsidered, we fail to see how this prevarication relates to the\n\nissue of whether section 241(a)(5) applies retroactively to her.\n\n\n                                -28-\n\f           For the reasons stated, we conclude that the text of\n\nsection 241(a)(5) is uncertain as to the statute's temporal scope,\n\nand that the statute, applied as the INS urges, would have an\n\nunfairly   retroactive     effect   on     the   petitioner's       rights   and\n\nexpectations.   Under these circumstances, the presumption against\n\nretroactivity   endures.      See   Landgraf,     511   U.S.   at    265.    We\n\ntherefore vacate the INS's unilateral decision to reinstate the\n\npetitioner's previous deportation order.8\n\nV.   HABEAS RELIEF\n\n           One final issue remains. The petitioner originally asked\n\nthe district court, among other things, for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nordering her immediate release from detention.             See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2241(a).   This request was properly filed with the district court.\n\nSee, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 687-88 (2001); Vasquez\n\nv. Reno, 233 F.3d 688, 690 (1st Cir. 2000).             The district court\n\nnevertheless refrained from ruling upon the petitioner's habeas\n\nclaim, recognizing that the propriety of detention depended in\n\nlarge part on questions of law over which this court — and only\n\nthis court — had jurisdiction.           See INA § 242(b)(2) (8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b)(2)) (2003) (limiting to courts of appeals all jurisdiction\n\nover final orders of removal); see also Castro-Cortez, 239 F.3d at\n\n\n\n     8\n      In view of this holding, we need not probe more deeply the\npetitioner's alternative argument that the Due Process Clause also\nbars the unilateral reinstatement of the previous deportation\norder.\n\n                                    -29-\n\f1047   (explaining       that    federal   courts      should     exercise   habeas\n\njurisdiction      only    when   all    other    judicial   and    administrative\n\navenues    have    been    exhausted).          We   have   now   answered     those\n\nquestions.     Accordingly, we retransfer this case to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings on the remnant habeas claim.                   See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2241(b); see also Carranza, 277 F.3d at 67.\n\nVI.    CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. We uphold the stay of deportation\n\npreviously    granted      and   rule    that    the   recent     changes    to   the\n\nreinstatement provision of the INA would, if given retroactive\n\neffect, unfairly attach new legal consequences to the petitioner's\n\npreexisting application for an adjustment of status.                 We therefore\n\nhold that the new reinstatement provision cannot be applied in this\n\ninstance. Accordingly, we vacate the reinstatement of the original\n\nremoval order and transfer what remains of the petition to the\n\ndistrict   court     for    further     proceedings      consistent     with      this\n\nopinion.   The INS, of course, is free (again, consistent with this\n\nopinion) to resume the processing of the petitioner's application\n\nfor adjustment of status and to go forward with a new round of\n\nremoval proceedings.\n\n\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\f",

First, we must determine what standard the new law requires us to apply when considering whether to grant stays of removal pending appeal (we use the terms \"removal\" and \"deportation\" interchangeably in this opinion). After studying the question, we hold that under the new law such stays are guided by essentially the same standard that informs the grant or denial of preliminary injunctions. Second, we must decide whether the neoteric statutory procedures for reinstating previous removal orders can be applied retroactively to an illegal reentrant who had requested discretionary relief before those procedures took effect. We hold that they cannot. Our reasoning follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In laying the foundation for our consideration of this petition, we first limn the applicable statutory framework.

Only after we have set the stage do we turn to the issues that confront us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) in a comprehensive effort to strengthen and tighten the immigration laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996); <i>see also INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 317, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (describing the overall effect of the IIRIRA); <i>Bejjani v. INS,</i> 271 F.3d 670, 683 (6th Cir.2001) (similar). In doing so, Congress repealed and amended various parts of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the provision on reinstatement of orders of deportation for those who illegally reenter the United States. <i>See</i> IIRIRA &#167; 305(a)(3) (codified as amended at INA &#167; 241, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231 (2002)) (replacing INA &#167; 242(f), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(f)). These changes became effective on April 1, 1997. <i>See</i> IIRIRA &#167; 309(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new reinstatement provision, replicated in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> differs from its predecessor in a number of material respects. <i>Compare</i> INA &#167; 241(a)(5), <i>with</i> INA &#167; 242(f) (repealed 1996). First, the current provision expands the category of illegal reentrants who may be subject to reinstatement of a previous deportation order. Whereas its immediate ancestor authorized reinstatement only for those who had been deported for certain enumerated reasons (e.g., persons convicted of aggravated felonies), the new provision authorizes reinstatement of prior removal orders for all illegal reentrants previously deported for <i>any</i> reason. <i>See Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft,</i> 290 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.2002) (describing operation of reinstatement procedures under the IIRIRA); <i>Alvarez-Portillo v. Ashcroft,</i> 280 F.3d 858, 862-63 (8th Cir.2002) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, persons subject to reinstatement of a previous deportation order no longer are entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge (with its concomitant right to counsel and opportunity to develop an administrative record). <i>Compare</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8(a) &amp; (b) (2003), <i>with</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 242.23 (removed 1997).

INA &#167; 241(a)(5). By contrast, the pre-IIRIRA regime allowed those in deportation proceedings to request an adjustment of status (although granting the request lay within the discretion of the Attorney General). <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 242.17(a) (removed 1997). Even those reentering the United States illegally could seek such an adjustment. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 245(i) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i)) (repealed 1996); 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 245.1, 245.10 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner in this case first arrived in the United States in 1986 under the pseudonym \"Maria Guadalupe Sillas-Mendoza.\" She was soon apprehended by the INS and, because she had entered without the documentation necessary for legal admission, an immigration judge ordered her deported to her native Guatemala. In 1990, the petitioner illegally reentered the United States, this time using the name \"Gloria Arevalo.\" She has remained here from that time forward and given birth to two children (both of whom are American citizens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 1990, the petitioner's father, a legal permanent resident, filed a visa petition on her behalf. The INS approved that petition and issued an employment authorization card (a so-called \"green card\") to the petitioner. In March of 1996, the petitioner applied for adjustment of status to become a legal permanent resident and tendered the requisite fee. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 245(i). On her application, she falsely swore that she had never been deported from the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceedings on the petitioner's application for adjustment of status lagged for almost six years. Finally, fingerprint analysis revealed that she had previously been deported under a different name. The INS sent the petitioner a letter in January of 2002, notifying her of its discovery and advising her that it would not entertain her application for adjustment of status. The INS did nothing further, however, until January 17, 2003, when it detained the petitioner. Acting under the INA's current reinstatement provision, <i>see supra</i> note 2, the INS then resurrected the previous order of deportation and instructed the petitioner that she had no right either to seek a hearing before an immigration judge or to apply for discretionary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner repaired to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, challenging the Attorney General's authority summarily to reinstate the previous order of deportation. The district court, concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over most of the petitioner's claims, transferred the case to us. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631 (allowing inter-court transfers to cure lack of jurisdiction). Acting under INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(3)(B)) (2003), we temporarily stayed the petitioner's deportation and set a briefing schedule. We heard oral argument on June 4, 2003, and took the matter under advisement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE STAY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stay of the order of deportation remains in effect. The INS challenges it, asserting that its issuance was predicated upon an improper legal standard. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Congress enacted the IIRIRA, an alien seeking review of a deportation order was entitled to an automatic stay pending the completion of that review. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 106(a)(3) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(a)(3)) (repealed 1996). The IIRIRA altered that paradigm: INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) requires a review-seeker to ask the reviewing court for a stay of removal. But section 242(b)(3)(B) does not specify the standard that a court should use in deciding whether to grant a stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To fill this vacuum, the INS invites us to turn to a neighboring subsection, namely, INA &#167; 242(f)(2) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(f)(2)) (2003). That subsection provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 242(f)(2). According to the INS, a stay is an injunction, and, thus, the review-seeker cannot obtain a stay unless she can show the illegality of the removal order by clear and convincing evidence. We decline the INS's invitation to treat a temporary stay on a par with a permanent injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is a matter of first impression in this court, the case law in other circuits provides a modicum of guidance. In <i>Andreiu v. Ashcroft,</i> 253 F.3d 477 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), the Ninth Circuit rejected the INS's proposal that the clear and convincing evidence standard should apply to a stay of removal <i>pendente lite.</i> The court instead adopted the preliminary injunction standard. <i>Id.</i> at 483. Under this quadral standard, a petitioner must demonstrate (1) that she is likely to succeed on the merits of her underlying objection; (2) that she will suffer irreparable harm absent the stay; (3) that this harm outweighs any potential harm fairly attributable to the granting of the stay; and (4) that the stay would not disserve the public interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit's holding has been embraced in opinions published by both the Second and Sixth Circuits. <i>See Mohammed v. Reno,</i> 309 F.3d 95, 98-100 (2d Cir.2002); <i>Bejjani,</i> 271 F.3d at 687-88. The Seventh Circuit reached the same conclusion in an unpublished opinion. <i>See Lal v. Reno,</i> 221 F.3d 1338 (7th Cir.2000) (unpublished table opinion). The Eleventh Circuit, however, has adopted the clear and convincing evidence standard in this context. <i>See, e.g., Weng v. United States Atty. Gen.,</i> 287 F.3d 1335, 1340 (11th Cir. 2002). For the reasons that follow, we adhere to the majority view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start &#8212; as we must &#8212; with the language of the statute itself. The subsection immediately preceding INA &#167; 242(f)(2) establishes the Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction \"to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of [this subchapter].\" INA &#167; 242(f)(1) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(f)(1)) (2003). In contradistinction, subsection (f)(2) employs only the term \"enjoin.\" Even though courts frequently use the terms \"enjoin\" and \"restrain\" interchangeably, this linguistic shift makes it appear likely that Congress intended the words \"enjoin\" and \"restrain\" to have different meanings. Otherwise, the use of the word \"restrain\" in subsection (f)(1) would be pointless &#8212; a circumstance that would put the subsection at odds with the venerable rule that statutes should be interpreted, whenever possible, to give every word and phrase some operative effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Walters v. Metro. Educ. Enters.,</i> 519 U.S. 202, 209, 117 S.Ct. 660, 136 L.Ed.2d 644 (1997) (explaining this point); <i>United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc.,</i> 758 F.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir.1985) (same). The most sensible way to give operative effect to both words in this statutory scheme is to treat the word \"enjoin\" as referring to permanent injunctions and the word \"restrain\" as referring to temporary injunctive relief (such as a stay). This distinction between \"enjoin\" and \"restrain\" mirrors an identical distinction expressly made in the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2349(a) &amp; (b) &#8212; a statute that INA &#167; 242(a)(1) explicitly incorporates. <i>See Maharaj v. Ashcroft,</i> 295 F.3d 963, 965 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, courts long have employed the conventional preliminary injunction test in considering requests for discretionary stays of deportation. <i>See, e.g., Michael v. INS,</i> 48 F.3d 657, 662 n. 4 (2d Cir.1995); <i>Ignacio v. INS,</i> 955 F.2d 295, 299 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.1992) (per curiam). We believe that if Congress had wanted to break from the routine of the past and apply a heightened standard to stays pending appeal, it most likely would have included such a standard in INA &#167; 242(b)(3) itself. <i>Cf. Precision Indus., Inc. v. Qualitech Steel SBQ, LLC (In re Qualitech Steel Corp.</i>), 327 F.3d 537, 548 (7th Cir.2003) (refusing to interpolate limitations from one statutory section into a different section when the legislature itself did not do so). In the absence of such a specific directive, reading INA &#167; 242(f)(2) in a more circumspect manner follows the path demarcated by the Supreme Court in <i>Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee,</i> 525 U.S. 471, 482-87, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999), in which the Court indicated that section 242 should be construed narrowly (in part because the execution of removal orders is juridically distinct from the merits of those orders).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps most important, we recognize that extending subsection (f)(2)'s stringent clear and convincing evidence standard to stays pending appeal under subsection (b)(3)(B) would result in a peculiar situation in which adjudicating a stay request would necessitate full deliberation on the merits of the underlying case and, in the bargain, require the alien to carry a burden of proof <i>higher</i> than she would have to carry on the merits. This Kafkaesque design is counterintuitive. Typically, stays are granted or denied without a full adjudication on the merits, based in part on the likelihood &#8212; not the certainty-of eventual success. <i>See, e.g., Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig,</i> 296 F.3d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 2002); <i>see generally</i> 11A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2947, at 122 (2d ed.2003). The reading of the statute advanced by the petitioner and adopted in <i>Andreiu</i> and its progeny comports with this conventional approach. The INS's reading, on the other hand, creates a severe anomaly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The anomaly is magnified when one considers the barebones administrative record from which appellate judges must work in deportation cases. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 242(b)(4)(A) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(A)) (2003) (\"[T]he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> It is trite, but true, that courts are bound to interpret statutes whenever possible in ways that avoid absurd results. <i>United States v. Wilson,</i> 503 U.S. 329, 334, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992); <i>Atlantic Fish Spotters Ass'n v. Evans,</i> 321 F.3d 220, 225 (1st Cir.2003). That prudential rule seems apposite here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; a survey of the IIRIRA amendments reveals that INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) employs language identical to that used in IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(F), which regulates stays pending appeal in so-called transitional cases (cases pending as of the IIRIRA's effective date). In acting under IIRIRA 309(c)(4)(F), courts unhesitatingly have used the preliminary injunction standard in deciding whether to grant or deny a stay. <i>See, e.g., Sofinet v. INS,</i> 188 F.3d 703, 706 (7th Cir.1999); <i>Abbassi v. INS,</i> 143 F.3d 513, 514 (9th Cir.1998). We think it highly probable that IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(F) carries the language and effect of INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) backward in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching these conclusions, we acknowledge that the Eleventh Circuit has interpreted INA &#167; 242(f)(2) in line with the INS's view, and that a tougher standard for obtaining stays while awaiting judicial review of removal orders may be philosophically in keeping with the overall goals of the IIRIRA amendments. <i>See, e.g., Weng,</i> 287 F.3d at 1340. But the change from automatic stays (the pre-IIRIRA regime) to stays granted only upon making the four-part preliminary injunction showing is itself a significant tightening of the law and, thus, is consistent with the fundamental policies undergirding the IIRIRA amendments. We reject an interpretive rule that would require courts invariably to construe all immigration statutes in the most draconian manner that their words conceivably could support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we hold that the applicable standard for evaluating requests for stays pending review of final orders of removal is the four-part algorithm used for preliminary injunctions. <i>See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1996) (describing the four-part standard for preliminary injunctions); <i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert,</i> 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir.1991) (same). As can readily be gleaned from our ensuing discussion of the reinstatement provision, see <i>infra</i> Part IV, the stay previously granted in this case easily meet those requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner claims that because she reentered the United States and applied for adjustment of status before the IIRIRA's effective date, that statute cannot be used as a vehicle for reinstating the previous deportation order (and, thus, abrogating her right to seek an adjustment of status). Before considering the merits of the petitioner's claim, we pause to clarify certain threshold matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Jurisdiction and Standard of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little doubt that we have appellate jurisdiction over the reinstatement of an order to deport an illegal reentrant. The reinstatement itself operates as the functional equivalent of a final order of removal. While we cannot revisit the validity of the original deportation order, <i>see</i> INA &#167; 241(a)(5), we do have the authority to determine the appropriateness of its resurrection. <i>See Ojeda-Terrazas,</i> 290 F.3d at 294-95 (collecting cases); <i>see also</i> INA &#167; 242(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's claim is based on the theory that the INS's invocation of the new reinstatement provision was impermissibly retroactive. That raises a question as to what standard of review applies to our retroactivity analysis. The INS asserts that we owe it deference as the agency in charge of administering the INA. <i>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. 415, 425, 119 S.Ct. 1439 (1999); <i>see generally Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 865, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute only when the statute is ambiguous. <i>See Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. But when a statute is silent as to its temporal reach and a court is called upon to construe it, under legal precedents, in order to decide whether it should be interpreted retrospectively or prospectively with regard to a particular antecedent event, there is no occasion for <i>Chevron</i> deference. <i>See St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 320 n. 45, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (explaining that for <i>Chevron</i> purposes, there is \"no ambiguity ... for an agency to resolve\"); <i>Bejjani,</i> 271 F.3d at 679-80 (rejecting the INS's claim of <i>Chevron</i> deference in interpreting section 241(a)(5)); <i>Velasquez-Gabriel v. Crocetti,</i> 263 F.3d 102, 106 n. 2 (4th Cir.2001) (same). After all, courts, rather than agencies, are best equipped to make the constitutionally tinged judgment calls inherent in retroactivity determinations. <i>See Pak v. Reno,</i> 196 F.3d 666, 675 n. 10 (6th Cir.1999); <i>Sandoval v. Reno,</i> 166 F.3d 225, 239-40 (3d Cir.1999); <i>Goncalves v. Reno,</i> 144 F.3d 110, 127 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, moreover, that we do not review here an INS decision to grant or deny the petitioner an adjustment of status. The INS may be quite right that such decisionmaking is committed to the Attorney General's discretion (and, as such, is largely unreviewable). <i>See Jay v. Boyd,</i> 351 U.S. 345, 353, 76 S.Ct. 919, 100 L.Ed. 1242 (1956); <i>Carranza v. INS,</i> 277 F.3d 65, 71-72 (1st Cir.2002). Rather, we review in this proceeding the INS's unilateral determination that Congress intended to make INA &#167; 241(a)(5) effective even as to applications for discretionary relief that were pending at the time of its enactment (and, if so, whether that gives the statute an impermissibly retroactive cast). This inquiry raises pure questions of law. <i>See Mattis v. Reno,</i> 212 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2000); <i>LaGuerre v. Reno,</i> 164 F.3d 1035, 1041 (7th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we proceed to the retroactivity issue, employing de novo review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Retroactivity.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has prescribed the proper rubric by which a court should determine whether a statute enacted after a particular event can nonetheless direct the legal consequences of that event.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,</i> 511 U.S. 244, 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (1994); <i>see also St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 316, 320, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (applying the <i>Landgraf</i> rubric in the immigration context). As in all cases of statutory construction, the initial question involves the extent to which the legislature has spoken to the matter. <i>Martin v. Hadix,</i> 527 U.S. 343, 352, 119 S.Ct. 1998, 144 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999); <i>Associated Fisheries, Inc. v. Daley,</i> 127 F.3d 104, 112 (1st Cir.1997). This is particularly apropos with respect to retroactivity: \"a requirement that Congress first make its intention clear helps ensure that Congress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness.\" <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 268, 114 S.Ct. 1483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In answering this question, courts should employ the customary rules of statutory construction, assaying the language of the statute itself and then considering its structure and purpose. <i>Lindh v. Murphy,</i> 521 U.S. 320, 326, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997); <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 262, 114 S.Ct. 1483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the statute itself does not sufficiently denote the temporal reach of its provisions, further inquiry follows a well-trod path. When a new statute is silent as to how (if at all) it applies to antecedent conduct, an inquiring court must proceed to examine whether application of the statute in that fashion would create an impermissibly retroactive effect, that is, whether such an application \"would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\" <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483. If such ramifications loom, the default rule is that the statute should not be construed to regulate the past conduct. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer,</i> 520 U.S. 939, 946, 117 S.Ct. 1871, 138 L.Ed.2d 135 (1997); <i>United States v. Puerto Rico,</i> 287 F.3d 212, 217 (1st Cir.2002). Here, then, our retroactivity analysis must focus on the repercussions of the recently enacted statute vis-&#224;-vis persons situated similarly to the petitioner in relevant respects. <i>McAndrews v. Fleet Bank,</i> 989 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere fact that a new statute has some retroactive effect does not make the answer to this inquiry a foregone conclusion. A new law is not impermissibly retroactive simply because subsequent proceedings under that law's authority implicate past events. <i>Puerto Rico,</i> 287 F.3d at 217. \"[A]pplication of new statutes passed after the events in suit is unquestionably proper in many situations.\" <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 273; <i>accord St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 315, 121 S.Ct. 2271. The statute's temporal reach becomes unacceptable only when its retrospective application would significantly impair existing substantive rights and thereby disappoint legitimate expectations. <i>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Romein,</i> 503 U.S. 181, 191, 112 S.Ct. 1105, 117 L.Ed.2d 328 (1992); <i>McAndrews,</i> 989 F.2d at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although pristine in theory, distinctions between permissible and impermissible effects are often fuliginous in practice. That potential difficulty argues for close scrutiny of a new law in its diverse applications. <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 270, 114 S.Ct. 1483; <i>Pratt v. United States,</i> 129 F.3d 54, 59 n. 4 (1st Cir.1997). Such scrutiny demands \"a common sense, functional judgment about whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences\" to a past event &#8212; a judgment \"informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.\" <i>Martin,</i> 527 U.S. at 357-58, 119 S.Ct. 1998 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In examining the text of a statute, we recognize that, as a general rule, the benchmark for finding unambiguous temporal scope is quite high. <i>See id.</i> at 354-55, 119 S.Ct. 1998 (intimating that nothing less than phrases such as \"shall apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced after the date of enactment\" can make a statute unambiguously retroactive); <i>see also St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 316, 121 S.Ct. 2271. A series of courts have ruled that the wording of section 241(a)(5) fails to achieve this benchmark. <i>See, e.g., Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 864; <i>Bejjani,</i> 271 F.3d at 680; <i>Velasquez-Gabriel,</i> 263 F.3d at 106. Although IIRIRA &#167; 309(a) establishes an effective date of April 1, 1997 for Title III-A (the title in which section 241 resides), it too fails to provide the necessary guidance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 317, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (\"[A] statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.\") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to show congressional intent, the INS points to section 241(a)(5)'s use of the perfective participle \"has reentered\" rather than the present tense \"reenters or attempts to reenter\" seen, for example, in INA &#167; 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(9)(C)(ii)) (2003) (defining classes of aliens who are inadmissible). This gambit fails for two reasons. First, section 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) regulates an alien's admissibility (i.e., her ability to enter the country lawfully), whereas section 241(a)(5) relates to an alien's removability (i.e., her liability for deportation). <i>See Rosales-Garcia v. Holland,</i> 322 F.3d 386, 391 n. 1 (6th Cir.2003); <i>Almon v. Reno,</i> 192 F.3d 28, 30 (1st Cir.1999). For that reason, it was logical for Congress to vary the tenses in the statutes accordingly. One cannot read anything further into these contrasting linguistic choices. <i>Accord Ojeda-Terrazas,</i> 290 F.3d at 300 (finding that this difference in language \"is not so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Second, this distinction between sections 241 and 212 addresses, if anything, the relative effects of time of reentry; it does not speak at all to the potential effect of when an application for discretionary relief was filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For her part, the petitioner would have us read section 241(a)(5) prospectively based upon its legislative history. Section 242(f), the reinstatement provision's pre-IIRIRA embodiment, contained an express retroactivity proviso permitting the Attorney General to reinstate deportation orders for those illegally reentering the United States \"after having previously departed or been deported ... whether before or after June 27, 1952.\" In drafting the new reinstatement provision, Congress declined to carry forward this concept. In that process, it rejected drafts that included explicit retroactivity language. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-469(I), at 416-17 (1996), 1996 WL 168955; S.Rep. No. 104-249, at 118 (1996), 1996 WL 180026. On this basis, the petitioner asserts that Congress must have meant the new reinstatement provision to apply only to reentries occurring after its effective date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not as sanguine about this theory as the petitioner. Although Congress is presumed to be aware of the law's general aversion to retroactivity, <i>see Castro-Cortez v. INS,</i> 239 F.3d 1037, 1052 (9th Cir.2001), it must also be presumed to know that some <i>Landgraf</i> inquiries come out the other way. Hence, Congress's failure to include explicit reach-back language in the current version of the reinstatement provision, without more, lacks decretory significance. <i>Cf. Rivers v. Roadway Exp., Inc.,</i> 511 U.S. 298, 307-09, 114 S.Ct. 1510, 128 L.Ed.2d 274 (1994) (declining to attribute dispositive effect to the pretermission of retroactivity language in the final draft of the \"make and enforce contracts\" provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991); <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 262-63, 114 S.Ct. 1522 (noting the same phenomenon with respect to the damages provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991). At most, legislative histories of this type tell us that while Congress may have thought retroactivity to be an important topic, it could not muster a clear consensus on the subject. <i>See Rivers,</i> 511 U.S. at 309, 114 S.Ct. 1510.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner also asseverates that we can draw a favorable conclusion from a comparison of INA &#167; 241(a)(5) with other sections of the IIRIRA. She points out that some sections do provide expressly for retroactive application to particular events transpiring before April 1, 1997. <i>See, e.g.,</i> IIRIRA &#167; 321(b) (defining aggravated felony); <i>id.</i> &#167; 342(b) (discussing incitement of terrorism as a ground for exclusion); <i>id.</i> &#167; 347(c) (discussing unlawful voting as a ground for exclusion). By negative implication, she asks that we assume that Congress intended section 241(a)(5) to apply only in a prospective manner. <i>See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. 421, 432, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (\"Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section... it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The problem is that many other sections of the IIRIRA unequivocally state that they will apply only prospectively. <i>See, e.g.,</i> IIRIRA &#167; 344(c) (dealing with false claims of citizenship as a ground for exclusion); <i>id.</i> &#167; 352(b) (dealing with renouncing citizenship for tax purposes as a ground for exclusion). Thus, the negative implication argument could just as easily run in the other direction. Courts should be reluctant to impute any meaning to disparities between statutory sections that were not drafted with each other in mind. <i>Martin,</i> 527 U.S. at 356-57, 119 S.Ct. 1998; <i>Lindh,</i> 521 U.S. at 330, 117 S.Ct. 2059. In this instance, then, we unhesitatingly endorse the wise judgment of the Fourth Circuit that \"the sometimes retrospective, sometimes prospective provisions that surround [the statute] unveil[ ] the Janus-like faces of Congress, but leave[ ] its mind concealed.\" <i>Tasios v. Reno,</i> 204 F.3d 544, 549 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties make other arguments, but none is convincing. What comes through loud and clear is that Congress failed to specify the temporal reach of the INA's reinstatement provision. Nor did Congress seed the statute with telltale clues; after careful perscrutation of section 241(a)(5)'s text, history, and structure, we conclude that the statute leaves uncertain whether it should be read to occupy the field even when an application for adjustment of status was already on record at the time the statute took effect. Although Congress devised the IIRIRA as a detailed and comprehensive plan to strengthen the immigration laws, <i>see Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim. Comm.,</i> 525 U.S. at 486, 119 S.Ct. 936; <i>Bartoszewska-Zajac v. INS,</i> 237 F.3d 710, 712 (6th Cir.2001), the comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme says very little about Congress's desires anent the retroactivity vel non of the statute's individual provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, section 241(a)(5) is hopelessly unclear as to whether it applies to those who illegally reentered the United States before April 1, 1997. A fortiori, it is all the more tenebrous as to whether it affects those who not only reentered but also applied for adjustment of status before that crucial date. In view of this rampant uncertainty, we must proceed to the second half of the <i>Landgraf</i> model and assess whether the operation of section 241(a)(5) in the instant case would impose new burdens or attach new legal consequences to the petitioner's illegal reentry and-or her pending application for adjustment of status. <i>See Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 269-70, 114 S.Ct. 1483. This assessment depends on whether execution of the reinstatement order \"takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability\" to the petitioner's actions in a way that offends the fundamental principles of fair notice and reasonable expectation. <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Perhaps the easiest place to start is to note that this case does not entail a challenge to the Attorney General's raw power to disallow the petitioner access to a new deportation hearing; although aliens subject to reinstatement of a previous deportation order had a right to such a hearing before the passage of the IIRIRA, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 242.23, that right was procedural, and, therefore, can be taken away retroactively. <i>See Ojeda-Terrazas,</i> 290 F.3d at 301-02 (explaining that illegal reentrants cannot entertain any reasonable expectation of having a hearing before an immigration judge); <i>Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 865 (similar); <i>see also Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 275, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (remarking \"the diminished reliance interests in matters of procedure\"); <i>United States v. Thurston,</i> 338 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.2003) [No. 02-1966, slip op. at 46] (stating that \"procedural changes that do not affect substantial rights are not usually considered [impermissibly] retroactive\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What the petitioner can and does contest, however, is the sudden negation of her application for discretionary relief. The availability of relief (or, at least, the opportunity to seek it) is properly classified as a substantive right. <i>See Carranza,</i> 277 F.3d at 71-72 (holding that a current statutory grant of opportunity for discretionary relief from deportation is a substantive right); <i>Goncalves,</i> 144 F.3d at 128 (finding loss of opportunity for discretionary relief from deportation under INA &#167; 212(c) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c)) (repealed 1996) affected substantive rights); <i>cf. Hughes Aircraft,</i> 520 U.S. at 951, 117 S.Ct. 1871 (stating that changes in whether a claim may be brought at all affect substantive rights). We see no reason why the bar on applications for relief under section 241(a)(5) should be deemed an exception to this general rule. <i>Accord Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 867; <i>Castro-Cortez,</i> 239 F.3d at 1052 n. 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS objects that, unlike the petitioner in <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 321-23, 121 S.Ct. 2271, the petitioner here can show neither a cognizable reliance interest in this right nor a settled expectation based on it. Warming to the task, the INS insists that the petitioner had no protectable interest in applying for relief because an adjustment of status was never a vested right. We think that the INS circumscribes the enceinture of relevant interests too grudgingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the array of pertinent interests listed in <i>Landgraf, Hughes Aircraft,</i> and other influential precedents is not exhaustive but merely illustration by synecdoche. Such listings \"simply describe[ ] several `sufficient,' as opposed to `necessary,' conditions for finding retroactivity.\" <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 320 n. 46, 121 S.Ct. 2271. Second, the presumption against statutory retroactivity is not restricted to cases involving vested rights. <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 275 n. 29, 114 S.Ct. 1483; <i>Goncalves,</i> 144 F.3d at 130. Third, and most important, the petitioner in this case applied for adjustment of status before April 1, 1997 &#8212; a fact that distinguishes her in a material way from the mine run of persons who appeal from the reinstatement of previous removal orders. <i>See Velasquez-Gabriel,</i> 263 F.3d at 109-10 (noting that no application for status adjustment had been made before IIRIRA's effective date despite more than adequate time to do so); <i>see also Jurado-Gutierrez v. Greene,</i> 190 F.3d 1135, 1147 n. 11 (10th Cir.1999) (noting that no application for waiver of deportation had been filed before effective date of AEDPA); <i>Wright v. Ouellette,</i> 171 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that motion to reopen was filed after AEDPA's effective date). In the latter genus of cases, it is not possible to complain that section 241(a)(5) appends new legal consequences to an event (the filing of an application for discretionary relief) occurring <i>before</i> its effective date. <i>See Velasquez-Gabriel,</i> 263 F.3d at 110. This is a salient distinction because applications for discretionary relief, once made, often become a source of expectation and even reliance. <i>See, e.g., Mattis,</i> 212 F.3d at 37; <i>Bowen v. Hood,</i> 202 F.3d 1211, 1220-22 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam); <i>Wallace v. Reno,</i> 194 F.3d 279, 287 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While aliens like the petitioner here, unlike the petitioner in <i>St. Cyr,</i> cannot reasonably rely on the availability of discretionary relief when pondering whether to reenter this country illegally, we nonetheless must look at the impact of the new law on the specific individual. <i>See Hughes Aircraft,</i> 520 U.S. at 947-48, 117 S.Ct. 1871; <i>Mattis,</i> 212 F.3d at 37. The petitioner already had filed for relief when Congress amended the statute. Discarding her application now would deprive her both of a right that she once had and of the reasonable expectation that she would have the opportunity to convince the Attorney General to grant her relief. As the Supreme Court recently stated, \"[t]here is a clear difference, for the purposes of retroactivity analysis, between facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation.\" <i>St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. at 325, 121 S.Ct. 2271.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the INS's position, we do not think it is significant that adjustment of status is a discretionary form of relief. A right to seek relief is analytically separate and distinct from a right to the relief itself. <i>United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy,</i> 347 U.S. 260, 268, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954); <i>Mayers v. INS,</i> 175 F.3d 1289, 1301 n. 15 (11th Cir.1999). Consequently, an alien is not precluded from having a vested right in a form of relief merely because the relief itself is ultimately at the discretion of the Executive Branch. <i>Goncalves,</i> 144 F.3d at 130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a final matter the INS pounces on the petitioner's use of an alias and posits that she cannot be heard to complain of her loss of the right to apply for discretionary relief because of her \"unclean hands.\" This argument is wide of the mark. \"The doctrine of unclean hands only applies when the claimant's misconduct is directly related to the merits of the controversy between the parties [and] `in some measure affect[s] the equitable relations between the parties in respect of something brought before the court for adjudication.'\" <i>Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Dep't of Consumer Affairs,</i> 60 F.3d 867, 880 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting <i>Keystone Driller Co. v. Gen. Excavator Co.,</i> 290 U.S. 240, 245, 54 S.Ct. 146, 78 L.Ed. 293 (1933)). Although the petitioner's dissembling may very well come back to haunt her when the merits of her application for an adjustment of status are considered, we fail to see how this prevarication relates to the issue of whether section 241(a)(5) applies retroactively to her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we conclude that the text of section 241(a)(5) is uncertain as to the statute's temporal scope, and that the statute, applied as the INS urges, would have an unfairly retroactive effect on the petitioner's rights and expectations. Under these circumstances, the presumption against retroactivity endures. <i>See Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 265, 114 S.Ct. 1483. We therefore vacate the INS's unilateral decision to reinstate the petitioner's previous deportation order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. HABEAS RELIEF</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final issue remains. The petitioner originally asked the district court, among other things, for a writ of habeas corpus ordering her immediate release from detention. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(a). This request was properly filed with the district court. <i>See, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis,</i> 533 U.S. 678, 687-88, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001); <i>Vasquez v. Reno,</i> 233 F.3d 688, 690 (1st Cir.2000). The district court nevertheless refrained from ruling upon the petitioner's habeas claim, recognizing that the propriety of detention depended in large part on questions of law over which this court &#8212; and only this court &#8212; had jurisdiction. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 242(b)(2) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(2)) (2003) (limiting to courts of appeals all jurisdiction over final orders of removal); <i>see also Castro-Cortez,</i> 239 F.3d at 1047 (explaining that federal courts should exercise habeas jurisdiction only when all other judicial and administrative avenues have been exhausted). We have now answered those questions. Accordingly, we retransfer this case to the district court for further proceedings on the remnant habeas claim. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(b); <i>see also Carranza,</i> 277 F.3d at 67.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We uphold the stay of deportation previously granted and rule that the recent changes to the reinstatement provision of the INA would, if given retroactive effect, unfairly attach new legal consequences to the petitioner's preexisting application for an adjustment of status. We therefore hold that the new reinstatement provision cannot be applied in this instance. Accordingly, we vacate the reinstatement of the original removal order and transfer what remains of the petition to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The INS, of course, is free (again, consistent with this opinion) to resume the processing of the petitioner's application for adjustment of status and to go forward with a new round of removal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The Hon.

The INS functions relevant to this case, including the adjudication of asylum claims, now reside in the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services within the Department of Homeland Security. Because the petitioner was detained before this change took place, we continue to refer to the agency as the INS. We note, however, that our jurisdiction derives from INA &#167; 242(b)(2) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(2)) (2003), so the proper respondent is the United States Attorney General, <i>see</i> INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(A) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(3)(A)) (2003).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In point of fact, subsection (b)(3) uses the word \"stay\" rather than either \"enjoin\" or \"restrain,\"<i>see</i> INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) (stating that service of a petition for judicial review \"does not stay the removal of an alien\"), making it even less likely that this subsection was intended to incorporate the language of subsection (f)(2).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The administrative record may be particularly scanty in cases such as the petitioner's.

First, we must determine what standard the new law requires us to apply when considering whether to grant stays of removal pending appeal (we use the terms \"removal\" and \"deportation\" interchangeably in this opinion). After studying the question, we hold that under the new law such stays are guided by essentially the same standard that informs the grant or denial of preliminary injunctions. Second, we must decide whether the neoteric statutory procedures for reinstating previous removal orders can be applied retroactively to an illegal reentrant who had requested discretionary relief before those procedures took effect.

First, the current provision expands the category of illegal reentrants who may be subject to reinstatement of a previous deportation order. Whereas its immediate ancestor authorized reinstatement only for those who had been deported for certain enumerated reasons (e.g., persons convicted of aggravated felonies), the new provision authorizes reinstatement of prior removal orders for all illegal reentrants previously deported for <i>any</i> reason. <i>See Ojeda-Terrazas v.

THE FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner in this case first arrived in the United States in 1986 under the pseudonym \"Maria Guadalupe Sillas-Mendoza.\" She was soon apprehended by the INS and, because she had entered without the documentation necessary for legal admission, an immigration judge ordered her deported to her native Guatemala. In 1990, the petitioner illegally reentered the United States, this time using the name \"Gloria Arevalo.\" She has remained here from that time forward and given birth to two children (both of whom are American citizens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 1990, the petitioner's father, a legal permanent resident, filed a visa petition on her behalf. The INS approved that petition and issued an employment authorization card (a so-called \"green card\") to the petitioner. In March of 1996, the petitioner applied for adjustment of status to become a legal permanent resident and tendered the requisite fee. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 245(i). On her application, she falsely swore that she had never been deported from the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proceedings on the petitioner's application for adjustment of status lagged for almost six years. Finally, fingerprint analysis revealed that she had previously been deported under a different name. The INS sent the petitioner a letter in January of 2002, notifying her of its discovery and advising her that it would not entertain her application for adjustment of status. The INS did nothing further, however, until January 17, 2003, when it detained the petitioner. Acting under the INA's current reinstatement provision, <i>see supra</i> note 2, the INS then resurrected the previous order of deportation and instructed the petitioner that she had no right either to seek a hearing before an immigration judge or to apply for discretionary relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner repaired to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, challenging the Attorney General's authority summarily to reinstate the previous order of deportation. The district court, concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over most of the petitioner's claims, transferred the case to us. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631 (allowing inter-court transfers to cure lack of jurisdiction). Acting under INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(3)(B)) (2003), we temporarily stayed the petitioner's deportation and set a briefing schedule. We heard oral argument on June 4, 2003, and took the matter under advisement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE STAY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stay of the order of deportation remains in effect. The INS challenges it, asserting that its issuance was predicated upon an improper legal standard. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Congress enacted the IIRIRA, an alien seeking review of a deportation order was entitled to an automatic stay pending the completion of that review. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 106(a)(3) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1105a(a)(3)) (repealed 1996). The IIRIRA altered that paradigm: INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) requires a review-seeker to ask the reviewing court for a stay of removal. But section 242(b)(3)(B) does not specify the standard that a court should use in deciding whether to grant a stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To fill this vacuum, the INS invites us to turn to a neighboring subsection, namely, INA &#167; 242(f)(2) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(f)(2)) (2003). That subsection provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 242(f)(2). According to the INS, a stay is an injunction, and, thus, the review-seeker cannot obtain a stay unless she can show the illegality of the removal order by clear and convincing evidence. We decline the INS's invitation to treat a temporary stay on a par with a permanent injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this is a matter of first impression in this court, the case law in other circuits provides a modicum of guidance. In <i>Andreiu v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773640\"><a href=\"/opinion/773640/dan-marius-andreiu-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), the Ninth Circuit rejected the INS's proposal that the clear and convincing evidence standard should apply to a stay of removal <i>pendente lite.</i> The court instead adopted the preliminary injunction standard. <i>Id.</i> at 483. Under this quadral standard, a petitioner must demonstrate (1) that she is likely to succeed on the merits of her underlying objection; (2) that she will suffer irreparable harm absent the stay; (3) that this harm outweighs any potential harm fairly attributable to the granting of the stay; and (4) that the stay would not disserve the public interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ninth Circuit's holding has been embraced in opinions published by both the Second and Sixth Circuits. <i>See Mohammed v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779653\"><a href=\"/opinion/779653/haniff-mohammed-v-janet-reno-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-doris/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 98-100 (2d Cir.2002); <i>Bejjani,</i> 271 F.3d at 687-88. The Seventh Circuit reached the same conclusion in an unpublished opinion. <i>See Lal v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1338</span></span> (7th Cir.2000) (unpublished table opinion). The Eleventh Circuit, however, has adopted the clear and convincing evidence standard in this context. <i>See, e.g., Weng v. United States Atty. Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777421\"><a href=\"/opinion/777421/bin-weng-v-us-attorney-general-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span>, 1340 (11th Cir. 2002). For the reasons that follow, we adhere to the majority view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start &#8212; as we must &#8212; with the language of the statute itself. The subsection immediately preceding INA &#167; 242(f)(2) establishes the Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction \"to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of [this subchapter].\" INA &#167; 242(f)(1) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(f)(1)) (2003). In contradistinction, subsection (f)(2) employs only the term \"enjoin.\" Even though courts frequently use the terms \"enjoin\" and \"restrain\" interchangeably, this linguistic shift makes it appear likely that Congress intended the words \"enjoin\" and \"restrain\" to have different meanings. Otherwise, the use of the word \"restrain\" in subsection (f)(1) would be pointless &#8212; a circumstance that would put the subsection at odds with the venerable rule that statutes should be interpreted, whenever possible, to give every word and phrase some operative effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Walters v. Metro. Educ. Enters.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118075\"><a href=\"/opinion/118075/walters-v-metropolitan-ed-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 209, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118075\"><a href=\"/opinion/118075/walters-v-metropolitan-ed-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The most sensible way to give operative effect to both words in this statutory scheme is to treat the word \"enjoin\" as referring to permanent injunctions and the word \"restrain\" as referring to temporary injunctive relief (such as a stay). This distinction between \"enjoin\" and \"restrain\" mirrors an identical distinction expressly made in the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2349(a) &amp; (b) &#8212; a statute that INA &#167; 242(a)(1) explicitly incorporates. <i>See Maharaj v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778260\"><a href=\"/opinion/778260/ravin-maharaj-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span>, 965 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, courts long have employed the conventional preliminary injunction test in considering requests for discretionary stays of deportation. <i>See, e.g., Michael v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"690278\"><a href=\"/opinion/690278/marcus-andre-michael-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span>, 662 n. 4 (2d Cir.1995); <i>Ignacio v.

We believe that if Congress had wanted to break from the routine of the past and apply a heightened standard to stays pending appeal, it most likely would have included such a standard in INA &#167; 242(b)(3) itself. <i>Cf. Precision Indus., Inc. v. Qualitech Steel SBQ, LLC (In re Qualitech Steel Corp.</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781754\"><a href=\"/opinion/781754/precision-industries-inc-and-circo-leasing-co-llc-v-qualitech-steel/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 548 (7th Cir.2003) (refusing to interpolate limitations from one statutory section into a different section when the legislature itself did not do so). In the absence of such a specific directive, reading INA &#167; 242(f)(2) in a more circumspect manner follows the path demarcated by the Supreme Court in <i>Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118264\"><a href=\"/opinion/118264/reno-v-american-arab-anti-discrimination-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 482-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118264\"><a href=\"/opinion/118264/reno-v-american-arab-anti-discrimination-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This Kafkaesque design is counterintuitive. Typically, stays are granted or denied without a full adjudication on the merits, based in part on the likelihood &#8212; not the certainty-of eventual success. <i>See, e.g., Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-Monroig,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 2002); <i>see generally</i> 11A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2947, at 122 (2d ed.2003). The reading of the statute advanced by the petitioner and adopted in <i>Andreiu</i> and its progeny comports with this conventional approach.

That prudential rule seems apposite here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; a survey of the IIRIRA amendments reveals that INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) employs language identical to that used in IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(F), which regulates stays pending appeal in so-called transitional cases (cases pending as of the IIRIRA's effective date). In acting under IIRIRA 309(c)(4)(F), courts unhesitatingly have used the preliminary injunction standard in deciding whether to grant or deny a stay. <i>See, e.g., Sofinet v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765781\"><a href=\"/opinion/765781/ioan-sofinet-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span>, 706 (7th Cir.1999); <i>Abbassi v.

We think it highly probable that IIRIRA &#167; 309(c)(4)(F) carries the language and effect of INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) backward in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching these conclusions, we acknowledge that the Eleventh Circuit has interpreted INA &#167; 242(f)(2) in line with the INS's view, and that a tougher standard for obtaining stays while awaiting judicial review of removal orders may be philosophically in keeping with the overall goals of the IIRIRA amendments. <i>See, e.g., Weng,</i> 287 F.3d at 1340. But the change from automatic stays (the pre-IIRIRA regime) to stays granted only upon making the four-part preliminary injunction showing is itself a significant tightening of the law and, thus, is consistent with the fundamental policies undergirding the IIRIRA amendments. We reject an interpretive rule that would require courts invariably to construe all immigration statutes in the most draconian manner that their words conceivably could support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we hold that the applicable standard for evaluating requests for stays pending review of final orders of removal is the four-part algorithm used for preliminary injunctions. <i>See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1996) (describing the four-part standard for preliminary injunctions); <i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v.

As can readily be gleaned from our ensuing discussion of the reinstatement provision, see <i>infra</i> Part IV, the stay previously granted in this case easily meet those requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner claims that because she reentered the United States and applied for adjustment of status before the IIRIRA's effective date, that statute cannot be used as a vehicle for reinstating the previous deportation order (and, thus, abrogating her right to seek an adjustment of status). Before considering the merits of the petitioner's claim, we pause to clarify certain threshold matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Jurisdiction and Standard of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little doubt that we have appellate jurisdiction over the reinstatement of an order to deport an illegal reentrant. The reinstatement itself operates as the functional equivalent of a final order of removal.

First, section 212(a)(9)(C)(ii) regulates an alien's admissibility (i.e., her ability to enter the country lawfully), whereas section 241(a)(5) relates to an alien's removability (i.e., her liability for deportation). <i>See Rosales-Garcia v.

Section 242(f), the reinstatement provision's pre-IIRIRA embodiment, contained an express retroactivity proviso permitting the Attorney General to reinstate deportation orders for those illegally reentering the United States \"after having previously departed or been deported ... whether before or after June 27, 1952.\" In drafting the new reinstatement provision, Congress declined to carry forward this concept. In that process, it rejected drafts that included explicit retroactivity language. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-469(I), at 416-17 (1996), 1996 WL 168955; S.Rep.

She points out that some sections do provide expressly for retroactive application to particular events transpiring before April 1, 1997. <i>See, e.g.,</i> IIRIRA &#167; 321(b) (defining aggravated felony); <i>id.</i> &#167; 342(b) (discussing incitement of terrorism as a ground for exclusion); <i>id.</i> &#167; 347(c) (discussing unlawful voting as a ground for exclusion). By negative implication, she asks that we assume that Congress intended section 241(a)(5) to apply only in a prospective manner. <i>See INS v.

The problem is that many other sections of the IIRIRA unequivocally state that they will apply only prospectively. <i>See, e.g.,</i> IIRIRA &#167; 344(c) (dealing with false claims of citizenship as a ground for exclusion); <i>id.</i> &#167; 352(b) (dealing with renouncing citizenship for tax purposes as a ground for exclusion). Thus, the negative implication argument could just as easily run in the other direction.

Nor did Congress seed the statute with telltale clues; after careful perscrutation of section 241(a)(5)'s text, history, and structure, we conclude that the statute leaves uncertain whether it should be read to occupy the field even when an application for adjustment of status was already on record at the time the statute took effect. Although Congress devised the IIRIRA as a detailed and comprehensive plan to strengthen the immigration laws, <i>see Am.-Arab Anti-Discrim.

A fortiori, it is all the more tenebrous as to whether it affects those who not only reentered but also applied for adjustment of status before that crucial date. In view of this rampant uncertainty, we must proceed to the second half of the <i>Landgraf</i> model and assess whether the operation of section 241(a)(5) in the instant case would impose new burdens or attach new legal consequences to the petitioner's illegal reentry and-or her pending application for adjustment of status. <i>See Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 269-70, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This assessment depends on whether execution of the reinstatement order \"takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability\" to the petitioner's actions in a way that offends the fundamental principles of fair notice and reasonable expectation. <i>Id.</i> (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Perhaps the easiest place to start is to note that this case does not entail a challenge to the Attorney General's raw power to disallow the petitioner access to a new deportation hearing; although aliens subject to reinstatement of a previous deportation order had a right to such a hearing before the passage of the IIRIRA, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 242.23, that right was procedural, and, therefore, can be taken away retroactively. <i>See Ojeda-Terrazas,</i> 290 F.3d at 301-02 (explaining that illegal reentrants cannot entertain any reasonable expectation of having a hearing before an immigration judge); <i>Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 865 (similar); <i>see also Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 275, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Third, and most important, the petitioner in this case applied for adjustment of status before April 1, 1997 &#8212; a fact that distinguishes her in a material way from the mine run of persons who appeal from the reinstatement of previous removal orders. <i>See Velasquez-Gabriel,</i> 263 F.3d at 109-10 (noting that no application for status adjustment had been made before IIRIRA's effective date despite more than adequate time to do so); <i>see also Jurado-Gutierrez v.

We note, however, that our jurisdiction derives from INA &#167; 242(b)(2) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(2)) (2003), so the proper respondent is the United States Attorney General, <i>see</i> INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(A) (8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(3)(A)) (2003).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In point of fact, subsection (b)(3) uses the word \"stay\" rather than either \"enjoin\" or \"restrain,\"<i>see</i> INA &#167; 242(b)(3)(B) (stating that service of a petition for judicial review \"does not stay the removal of an alien\"), making it even less likely that this subsection was intended to incorporate the language of subsection (f)(2).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The administrative record may be particularly scanty in cases such as the petitioner's.
