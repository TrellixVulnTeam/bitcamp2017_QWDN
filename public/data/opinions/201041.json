Eric J. Donnelly (“Donnelly”)\n\nappeals from a 46-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea\n\nto conspiracy to violate the civil rights of jail detainees under\n\nhis supervision, conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of\n\njustice, and four counts of deprivation of rights under color of\n\nlaw.       On appeal, Donnelly argues that the sentencing court erred\n\nwhen it included a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. §\n\n3A1.1 (“vulnerable victim”).          Because we find that the district\n\ncourt committed no reversible error in its determination that one\n\nof Donnelly’s victims was a “vulnerable victim,” we affirm the\n\nsentence.\n\n                              I.     Background1\n\n              From December, 1989 through December, 1999, Donnelly was\n\nemployed by the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Department.                  Donnelly\n\nworked at the Nashua Street Jail in Boston, Massachusetts, a\n\ndetention center which houses pre-trial detainees. Donnelly was an\n\nofficer and supervisor at the jail and sometimes served as the\n\nlieutenant of the Sheriff’s Emergency Response Team.\n\n              From at least June, 1998 through February, 2001, Donnelly\n\nand    several    other   officers   and    supervisors   had   an   unwritten\n\nagreement to use unjustified, excessive force to punish detainees\n\n\n\n       1\n       Because this case was disposed of by a guilty plea, we\naccept the facts as presented in the uncontested portions of the\nPresentence Report and the sentencing hearing transcript. United\nStates v. Lagasse, 87 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fwho “disrespected” the officers, “put hands” on the officers, or\n\notherwise misbehaved.         The agreement led to the use of excessive\n\nforce in order “to teach the inmates a lesson.”               Donnelly and other\n\nofficers and supervisors assaulted at least four detainees between\n\nApril    15,    1999   and    October    16,   1999.     It    is    the      factual\n\ncircumstances surrounding the assault on one of the detainees,\n\n“L.G.,”2 which give rise to this appeal.\n\n               During September and October of 1999, L.G. was detained\n\nat the Nashua Street Jail.        L.G. suffers from Tourette’s Syndrome,\n\na neurological disorder which affects his ability to control his\n\nverbal and physical acts. L.G.’s Tourette’s outbursts consisted of\n\nrepetitious      and   involuntary      physical   movements,       or    tics,   and\n\nuncontrollable verbal outbursts, which often included the use of\n\nprofanity.\n\n               On October 16, 1999, L.G., in violation of jail rules,\n\ngot up from his table to wash a piece of fruit.                 Officer William\n\nBenson    (“Benson”)      admonished      L.G.     for   getting         up   without\n\npermission, but permitted him to wash his fruit before sitting back\n\ndown.    What happened after L.G. returned to his seat is disputed.\n\nOne version of the story is that L.G. sat down and said of Benson,\n\n“What an attitude.”          Another officer claims that L.G. said, “You\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       The initials “L.G.” are used simply to protect the identity\nof the victim.\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffat f*ck.”       Regardless of what was said, L.G. was dismissed from\n\ndinner and returned to his locked cell in the medical unit.\n\n              Once back in his cell, L.G. began to feel his Tourette’s\n\nsymptoms act up. To lessen the effects of the Tourette’s outburst,\n\nL.G. engaged in physical activity, which consisted of shadowboxing\n\nand bench       pressing   his   bed.     Benson,   hearing   the   commotion,\n\napproached L.G.’s cell and said, “Shut the f*ck up,” to which L.G.\n\nresponded, “You shut the f*ck up.         You people make fun of me around\n\nhere all the time and I can’t say nothing about it.                 F*ck you.\n\nNo.”       The exchange between L.G. and Benson prompted Donnelly, who\n\nwas in the medical unit watching a baseball game on television, to\n\napproach L.G.’s cell.        Donnelly then said to L.G., “You will not\n\ntalk to my officers that way.”           Donnelly and Benson then entered\n\nL.G.’s cell where they hit him repeatedly in the face, head, and\n\nbody.       During the assault, one or both of the officers3 yelled,\n\n“We’ll beat the Tourette’s out of you.”\n\n               On May 15, 2001, Donnelly was charged with conspiracy to\n\nviolate the civil rights of detainees being held at the Nashua\n\nStreet Jail. In particular, Donnelly was charged with seven counts\n\nconsisting of: (1) conspiring to obstruct justice, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 371; (2) obstruction of justice, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. 1512(b)(3); (3) conspiring to violate rights, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 241; and (4) deprivation of rights under color of\n\n\n       3\n           It is not clear who uttered these words.\n\n                                        -4-\n\flaw, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 242.                   The indictment contained\n\nfour individual counts of deprivation of rights under color of law,\n\nwhich included the L.G. assault.\n\n              On March 3, 2003, Donnelly entered into a plea agreement\n\nwith the United States Attorney’s Office, wherein Donnelly agreed\n\nto plead guilty to all counts with which he was charged.                   The plea\n\nagreement provided that the government would take the position that\n\nDonnelly’s total offense level was 21.                 The plea agreement further\n\nprovided that the government would recommend that Donnelly be\n\nsentenced at the low end of the guideline sentencing range.                  In the\n\nevent    of    an    appeal,      however,       the   agreement   preserved   the\n\ngovernment’s        “right   to    argue    the    correctness     of   Defendant’s\n\nsentence and the manner in which the District Court determines it.”\n\n              At the sentencing hearing on June 6, 2003, the court\n\nconsidered the Presentence Report (“PSR”), which included a two-\n\nlevel enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1 for each of the four\n\ncounts charging Donnelly with deprivation of rights under color of\n\nlaw.    The probation officer included the enhancement citing the\n\nfact that Donnelly’s victims were detained in a jail cell when they\n\nwere    assaulted.       This     fact,    the    probation    officer    believed,\n\nsupported a finding that those victims were vulnerable victims\n\nunder section 3A1.1.         Accordingly, the probation officer concluded\n\nthat Donnelly’s total offense level was 23.                   Both the government\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fand Donnelly objected to the applicability of section 3A1.1 to each\n\nof the four counts.\n\n           The district court found that section 3A1.1 was not\n\napplicable on the grounds set forth in the PSR by the probation\n\nofficer.   Rather, the sentencing judge, relying on the PSR and his\n\nown observations of L.G. during the trial of several of Donnelly’s\n\nco-conspirators,4 advised the parties that he would apply the\n\nvulnerable victim enhancement to the assault on L.G.    The district\n\njudge stated that he believed the enhancement should be applied in\n\nL.G.’s case because “in very large part the assault on [L.G.]\n\noccurred because he had Tourette’s Syndrome.”          At Donnelly’s\n\nrequest, the district court suspended the hearing to allow Donnelly\n\ntime to prepare to address the district court’s position that the\n\nvulnerable victim enhancement be applied with respect to Donnelly’s\n\nassault on L.G.\n\n           On July 7, 2003, the sentencing hearing was re-convened.\n\nOn that same day, just prior to the hearing, Donnelly filed an\n\nobjection to the PSR, specifically objecting to the district court\n\ntaking the statement, “We’ll beat the Tourette’s out of you,” into\n\naccount in its consideration of the applicability of section 3A1.1.\n\n\n\n     4\n       The sentencing judge presided over the trial of three of\nDonnelly’s co-conspirators, where he observed L.G.’s Tourette’s\noutbursts during L.G.’s testimony at the trial. At the sentencing\nhearing, the judge informed counsel that he would take into\nconsideration his observations of L.G. in determining whether\nsection 3A1.1 should be applied to Donnelly.\n\n                                -6-\n\fFinding the objection untimely, the sentencing judge declined to\n\nconsider it.\n\n            After   hearing   the   arguments   of   counsel,    the   court\n\ndetermined that the two-level enhancement provided for by section\n\n3A1.1 should be included in the sentencing calculation as it\n\nrelated to the L.G. incident.        The court found that the assault\n\noccurred because of L.G.’s Tourette’s Syndrome.            Accordingly, the\n\ncourt determined Donnelly’s total offense level to be 23, with a\n\nguideline range of 46-57 months.          Donnelly was sentenced to 46\n\nmonths   imprisonment.        Donnelly    appeals    his   sentence.      In\n\naccordance with the plea agreement, the government pursues its\n\noption to argue that the sentencing court imposed the correct\n\nsentence.\n\n                        II.   Standard of Review\n\n            Before reaching the merits of this appeal, we must\n\ndetermine the appropriate standard of review.          A sentencing court\n\nmust make two distinct and separate findings to apply section\n\n3A1.1: (1) that the victim is a “vulnerable victim”; and (2) that\n\nthe defendant knew or should have known of the victim’s unusual\n\nvulnerability.      Both parties agree that the district court’s\n\nfindings of fact as they relate to whether or not L.G. is a\n\nvulnerable victim, by virtue of his Tourette’s Syndrome, are\n\nreviewed for clear error and that the legal determinations of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdistrict court are subject to plenary review. See United States v.\n\nGill, 99 F.3d 484, 485 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           The government and Donnelly disagree, however, as to the\n\nappropriate standard of review as it relates to the second element\n\nof the vulnerable victim enhancement: whether Donnelly knew or\n\nshould have known of L.G.’s unusual vulnerability.           The government\n\nargues that, although Donnelly objected to the enhancement on the\n\ngrounds that L.G. was not a “vulnerable victim,” he did not argue\n\nto the sentencing court that Donnelly did not know of L.G.’s\n\nvulnerability, and therefore the issue of Donnelly’s knowledge of\n\nL.G.’s   vulnerability   was   not    properly   preserved    below.   The\n\ngovernment, therefore, urges us to review this claim for plain\n\nerror.   Donnelly argues that the plain error standard does not\n\napply because he is not raising a new claim on appeal, but rather\n\nthat he properly preserved the issue below by arguing against the\n\napplication of section 3A1.1 generally.\n\n           We have said that an appellant must specifically raise\n\nbefore the district court any issues he or she wishes to preserve\n\nfor our consideration.   See United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (noting that “arguments not seasonably addressed to\n\nthe trial court may not be raised for the first time in an\n\nappellate venue”).   In the court below Donnelly objected to the\n\nimposition of the enhancement based on his assertion that L.G. was\n\nnot a “vulnerable victim.”           Donnelly, however, did not argue\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fspecifically that the enhancement could not be applied to Donnelly\n\nbecause there was no evidence to support a finding that Donnelly\n\nknew or should have known of L.G.’s vulnerability.                       Donnelly’s\n\nfailure to address the second element of the vulnerable victim\n\nenhancement requires that we review the court’s ruling on this\n\nelement for plain error.          Thus, as it relates to the knowledge\n\nelement of section 3A1.1, Donnelly bears the burden of showing that\n\nthe district court committed “(1) an error, (2) that is plain, and\n\n(3) that affects substantial rights.”             United States v. Connolly,\n\n341 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. Downs-\n\nMoses, 329 F.3d 253, 263 (1st Cir. 2003)(internal quotations\n\nomitted)).      If Donnelly can establish plain error, he then “must\n\ndemonstrate     that   the    error    ‘seriously       impaired   the   fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.’” Id.\n\n(quoting United States v. Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 2003)).\n\n                          III.    U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1.\n\n             Having established the standard of our review, we next\n\nturn to Donnelly’s claims on appeal.\n\n             Section 3A1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that\n\na   two-level    upward      enhancement      should    be   applied     “[i]f   the\n\ndefendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense\n\nwas a vulnerable victim.”             U.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b)(1) (Nov. 2002).\n\nCommentary    to   section     3A1.1(b)       defines    the   term    “vulnerable\n\nvictim”:\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f           “vulnerable victim” means a person (A) who is\n           a victim of the offense of conviction . . . ;\n           and (B) who is unusually vulnerable due to\n           age, physical or mental condition, or who is\n           otherwise particularly susceptible to the\n           criminal conduct. . . . [The section] applies\n           to offenses involving an unusually vulnerable\n           victim in which the defendant knows or should\n           have   known   of    the   victim’s   unusual\n           vulnerability.\n\nU.S.S.G.   §    3A1.1,     cmt.    n.2.       We   have    interpreted      the    term\n\n“susceptible to the criminal conduct” as being “primarily concerned\n\nwith the impaired capacity of the victim to detect or prevent the\n\ncrime, rather than the quantity of harm suffered by the victim.”\n\nUnited States v. Fosher, 124 F.3d 52, 55-56 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(quoting Gill, 99 F.3d at 486).\n\n           Focusing        on    the   language    of     section   3A1.1    and   the\n\nsection’s commentary, a two-prong test must be satisfied before the\n\nenhancement is imposed: First, the sentencing court must find that\n\nthe victim of the crime was vulnerable, that is, that the victim\n\nhad an “impaired capacity . . . to detect or prevent the crime.”\n\nId. at 55-56 (quoting Gill, 99 F.3d at 486); and second, the\n\nsentencing court must find that the defendant knew or should have\n\nknown of the victim’s unusual vulnerability.\n\n           On    appeal,        Donnelly    challenges     the   district    court’s\n\napplication     of   the    vulnerable       victim     enhancement    on    several\n\ngrounds: (1) L.G. was not a vulnerable victim within the meaning of\n\nsection 3A1.1 because he was not particularly susceptible to the\n\nassault; (2) the record does not support a finding, either directly\n\n                                           -10-\n\for by inference, that Donnelly knew or should have known that L.G.\n\nwas particularly susceptible; and (3) there is no nexus between\n\nL.G.’s vulnerability and the assault.\n\n          We begin by disposing of Donnelly’s third assignment of\n\nerror: that the district court erred in applying section 3A1.1\n\nbecause it did not find a nexus between L.G.’s vulnerability and\n\nDonnelly’s crime.      Donnelly urges us to adopt the analysis set\n\nforth in United States v. Monostra, 125 F.3d 183 (3d Cir. 1997), a\n\nThird Circuit case which the court remanded to the district court\n\nfor further consideration of whether there was a nexus between the\n\nvictim’s vulnerability and the crime’s success.\n\n          The nexus requirement is based on the general limitation\n\nthat a sentencing court base its finding of unusual vulnerability\n\non individualized findings of particular susceptibility, rather\n\nthan on the victim’s membership in a large class.              See United\n\nStates v. Lee, 973 F.2d 832, 834 (10th Cir. 1992) (“The language of\n\nthe guideline requires that a victim be ‘unusually vulnerable . .\n\n.’ and the cases accordingly require that the sentencing court make\n\nparticularized findings of vulnerability.           Specifically, there\n\nshould be a nexus between the victim’s vulnerability and the\n\ncrime’s ultimate success.” (emphasis in original)).              “We have\n\ndiscouraged sentencing courts from making an ‘unusually vulnerable\n\nvictim’ finding based solely on the victim’s membership in a\n\nparticular   class,”   but   have    recognized   that   “in   some   cases\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\finferences to be drawn regarding particular class characteristics\n\nmay be so strong that ‘there can be little doubt about unusual\n\nvulnerability of class members within the meaning of section\n\n3A1.1.’”          Fosher, 124 F.3d at 56 (quoting Gill, 99 F.3d at 487).\n\nSince       the “nexus” test is already a part of our analysis of\n\nwhether the victim is a “vulnerable victim” under section 3A1.1, we\n\nfind       that    it   would    be   superfluous    to   incorporate    a   third,\n\nindependent “nexus” prong into our discussion of the applicability\n\nof the vulnerable victim enhancement.                We therefore focus on the\n\ntwo-prong          formulation:       (1)   that   the    victim   was   unusually\n\nvulnerable, and (2) that the defendant knew or should have known of\n\nthe victim’s unusual vulnerability.\n\n                            A.    Unusual Vulnerability\n\n                  Donnelly challenges the district court’s application of\n\nsection 3A1.1, arguing that L.G. is not a “vulnerable victim.”\n\nFirst Donnelly asserts that the district court erred in applying\n\nsection 3A1.1 because the facts before the district court did not\n\nsupport an individualized finding of vulnerability.5                 We disagree.\n\n\n       5\n       The government contends that the sentencing court could have\nfound L.G. particularly susceptible without having to make an\nindividualized finding of particular susceptibility. See Gill, 99\nF.3d at 487 (“In some cases the inference . . . may be so powerful\nthat there can be little doubt about unusual vulnerability of class\nmembers within the meaning of section 3A1.1.”) Since, however, we\nfind that the district court did make an individualized finding of\nparticular susceptibility, we need not decide whether an inmate or\ndetainee who suffers from Tourette’s Syndrome and is the victim of\na plan to assault individuals who are disruptive or disrespectful\nto persons in authority carries with it so strong an inference that\n\n                                            -12-\n\fThe record below amply supports the district court’s determination\n\nthat L.G. was unusually vulnerable to the assault, that is, that he\n\nhad an “impaired capacity . . . to detect or prevent the crime.”\n\nFosher, 124 F.3d at 55-56 (quoting Gill, 99 F.3d at 486).\n\n          L.G. was reprimanded by Benson for breaking jail rules,\n\nexchanged words with another officer over the incident, and as a\n\nresult, was sent back to his locked cell in the medical unit.      Back\n\nin his cell, L.G. found himself exhibiting symptoms of a Tourette’s\n\nrelated outburst.   To lessen the effects of his outburst, L.G.\n\nengaged in physical activity which induced Benson, and later\n\nDonnelly, to approach L.G.’s cell.       It was the exchange between\n\nBenson and L.G., which resulted from L.G.’s Tourette’s outburst,\n\nwhich led to the assault.    Thus, it is reasonable to conclude, as\n\ndid the district court, that L.G.’s condition made him particularly\n\nsusceptible to the attack.\n\n          Furthermore,   these   facts   illustrate    the   individual\n\ncharacteristics possessed by L.G. which distinguish him from the\n\nother detainees: a detainee who does not suffer from Tourette’s\n\nSyndrome can make a conscious decision not to act in ways which may\n\nprovoke jail officers to “teach him a lesson.”        L.G.’s Tourette’s\n\nSyndrome impaired his capacity to prevent the behavior which would\n\nlead to the assault by Donnelly.   We therefore find no clear error\n\n\n\n\nthere is little doubt as to the vulnerability of class members.\n\n                                 -13-\n\fin the district court’s conclusion that L.G. was a “vulnerable\n\nvictim” under section 3A1.1.\n\n         B.    Defendant’s Knowledge of Unusual Vulnerability\n\n              We now turn to the second element of the vulnerable\n\nvictim enhancement, that Donnelly knew or should have known of\n\nL.G.’s particular susceptibility to the assault.              Before doing so,\n\nhowever, there is an evidentiary matter we must consider: which\n\nfacts are properly before this Court in our consideration of this\n\nissue.     Donnelly argues that we should not consider as fact the\n\nstatement contained in the PSR and the government’s presentation of\n\npredicate facts at the plea hearing that the officers shouted,\n\n“We’ll beat the Tourette’s out of you,” during L.G.’s assault.\n\nDonnelly asserts that the statement is too vague because there is\n\nno indication as to which of the officers made the statement.\n\nDonnelly      also    argues   that   because   L.G.   did    not    mention    the\n\nstatement during his trial testimony, the court erred in finding\n\nthe statement a “fact” proven by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nWe disagree.         The sentencing judge properly took into account his\n\nobservations of L.G. when he testified at the trial of Donnelly’s\n\nco-conspirators.6          The   statements     made   in    the    PSR   and   the\n\ngovernment’s presentation of predicate facts were also properly\n\n\n     6\n        First hand observations of the sentencing judge are\nsufficient for the sentencing judge to make an individualized\ndetermination of vulnerability necessary to impose the enhancement\nset forth in section 3A1.1. See United States v. Pavao, 948 F.2d\n74, 78 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                       -14-\n\fconsidered because Donnelly failed to object to the statements in\n\na timely manner.7   Since the sentencing court may properly adopt\n\nthe statement as fact, we find that it is proper for us to consider\n\nthe statement when addressing the matter now before this Court.\n\n          Donnelly challenges the application of section 3A1.1\n\narguing that the record does not support a finding, either directly\n\nor by inference, that Donnelly knew or should have known that L.G.\n\nwas unusually vulnerable.   After reviewing the record, it does not\n\nappear that the trial judge explicitly addressed this element of\n\nthe vulnerable victim calculus.   The district judge did, however,\n\nmake a general finding that the vulnerable victim enhancement\n\napplied in this case and, by so doing, implicitly found that\n\nDonnelly knew or should have known of L.G.’s vulnerability.\n\n          Our determination that the plain error standard must be\n\napplied to the second prong of this analysis places a substantial\n\nburden on Donnelly: “Where the error defendant asserts on appeal\n\ndepends upon a factual finding the defendant neglected to ask the\n\ndistrict court to make, the error cannot be ‘clear’ or ‘obvious’\n\n\n     7\n      Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(f)(1), “[w]ithin\n14 days after receiving the [PSR], the parties must state in\nwriting any     objections,  including   objections   to   material\ninformation, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements\ncontained in or omitted from the report.” Donnelly, however, did\nnot make a timely objection to the PSR which contained the\nstatement. Donnelly’s objection to the statement was made the day\nof the final sentencing hearing, well after the fourteen-day time\nperiod had passed.     We also note that the same language was\nincluded in the government’s presentation of predicate facts at the\nchange of plea hearing, and there too, Donnelly posed no objection.\n\n                               -15-\n\funless the desired factual finding is the only one rationally\n\nsupported by the record below.”          United States v. Olivier-Diaz, 13\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993).       We find that Donnelly fails to meet his\n\nburden that the only rational conclusion supported by the record is\n\nthat Donnelly did not know of L.G.’s unusual vulnerability.                   The\n\nevidence in the record which would tend to support a conclusion\n\nthat    Donnelly    knew   or   should    have   known   of     L.G.’s   unusual\n\nvulnerability includes: (1) the district judge’s own observations\n\nof L.G., which included Tourette’s related outbursts; (2) that\n\nduring the beating of L.G., one of the officers was heard yelling,\n\n“We’ll beat the Tourette’s out of you”; and (3) that just prior to\n\nL.G.’s assault, L.G. said, “You people make fun of me around here\n\nall the time and I can’t say nothing about it.”               Clearly then, we\n\ncannot conclude that a finding that Donnelly did not know or should\n\nnot have known of L.G.’s unusual vulnerability is the only finding\n\nrationally supported by the record.              While the district court’s\n\nsilence is somewhat troublesome, we reject Donnelly’s argument that\n\nthe    district    judge   committed     plain   error   when    he   found   the\n\nvulnerable victim enhancement applicable to the L.G. incident.\n\n                                IV.   Conclusion\n\n            For the reasons set forth herein, the sentence of the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f",

Donnelly (\"Donnelly\") appeals from a 46-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea to conspiracy to violate the civil rights of jail detainees under his supervision, conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice, and four counts of deprivation of rights under color of law. On appeal, Donnelly argues that the sentencing court erred when it included a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1 (\"vulnerable victim\"). Because we find that the district court committed no reversible error in its determination that one of Donnelly's victims was a \"vulnerable victim,\" we affirm the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From December, 1989 through December, 1999, Donnelly was employed by the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department. Donnelly worked at the Nashua Street Jail in Boston, Massachusetts, a detention center which houses pre-trial detainees. Donnelly was an officer and supervisor at the jail and sometimes served as the lieutenant of the Sheriff's Emergency Response Team.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From at least June, 1998 through February, 2001, Donnelly and several other officers and supervisors had an unwritten agreement to use unjustified, excessive force to punish detainees who \"disrespected\" the officers, \"put hands\" on the officers, or otherwise misbehaved. The agreement led to the use of excessive force in order \"to teach the inmates a lesson.\" Donnelly and other officers and supervisors assaulted at least four detainees between April 15, 1999 and October 16, 1999. It is the factual circumstances surrounding the assault on one of the detainees, \"L.G.,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> which give rise to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During September and October of 1999, L.G. was detained at the Nashua Street Jail. L.G. suffers from Tourette's Syndrome, a neurological disorder which affects his ability to control his verbal and physical acts. L.G.'s Tourette's outbursts consisted of repetitious and involuntary physical movements, or tics, and uncontrollable verbal outbursts, which often included the use of profanity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 1999, L.G., in violation of jail rules, got up from his table to wash a piece of fruit. Officer William Benson (\"Benson\") admonished L.G. for getting up without permission, but permitted him to wash his fruit before sitting back down. What happened after L.G. returned to his seat is disputed. One version of the story is that L.G. sat down and said of Benson, \"What an attitude.\" Another officer claims that L.G. said, \"You fat f*ck.\" Regardless of what was said, L.G. was dismissed from dinner and returned to his locked cell in the medical unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once back in his cell, L.G. began to feel his Tourette's symptoms act up. To lessen the effects of the Tourette's outburst, L.G. engaged in physical activity, which consisted of shadowboxing and bench pressing his bed. Benson, hearing the commotion, approached L.G.'s cell and said, \"Shut the f*ck up,\" to which L.G. responded, \"You shut the f*ck up. You people make fun of me around here all the time and I can't say nothing about it. F*ck you. No.\" The exchange between L.G. and Benson prompted Donnelly, who was in the medical unit watching a baseball game on television, to approach L.G.'s cell. Donnelly then said to L.G., \"You will not talk to my officers that way.\" Donnelly and Benson then entered L.G.'s cell where they hit him repeatedly in the face, head, and body. During the assault, one or both of the officers<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> yelled, \"We'll beat the Tourette's out of you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 15, 2001, Donnelly was charged with conspiracy to violate the civil rights of detainees being held at the Nashua Street Jail. In particular, Donnelly was charged with seven counts consisting of: (1) conspiring to obstruct justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; (2) obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1512(b)(3); (3) conspiring to violate rights, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241; and (4) deprivation of rights under color of law, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242. The indictment contained four individual counts of deprivation of rights under color of law, which included the L.G. assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, 2003, Donnelly entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney's Office, wherein Donnelly agreed to plead guilty to all counts with which he was charged. The plea agreement provided that the government would take the position that Donnelly's total offense level was 21. The plea agreement further provided that the government would recommend that Donnelly be sentenced at the low end of the guideline sentencing range. In the event of an appeal, however, the agreement preserved the government's \"right to argue the correctness of Defendant's sentence and the manner in which the District Court determines it.\" At the sentencing hearing on June 6, 2003, the court considered the Presentence Report (\"PSR\"), which included a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1 for each of the four counts charging Donnelly with deprivation of rights under color of law. The probation officer included the enhancement citing the fact that Donnelly's victims were detained in a jail cell when they were assaulted. This fact, the probation officer believed, supported a finding that those victims were vulnerable victims under section 3A1.1. Accordingly, the probation officer concluded that Donnelly's total offense level was 23. Both the government and Donnelly objected to the applicability of section 3A1.1 to each of the four counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that section 3A1.1 was not applicable on the grounds set forth in the PSR by the probation officer. Rather, the sentencing judge, relying on the PSR and his own observations of L.G. during the trial of several of Donnelly's co-conspirators,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> advised the parties that he would apply the vulnerable victim enhancement to the assault on L.G. The district judge stated that he believed the enhancement should be applied in L.G.'s case because \"in very large part the assault on [L.G.] occurred because he had Tourette's Syndrome.\" At Donnelly's request, the district court suspended the hearing to allow Donnelly time to prepare to address the district court's position that the vulnerable victim enhancement be applied with respect to Donnelly's assault on L.G.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 2003, the sentencing hearing was re-convened. On that same day, just prior to the hearing, Donnelly filed an objection to the PSR, specifically objecting to the district court taking the statement, \"We'll beat the Tourette's out of you,\" into account in its consideration of the applicability of section 3A1.1. Finding the objection untimely, the sentencing judge declined to consider it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing the arguments of counsel, the court determined that the two-level enhancement provided for by section 3A1.1 should be included in the sentencing calculation as it related to the L.G. incident. The court found that the assault occurred because of L.G.'s Tourette's Syndrome. Accordingly, the court determined Donnelly's total offense level to be 23, with a guideline range of 46-57 months. Donnelly was sentenced to 46 months imprisonment. Donnelly appeals his sentence. In accordance with the plea agreement, the government pursues its option to argue that the sentencing court imposed the correct sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before reaching the merits of this appeal, we must determine the appropriate standard of review. A sentencing court must make two distinct and separate findings to apply section 3A1.1: (1) that the victim is a \"vulnerable victim\"; and (2) that the defendant knew or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability. Both parties agree that the district court's findings of fact as they relate to whether or not L.G. is a vulnerable victim, by virtue of his Tourette's Syndrome, are reviewed for clear error and that the legal determinations of the district court are subject to plenary review. <i>See United States v. Gill,</i> 99 F.3d 484, 485 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government and Donnelly disagree, however, as to the appropriate standard of review as it relates to the second element of the vulnerable victim enhancement: whether Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s unusual vulnerability. The government argues that, although Donnelly objected to the enhancement on the grounds that L.G. was not a \"vulnerable victim,\" he did not argue to the sentencing court that Donnelly did not know of L.G.'s vulnerability, and therefore the issue of Donnelly's knowledge of L.G.'s vulnerability was not properly preserved below. The government, therefore, urges us to review this claim for plain error. Donnelly argues that the plain error standard does not apply because he is not raising a new claim on appeal, but rather that he properly preserved the issue below by arguing against the application of section 3A1.1 generally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said that an appellant must specifically raise before the district court any issues he or she wishes to preserve for our consideration. <i>See United States v. Dietz,</i> 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that \"arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be raised for the first time in an appellate venue\"). In the court below Donnelly objected to the imposition of the enhancement based on his assertion that L.G. was not a \"vulnerable victim.\" Donnelly, however, did not argue specifically that the enhancement could not be applied to Donnelly because there was no evidence to support a finding that Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s vulnerability. Donnelly's failure to address the second element of the vulnerable victim enhancement requires that we review the court's ruling on this element for plain error. Thus, as it relates to the knowledge element of section 3A1.1, Donnelly bears the burden of showing that the district court committed \"(1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\" <i>United States v. Connolly,</i> 341 F.3d 16, 31 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>United States v. Downs-Moses,</i> 329 F.3d 253, 263 (1st Cir.2003)(internal quotations omitted)). If Donnelly can establish plain error, he then \"must demonstrate that the error `seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Matos,</i> 328 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>III. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established the standard of our review, we next turn to Donnelly's claims on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3A1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that a two-level upward enhancement should be applied \"[i]f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1(b)(1) (Nov.2002). Commentary to section 3A1.1(b) defines the term \"vulnerable victim\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"vulnerable victim\" means a person (A) who is a victim of the offense of conviction ...; and (B) who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.... [The section] applies to offenses involving an unusually vulnerable victim in which the defendant knows or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1, cmt. n. 2. We have interpreted the term \"susceptible to the criminal conduct\" as being \"primarily concerned with the impaired capacity of the victim to detect or prevent the crime, rather than the quantity of harm suffered by the victim.\" <i>United States v. Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d 52, 55-56 (1st Cir.1997) (quoting <i>Gill,</i> 99 F.3d at 486).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Focusing on the language of section 3A1.1 and the section's commentary, a two-prong test must be satisfied before the enhancement is imposed: First, the sentencing court must find that the victim of the crime was vulnerable, that is, that the victim had an \"impaired capacity ... to detect or prevent the crime.\" <i>Id.</i> at 55-56 (quoting <i>Gill,</i> 99 F.3d at 486); and second, the sentencing court must find that the defendant knew or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Donnelly challenges the district court's application of the vulnerable victim enhancement on several grounds: (1) L.G. was not a vulnerable victim within the meaning of section 3A1.1 because he was not particularly susceptible to the assault; (2) the record does not support a finding, either directly or by inference, that Donnelly knew or should have known that L.G. was particularly susceptible; and (3) there is no nexus between L.G.'s vulnerability and the assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by disposing of Donnelly's third assignment of error: that the district court erred in applying section 3A1.1 because it did not find a nexus between L.G.'s vulnerability and Donnelly's crime. Donnelly urges us to adopt the analysis set forth in <i>United States v. Monostra,</i> 125 F.3d 183 (3d Cir.1997), a Third Circuit case which the court remanded to the district court for further consideration of whether there was a nexus between the victim's vulnerability and the crime's success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nexus requirement is based on the general limitation that a sentencing court base its finding of unusual vulnerability on individualized findings of particular susceptibility, rather than on the victim's membership in a large class. <i>See United States v. Lee,</i> 973 F.2d 832, 834 (10th Cir.1992) (\"The language of the guideline requires that a victim be `<i>unusually vulnerable</i> ...' and the cases accordingly require that the sentencing court make particularized findings of vulnerability. Specifically, there should be a nexus between the victim's vulnerability and the crime's ultimate success.\" (emphasis in original)). \"We have discouraged sentencing courts from making an `unusually vulnerable victim' finding based solely on the victim's membership in a particular class,\" but have recognized that \"in some cases inferences to be drawn regarding particular class characteristics may be so strong that `there can be little doubt about unusual vulnerability of class members within the meaning of section 3A1.1.'\" <i>Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d at 56 (quoting <i>Gill,</i> 99 F.3d at 487). Since the \"nexus\" test is already a part of our analysis of whether the victim is a \"vulnerable victim\" under section 3A1.1, we find that it would be superfluous to incorporate a third, independent \"nexus\" prong into our discussion of the applicability of the vulnerable victim enhancement. We therefore focus on the two-prong formulation: (1) that the victim was unusually vulnerable, and (2) that the defendant knew or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Unusual Vulnerability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnelly challenges the district court's application of section 3A1.1, arguing that L.G. is not a \"vulnerable victim.\" First Donnelly asserts that the district court erred in applying section 3A1.1 because the facts before the district court did not support an individualized finding of vulnerability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We disagree. The record below amply supports the district court's determination that L.G. was unusually vulnerable to the assault, that is, that he had an \"impaired capacity ... to detect or prevent the crime.\" <i>Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d at 55-56 (quoting <i>Gill,</i> 99 F.3d at 486).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.G. was reprimanded by Benson for breaking jail rules, exchanged words with another officer over the incident, and as a result, was sent back to his locked cell in the medical unit. Back in his cell, L.G. found himself exhibiting symptoms of a Tourette's related outburst. To lessen the effects of his outburst, L.G. engaged in physical activity which induced Benson, and later Donnelly, to approach L.G.'s cell. It was the exchange between Benson and L.G., which resulted from L.G.'s Tourette's outburst, which led to the assault. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude, as did the district court, that L.G.'s condition made him particularly susceptible to the attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, these facts illustrate the individual characteristics possessed by L.G. which distinguish him from the other detainees: a detainee who does not suffer from Tourette's Syndrome can make a conscious decision not to act in ways which may provoke jail officers to \"teach him a lesson.\" L.G.'s Tourette's Syndrome impaired his capacity to prevent the behavior which would lead to the assault by Donnelly. We therefore find no clear error in the district court's conclusion that L.G. was a \"vulnerable victim\" under section 3A1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>B. Defendant's Knowledge of Unusual Vulnerability</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the second element of the vulnerable victim enhancement, that Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s particular susceptibility to the assault. Before doing so, however, there is an evidentiary matter we must consider: which facts are properly before this Court in our consideration of this issue. Donnelly argues that we should not consider as fact the statement contained in the PSR and the government's presentation of predicate facts at the plea hearing that the officers shouted, \"We'll beat the Tourette's out of you,\" during L.G.'s assault. Donnelly asserts that the statement is too vague because there is no indication as to which of the officers made the statement. Donnelly also argues that because L.G. did not mention the statement during his trial testimony, the court erred in finding the statement a \"fact\" proven by a preponderance of the evidence. We disagree. The sentencing judge properly took into account his observations of L.G. when he testified at the trial of Donnelly's co-conspirators.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The statements made in the PSR and the government's presentation of predicate facts were also properly considered because Donnelly failed to object to the statements in a timely manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Since the sentencing court may properly adopt the statement as fact, we find that it is proper for us to consider the statement when addressing the matter now before this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnelly challenges the application of section 3A1.1 arguing that the record does not support a finding, either directly or by inference, that Donnelly knew or should have known that L.G. was unusually vulnerable. After reviewing the record, it does not appear that the trial judge explicitly addressed this element of the vulnerable victim calculus. The district judge did, however, make a general finding that the vulnerable victim enhancement applied in this case and, by so doing, implicitly found that Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s vulnerability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the plain error standard must be applied to the second prong of this analysis places a substantial burden on Donnelly: \"Where the error defendant asserts on appeal depends upon a factual finding the defendant neglected to ask the district court to make, the error cannot be `clear' or `obvious' unless the desired factual finding is the only one rationally supported by the record below.\" <i>United States v. Olivier-Diaz,</i> 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993). We find that Donnelly fails to meet his burden that the only rational conclusion supported by the record is that Donnelly did not know of L.G.'s unusual vulnerability. The evidence in the record which would tend to support a conclusion that Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s unusual vulnerability includes: (1) the district judge's own observations of L.G., which included Tourette's related outbursts; (2) that during the beating of L.G., one of the officers was heard yelling, \"We'll beat the Tourette's out of you\"; and (3) that just prior to L.G.'s assault, L.G. said, \"You people make fun of me around here all the time and I can't say nothing about it.\" Clearly then, we cannot conclude that a finding that Donnelly did not know or should not have known of L.G.'s unusual vulnerability is the only finding rationally supported by the record. While the district court's silence is somewhat troublesome, we reject Donnelly's argument that the district judge committed plain error when he found the vulnerable victim enhancement applicable to the L.G. incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Donnelly (\"Donnelly\") appeals from a 46-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea to conspiracy to violate the civil rights of jail detainees under his supervision, conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice, and four counts of deprivation of rights under color of law. On appeal, Donnelly argues that the sentencing court erred when it included a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1 (\"vulnerable victim\"). Because we find that the district court committed no reversible error in its determination that one of Donnelly's victims was a \"vulnerable victim,\" we affirm the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From December, 1989 through December, 1999, Donnelly was employed by the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department. Donnelly worked at the Nashua Street Jail in Boston, Massachusetts, a detention center which houses pre-trial detainees. Donnelly was an officer and supervisor at the jail and sometimes served as the lieutenant of the Sheriff's Emergency Response Team.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From at least June, 1998 through February, 2001, Donnelly and several other officers and supervisors had an unwritten agreement to use unjustified, excessive force to punish detainees who \"disrespected\" the officers, \"put hands\" on the officers, or otherwise misbehaved. The agreement led to the use of excessive force in order \"to teach the inmates a lesson.\" Donnelly and other officers and supervisors assaulted at least four detainees between April 15, 1999 and October 16, 1999. It is the factual circumstances surrounding the assault on one of the detainees, \"L.G.,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> which give rise to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During September and October of 1999, L.G. was detained at the Nashua Street Jail. L.G. suffers from Tourette's Syndrome, a neurological disorder which affects his ability to control his verbal and physical acts. L.G.'s Tourette's outbursts consisted of repetitious and involuntary physical movements, or tics, and uncontrollable verbal outbursts, which often included the use of profanity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 1999, L.G., in violation of jail rules, got up from his table to wash a piece of fruit. Officer William Benson (\"Benson\") admonished L.G. for getting up without permission, but permitted him to wash his fruit before sitting back down. What happened after L.G. returned to his seat is disputed. One version of the story is that L.G. sat down and said of Benson, \"What an attitude.\" Another officer claims that L.G. said, \"You fat f*ck.\" Regardless of what was said, L.G. was dismissed from dinner and returned to his locked cell in the medical unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once back in his cell, L.G. began to feel his Tourette's symptoms act up. To lessen the effects of the Tourette's outburst, L.G. engaged in physical activity, which consisted of shadowboxing and bench pressing his bed. Benson, hearing the commotion, approached L.G.'s cell and said, \"Shut the f*ck up,\" to which L.G. responded, \"You shut the f*ck up. You people make fun of me around here all the time and I can't say nothing about it. F*ck you. No.\" The exchange between L.G. and Benson prompted Donnelly, who was in the medical unit watching a baseball game on television, to approach L.G.'s cell. Donnelly then said to L.G., \"You will not talk to my officers that way.\" Donnelly and Benson then entered L.G.'s cell where they hit him repeatedly in the face, head, and body. During the assault, one or both of the officers<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> yelled, \"We'll beat the Tourette's out of you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 15, 2001, Donnelly was charged with conspiracy to violate the civil rights of detainees being held at the Nashua Street Jail. In particular, Donnelly was charged with seven counts consisting of: (1) conspiring to obstruct justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; (2) obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1512(b)(3); (3) conspiring to violate rights, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241; and (4) deprivation of rights under color of law, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242. The indictment contained four individual counts of deprivation of rights under color of law, which included the L.G. assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, 2003, Donnelly entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney's Office, wherein Donnelly agreed to plead guilty to all counts with which he was charged. The plea agreement provided that the government would take the position that Donnelly's total offense level was 21. The plea agreement further provided that the government would recommend that Donnelly be sentenced at the low end of the guideline sentencing range. In the event of an appeal, however, the agreement preserved the government's \"right to argue the correctness of Defendant's sentence and the manner in which the District Court determines it.\" At the sentencing hearing on June 6, 2003, the court considered the Presentence Report (\"PSR\"), which included a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1 for each of the four counts charging Donnelly with deprivation of rights under color of law. The probation officer included the enhancement citing the fact that Donnelly's victims were detained in a jail cell when they were assaulted. This fact, the probation officer believed, supported a finding that those victims were vulnerable victims under section 3A1.1. Accordingly, the probation officer concluded that Donnelly's total offense level was 23. Both the government and Donnelly objected to the applicability of section 3A1.1 to each of the four counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that section 3A1.1 was not applicable on the grounds set forth in the PSR by the probation officer. Rather, the sentencing judge, relying on the PSR and his own observations of L.G. during the trial of several of Donnelly's co-conspirators,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> advised the parties that he would apply the vulnerable victim enhancement to the assault on L.G. The district judge stated that he believed the enhancement should be applied in L.G.'s case because \"in very large part the assault on [L.G.] occurred because he had Tourette's Syndrome.\" At Donnelly's request, the district court suspended the hearing to allow Donnelly time to prepare to address the district court's position that the vulnerable victim enhancement be applied with respect to Donnelly's assault on L.G.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 7, 2003, the sentencing hearing was re-convened. On that same day, just prior to the hearing, Donnelly filed an objection to the PSR, specifically objecting to the district court taking the statement, \"We'll beat the Tourette's out of you,\" into account in its consideration of the applicability of section 3A1.1. Finding the objection untimely, the sentencing judge declined to consider it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing the arguments of counsel, the court determined that the two-level enhancement provided for by section 3A1.1 should be included in the sentencing calculation as it related to the L.G. incident. The court found that the assault occurred because of L.G.'s Tourette's Syndrome. Accordingly, the court determined Donnelly's total offense level to be 23, with a guideline range of 46-57 months. Donnelly was sentenced to 46 months imprisonment. Donnelly appeals his sentence. In accordance with the plea agreement, the government pursues its option to argue that the sentencing court imposed the correct sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before reaching the merits of this appeal, we must determine the appropriate standard of review. A sentencing court must make two distinct and separate findings to apply section 3A1.1: (1) that the victim is a \"vulnerable victim\"; and (2) that the defendant knew or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability. Both parties agree that the district court's findings of fact as they relate to whether or not L.G. is a vulnerable victim, by virtue of his Tourette's Syndrome, are reviewed for clear error and that the legal determinations of the district court are subject to plenary review. <i>See United States v. Gill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197061\"><a href=\"/opinion/197061/united-states-v-gill/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 485 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government and Donnelly disagree, however, as to the appropriate standard of review as it relates to the second element of the vulnerable victim enhancement: whether Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s unusual vulnerability. The government argues that, although Donnelly objected to the enhancement on the grounds that L.G. was not a \"vulnerable victim,\" he did not argue to the sentencing court that Donnelly did not know of L.G.'s vulnerability, and therefore the issue of Donnelly's knowledge of L.G.'s vulnerability was not properly preserved below. The government, therefore, urges us to review this claim for plain error. Donnelly argues that the plain error standard does not apply because he is not raising a new claim on appeal, but rather that he properly preserved the issue below by arguing against the application of section 3A1.1 generally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said that an appellant must specifically raise before the district court any issues he or she wishes to preserve for our consideration. <i>See United States v. Dietz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that \"arguments not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be raised for the first time in an appellate venue\"). In the court below Donnelly objected to the imposition of the enhancement based on his assertion that L.G. was not a \"vulnerable victim.\" Donnelly, however, did not argue specifically that the enhancement could not be applied to Donnelly because there was no evidence to support a finding that Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s vulnerability. Donnelly's failure to address the second element of the vulnerable victim enhancement requires that we review the court's ruling on this element for plain error. Thus, as it relates to the knowledge element of section 3A1.1, Donnelly bears the burden of showing that the district court committed \"(1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\" <i>United States v.

Donnelly urges us to adopt the analysis set forth in <i>United States v. Monostra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746439\"><a href=\"/opinion/746439/united-states-v-alfred-monostra-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1997), a Third Circuit case which the court remanded to the district court for further consideration of whether there was a nexus between the victim's vulnerability and the crime's success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nexus requirement is based on the general limitation that a sentencing court base its finding of unusual vulnerability on individualized findings of particular susceptibility, rather than on the victim's membership in a large class. <i>See United States v. Lee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589785\"><a href=\"/opinion/589785/united-states-v-jeana-p-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span>, 834 (10th Cir.1992) (\"The language of the guideline requires that a victim be `<i>unusually vulnerable</i> ...' and the cases accordingly require that the sentencing court make particularized findings of vulnerability. Specifically, there should be a nexus between the victim's vulnerability and the crime's ultimate success.\" (emphasis in original)). \"We have discouraged sentencing courts from making an `unusually vulnerable victim' finding based solely on the victim's membership in a particular class,\" but have recognized that \"in some cases inferences to be drawn regarding particular class characteristics may be so strong that `there can be little doubt about unusual vulnerability of class members within the meaning of section 3A1.1.'\" <i>Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d at 56 (quoting <i>Gill,</i> 99 F.3d at 487). Since the \"nexus\" test is already a part of our analysis of whether the victim is a \"vulnerable victim\" under section 3A1.1, we find that it would be superfluous to incorporate a third, independent \"nexus\" prong into our discussion of the applicability of the vulnerable victim enhancement. We therefore focus on the two-prong formulation: (1) that the victim was unusually vulnerable, and (2) that the defendant knew or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Unusual Vulnerability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnelly challenges the district court's application of section 3A1.1, arguing that L.G. is not a \"vulnerable victim.\" First Donnelly asserts that the district court erred in applying section 3A1.1 because the facts before the district court did not support an individualized finding of vulnerability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> We disagree. The record below amply supports the district court's determination that L.G. was unusually vulnerable to the assault, that is, that he had an \"impaired capacity ... to detect or prevent the crime.\" <i>Fosher,</i> 124 F.3d at 55-56 (quoting <i>Gill,</i> 99 F.3d at 486).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.G. was reprimanded by Benson for breaking jail rules, exchanged words with another officer over the incident, and as a result, was sent back to his locked cell in the medical unit. Back in his cell, L.G. found himself exhibiting symptoms of a Tourette's related outburst. To lessen the effects of his outburst, L.G. engaged in physical activity which induced Benson, and later Donnelly, to approach L.G.'s cell. It was the exchange between Benson and L.G., which resulted from L.G.'s Tourette's outburst, which led to the assault. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude, as did the district court, that L.G.'s condition made him particularly susceptible to the attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, these facts illustrate the individual characteristics possessed by L.G. which distinguish him from the other detainees: a detainee who does not suffer from Tourette's Syndrome can make a conscious decision not to act in ways which may provoke jail officers to \"teach him a lesson.\" L.G.'s Tourette's Syndrome impaired his capacity to prevent the behavior which would lead to the assault by Donnelly. We therefore find no clear error in the district court's conclusion that L.G. was a \"vulnerable victim\" under section 3A1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>B. Defendant's Knowledge of Unusual Vulnerability</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the second element of the vulnerable victim enhancement, that Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s particular susceptibility to the assault. Before doing so, however, there is an evidentiary matter we must consider: which facts are properly before this Court in our consideration of this issue. Donnelly argues that we should not consider as fact the statement contained in the PSR and the government's presentation of predicate facts at the plea hearing that the officers shouted, \"We'll beat the Tourette's out of you,\" during L.G.'s assault. Donnelly asserts that the statement is too vague because there is no indication as to which of the officers made the statement. Donnelly also argues that because L.G. did not mention the statement during his trial testimony, the court erred in finding the statement a \"fact\" proven by a preponderance of the evidence. We disagree. The sentencing judge properly took into account his observations of L.G. when he testified at the trial of Donnelly's co-conspirators.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The statements made in the PSR and the government's presentation of predicate facts were also properly considered because Donnelly failed to object to the statements in a timely manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Since the sentencing court may properly adopt the statement as fact, we find that it is proper for us to consider the statement when addressing the matter now before this Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donnelly challenges the application of section 3A1.1 arguing that the record does not support a finding, either directly or by inference, that Donnelly knew or should have known that L.G. was unusually vulnerable. After reviewing the record, it does not appear that the trial judge explicitly addressed this element of the vulnerable victim calculus. The district judge did, however, make a general finding that the vulnerable victim enhancement applied in this case and, by so doing, implicitly found that Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s vulnerability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our determination that the plain error standard must be applied to the second prong of this analysis places a substantial burden on Donnelly: \"Where the error defendant asserts on appeal depends upon a factual finding the defendant neglected to ask the district court to make, the error cannot be `clear' or `obvious' unless the desired factual finding is the only one rationally supported by the record below.\" <i>United States v. Olivier-Diaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195103\"><a href=\"/opinion/195103/united-states-v-olivier/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1993). We find that Donnelly fails to meet his burden that the only rational conclusion supported by the record is that Donnelly did not know of L.G.'s unusual vulnerability. The evidence in the record which would tend to support a conclusion that Donnelly knew or should have known of L.G.'s unusual vulnerability includes: (1) the district judge's own observations of L.G., which included Tourette's related outbursts; (2) that during the beating of L.G., one of the officers was heard yelling, \"We'll beat the Tourette's out of you\"; and (3) that just prior to L.G.'s assault, L.G. said, \"You people make fun of me around here all the time and I can't say nothing about it.\" Clearly then, we cannot conclude that a finding that Donnelly did not know or should not have known of L.G.'s unusual vulnerability is the only finding rationally supported by the record. While the district court's silence is somewhat troublesome, we reject Donnelly's argument that the district judge committed plain error when he found the vulnerable victim enhancement applicable to the L.G. incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Donnelly's objection to the statement was made the day of the final sentencing hearing, well after the fourteen-day time period had passed.
