José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n           Lipez, Baldock* and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Linda Backiel for appellant Sanchez.\n     Mauricio Hernández-Arroyo for appellant Rivera.\n     Timothy R. Henwood, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez, United States Attorney, Nelson\nPérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and Germán A.\nRieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           February 9, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f           HOWARD, Circuit Judge.            Appellants José Rivera-Rivera\n\n(\"Rivera\") and Ramón Sánchez-Rosado (\"Sánchez\") were convicted on\n\nthree counts stemming from the armed robbery of a lottery ticket\n\nbusiness in Caguas, Puerto Rico.               Rivera was sentenced to 415\n\nmonths' imprisonment – more than 34 years – and Sánchez was\n\nsentenced to 397 months – just over 33 years.                      Both sentences\n\nincluded a mandatory minimum term of 25 years for the use of a\n\nfirearm in relation to a violent federal felony after a previous\n\nconviction for the same offense.            See 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(C)(i).\n\nBy   statute,   the     25-year      term    was    required   to       be   imposed\n\nconsecutively to any other sentence. The appellants challenge both\n\ntheir convictions and their sentences.                   They claim two trial\n\nerrors:   (1) the key witness's in-court identification was tainted\n\nby   unnecessarily      suggestive    pretrial      encounters,     and      (2)   the\n\ngovernment failed to meet its burden of proving that the robbery\n\naffected interstate commerce.          They also assert multiple flaws in\n\ntheir sentencing, including that the court improperly imposed the\n\n25-year mandatory minimum based on facts not found by the jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.         We affirm.\n                           I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n           The facts of the robbery, as the jury could have found\n\nthem, are as follows.         Shortly after 8 a.m. on the morning of\n\nOctober   11,   2004,    Carmelo     Fonseca,      the   manager   of    the   Muñiz\n\nGallery, a small shopping mall in Caguas, opened both the front and\n\nrear entrances to the building, turned on the machines in the\n\nmall's game center, and started walking toward the office of the\n\n                                       -2-\n\flottery ticket business run by the Gallery's owner, Félix Muñiz.\n\nAt   8:20   a.m.,    before   the   mall    was    open    for    customers,   two\n\nindividuals entered the mall through the back entrance.                        They\n\napproached Fonseca and asked him where the lottery machines were\n\nlocated, and then each pulled out a gun.            One of them \"loaded [his]\n\npistol and charged it,\" and, after warning Fonseca \"not to act like\n\nsome tough guy, that they would shoot [him],\" they directed Fonseca\n\nto take them to the lottery business office on the second floor.\n\nAlthough the men told Fonseca not to look at them, he testified\nthat he did not comply and that \"every time I had a chance, I\n\nlooked at them.\"      Fonseca reported that one of the individuals was\n\nwearing a white shirt and the other wore a black shirt.                   On direct\n\nexamination,     Fonseca      indicated     that    both    men    were    wearing\n\nsunglasses and hats.       On cross-examination, he testified that one\n\nof them was wearing dark glasses and the other was wearing a hat.\n\nOne of the men was carrying a black plastic bag of the type used by\n\nretail stores.\n\n            Meanwhile, across the hallway from where the three men\nwere having their initial conversation, Dr. Johanna Loyola, an\n\noptometrist who had just arrived at her office, noticed the young\n\nmen with Fonseca and saw that one had a pistol.                   She immediately\n\ncalled 911 to report a robbery, describing the perpetrators as\n\nyoung men with dark glasses and caps, and also shouted to the\n\nmall's maintenance employee, María, to get help because Fonseca was\n\nbeing robbed.       In her phone call to the police, Loyola stated that\n\none of the men did not seem tall, but looked strong.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f           María     found    a   municipal    police     officer,     Juan   Soto,\n\noutside the mall.      Soto went in through the back entrance, which he\n\nclosed, proceeded to the front of the building, and padlocked the\n\nfront door.        He then called for backup.           By this time, the two\n\nrobbers had taken Fonseca upstairs, where he was forced to open the\n\noffice safe. Because he was nervous, Fonseca made several attempts\n\nbefore he successfully opened the combination lock.                  The men then\n\nordered him to get face down on the floor, and they tied his arms\n\nand legs with black ties taken from the black bag.                     They took a\ncash box containing $8,770 from the safe, and a gun and photographs\n\nfrom Muñiz's desk.\n\n           Outside     the    building,    Puerto   Rico    Police      Department\n\nofficers and municipal officers, including Soto and Caguas officer\n\nEliseo Martínez, had gathered in response to Soto's request for\n\nbackup and Loyola's call.         Soto removed the padlock from the front\n\ndoor and prepared to enter the building. He and Martínez testified\n\nthat they could see two individuals in the vicinity of Muñiz's\n\noffice.   One wore blue jeans and a white t-shirt, had on dark\nglasses and was carrying a black bag with shiny lettering; the\n\nother   wore   a    black    shirt   and   blue   jeans    and   was    holding   a\n\nfisherman's cap in his right hand.            Ignoring Soto's order to halt,\n\nthe men walked to the end of the hallway, found the back door\n\nclosed, and then walked back down the hallway trying the doors of\n\nthe businesses they passed.          None were open, and the pair went into\n\nthe men's restroom at the end of the hall.                As they entered the\n\nbathroom, they lifted their shirts, and Soto saw pistol butts in\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\ftheir waistbands.      The two men -- defendants Sánchez and Rivera            --\n\ncame out several minutes later, at which point Martínez arrested\n\nthem.\n\n           In a trash can in the bathroom, Soto found the black bag\n\nwith the shiny letters, which contained some dollar bills; a metal\n\nbox; the fisherman's cap he had seen one of the men holding; some\n\nblack straps; and a .38-caliber revolver belonging to Muñiz.                 Soto\n\nalso found two loaded pistols inside a towel dispenser.\n\n           Fonseca was released by a municipal police officer and\nshortly   thereafter      saw   Martínez     escorting    the   defendants,     in\n\nhandcuffs,   out    of    the   building.      Fonseca     testified    that    he\n\nimmediately recognized them as the robbers.              He saw the defendants\n\nagain about an hour later at the Caguas municipal police station,\n\nwhere he had gone to file charges.               Fonseca testified that he\n\nhappened to notice them as they walked back and forth inside a\n\nholding cell.      On cross-examination, Fonseca stated that he also\n\nsaw them in two locations at the courthouse where the defendants'\n\npreliminary hearing was held: in a cell at the district attorney's\noffice and then \"standing in front of the judge.\"               Soto testified\n\nthat Fonseca also saw the defendants briefly as they were being\n\nmoved from the police station to the patrol car to be transported\n\nto the courthouse.\n\n           Charges       originally   were    brought    against   Sánchez     and\n\nRivera under local law, but they were later dismissed and the men\n\nwere charged in a three-count federal indictment.                      Count One\n\nalleged   that   the     defendants   aided    and   abetted    each   other    in\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fcommitting    an   armed   robbery   affecting    interstate   commerce     in\n\nviolation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) and 2.              Count Two\n\ncharged the use of a firearm in connection with the robbery, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 2.               Count Three\n\ncharged defendants with being felons-in-possession of a firearm, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)and 924(a)(2), and alleged that\n\nthey had been convicted in 1998 for an armed bank robbery.\n\n           At trial, Fonseca was asked if the men who robbed him\n\nwere in the courtroom, and he identified the defendants.                   When\nasked by the prosecutor and the court to explain the basis for his\n\nconclusion that these were the men, he said that he \"recognized\n\nthem because they were the ones that robbed me.\"            For purposes of\n\nCount Three, the felon-in-possession charge, the government and the\n\ndefendants stipulated that Rivera and Sánchez had a triggering\n\nprior felony, and no evidence of the prior conviction was presented\n\nto the jury.\n\n           At the end of the government's case, the defendants\n\nsought suppression of Fonseca's identification testimony on the\nground that he had been exposed to unnecessarily suggestive pre-\n\ntrial confrontations with the defendants.              The court refused to\n\nsuppress     the   statement   identifying       the    defendants    as   the\n\nperpetrators, but agreed to give the jury a specific instruction on\n\nidentification procedures.           Defense counsel also moved for a\n\njudgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29, claiming that the\n\nevidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt. The court\n\ndenied the motion, observing that \"there is overwhelming evidence\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fof the fact that this robbery took place as testified to by the\n\nwitnesses.\"      The jury subsequently found both defendants guilty on\n\nall three counts.\n\n            On    appeal,    the    defendants    renew    their     challenge   to\n\nFonseca's in-court identification and also seek reversal of their\n\nconviction on Count One, the Hobbs Act charge, on the ground that\n\nthe government failed to present sufficient evidence that the\n\nrobbery affected interstate commerce.1              A reversal on Count One\n\nwould require reversal on the Count Two firearms charge as well\nbecause proof of the Hobbs Act violation is an element of that\n\noffense.    See United States v. Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d 3, 8 n.1\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n                                 II. IDENTIFICATION\n\n            The appellants claim that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to suppress Fonseca's in-court identification, which they\n\nassert    was    tainted    by    his    impermissibly    suggestive    pre-trial\n\nencounters with them shortly after the robbery occurred.                         As\n\ndescribed above, Fonseca came into contact with the defendants\nthree or four times before the preliminary hearing that took place\n\non the day of the robbery.              It is undisputed that he saw them at\n\nthe mall shortly after they were arrested and handcuffed, although\n\nthe   precise     nature     of    that    encounter     was   the    subject    of\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Hobbs Act provides that \"[w]hoever in any way or degree\nobstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any\narticle or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion . . .\nshall be fined . . . or imprisoned . . . .\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).\n\n                                          -7-\n\finconsistent testimony.2\n\n           There also is no dispute that the subsequent encounters\n\nwere unplanned:     first, at the Caguas police station, when the\n\ndefendants were in a holding cell; next, according to Officer Soto,\n\nas the defendants were being transported in a police car to the\n\ncourthouse; and, finally, in a holding cell near the district\n\nattorney's office at the courthouse.\n\n           Although   introduction       of    \"impermissibly     suggestive\"\n\nidentification evidence may violate the Due Process Clause, see\nNeil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 196-98 (1972); United States v.\n\nHolliday, 457 F.3d 121, 125 (1st Cir. 2006), we have stated\n\nrepeatedly that identification evidence should be withheld from the\n\njury \"only in extraordinary cases.\"            Holliday, 457 F.3d at 125;\n\nUnited States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nUnited States v. Watson, 76 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1996).                 A court\n\nshould suppress identifications made before trial and in the\n\ncourtroom on due process grounds only if it is \"persuaded that\n\nthere    was   a   very     substantial       likelihood     of   irreparable\nmisidentification.\"       United States v. de Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672,\n\n677 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations and quotation marks omitted); see\n\nalso, e.g., Holliday, 457 F.3d at 125; Henderson, 320 F.3d at 100.\n\n           A   two-step     analysis    is    used   to    determine   whether\n\nsuppression is appropriate.      Holliday, 457 F.3d at 125; Henderson,\n\n     2\n      Fonseca testified that Officer Martínez showed him the\ndefendants and asked if \"these were the ones,\" while Martínez\ntestified that he did not speak to Fonseca and that Fonseca, when\nhe saw the defendants, volunteered that they \"'are the individuals\nthat robbed me.'\"\n\n                                       -8-\n\f320 F.3d at 100.          We consider first whether an impermissibly\n\nsuggestive identification procedure was used and, if so, whether\n\nthe identification was nonetheless reliable under the totality of\n\nthe circumstances.        Id.    Our review of the court's ruling on the\n\nmotion to suppress is plenary.             Henderson, 320 F.3d at 99.         We\n\nreview   findings    of   fact    for    clear   error.     United   States   v.\n\nBrennick, 405 F.3d 96, 99-100 (1st Cir. 2005).             In the end, we will\n\naffirm a district court's denial of a suppression motion if any\n\nreasonable view of the evidence supports the evidence.                   United\nStates v. St. Pierre, 488 F.3d 76, 79 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The identification issue first arose at the conclusion of\n\nFonseca's   testimony,      during      which    defense   counsel   apparently\n\nlearned for the first time that Fonseca had had four encounters\n\nwith the defendants after the robbery.             Counsel moved to suppress\n\nthe identification.        The court deferred ruling until after the\n\ngovernment completed its case-in-chief, and when he restated the\n\nmotion, counsel referred to the two-step inquiry set out above,\n\nrecounted Fonseca's several encounters with the defendants on the\nday of the robbery, and argued that Fonseca's identification was\n\nunreliable because it lacked several indicia upon which courts\n\nusually rely.3      The district court denied the motion, and instead\n\nannounced its intention to specially instruct the jury on the\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Defense counsel noted \"[T]he opportunity of the witness to\nview the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness' degree of\nattention, accuracy and level of certainty, et cetera, the length\nof time of the time of confrontation . . . .\"\n\n                                        -9-\n\fidentification issue.4   The court later provided the following\n\ninstruction:\n\n                 In any criminal case, the government\n          must prove, of course, that the identity of\n          the persons who committed the alleged crime,\n          when a person's a defendant, as the person who\n          committed the crime . . . .\n                 Again, I suggest that you ask yourself\n          a number of questions: Did the witness have\n          an adequate opportunity at the time of the\n          crime to observe the person in question? What\n          was the length of time that the person or the\n          witness had to observe the persons involved?\n          What were the prevailing conditions at the\n          time in terms of visibility or distance and\n          the like? Had the witnesses known or observed\n          the person at earlier times?\n                 You may also consider the circumstances\n          surrounding   any   lack  of   identification,\n          including, for example, the manner in which\n          the defendant was presented to the witnesses\n          for identification, and the length of time\n          that elapsed between the incident in question\n          and the witness' identification of the\n          defendant.\n                 After examining all the testimony and\n          evidence in the case, if you have a reasonable\n          doubt as to the identity of the defendant as\n          the perpetrators of the offense charged, you\n          must find the defendants not guilty.\n\n\n          Turning to the first step of our inquiry, we disagree\nwith the appellants' assertion that an impermissibly suggestive\n\nepisode occurred.   The initial encounter at the mall was no more\n\nthan a quick confirmation at the scene of the crime that the\n\nofficers had detained the correct individuals. See Watson, 76 F.3d\n\n\n     4\n      The defendants did not specifically object to the court's\ndecision to instruct the jury, to the language of the instruction,\nor to testimony from Martínez and Fonseca about Fonseca's out-of-\ncourt recognition of them. Those particulars are thus not before\nus on appeal, nor have the appellants raised these issues on\nappeal.\n\n                               -10-\n\fat 6 (\"Show-ups that take place immediately after the offense has\n\nbeen committed may be necessary in order to avoid the mistaken\n\napprehension of the wrong person.\").               Whether Martínez asked for\n\nthe confirmation or whether Fonseca volunteered that he recognized\n\nthe   defendants     does    not   change    the     nature   of   that    exchange.\n\nAlthough the appellants argue that the need for an on-the-scene\n\nidentification is diminished when the police already have made\n\ntheir probable cause determination and arrested suspects, the\n\nappellants have also sought to cast doubt on their culpability by\nasserting that other individuals had the opportunity to enter the\n\nmall.        Thus,      notwithstanding        any     \"inherent     element     of\n\nsuggestiveness\" in such a confrontation, the quick and informal\n\nconfirmation     that    took      place    here     was   appropriate     for   the\n\ncircumstances.       See Watson, 76 F.3d at 7 (\"Here, the crime was very\n\nfresh, the police not suggestive, and had [the defendant] not been\n\nthe   assailant,      [the    victim]      could     easily   have   said    so.\").\n\nFonseca's later views of the defendants undoubtedly reinforced his\n\noriginal impression, but they were chance encounters that had\nmarginal significance given the identification at the scene of the\n\ncrime.\n\n           Although our conclusion that no impermissibly suggestive\n\nprocedures     took     place      \"eliminates       appellants'     due     process\n\narguments\" Watson, 76 F.3d at 10, we note briefly that our review\n\nof the evidence assures us that Fonseca's in-court identification\n\nwas reliable.        The five factors to be considered in assessing\n\nreliability are \"(1) the opportunity of the witness to view the\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fcriminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of\n\nattention; (3) the accuracy of the witness' prior description of\n\nthe defendant; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the\n\nwitness at the confrontation; (5) the length of time between the\n\ncrime and the confrontation.\"   Henderson, 320 F.3d at 100 (citing\n\nNeil, 409 U.S. at 199-200).\n\n          Here, Fonseca initially observed the defendants face-to-\n\nface, at a close distance, as they approached him.    He testified\n\nthat, during the robbery, he looked at them every time he had the\nchance and did so four or five times.   His physical description of\n\ntheir appearance when he first saw them -- including the wearing of\n\na fisherman's cap and sunglasses -- coincided with Dr. Loyola's\n\nobservations. The details he recalled about the robbery, including\n\nthat each had a gun, were consistent with the evidence that was\n\nlater recovered in the bathroom from which the defendants exited.\n\nAlthough Fonseca's unquestionable nervousness caused him to fumble\n\nwith the combination lock, his recollection of detail reflects\n\nattentiveness to his surroundings.\n          None of this evidence, which was derived from Fonseca's\n\nexperiences during and in the immediate aftermath of the robbery,\n\ncould have been mistakenly based on his post-robbery exposures to\n\nthe defendants. Moreover, both Fonseca and Martínez testified that\n\nwhen Fonseca first saw the defendants after the crime -- an\n\nencounter we already have deemed permissible -- his recognition of\n\nthem was immediate. Given that reaction, we are confident that the\n\nsubsequent encounters had little, if any, impact on the level of\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fcertainty of his in-court identification. Finally, as to the fifth\n\nfactor, the length of time between the crime and the in-court\n\nidentification, the six-month span here is de minimis compared to\n\nother cases.          Cf. Henderson, 320 F.3d at 101 (upholding in-court\n\nidentification despite passage of two and one-half years after\n\ncrime); United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 331 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (seven-year gap between crime and identification permissible\n\nwhere other factors were persuasive).                 In sum, \"we cannot say that\n\nunder       all    the    circumstances    of    this   case    there    is   a   very\nsubstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.                      Short of\n\nthat point, such evidence is for the jury to weigh.\"                      Manson v.\n\nBrathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 114 (1977), quoted by Henderson, 320 F.3d\n\nat 100.       We therefore find no error in the district court's denial\n\nof the appellants' motion to suppress Fonseca's identification\n\ntestimony.\n                                  III. THE HOBBS ACT\n\n                  The appellants make two arguments related to the Hobbs\n\nAct.5       First, they contend that their convictions on Counts One and\nTwo must be reversed because the government failed to introduce\n\nsufficient evidence that their robbery of the lottery business\n\naffected interstate commerce within the meaning of the Hobbs Act.\n\nThe     evidence         was   insufficient,     in   their    view,    because   the\n\n\n        5\n      As noted earlier, Count One explicitly charged a Hobbs Act\nviolation, while the firearms charge in Count Two is premised on\nthe use of a firearm in connection with that crime. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 924(c)(1)(A) (providing enhanced penalty when a firearm is used\n\"during and in relation to any crime of violence . . . for which\nthe person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States\").\n\n                                          -13-\n\fgovernment failed to prove that the lottery business was engaged in\n\ninterstate commerce.6    Second, the appellants contend that the\n\ndistrict court improperly instructed the jury on the Hobbs Act\n\ncharge.   Because neither of the appellants' preserved these claims\n\nbelow, we review both for plain error.7   United States v. Griffin,\n\n524 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir. 2008). Accordingly, appellants must show\n\n\n     6\n      Arguably, the appellants have waived the argument that the\ngovernment failed to produce sufficient evidence that the lottery\nbusiness was engaged in interstate commerce.      In their opening\nbriefs, the appellants appear to concede that the lottery business\nwas engaged in interstate commerce and focus instead on the\nprosecution's \"burden to prove the impact\" of the robbery on\ninterstate commerce. The appellants both argue \"[u]nlike statutes\nthat make it a federal offense to possess a[] weapon that has at\none time traveled in interstate commerce, the Hobbs Act requires\nsome proof of impact.    It was totally lacking here.\"     In their\nreply briefs, however, the appellants switch gears.       That the\nrobbery had a \"de minimis impact\" on interstate commerce, the\nappellants observe, \"is not in dispute here.\"          Rather, the\nappellants contend that at issue \"is the adequacy of the proof that\n[the lottery business] was, in fact, engaged in interstate\ncommerce, rather than the adequacy of the proof of impact.\"\n     We have made clear that arguments that make their debut in a\nreply brief are deemed waived. United States v. Vanvliet, 542 F.3d\n259, 264 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing United States v. Marti-Lon, 524\nF.3d 295, 299 n.2 (1st Cir. 2008)).      Nevertheless, because the\nwaiver issue is a close one, we will address the appellants'\nargument on the merits.\n     7\n      We note that although the appellants did move for a judgment\nof acquittal under Rule 29 at the close of the government's case,\nneither did so on the basis that the government failed to present\nsufficient evidence that the lottery business was engaged in\ninterstate commerce. Rather, counsel for the appellants contended\nthat \"there is insufficient evidence for the robbery, [and] the\nfirearm.\" See United States v. Upham, 168 F.3d 532, 537 (1st Cir.\n1999) (applying plain error standard or review because although\n\"[appellant] did move for a judgment of acquittal [he] did not\nraise this [particular] request or objection\"); see also United\nStates v. Pena-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 26 & n. 5 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing\nUnited States v. Dandy, 998 F.2d 1344, 1356-57 (6th Cir. 1993)).\nThe district court denied the Rule 29 motion, commenting that\n\"[T]here is overwhelming evidence of the fact that this robbery\ntook place as testified to by the witnesses.\"\n\n                                -14-\n\fan error that was plain, (i.e., obvious and clear under current\n\nlaw), prejudicial (i.e., affected the outcome of the district court\n\nproceedings), and that seriously impaired the fairness, integrity,\n\nor public reputation of the judicial proceedings.           Id.\n                        A.   Sufficiency claim\n\n          To successfully prove the robbery violated the Hobbs Act,\n\nthe government had to demonstrate that the robbery had an effect on\n\ninterstate commerce.    Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d at 7.            The effect\n\nneed not be significant.     It is well established that \"a de minimis\ninterference   with   commerce   is   enough   to   sustain   a   Hobbs   Act\n\nconviction.\"   United States v. Cruz-Arroyo, 461 F.3d 69, 75 (1st\n\nCir. 2007); United States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (\"[T]o prove a Hobbs Act violation, the government must show\n\nonly that the . . . conduct created 'a realistic probability of a\n\nde minimis effect on interstate commerce.'\") (quoting United States\n\nv. Butt, 955 F.2d 77, 80 n.2 (1st Cir. 1992)).8\n\n          Where a business9 has been robbed, the government may\n\ndemonstrate    the    robbery    affected      interstate     commerce    by\n\n     8\n      That such a minimal effect on interstate commerce implicates\nthe Hobbs Act reflects the statute's broad sweep. Congress, in\npassing the Act, intended \"'to use all [its] constitutional power\n. . . to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion,\nrobbery, or physical force.'\"      Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d at 7\n(quoting Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 215 (1960)).\n     9\n      We have noted that criminal acts directed at businesses have\na more obvious effect on interstate commerce than criminal acts\ndirected at individuals. See United States v. Rodriguez-Casiano,\n425 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing United States v. McCormack,\n371 F.3d 22, 28-29 (1st Cir. 2004)); see also United States v.\nQuigley, 53 F.3d 909, 910 (8th Cir. 1995) (\"Actions normally have\na lesser effect on interstate commerce when directed at individuals\nrather than businesses.\") (citations omitted).\n\n                                  -15-\n\fdemonstrating that (1) the business engaged in interstate commerce,\n\nand   (2)   that   the   robbery   either   depleted   the    assets   of   the\n\nbusiness, United States v. Rodríguez-Casiano, 425 F.3d 12, 15 (1st\n\nCir. 2005), or resulted in the business's temporary or permanent\n\nclosure.    United States v. Cruz-Rivera, 357 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (expressing doubt \"that there is any serious claim of a\n\nconstitutionally insufficient interstate commerce connection where\n\na robbery directly results in the shutting down of an interstate\n\nbusiness\"). Here, there is no dispute about the asset depletion or\nclosure because the lottery business was robbed of nearly $9,000\n\nand it remained closed on the day of the robbery.            The focus, then,\n\nis on whether the lottery business was engaged in interstate\n\ncommerce.\n\n            Previously, we have held that a business is engaged in\n\ninterstate commerce where the business purchased products from out-\n\nof-state.    In Jiménez-Torres, we concluded that a gas station was\n\ninvolved in interstate commerce where, in the two months preceding\n\nrobbery, the station had purchased a substantial amount of gasoline\nfrom outside of Puerto Rico.        435 F.3d at 8.     In United States v.\n\nCruz-Arroyo, we concluded that the interstate commerce nexus was\n\nsatisfied in an extortion case where money paid to the defendant\n\nwas traceable to a Puerto Rico hospital that bought much of its\n\nequipment from the United States.       461 F.3d 69, 76 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nAnd finally, in Capozzi we concluded that evidence that a car\n\ndealer purchased vehicles from out of state was sufficient to\n\nestablish the interstate commerce nexus.         347 F.3d at 337.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f            Other cases establish that where a business serves out-\n\nof-state customers, the business is engaged in interstate commerce.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Rodriguez, 218 F.3d 1243, 1244\n\n(11th Cir. 2000), the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the defendant's\n\nconviction under the Hobbs Act for robbing five motels.             The Court\n\nnoted that the evidence presented established that all of the\n\nmotels robbed by the defendants registered guests from out-of-state\n\nand that at least four registered guests from outside the country.\n\nId. at 1244.    In holding that the robbery of the motels constituted\na Hobbs Act violation, the court concluded that \"evidence that\n\n[motels] have at some point registered guests from out-of-state is\n\nsufficient to establish their connection to interstate commerce.\"\n\nId. at 1245; see also United States v. Pearson, 508 F.2d 595, 596-\n\n97   (5th   Cir.   1975)   (holding    that    the   government's   evidence,\n\nconsisting of 1,000 guest registration cards from a large hotel,\n\nwas sufficient to establish that the defendant robbed a hotel that\n\nwas engaged in interstate commerce).           And in Capozzi, we concluded\n\nthat one of the robbery victims was engaged in an \"interstate drug\nbusiness\"    because   he    sold     drugs    repeatedly   to   out-of-state\n\ncustomers.     486 F.3d at 726.\n\n            Here, the government introduced evidence that the lottery\n\nbusiness purchased goods from out of state and that the business\n\nserved tourists. The evidence with respect to the former consisted\n\nof both a stipulation and testimony from Muñiz.             The stipulation\n\nestablished that the Muñiz Gallery used lottery machines that had\n\nbeen manufactured in Rhode Island.            The stipulation provided:\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f          That   Mr.    Pedro    Zayas    is   the   local\n          representative of GTEC Corporation. Mr. Zayas\n          would testify that, pursuant to a professional\n          service agreement between the Department of\n          the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n          Rico and GTEC Latin American Corporation,\n          which is a subsidiary of GTEC Corporation, a\n          lottery terminal including of the type they\n          usually use was installed at the business of\n          Mr. Muñiz on October 11, 2004, so that he\n          could    sell     online     lottery,    loteria\n          electronica, out of that business.\n                 Mr. Zayas would also testify that this\n          machine was manufactured in Rhode Island and\n          from there was shipped to Puerto Rico for\n          installation here.\n          Muñiz further testified that the lottery machines and\n\n\"all of the parts and cables and everything . . . they come from\n\nthe States . . . . And the screens, the cables, the whole of the\n\ninside of the game, I bring it from outside.\"\n\n          With respect to the lottery business's involvement in\n\ntourism, Muñiz testified that the lottery business' customers\n\nincluded tourists from outside of Puerto Rico.10\n\n          Even if we were reviewing the appellants' sufficiency\n\nclaim de novo,11 which we are not, we would be hard pressed to find\n\nthe evidence regarding the interstate commerce nexus insufficient\n\n\n     10\n      At trial, Muñiz was specifically asked, \"Do you ever receive\nclientele from outside of Puerto Rico?\" He responded: \"Yes, when\ntourists come. People who live in the United States and they know\nthe business where the lottery tickets are sold, and they play in\nthe gaming room.\"\n     11\n      When reviewing a sufficiency claim de novo, \"we examine the\nevidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the light most\nfavorable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence,\nincluding all plausible inferences drawn therefrom, would allow a\nrational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the\ndefendant committed the charged crime.\" United States v. Cruz-\nRodriguez, 541 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                               -18-\n\fto support the verdict. Both the stipulation and Muñiz's testimony\n\nestablished that the lottery machines put out of service by the\n\nrobbery,     as    well   as     associated       equipment,     were     interstate\n\npurchases.        See Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d at 8.                  In addition,\n\nMuñiz's testimony that he \"bring[s] [the equipment] from outside\"\n\nis sufficient to allow a jury to infer that he also purchased\n\nequipment ancillary to the machines in the past and could do so in\n\nthe future.       The jury's verdict also finds support in the fact that\n\nat least some lottery customers were from the United States.                         See\nRodriguez, 218 F.3d at 1244.            In sum, given the evidence adduced at\n\ntrial, the appellants' sufficiency claim cannot survive plain error\n\nreview.\n\n           The      appellants,        for   their    part,    contend        that   the\n\ngovernment failed to present sufficient evidence that the lottery\n\nbusiness was engaged in interstate commerce.                  They appear to make\n\ntwo arguments.\n\n           Their first argument is that the lottery business had to\n\nbe   \"regularly       engaged     in     buying      and   selling    products        []\nmanufactured outside of Puerto Rico\" in order to be engaged in\n\ninterstate commerce.        In support of this argument, the appellants\n\ncite Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d at 8 and United States v. Vega\n\nMolina, 407 F.3d 511, 527 (1st Cir. 2005).                    In those cases, the\n\nappellants maintain, the businesses at issue regularly bought and\n\nsold out-of-state goods.          Although the appellants never make the\n\npoint   explicitly,       they    appear     to    suggest     that     the    lottery\n\nbusiness's purchase of machines from Rhode Island was a one-off\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fevent and that, as a result, the business was not \"regularly\n\nengaged in buying and selling products.\"               There are at least two\n\nproblems with this argument.\n\n            First,    even    assuming   that     a    business    needs   to   be\n\n\"regularly engaged in buying and selling [out-of-state] products\"\n\nin order to be engaged in interstate commerce, the record can be\n\nfairly read to indicate that the lottery business was so engaged.\n\nAs noted above, Muñiz testified that the lottery machines and \"all\n\nof the parts and cables and everything . . . they come from the\nStates . . . . And the screens, the cables, the whole of the inside\n\nof the game, I bring it from outside.\"                If we were to read this\n\ntestimony as indicating that the lottery business only dealt in\n\ninterstate products one time, we would effectively be viewing the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the defendants.                    Cruz-\n\nRodriguez, 541 F.3d.         It is well established, of course, that we\n\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.                    A\n\njury would need no special background knowledge or particular\n\nevidence to infer that machines, games, screens and cables become\nobsolete or are broken and must be replaced.                 The jury could have\n\nvalidly inferred -- based on Muñiz's testimony -- that the lottery\n\nbusiness was regularly engaged in interstate commerce.\n\n            Second, the appellants' argument fails to address Muñiz's\n\ntestimony that some of the lottery business's customers were from\n\nout-of-state.        This evidence alone suffices to establish the\n\nrequisite   interstate       commerce    nexus.        See    United   States   v.\n\nPeterson, 236 F.3d 848 (7th Cir. 2001) (\"[T]ypically in Hobbs Act\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fcases an owner or manager of the business establishment takes the\n\nstand to testify that the business robbed either served out-of-\n\nstate customers or bought inventory manufactured out-of-state.\")\n\n(emphasis added) (citation omitted)).\n\n           The appellants say that it was the Puerto Rico Department\n\nof   Treasury,   not    the   lottery   business,    that     was   engaged   in\n\ninterstate commerce.      The lottery business, they note, leased the\n\nmachines from the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury.\n\n           We are unpersuaded by this argument for two reasons.\nFirst, the argument proceeds on a faulty premise -- that the\n\nlottery business' only connection to interstate commerce was the\n\nleasing of out-of-state machines from the Department of Treasury.\n\nAs we have just noted, the lottery business served out-of-state\n\ncustomers, specifically, tourists coming from the mainland United\n\nStates.\n\n           Second, a business may be engaged in interstate commerce\n\nindirectly. For example, if a business purchases its products from\n\nan in-state supplier who, in turn, purchases its products from out\nof state, that indirect link to interstate commerce suffices to\n\nestablish that the business is engaged in interstate commerce. See\n\nUnited States v. Zeigler, 19 F.3d 486, 491 (10th Cir. 1994) (\"[The\n\nbusiness] purchased goods from an [in-state] distributor who, in\n\nturn purchased the goods it supplied to [the business] from outside\n\nthe state. This indirect link to interstate commerce is sufficient\n\nto   establish   that    [the   business]   was     engaged    in   interstate\n\ncommerce.\").     The reason why an indirect link may establish the\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\frequisite interstate nexus is that a crime that either closes or\n\ndepletes the assets of a business indirectly engaged in interstate\n\ncommerce could realistically affect interstate commerce.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Elias, 285 F.3d 183, 189 (2d Cir. 2002) (rejecting\n\ndefendant's argument that the government was required to show that\n\nsome of the products sold by the business were purchased directly\n\nfrom out-of-state suppliers and holding that \"a robbery of a local\n\n[business] may be said to affect interstate commerce if the robbery\n\nimpairs the ability of the [business] to acquire - whether from\nout-of-state or in-state suppliers - goods originating out-of-\n\nstate\"); United States v. Brown, 959 F.2d 63, 68 (6th Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"Brown attempted to rob a tavern that . . . purchased goods from\n\nlocal distributors who in turn purchased goods from outside of the\n\nstate.   Had Brown's heist been successful, there is a realistic\n\nprobability that the depletion of the bar's assets would have\n\naffected the amount of its purchases of beer having moved through\n\ninterstate commerce.\").\n                       B.   Jury instruction claim\n\n          Next the appellants claim that the jury was improperly\n\ninstructed on the Hobbs Act charge.           They focus on one sentence\n\nwithin the judge's charge, which stated that in order to find\n\ndefendants   guilty,    the    jury    had   to   find   that   \"the   natural\n\nconsequences\" of the defendants' acts \"would affect commerce in any\n\nway or in any degree.\"        The appellants argue that the instruction\n\nimproperly asked the jury to find whether their acts would affect\n\ncommerce, as opposed to the correct formulation, which would have\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fasked whether the acts did affect commerce.     In the absence of an\n\nobjection, we review for plain error.    United States v. Paniagua-\n\nRamos, 251 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            In relevant part, the trial judge   stated:\n\n            As I said before, it is against federal law to\n            obstruct, delay, or affect commerce by\n            committing robbery.     For you to find the\n            defendants guilty of this crime, you must be\n            convinced that the government has proven each\n            of the following things beyond a reasonable\n            doubt:\n\n             . . .\n            Fourth, that the robbery affected commerce.\n\n            It is not necessary for you to find that the\n            defendants knew or intended that their actions\n            would affect commerce. It is only necessary\n            that the natural consequences of the acts\n            committed by the defendants as charged in the\n            indictment would affect commerce in any way or\n            any degree.\n\n            We reject the appellants' argument.   Contrary to their\n\nassertion, the trial judge specifically did instruct the jury that\n\nit had to find \"that the robbery affected commerce.\" Additionally,\n\nthe sentence targeted by appellants, when placed in its proper\ncontext, is a correct statement of the law, wherein the government\n\nis not required to prove that the defendants intended to affect\n\ncommerce.    See Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d at 9-10 (\"Jiménez may not\n\nhave intended to cause these effects, but his intent is irrelevant\n\nto establish the commerce element of a Hobbs Act offense.\").    Our\n\ntask is to review jury instructions as a whole, to determine if\n\nthey adequately explain the law.   United States v. Gonzalez-Velez,\n\n466 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 2006).   It is clear that this instruction\n\n\n                                -23-\n\fis in accord with the law.12         We therefore find no error in the\n\ninstruction.\n                              IV.    SENTENCING\n\n            The district court sentenced the appellants on Counts One\n\nand Three to concurrent terms at the tops of their applicable\n\nGuidelines ranges -- 115 months for Rivera and 97 months for\n\nSánchez.       On   Count   Two,    the   court   imposed   the   mandatory,\n\nconsecutive sentence of twenty-five years required by 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(C)(I), which applies when a defendant charged with using\na firearm during a violent felony has a previous conviction for\n\nsuch conduct.       The indictment, however, charged a violation of §\n\n924(c)(1)(A)(ii), which mandates a seven-year consecutive minimum\n\nsentence and is applicable when a defendant \"brandishes\" a firearm\n\nin furtherance of a violent crime.          The Presentence Investigation\n\nReports (\"PSRs\") originally recommended the seven-year term, but,\n\nin response to a government objection, the PSRs were amended to\n\ntake the 1998 bank robbery into account.            The amended PSRs thus\n\nproposed the mandatory twenty-five year term for Count Two.                 At\nsentencing, as they do on appeal, the defendants objected to the\n\nchange, asserting that the prior conviction should be viewed as an\n\nelement of the § 924(c) violation and thus a fact the jury needed\n\nto find beyond a reasonable doubt.          The trial court rejected their\n\nargument,    concluding     that    the   twenty-five   year   term   was    a\n\n     12\n      While the instruction also follows verbatim the First\nCircuit's Pattern Jury Instructions, See First Circuit Criminal\nPattern Jury Instructions § 4.16 (1998), these are only a guide,\nand not mandated by this court. United States v. Tse, 375 F.3d\n148, 157-58 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                     -24-\n\fsentencing enhancement that properly could be imposed by the\n\ncourt.13    In addition, the appellants argue that various Guidelines\n\nenhancements were impermissibly factored into the sentence on\n\nCounts One and Three based on facts not found by the jury, and that\n\nthe district court failed to abide by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)'s call\n\nthat    a   sentence   must   be   \"sufficient,   but   not   greater   than\n\nnecessary\" to achieve the objectives of sentencing.\n\n             We turn first to the 25-year consecutive sentence imposed\n\non Count Two, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(C)(I), which mandates\na minimum sentence of twenty five years \"[i]n the case of a second\n\nor subsequent conviction under this subsection . . . .\"           We agree\n\nwith the district court's conclusion that this is a sentencing\n\nenhancement, rather than an element of the offense, and thus a jury\n\ndetermination on the \"second or subsequent conviction\" issue was\n\nnot required.      Although we have not passed on this particular\n\n\n       13\n      An extended colloquy took place at Rivera's sentencing\nconcerning the need for the jury to hear evidence of the prior\nconviction with respect to both Count Three, the felon-in-\npossession charge, and to the harsher penalty on Count Two. The\ncourt noted that the defendants had stipulated to the fact of a\nprior conviction for purposes of Count Three. Rivera's counsel\nacknowledged the stipulation, but asserted that the fact of the\nstipulation was never presented to the jury, and the jury thus\nlacked evidence on a crucial element of the charge. The court,\nhowever, understood the stipulation to remove the prior conviction\nfrom the case, allowing the jury to decide only whether defendants\nhad possessed firearms. If the jury found possession, the court's\nview was that the stipulation would kick in to complete the\nevidence necessary to support a guilty verdict on Count Three.\nWith respect to the twenty-five year term imposed on Count Two –\nwhich was based on the same prior conviction – the court ultimately\nruled that the penalty was \"an appropriate sentencing enhancement\nunder the circumstances.\" Both appellants explicitly declaim any\nchallenge to that portion of the sentence on Counts One and Three\nthat resulted from the stipulation.\n\n                                     -25-\n\fsubsection, we agree with the Second Circuit's conclusion that the\n\nfact of a prior conviction is not an element of § 924(c).                    United\n\nStates v. Mejia, 545 F.3d 179, 207-08 (2d Cir. 2008)(citing United\n\nStates v. Campbell, 300 F.3d at 202, 212-13 (2d Cir. 2002).14                       We\n\nfurther        note   that   this     conclusion   is       in   harmony   with    our\n\nconstruction of the mandatory minimum sentence provision of the\n\nArmed        Career   Criminal   Act,    18   U.S.C.    §    924(e)(1),    which    is\n\nroutinely        considered      an    enhancement      suitable     for    judicial\n\ndetermination.         See, e.g., United States v. Diaz, 519 F.3d 56, 66-\n67 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v. Lewis, 406 F.3d 11, 21 n.11\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                With that question resolved, the sentence at issue falls\n\nsquarely within the realm of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000), in which the Supreme Court held that prior convictions were\n\nnot among the sentence-enhancers that must be submitted to a jury\n\nand proved beyond a reasonable doubt.                       Id. at 490; see also\n\nCampbell, 300 F.3d at 212-13.                   In so doing, the Court left\n\nundisturbed that portion of Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523\nU.S. 226 (1998), which treated prior convictions as sentencing\n\nfactors, rather than offense elements.                 Although appellants point\n\n\n        14\n      In analyzing a provision relating to machine guns, §\n924(c)(1)(B)(ii), we recently concluded that knowing possession of\na machine gun is an element of the crime that must be proven to the\njury. United States v. O'Brien, 542 F.3d 921 (1st Cir. 2008). In\nthis case, however, the appellants do not make any allegations\nregarding the possession of a machine gun. Rather they challenge\nthe fact of a prior conviction, which as we further explain infra,\nthe Supreme Court definitively has concluded is a sentencing\nenhancement that need not be proven to a jury. See Almanderes-\nTorres v. United States, 523 U.S. 226 (1998).\n\n                                         -26-\n\fto Justice Thomas's concurring opinion in Shepard v. United States,\n\n544 U.S. 13 (2005) that questioned the continuing viability of\n\nAlmendarez-Torres, \"[w]e have ruled with a regularity bordering on\n\nthe monotonous, that given the explicit exception and force of\n\nAlmendarez-Torres, the rationale of Apprendi does not apply to\n\nsentence-enhancement       provisions        based   upon   prior     criminal\n\nconvictions.\" United States v. Ivery, 427 F.3d 69, 74-75 (1st Cir.\n\n2005)(internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n            Here, the district court had before it the appellants'\ngeneralized stipulation that they had previously been convicted of\n\na felony punishable by more than one year as well as the PSRs which\n\nspecifically noted that the appellants had previously pled guilty\n\nto using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §924(c)(1). The appellants attempt to shrug\n\noff the yoke of Apprendi, Almendarez-Torres, and Mejia by arguing\n\nthat   Shepard    limits   the   district     court's   consideration    to   a\n\ncharging document, written plea agreement or plea colloquy.                   We\n\ndisagree.        Shepard   involved   a   determination     whether   certain\npredicate offenses were \"crimes of violence,\" within the meaning of\n\nthe ACCA.    Given the factual inquiry involved, the Court limited\n\nthe type of fact-finding that could be permissibly conducted by the\n\ntrial judge.      Shepard, 544 U.S. at 24-26.        Here, by contrast, the\n\ndistrict court needed only to find that the prior convictions were\n\nunder section 924(c), a fact which was both undisputed by the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fdefendants15 and readily apparent from the PSR.             Cf. United States\n\nv. Brown, 510 F.3d 57, 74-75 (1st Cir. 2007) (district court may\n\nnot rely solely on factual assertions in PSR if defendant contests\n\nthem).      Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's\n\napplication of 18 U.S.C. § 924 (c)(1)(C)(i) to Count Two.\n\n               Finally, we address the appellants' contention that the\n\ndistrict court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).                     In\n\nsentencing appellants on Counts One and Three, which were properly\n\ngrouped for sentencing, the district court was bound to employ the\nprocedures we sketched out in United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d     514    (1st    Cir.   2006)   by     \"engag[ing]   in   a   sequential\n\ndetermination      of    the   guideline    range,   including   any    proposed\n\ndepartures, followed by the further determination whether other\n\nfactors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence\n\nabove or below the guideline range.\"              Id. at 518-19.       The court\n\nalso must consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(a) and ultimately explain the reasoning behind the sentence,\n\neven if the sentence is within the guideline range.              United States\nv. Turbides-Leonardo, 468 F.3d 34, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2006).                     We\n\nreview the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines de\n\nnovo, and its factual findings for clear error.              United States v.\n\nAlli, 444 F.3d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n               With respect to Sánchez, the district court, following\n\nthe PSR, started with a base offense level of 20. U.S. Sentencing\n\n       15\n      The appellants disputed many aspects of the PSR, but neither\none disputed that his predicate conviction was, in fact, for\nviolating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).\n\n                                       -28-\n\fGuideline Manual § 2B3.1 (2004). Upward adjustments were added for\n\nphysical restraint of the victim (two points), making a death\n\nthreat (two points), theft of a firearm (one point), and loss in\n\nexcess of $10,000 (one point).           The resulting adjusted offense\n\nlevel was 26.     Sánchez was assigned three criminal history points\n\nfor his prior conviction, two because the subject offense occurred\n\nwhile he was on parole, and one because it occurred less than two\n\nyears after his release from prison. The six points placed Sánchez\n\nin   Criminal   History   Category      III,    resulting    in    an   advisory\nGuideline range of 78 to 97 months.            The district court imposed a\n\nsentence at the top of that range, 97 months.            Adding the 25-year\n\nconsecutive sentence from Count Two, Sánchez's sentence totaled 397\n\nmonths.\n\n           Rivera's sentencing calculation was different in only one\n\nrespect. His record included an additional conviction which led to\n\nseven criminal history points, placing him in Criminal History\n\nCategory IV, and yielding a guideline range of 92 to 115 months.\n\nThe court again chose the uppermost sentence within the range,\nwhich, when combined with the 25-year sentence on Count Two,\n\nyielded a sentence of 415 months.\n\n           As the appellants advance identical arguments, we treat\n\nthem together.     First, relying on Apprendi, they argue that the\n\nenhancements to their respective base offense levels needed to be\n\ndetermined   by   a   jury,   beyond    a   reasonable      doubt.      We   have\n\npreviously   held,    however,   that    Apprendi    does    not     prohibit   a\n\nsentencing court from making factual findings that increase a\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fdefendant's sentence as long as the sentence imposed is within the\n\ndefault statutory maximum based on the jury's findings.                        United\n\nStates v. Butterworth, 511 F.3d 71, 77 (1st Cir. 200).                      Here, the\n\nstatutory maximum sentences on Counts One and Three are 20 and 10\n\nyears, respectively.             See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) and 924(a)(2).\n\nThus, the court properly considered these enhancements.\n\n            Next the appellants each argue that the court erroneously\n\nconcluded that there was a total loss in excess of $10,000, as\n\nrequired by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B3.1(b)(7) (2004).\nWe disagree.       In addition to the undisputed fact that $8700 was\n\nstolen from Muniz, testimony also supported the finding that a\n\nwatch and gold key ring were taken, thus bringing the total loss to\n\nover $10,000.      It is of no moment that the items were recovered and\n\nreturned.       See Id. § 2B3.1(7) (\"loss\" is defined as the value of\n\nthe property taken); see also United States v. Cruz-Santiago, 12\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993) (in larceny case, finding that permanent\n\nand   temporary        takings    are    treated     similarly      for   Guidelines\n\npurposes).       Accordingly, we find that the           one-point enhancement\nfor a loss exceeding $10,000 was proper.\n\n            The appellants' final argument is that the district court\n\nviolated the principles of Booker by failing to consider the\n\nfactors contained in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and thus effectively\n\ntreated   the     Guidelines      as    mandatory.      Tied   to    this    specific\n\nargument is their claim that their sentences -- 415 months for\n\nRivera    and    397    months    for    Sanchez   --   violated      both    section\n\n3553(a)'s language that sentences be \"sufficient, but not greater\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fthan necessary\" and the \"ultimate requirement of reasonableness.\"\n\nJimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518.     We disagree.\n\n          We   first   note   that   the   district    court   explicitly\n\nindicated that the Guidelines were advisory during each appellant's\n\nsentencing hearing.    Next, as we have done in the past, we reject\n\nthe appellants' argument that section 3553(a)'s \"sufficient, but\n\nnot greater than necessary\" language is a mandate for leniency.\n\nThis language \"is often cited by defendants as if it were an\n\nadmonition to be lenient (and to explain a lack of leniency).\"\nUnited States v. Navedo-Concepcion, 450 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   However, \"we do not think that the 'not greater than\n\nnecessary' language requires as a general matter that a judge,\n\nhaving explained why a sentence has been chosen, also explain why\n\nsome lighter sentence is inadequate.\"        Id.      Here, the district\n\njudge explained that the Guideline portion of Sánchez's sentence\n\nwas based in part on the fact that the instant crime was his second\n\narmed robbery, that it was committed while on supervised release,\n\nand that he has shown a violent and criminal behavior toward\nsociety while lacking respect for the criminal justice system. The\n\ntrial court explained Rivera's sentence in similar terms.\n\n          In our view, these explanations are sufficient to satisfy\n\nsection 3553(a).   This is not a situation where, for example, \"the\n\ndistrict judge gave a one-sentence explanation\" of the sentence,\n\nwithout explaining the Guidelines calculations or referencing any\n\nevidence that influenced the decision. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nGarcia-Carasquillo, 483 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 2007) (remanding\n\n\n                                 -31-\n\ffor re-sentencing due to district court's inadequate sentence\n\nexplanation).16   We find no sentencing error.\n                           V.   CONCLUSION\n\n          The convictions and sentences are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                    \"Dissenting Opinion follows\"\n\n\n\n\n     16\n      We note that the trial court is not required to state the\nreasoning for imposing sentence at a particular point in the\nguideline range, as neither appellant's range exceeded 24 months.\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c); Navedo-Concepcion, 450 F.3d at 56.\n\n                                 -32-\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part. I respectfully\n\ndisagree with the majority's conclusion that the evidence in this\n\ncase was sufficient to allow the jury to find that appellants'\n\nrobbery affected interstate commerce within the meaning of the\n\nHobbs Act.   The interstate commerce element of the statute serves\n\nthe important function of establishing a federal interest in crimes\n\nthat are typically the concern of state criminal law, and it is\n\nthus a critical component of a Hobbs Act violation.     Although I\n\nrecognize that \"a de minimis effect\" will suffice to meet the\n\ncommerce element,\" United States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st\n\nCir. 2003), the evidence here falls short of even that modest\n\nrequirement.   I therefore would reverse appellants' convictions on\n\nCounts One and Two.17\n\n\n\n     17\n      As the majority notes, the defendants did not specifically\nrefer to the interstate commerce element in making their Rule 29\nmotion. The district court did not give them the opportunity to do\nso.   After the court ended a discussion concerning pretrial\nidentification by saying that it would give the jury a specific\ninstruction on identification procedures, the colloquy continued as\nfollows:\n     DEFENSE COUNSEL: Other than that, we pray the Court to\n     grant a Rule 29 and enter a not guilty verdict on this\n     particular case at this time, because I submit that there\n     is insufficient evidence for the robbery, the firearm,\n     and the fact –\n     COURT: I think there is overwhelming evidence of the fact\n     that this robbery took place as testified to by the\n     witnesses. Motion denied.\n     OTHER DEFENSE COUNSEL: We adopt the motion.\n     COURT: Anything else?\n     GOVERNMENT: [returning to identification issue]\n\nIn these circumstances, I would not apply plain error review. In\nany event, I believe the government's failure to prove the\ninterstate commerce element constitutes plain error.\n\n                               -33-\n\f           There is no doubt that the lottery business was impacted\n\nin ways that would establish an effect on interstate commerce if\n\nthe business were regularly involved in such commerce.            As the\n\nmajority notes, the interstate commerce element of the Hobbs Act is\n\noften proven in a robbery case by showing that the crime depleted\n\nthe assets of a business engaged in interstate commerce, see United\n\nStates v. Rodríguez-Casiano, 425 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2005), or\n\nforced such a business to close, even temporarily, see United\n\nStates v. Cruz-Rivera, 357 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2004).         Either of\nthose situations potentially affects the company's ability to\n\nconduct   business   as   usual,   thereby   \"creat[ing]   'a   realistic\n\nprobability'\" of preventing transactions in interstate commerce.\n\nCapozzi, 347 F.3d at 335 (\"[T]he government must show only that the\n\n. . . conduct created 'a realistic probability of a de minimis\n\neffect on interstate commerce.'\" (quoting United States v. Butt,\n\n955 F.2d 77, 80 n.2 (1st Cir. 1992))); see also United States v.\n\nDeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 68 (1st Cir. 2008).      I thus agree with the\n\nmajority that the lottery business's closure for a day and its loss\nof $9,000 would cause the kind of impact required by our cases.18\n\n     18\n      The government has long prosecuted Hobbs Act cases in Puerto\nRico assuming that it must prove an impact on interstate commerce\nrather than on commerce within the Commonwealth. In response to\nthe panel's request for supplemental briefing, the government now\nargues that the interstate commerce requirement applies only to\ncrimes that occur in the fifty states and not to those committed in\nother United States jurisdictions. See United States v. Liburd,\n291 F. Supp. 2d 383, 385-86 (D.V.I. 2003) (holding the requirement\ninapplicable to territories or possessions).      It relies on the\nAct's definition of \"commerce\" as including \"commerce within . . .\nany Territory or Possession of the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. §\n1951(b)(3).\n     However, as the government points out, even if the full panel\n\n                                   -34-\n\f          My   problem   is   that    the   evidence   did   not   show   the\n\nnecessary involvement by the business in interstate commerce.             To\n\nbe sure, Muñiz's enterprise used equipment – the lottery and gaming\n\nmachines – that were manufactured outside Puerto Rico.              Missing\n\nfrom the record, however, is any indication of future transactions\n\nin interstate commerce. There was no evidence that Muñiz purchased\n\nmachines for the business regularly or planned to acquire one at\n\nany point in the foreseeable future.19       Nor was there evidence that\n\nthe business engaged in any other interstate transactions in the\nordinary course of its business.       Although it seems plausible that\n\nthe paper used in printing lottery tickets might come from outside\n\nPuerto Rico and that the supply might need regular replenishing, or\n\nthat Muñiz might have had a maintenance contract with the Rhode\n\nIsland manufacturer to regularly service his machines, no evidence\n\n\nagreed that it is unnecessary to prove an effect on interstate\ncommerce for Hobbs Act violations in Puerto Rico, that construction\nof the statute would be inapplicable in this case because the\ncharges were brought, and the jury was instructed, based on the\ninterstate commerce requirement. See McCormick v. United States,\n500 U.S. 257, 270 n.8 (1991) (\"Appellate courts are not permitted\nto affirm convictions on any theory they please simply because the\nfacts necessary to support the theory were presented to the\njury.\"); Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 236 (1980)\n(\"[W]e cannot affirm a criminal conviction on the basis of a theory\nnot presented to the jury.\").      Thus, even if I accepted the\ngovernment's new understanding of the Hobbs Act as it applies to\nPuerto Rico, it would not affect my view of the sufficiency of the\nevidence in this case. I therefore do not discuss the merits of\nthat argument.\n     19\n      Indeed, the evidence suggests that Muñiz did not even\npurchase the lottery machines himself, but obtained them from the\nCommonwealth's Department of the Treasury, which brought them to\nPuerto Rico through an arrangement with the manufacturer. Because\nI believe the interstate commerce element would not be satisfied\neven if Muñiz had purchased the machines himself, I need not dwell\non this further complication.\n\n                                     -35-\n\fof such dealings was presented.      Thus, the record lacks proof of\n\nfuture interstate purchasing by Muñiz's business on which the\n\nrobbery could have had an impact.20\n\n            The majority asserts that it is reasonable to infer that\n\nthe lottery business was engaged in ongoing interstate commerce\n\nbecause \"[a] jury would need no special background knowledge or\n\nparticular evidence to infer that machines, games, screens and\n\ncables become obsolete or are broken and must be replaced.\"           It\n\ncites Muñiz's testimony that all of the equipment associated with\nthe machines – \"the screens, the cables, the whole of the inside of\n\nthe game\" – came from the United States mainland.         But the Hobbs\n\nAct requires proof that this particular robbery potentially impeded\n\nthe business's interstate dealings, see Capozzi, 347 F.3d at 336\n\n(\"[T]he Hobbs Act 'ensure[s], through case-by-case inquiry, that\n\nthe   [extortion   or   robbery]    in    question   affects   interstate\n\ncommerce.'\") (quoting United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 561\n\n(1995)), and the possible purchase of replacement equipment at some\n\nundefined point in the future does not suffice to establish that\nnexus.     Neither the business's closure for a day nor its loss of\n\ncash proceeds can reasonably be presumed to affect a transaction\n\nthat may not occur for years.\n\n\n      20\n      I note my agreement with the majority that the interstate\ncommerce element would be satisfied if a business purchased its\ninventory from an in-state supplier that obtained the products from\nout of state.    Such interstate activity, although indirect, is\nnonetheless ongoing, and a robbery of the business would have the\nsame impact on the future purchase of out-of-state goods as it\nwould if the products were purchased directly from an out-of-state\nsource.\n\n                                   -36-\n\f          The majority contends that reading Muñiz's testimony to\n\nindicate that his business \"only dealt in interstate products one\n\ntime\" would be to view the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe defendants, contrary to our obligation to view the testimony in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict.     I am not suggesting,\n\nhowever, that the jury could not reasonably infer that Muñiz at\n\nsome point would make additional purchases of machines and parts,\n\nbut only that the record contains no evidence of the frequency of\n\nsuch purchases or whether any such transaction was anticipated in\nreasonable proximity to the robbery.      In the absence of such\n\nevidence, it would be rank speculation for the jury to find that\n\nthis robbery had an impact on interstate commerce.\n\n          In relying on the lottery business's past acquisition of\n\nequipment, without any evidence of future purchases, the majority\n\ntakes a significant step beyond the precedent it invokes. Implicit\n\nin the cases is a requirement that the victim company's interstate\n\nactivity occur in the regular course of its business, such as when\n\na firm's stock in trade is a product acquired from an out-of-state\nsupplier or when, as in the case of a hotel, the business by its\n\nnature depends on out-of-state customers. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir. 2006) (Puerto Rico gas\n\nstation purchased gasoline from a refinery in the Virgin Islands);\n\nRodriguez-Casiano, 425 F.3d at 14 (Puerto Rico businesses obtained\n\nmuch of their inventory from mainland suppliers); United States v.\n\nHemingway, 108 Fed. App'x 83, 85 (4th Cir. 2004) (noting that\n\nvictim hotel was part of a national chain that received supplies\n\n\n                               -37-\n\ffrom out-of-state and that most of the hotel's guests were from\n\nout-of-state); Capozzi, 347 F.3d at 337 (car dealership that bought\n\ncars from out-of-state); United States v. Rodriguez, 218 F.3d 1243,\n\n1244 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (robbery of motels); United\n\nStates v. Pearson, 508 F.2d 595, 596-97 (5th Cir. 1975) (per\n\ncuriam) (robbery of a hotel). This requirement makes sense. Where\n\nthe robbed establishment engages in interstate commerce on a\n\nregular basis, an interstate impact can be presumed from the mere\n\nfact that the crime occurred.\n            Thus,   the     majority    misses    what    I   see     as    a   clear\n\ndistinction   between     businesses      whose    merchandise        or    supplies\n\ninclude    products    regularly       obtained    by    means   of      interstate\n\ncommerce,   requiring     repeated      future    transactions      to     replenish\n\ninventory, and businesses whose only connection with interstate\n\ncommerce was the initial purchase of the materials or equipment\n\nneeded to set up the company.            A robbery of the latter type of\n\nbusiness    would     potentially      affect     interstate     commerce       only\n\ncoincidentally,     i.e.,    if   a   purchase    of    replacement        equipment\nhappened to be imminent. When a business is involved in interstate\n\ncommerce every day, however, there is a \"realistic probability\"\n\nthat any depletion of assets or forced closure would have an effect\n\non interstate commerce.        See, e.g., United States v. Hebert, 131\n\nF.3d 514, 523 n.8 (5th Cir. 1997) (\"[A] showing that the business\n\nregularly buys goods from out of state allows an inference that the\n\nrobbery will impair a future purchase.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       -38-\n\f            The majority alternatively points to evidence that the\n\nlottery business served tourists from out-of-state, relying on\n\ncases involving motels and hotels to assert that evidence of past\n\nout-of-state customers is enough of a nexus to interstate commerce\n\nto satisfy the statutory requirement.         The hotel context is not,\n\nhowever, equivalent to the circumstances in this case.           The hotel\n\nindustry focuses on attracting travelers from outside the local\n\narea, and out-of-state tourists routinely book hotel or motel\n\naccommodations from their home locations.          In effect, out-of-state\nguests are part of the \"stock in trade\" of a hotel business, and\n\nmany of those guests' interactions with the hotel can reasonably be\n\npresumed   to   occur   across   state    lines.     In   addition,   hotels\n\nroutinely advertise their accommodations to residents of other\n\nstates.    Thus, when the evidence shows that a hotel serves out-of-\n\nstate guests, a jury reasonably may infer that the business is\n\nengaged in activities that implicate interstate commerce on a\n\nregular basis, and there is a \"realistic probability\" that any\n\ndepletion of its assets would affect that commerce.21\n\n     21\n      The majority quotes the Eleventh Circuit's statement in\nRodriguez that evidence that the victim motels had \"at some point\"\nregistered out-of-state guests was enough to establish a connection\nto interstate commerce.    I do not understand that decision to\nendorse a Hobbs Act conviction where the robbed business had only\na past relationship with interstate commerce. Rather, the fact\nthat the motel had previously served out-of-state guests allowed\nthe inference that its customary operations included such\ncustomers. In other words, a jury reasonably could find based on\nits clientele that the motel was regularly engaged in transactions\ninvolving interstate commerce. See also Pearson, 508 F.2d at 597\n(noting that \"[t]he evidence established that this hotel\nentertained a large number of out of state visitors, thus\nestablishing the required interstate nexus\").\n\n\n                                   -39-\n\f          By contrast, there is no evidence in this case permitting\n\nan inference that Muñiz's sale of lottery tickets to tourists\n\nordinarily involved interstate commerce, nor any evidence of \"'a\n\nrealistic probability'\" that interstate commerce was affected by\n\nthe robbery at issue here.   See Capozzi, 347 F.3d at 335.   A sale\n\nof locally produced merchandise (here, the lottery ticket) does not\n\nbecome an interstate transaction simply because the purchaser, who\n\nis buying locally, happens to hail from out-of-state.\n\n          I recognize that, in enacting the Hobbs Act, Congress\nintended \"'to use all [its] constitutional power . . . to punish\n\ninterference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery, or\n\nphysical force.'\"   Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d at 7 (quoting Stirone\n\nv. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 215 (1960)).     At the same time,\n\nhowever, the Supreme Court's discussions of the Commerce Clause in\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), and United States v.\n\nMorrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), should give us pause before further\n\nexpanding its reach into traditionally local concerns. Indeed, the\n\nCourt in Morrison explicitly recognized the singular role of the\nstates with respect to violent crime: \"[W]e can think of no better\n\nexample of the police power, which the Founders denied the National\n\nGovernment and reposed in the States, than the suppression of\n\nviolent crime and vindication of its victims.\"   Morrison, 529 U.S.\n\nat 618; see also Lopez, 514 U.S. at 557 (noting that \"the scope of\n\nthe interstate commerce power 'must be considered in the light of\n\nour dual system of government and may not be extended so as to\n\nembrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote\n\n\n                               -40-\n\fthat to embrace them . . . . would effectually obliterate the\n\ndistinction between what is national and what is local'\") (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            In Capozzi, 347 F.3d at 335-36, we concluded that Lopez\n\nand Morrison did not invalidate the de minimis effect standard for\n\nHobbs Act violations and replace it with a \"substantially affects\"\n\ntest because – unlike the statutes at issue in those cases – the\n\nHobbs Act includes a jurisdictional element that \"'ensure[s],\n\nthrough case-by-case inquiry, that the [extortion or robbery] in\nquestion affects interstate commerce.'\" Id. at 336 (quoting Lopez,\n\n514 U.S. at 561).       We observed that \"Congress' inclusion of a\n\njurisdictional element in the Hobbs Act addresses the Lopez Court's\n\nconstitutional   concern     that    congressional    authority   under   the\n\nCommerce Clause not become a 'general police power of the sort\n\nretained by the States.'\"         Id. (quoting Lopez, 514 U.S. at 567).\n\n            The Supreme Court arguably distinguished crimes with a\n\njurisdictional element from the statutes it invalidated in Lopez\n\nand Morrison because the interstate commerce element ensures the\npresence of a federal interest – justifying federal prosecution –\n\nin offenses that otherwise replicate traditional state crimes.\n\nAlthough we concluded in Capozzi that the \"de minimis effect\"\n\nstandard    continues   to   be    sufficient   to   identify   the   federal\n\ninterest, that standard cannot be applied so loosely that the\n\ninterstate commerce element no longer serves to distinguish between\n\nfederal and state crimes. Otherwise, we risk turning every routine\n\n\n\n\n                                     -41-\n\frobbery into a federal offense.             See Jiménez-Torres, 435 F.3d at\n\n14-15 (Torruella, J., concurring).\n\n               In my view, that is what the majority has done here with\n\na de minimis effect analysis that reduces this concept to a\n\nmeaningless verbal incantation.             Indeed, virtually every business\n\nuses some item that was made in another state – perhaps a table or\n\na   rug   or    paint   on   the   walls.     If   speculation   about   future\n\nreplacement of such items suffices to establish the interstate\n\ncommerce nexus, the Hobbs Act would embrace virtually all local\n\nrobberies.       Similarly, the happenstance that a tourist purchases\n\nlocally produced merchandise does not transform that purchase into\n\nan interstate transaction.            Otherwise, the robbery of a fruit\n\npeddler's stand that is patronized by tourists becomes a Hobbs Act\n\nviolation. On the record before us, the majority's conclusion that\n\nthe jury could find a nexus between the defendants' robbery and\n\ninterstate commerce is an exercise in imagination that places this\n\ncase beyond the outer boundaries of our prior precedent.             I cannot\n\nagree to such an expansion of the law.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\f",

Rivera was sentenced to 415 months' imprisonment  more than 34 years  and Sánchez was sentenced to 397 months  just over 33 years. Both sentences included a mandatory minimum term of 25 years for the use of a firearm in relation to a violent federal felony after a previous conviction for the same offense. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(C)(i). By statute, the 25-year term was required to be imposed consecutively to any other sentence. The appellants challenge both their convictions and their sentences. They claim two trial errors: (1) the key witness's in-court identification was tainted by unnecessarily suggestive pretrial encounters, and (2) the government failed to meet its burden of proving that the robbery affected interstate commerce. They also assert multiple flaws in their sentencing, including that the court improperly imposed the 25-year mandatory minimum based on facts not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The facts of the robbery, as the jury could have found them, are as follows. Shortly after 8 a.m. on the morning of October 11, 2004, Carmelo Fonseca, the manager of the Muñiz Gallery, a small shopping mall in Caguas, opened both the front and rear entrances to the building, turned on the machines in the mall's game center, and started walking toward the office of the lottery ticket business run by the Gallery's owner, Félix Muñiz. At 8:20 a.m., before the mall was open for customers, two individuals entered the mall through the back entrance. They approached Fonseca and asked him where the lottery machines were located, and then each pulled out a gun. One of them \"loaded [his] pistol and charged it,\" and, after warning Fonseca \"not to act like some tough guy, that they would shoot [him],\" they directed Fonseca to take them to the lottery business office on the second floor. Although the men told Fonseca not to look at them, he testified that he did not comply and that \"every time I had a chance, I looked at them.\" Fonseca reported that one of the individuals was wearing a white shirt and the other wore a black shirt. On direct examination, Fonseca indicated that both men were wearing sunglasses and hats. On cross-examination, he testified that one of them was wearing dark glasses and the other was wearing a hat. One of the men was carrying a black plastic bag of the type used by retail stores.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, across the hallway from where the three men were having their initial conversation, Dr. Johanna Loyola, an optometrist who had just arrived at her office, noticed the young men with Fonseca and saw that one had a pistol. She immediately called 911 to report a robbery, describing the perpetrators as young men with dark glasses and caps, and also shouted to the mall's maintenance employee, María, to get help because Fonseca was being robbed. In her phone call to the police, Loyola stated that one of the men did not seem tall, but looked strong.</p>\n<p>María found a municipal police officer, Juan Soto, outside the mall. Soto went in through the back entrance, which he closed, proceeded to the front of the building, and padlocked the front door. He then called for backup. By this time, the two robbers had taken Fonseca upstairs, where he was forced to open the office safe. Because he was nervous, Fonseca made several attempts before he successfully <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> opened the combination lock. The men then ordered him to get face down on the floor, and they tied his arms and legs with black ties taken from the black bag. They took a cash box containing $8,770 from the safe, and a gun and photographs from Muñiz's desk.</p>\n<p>Outside the building, Puerto Rico Police Department officers and municipal officers, including Soto and Caguas officer Eliseo Martínez, had gathered in response to Soto's request for backup and Loyola's call. Soto removed the padlock from the front door and prepared to enter the building. He and Martínez testified that they could see two individuals in the vicinity of Muñiz's office. One wore blue jeans and a white t-shirt, had on dark glasses and was carrying a black bag with shiny lettering; the other wore a black shirt and blue jeans and was holding a fisherman's cap in his right hand. Ignoring Soto's order to halt, the men walked to the end of the hallway, found the back door closed, and then walked back down the hallway trying the doors of the businesses they passed. None were open, and the pair went into the men's restroom at the end of the hall. As they entered the bathroom, they lifted their shirts, and Soto saw pistol butts in their waistbands. The two men  defendants Sánchez and Rivera  came out several minutes later, at which point Martínez arrested them.</p>\n<p>In a trash can in the bathroom, Soto found the black bag with the shiny letters, which contained some dollar bills; a metal box; the fisherman's cap he had seen one of the men holding; some black straps; and a .38-caliber revolver belonging to Muñiz. Soto also found two loaded pistols inside a towel dispenser.</p>\n<p>Fonseca was released by a municipal police officer and shortly thereafter saw Martínez escorting the defendants, in handcuffs, out of the building. Fonseca testified that he immediately recognized them as the robbers. He saw the defendants again about an hour later at the Caguas municipal police station, where he had gone to file charges. Fonseca testified that he happened to notice them as they walked back and forth inside a holding cell. On cross-examination, Fonseca stated that he also saw them in two locations at the courthouse where the defendants' preliminary hearing was held: in a cell at the district attorney's office and then \"standing in front of the judge.\" Soto testified that Fonseca also saw the defendants briefly as they were being moved from the police station to the patrol car to be transported to the courthouse.</p>\n<p>Charges originally were brought against Sánchez and Rivera under local law, but they were later dismissed and the men were charged in a three-count federal indictment. Count One alleged that the defendants aided and abetted each other in committing an armed robbery affecting interstate commerce in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) and 2. Count Two charged the use of a firearm in connection with the robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 2. Count Three charged defendants with being felons-in-possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)and 924(a)(2), and alleged that they had been convicted in 1998 for an armed bank robbery.</p>\n<p>At trial, Fonseca was asked if the men who robbed him were in the courtroom, and he identified the defendants. When asked by the prosecutor and the court to explain the basis for his conclusion that these were the men, he said that he \"recognized them because they were the ones that robbed me.\" For purposes of Count Three, the felon-in-possession charge, the government and the defendants stipulated that Rivera and Sánchez had a triggering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> prior felony, and no evidence of the prior conviction was presented to the jury.</p>\n<p>At the end of the government's case, the defendants sought suppression of Fonseca's identification testimony on the ground that he had been exposed to unnecessarily suggestive pre-trial confrontations with the defendants. The court refused to suppress the statement identifying the defendants as the perpetrators, but agreed to give the jury a specific instruction on identification procedures. Defense counsel also moved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt. The court denied the motion, observing that \"there is overwhelming evidence of the fact that this robbery took place as testified to by the witnesses.\" The jury subsequently found both defendants guilty on all three counts.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the defendants renew their challenge to Fonseca's in-court identification and also seek reversal of their conviction on Count One, the Hobbs Act charge, on the ground that the government failed to present sufficient evidence that the robbery affected interstate commerce.<sup>[1]</sup> A reversal on Count One would require reversal on the Count Two firearms charge as well because proof of the Hobbs Act violation is an element of that offense. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d 3, 8 n. 1 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>IDENTIFICATION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellants claim that the district court erred in refusing to suppress Fonseca's in-court identification, which they assert was tainted by his impermissibly suggestive pre-trial encounters with them shortly after the robbery occurred. As described above, Fonseca came into contact with the defendants three or four times before the preliminary hearing that took place on the day of the robbery. It is undisputed that he saw them at the mall shortly after they were arrested and handcuffed, although the precise nature of that encounter was the subject of inconsistent testimony.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>There also is no dispute that the subsequent encounters were unplanned: first, at the Caguas police station, when the defendants were in a holding cell; next, according to Officer Soto, as the defendants were being transported in a police car to the courthouse; and, finally, in a holding cell near the district attorney's office at the courthouse.</p>\n<p>Although introduction of \"impermissibly suggestive\" identification evidence may violate the Due Process Clause, <i>see </i><i>Neil v. Biggers,</i> 409 U.S. 188, 196-98, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972); <i>United States v. Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d 121, 125 (1st Cir.2006), we have stated repeatedly that identification evidence should be withheld from the jury \"only in extraordinary cases.\" <i>Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 125; <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 100 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Watson,</i> 76 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1996). A court should suppress identifications made before trial and in the courtroom on due process grounds only if it is \"persuaded that there was a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\" <i>United States v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*283</span> <i>de Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations and quotation marks omitted); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 125; <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100.</p>\n<p>A two-step analysis is used to determine whether suppression is appropriate. <i>Holliday,</i> 457 F.3d at 125; <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100. We consider first whether an impermissibly suggestive identification procedure was used and, if so, whether the identification was nonetheless reliable under the totality of the circumstances. <i>Id.</i> Our review of the court's ruling on the motion to suppress is plenary. <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 99. We review findings of fact for clear error. <i>United States v. Brennick,</i> 405 F.3d 96, 99-100 (1st Cir.2005). In the end, we will affirm a district court's denial of a suppression motion if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it. <i>United States v. St. Pierre,</i> 488 F.3d 76, 79 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The identification issue first arose at the conclusion of Fonseca's testimony, during which defense counsel apparently learned for the first time that Fonseca had had four encounters with the defendants after the robbery. Counsel moved to suppress the identification. The court deferred ruling until after the government completed its case-in-chief, and when he restated the motion, counsel referred to the two-step inquiry set out above, recounted Fonseca's several encounters with the defendants on the day of the robbery, and argued that Fonseca's identification was unreliable because it lacked several indicia upon which courts usually rely.<sup>[3]</sup> The district court denied the motion, and instead announced its intention to specially instruct the jury on the identification issue.<sup>[4]</sup> The court later provided the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote>In any criminal case, the government must prove, of course, that the identity of the persons who committed the alleged crime, when a person's a defendant, as the person who committed the crime. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Again, I suggest that you ask yourself a number of questions: Did the witness have an adequate opportunity at the time of the crime to observe the person in question? What was the length of time that the person or the witness had to observe the persons involved? What were the prevailing conditions at the time in terms of visibility or distance and the like? Had the witnesses known or observed the person at earlier times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You may also consider the circumstances surrounding any lack of identification, including, for example, the manner in which the defendant was presented to the witnesses for identification, and the length of time that elapsed between the incident in question and the witness' identification of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>After examining all the testimony and evidence in the case, if you have a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the defendant as the perpetrators of the offense charged, you must find the defendants not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p>Turning to the first step of our inquiry, we disagree with the appellants' assertion that an impermissibly suggestive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> episode occurred. The initial encounter at the mall was no more than a quick confirmation at the scene of the crime that the officers had detained the correct individuals. <i>See </i><i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 6 (\"Show-ups that take place immediately after the offense has been committed may be necessary in order to avoid the mistaken apprehension of the wrong person.\"). Whether Martínez asked for the confirmation or whether Fonseca volunteered that he recognized the defendants does not change the nature of that exchange. Although the appellants argue that the need for an on-the-scene identification is diminished when the police already have made their probable cause determination and arrested suspects, the appellants have also sought to cast doubt on their culpability by asserting that other individuals had the opportunity to enter the mall. Thus, notwithstanding any \"inherent element of suggestiveness\" in such a confrontation, the quick and informal confirmation that took place here was appropriate for the circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 7 (\"Here, the crime was very fresh, the police not suggestive, and had [the defendant] not been the assailant, [the victim] could easily have said so.\"). Fonseca's later views of the defendants undoubtedly reinforced his original impression, but they were chance encounters that had marginal significance given the identification at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p>Although our conclusion that no impermissibly suggestive procedures took place \"eliminates appellants' due process arguments\" <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 9, we note briefly that our review of the evidence assures us that Fonseca's in-court identification was reliable. The five factors to be considered in assessing reliability are \"(1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the defendant; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\" <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100 (citing <i>Neil,</i> 409 U.S. at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375).</p>\n<p>Here, Fonseca initially observed the defendants face-to-face, at a close distance, as they approached him. He testified that, during the robbery, he looked at them every time he had the chance and did so four or five times. His physical description of their appearance when he first saw them  including the wearing of a fisherman's cap and sunglasses  coincided with Dr. Loyola's observations. The details he recalled about the robbery, including that each had a gun, were consistent with the evidence that was later recovered in the bathroom from which the defendants exited. Although Fonseca's unquestionable nervousness caused him to fumble with the combination lock, his recollection of detail reflects attentiveness to his surroundings.</p>\n<p>None of this evidence, which was derived from Fonseca's experiences during and in the immediate aftermath of the robbery, could have been mistakenly based on his post-robbery exposures to the defendants. Moreover, both Fonseca and Martínez testified that when Fonseca first saw the defendants after the crime-an encounter we already have deemed permissible-his recognition of them was immediate. Given that reaction, we are confident that the subsequent encounters had little, if any, impact on the level of certainty of his in-court identification. Finally, as to the fifth factor, the length of time between the crime and the in-court identification, the six-month span here is de minimis compared to other cases. <i>Cf. </i><i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 101 (upholding in-court identification despite passage of two and one-half years after crime); <i>United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d 319, 331 (1st Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> 1995) (seven-year gap between crime and identification permissible where other factors were persuasive). In sum, \"we cannot say that under all the circumstances of this case there is a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Short of that point, such evidence is for the jury to weigh.\" <i>Manson v. Brathwaite,</i> 432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977), <i>quoted by </i><i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100. We therefore find no error in the district court's denial of the appellants' motion to suppress Fonseca's identification testimony.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>THE HOBBS ACT</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellants make two arguments related to the Hobbs Act.<sup>[5]</sup> First, they contend that their convictions on Counts One and Two must be reversed because the government failed to introduce sufficient evidence that their robbery of the lottery business affected interstate commerce within the meaning of the Hobbs Act. The evidence was insufficient, in their view, because the government failed to prove that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce.<sup>[6]</sup> Second, the appellants contend that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the Hobbs Act charge. Because neither of the appellants' preserved these claims below, we review both for plain error.<sup>[7]</sup><i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 524 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir.2008). Accordingly, appellants must show an error that was plain, (i.e., obvious and clear under current law), prejudicial (i.e., affected the outcome of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> district court proceedings), and that seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Sufficiency claim</h2>\n<p>To successfully prove the robbery violated the Hobbs Act, the government had to demonstrate that the robbery had an effect on interstate commerce. <i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 7. The effect need not be significant. It is well established that \"a de minimis interference with commerce is enough to sustain a Hobbs Act conviction.\" <i>United States v. Cruz-Arroyo,</i> 461 F.3d 69, 75 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[T]o prove a Hobbs Act violation, the government must show only that the . . . conduct created `a realistic probability of a <i>de minimis</i> effect on interstate commerce.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Butt,</i> 955 F.2d 77, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992)).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Where a business<sup>[9]</sup> has been robbed, the government may demonstrate the robbery affected interstate commerce by demonstrating that (1) the business engaged in interstate commerce, and (2) that the robbery either depleted the assets of the business, <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Casiano,</i> 425 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2005), or resulted in the business's temporary or permanent closure. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> 357 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2004) (expressing doubt \"that there is any serious claim of a constitutionally insufficient interstate commerce connection where a robbery directly results in the shutting down of an interstate business\"). Here, there is no dispute about the asset depletion or closure because the lottery business was robbed of nearly $9,000 and it remained closed on the day of the robbery. The focus, then, is on whether the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>Previously, we have held that a business is engaged in interstate commerce where the business purchased products from out-of-state. In <i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> we concluded that a gas station was involved in interstate commerce where, in the two months preceding robbery, the station had purchased a substantial amount of gasoline from outside of Puerto Rico. 435 F.3d at 8. In <i>United States v. Cruz-Arroyo</i><i>,</i> we concluded that the interstate commerce nexus was satisfied in an extortion case where money paid to the defendant was traceable to a Puerto Rico hospital that bought much of its equipment from the United States. 461 F.3d 69, 76 (1st Cir.2006). And finally, in <i>Capozzi</i> we concluded that evidence that a car dealer purchased vehicles from out of state was sufficient to establish the interstate commerce nexus. 347 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p>Other cases establish that where a business serves out-of-state customers, the business is engaged in interstate commerce. For example, in <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 218 F.3d 1243, 1244 (11th Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> 2000), the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the defendant's conviction under the Hobbs Act for robbing five motels. The Court noted that the evidence presented established that all of the motels robbed by the defendants registered guests from out-of-state and that at least four registered guests from outside the country. <i>Id.</i> at 1244. In holding that the robbery of the motels constituted a Hobbs Act violation, the court concluded that \"evidence that [motels] have at some point registered guests from out-of-state is sufficient to establish their connection to interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1245; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Pearson,</i> 508 F.2d 595, 596-97 (5th Cir.1975) (holding that the government's evidence, consisting of 1,000 guest registration cards from a large hotel, was sufficient to establish that the defendant robbed a hotel that was engaged in interstate commerce). And in <i>Capozzi,</i> we concluded that one of the robbery victims was engaged in an \"interstate drug business\" because he sold drugs repeatedly to out-of-state customers. 486 F.3d at 726.</p>\n<p>Here, the government introduced evidence that the lottery business purchased goods from out of state and that the business served tourists. The evidence with respect to the former consisted of both a stipulation and testimony from Muñiz. The stipulation established that the Muñiz Gallery used lottery machines that had been manufactured in Rhode Island. The stipulation provided:</p>\n<blockquote>That Mr. Pedro Zayas is the local representative of GTEC Corporation. Mr. Zayas would testify that, pursuant to a professional service agreement between the Department of the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and GTEC Latin American Corporation, which is a subsidiary of GTEC Corporation, a lottery terminal including of the type they usually use was installed at the business of Mr. Muñiz on October 11, 2004, so that he could sell online lottery, loteria electronica, out of that business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Mr. Zayas would also testify that this machine was manufactured in Rhode Island and from there was shipped to Puerto Rico for installation here.</blockquote>\n<p>Muñiz further testified that the lottery machines and \"all of the parts and cables and everything . . . they come from the States. . . . And the screens, the cables, the whole of the inside of the game, I bring it from outside.\"</p>\n<p>With respect to the lottery business's involvement in tourism, Muñiz testified that the lottery business' customers included tourists from outside of Puerto Rico.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Even if we were reviewing the appellants' sufficiency claim de novo,<sup>[11]</sup> which we are not, we would be hard pressed to find the evidence regarding the interstate commerce nexus insufficient to support the verdict. Both the stipulation and Muñiz's testimony established that the lottery machines put out of service by the robbery, as well as associated equipment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> were interstate purchases. <i>See </i><i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 8. In addition, Muñiz's testimony that he \"bring[s] [the equipment] from outside\" is sufficient to allow a jury to infer that he also purchased equipment ancillary to the machines in the past and could do so in the future. The jury's verdict also finds support in the fact that at least some lottery customers were from the United States. <i>See </i><i>Rodriguez,</i> 218 F.3d at 1244. In sum, given the evidence adduced at trial, the appellants' sufficiency claim cannot survive plain error review.</p>\n<p>The appellants, for their part, contend that the government failed to present sufficient evidence that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce. They appear to make two arguments.</p>\n<p>Their first argument is that the lottery business had to be \"regularly engaged in buying and selling products [ ] manufactured outside of Puerto Rico\" in order to be engaged in interstate commerce. In support of this argument, the appellants cite <i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 8 and <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 527 (1st Cir.2005). In those cases, the appellants maintain, the businesses at issue regularly bought and sold out-of-state goods. Although the appellants never make the point explicitly, they appear to suggest that the lottery business's purchase of machines from Rhode Island was a one-off event and that, as a result, the business was not \"regularly engaged in buying and selling products.\" There are at least two problems with this argument.</p>\n<p>First, even assuming that a business needs to be \"regularly engaged in buying and selling [out-of-state] products\" in order to be engaged in interstate commerce, the record can be fairly read to indicate that the lottery business was so engaged. As noted above, Muñiz testified that the lottery machines and \"all of the parts and cables and everything . . . they come from the States. . . . And the screens, the cables, the whole of the inside of the game, I bring it from outside.\" If we were to read this testimony as indicating that the lottery business only dealt in interstate products one time, we would effectively be viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants. <i>Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d at 19. It is well established, of course, that we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. A jury would need no special background knowledge or particular evidence to infer that machines, games, screens and cables become obsolete or are broken and must be replaced. The jury could have validly inferred  based on Muñiz's testimony  that the lottery business was regularly engaged in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>Second, the appellants' argument fails to address Muñiz's testimony that some of the lottery business's customers were from out-of-state. This evidence alone suffices to establish the requisite interstate commerce nexus. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Peterson,</i> 236 F.3d 848 (7th Cir.2001) (\"[T]ypically in Hobbs Act cases an owner or manager of the business establishment takes the stand to testify that the business robbed <i>either</i> served out-of-state customers <i>or</i> bought inventory manufactured out-of-state.\") (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The appellants say that it was the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury, not the lottery business, that was engaged in interstate commerce. The lottery business, they note, leased the machines from the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury.</p>\n<p>We are unpersuaded by this argument for two reasons. First, the argument proceeds on a faulty premise  that the lottery business' only connection to interstate commerce was the leasing of out-of-state machines from the Department of Treasury. As we have just noted, the lottery <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> business served out-of-state customers, specifically, tourists coming from the mainland United States.</p>\n<p>Second, a business may be engaged in interstate commerce indirectly. For example, if a business purchases its products from an in-state supplier who, in turn, purchases its products from out of state, that indirect link to interstate commerce suffices to establish that the business is engaged in interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zeigler,</i> 19 F.3d 486, 491 (10th Cir.1994) (\"[The business] purchased goods from an [in-state] distributor who, in turn purchased the goods it supplied to [the business] from outside the state. This indirect link to interstate commerce is sufficient to establish that [the business] was engaged in interstate commerce.\"). The reason why an indirect link may establish the requisite interstate nexus is that a crime that either closes or depletes the assets of a business indirectly engaged in interstate commerce could realistically affect interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Elias,</i> 285 F.3d 183, 189 (2d Cir.2002) (rejecting defendant's argument that the government was required to show that some of the products sold by the business were purchased directly from out-of-state suppliers and holding that \"a robbery of a local [business] may be said to affect interstate commerce if the robbery impairs the ability of the [business] to acquire  whether from out-of-state or in-state suppliers  goods originating out-of-state\"); <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 959 F.2d 63, 68 (6th Cir.1992) (\"Brown attempted to rob a tavern that . . . purchased goods from local distributors who in turn purchased goods from outside of the state. Had Brown's heist been successful, there is a realistic probability that the depletion of the bar's assets would have affected the amount of its purchases of beer having moved through interstate commerce.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Jury instruction claim</h2>\n<p>Next the appellants claim that the jury was improperly instructed on the Hobbs Act charge. They focus on one sentence within the judge's charge, which stated that in order to find defendants guilty, the jury had to find that \"the natural consequences\" of the defendants' acts \"would affect commerce in any way or in any degree.\" The appellants argue that the instruction improperly asked the jury to find whether their acts <i>would</i> affect commerce, as opposed to the correct formulation, which would have asked whether the acts <i>did</i> affect commerce. In the absence of an objection, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>In relevant part, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote>As I said before, it is against federal law to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce by committing robbery. For you to find the defendants guilty of this crime, you must be convinced that the government has proven each of the following things beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Fourth, that the robbery affected commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It is not necessary for you to find that the defendants knew or intended that their actions would affect commerce. It is only necessary that the natural consequences of the acts committed by the defendants as charged in the indictment would affect commerce in any way or any degree.</blockquote>\n<p>We reject the appellants' argument. Contrary to their assertion, the trial judge specifically <i>did</i> instruct the jury that it had to find \"that the robbery affected commerce.\" Additionally, the sentence targeted by appellants, when placed in its proper context, is a correct statement of the law, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> wherein the government is not required to prove that the defendants intended to affect commerce. <i>See </i><i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 9-10 (\"Jiménez may not have intended to cause these effects, but his intent is irrelevant to establish the commerce element of a Hobbs Act offense.\"). Our task is to review jury instructions as a whole, to determine if they adequately explain the law. <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Velez,</i> 466 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.2006). It is clear that this instruction is in accord with the law.<sup>[12]</sup> We therefore find no error in the instruction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>SENTENCING</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court sentenced the appellants on Counts One and Three to concurrent terms at the tops of their applicable Guidelines ranges  115 months for Rivera and 97 months for Sánchez. On Count Two, the court imposed the mandatory, consecutive sentence of twenty-five years required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(C)(I), which applies when a defendant charged with using a firearm during a violent felony has a previous conviction for such conduct. The indictment, however, charged a violation of § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), which mandates a <i>seven</i>-year consecutive minimum sentence and is applicable when a defendant \"brandishes\" a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime. The Presentence Investigation Reports (\"PSRs\") originally recommended the seven-year term, but, in response to a government objection, the PSRs were amended to take the 1998 bank robbery into account. The amended PSRs thus proposed the mandatory twenty-five year term for Count Two. At sentencing, as they do on appeal, the defendants objected to the change, asserting that the prior conviction should be viewed as an element of the § 924(c) violation and thus a fact the jury needed to find beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court rejected their argument, concluding that the twenty-five year term was a sentencing enhancement that properly could be imposed by the court.<sup>[13]</sup> In addition, the appellants argue that various Guidelines enhancements were impermissibly factored into the sentence on Counts One and Three based on facts not found by the jury, and that the district court failed to abide by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)'s call that a sentence must be \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to achieve the objectives of sentencing.</p>\n<p>We turn first to the 25-year consecutive sentence imposed on Count Two, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(C)(I), which mandates a minimum sentence of twenty five years \"[i]n the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection. . . .\" We agree with the district court's conclusion that this is a sentencing enhancement, rather than an element of the offense, and thus a jury determination on the \"second or subsequent conviction\" issue was not required. Although we have not passed on this particular subsection, we agree with the Second Circuit's conclusion that the fact of a prior conviction is not an element of § 924(c). <i>United States v. Mejia,</i> 545 F.3d 179, 207-08 (2d Cir. 2008) (<i>citing </i><i>United States v. Campbell,</i> 300 F.3d at 202, 212-13 (2d Cir.2002)).<sup>[14]</sup> We further note that this conclusion is in harmony with our construction of the mandatory minimum sentence provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), which is routinely considered an enhancement suitable for judicial determination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Diaz,</i> 519 F.3d 56, 66-67 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Lewis,</i> 406 F.3d 11, 21 n. 11 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>With that question resolved, the sentence at issue falls squarely within the realm of <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in which the Supreme Court held that prior convictions were not among the sentence-enhancers that must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Id.</i> at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <i>see also </i><i>Campbell,</i> 300 F.3d at 212-13. In so doing, the Court left undisturbed that portion of <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which treated prior convictions as sentencing factors, rather than offense elements. Although appellants point to Justice Thomas's concurring opinion in <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) that questioned the continuing viability of <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> \"[w]e have ruled with a regularity bordering on the monotonous, that given the explicit exception and force of <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> the rationale of <i>Apprendi</i> does not apply to sentence-enhancement provisions based upon prior criminal convictions.\" <i>United States v. Ivery,</i> 427 F.3d 69, 74-75 (1st Cir.2005)(internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the district court had before it the appellants' generalized stipulation that they had previously been convicted of a felony punishable by more than one year as well as the PSRs which specifically noted that the appellants had previously pled guilty to using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1). The appellants attempt to shrug off the yoke of <i>Apprendi, Almendarez-Torres,</i> and <i>Mejia</i> by arguing that <i>Shepard</i> limits the district court's consideration to a charging document, written plea agreement or plea colloquy. We disagree. <i>Shepard</i> involved a determination whether certain predicate offenses were \"crimes of violence,\" within the meaning of the ACCA. Given the factual inquiry involved, the Court limited the type of fact-finding that could be permissibly conducted by the trial judge. <i>Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> at 24-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Here, by contrast, the district court needed only to find that the prior convictions were under section 924(c), a fact which was both undisputed by the defendants<sup>[15]</sup> and readily apparent from the PSR. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> 510 F.3d 57, 74-75 (1st Cir.2007) (district court may not rely solely on factual assertions in PSR if defendant contests them). Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's application of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(C)(i) to Count Two.</p>\n<p>Finally, we address the appellants' contention that the district court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In sentencing appellants on Counts One and Three, which were properly grouped for sentencing, the district court was bound to employ the procedures we sketched out in <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514 (1st Cir.2006) by \"engag[ing] in a sequential determination of the guideline range, including any proposed departures, followed by the further determination whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\" <i>Id.</i> at 518-19. The court also must consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and ultimately explain the reasoning behind the sentence, even if the sentence is within the guideline range. <i>United States v. Turbides-Leonardo,</i> 468 F.3d 34, 40-41 (1st Cir.2006). We review the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v. Alli,</i> 444 F.3d 34, 37 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>With respect to Sánchez, the district court, following the PSR, started with a base offense level of 20. U.S. Sentencing Guideline Manual § 2B3.1 (2004). Upward adjustments were added for physical restraint of the victim (two points), making a death threat (two points), theft of a firearm (one point), and loss in excess of $10,000 (one point). The resulting adjusted offense level was 26. Sánchez was assigned three criminal history points for his prior conviction, two because the subject offense occurred while he was on parole, and one because it occurred less than two years after his release from prison. The six points placed Sánchez in Criminal History Category III, resulting in an advisory Guideline range of 78 to 97 months. The district court imposed a sentence at the top of that range, 97 months. Adding the 25-year consecutive sentence from Count Two, Sánchez's sentence totaled 397 months.</p>\n<p>Rivera's sentencing calculation was different in only one respect. His record included an additional conviction which led to seven criminal history points, placing him in Criminal History Category IV, and yielding a guideline range of 92 to 115 months. The court again chose the uppermost sentence within the range, which, when combined with the 25-year sentence on Count Two, yielded a sentence of 415 months.</p>\n<p>As the appellants advance identical arguments, we treat them together. First, relying on <i>Apprendi,</i> they argue that the enhancements to their respective base offense levels needed to be determined by a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt. We have previously held, however, that <i>Apprendi</i> does not prohibit a sentencing court from making factual findings that increase a defendant's sentence as long as the sentence imposed is within the default statutory maximum based on the jury's findings. <i>United States v. Butterworth,</i> 511 F.3d 71, 77 (1st Cir.200). Here, the statutory maximum sentences on Counts One and Three are 20 and 10 years, respectively. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) and 924(a)(2). Thus, the court properly considered these enhancements.</p>\n<p>Next the appellants each argue that the court erroneously concluded that there was a total loss in excess of $10,000, as required by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B3.1(b)(7) (2004). We disagree. In addition to the undisputed fact that $8700 was stolen from Muniz, testimony also supported the finding that a watch and gold key ring were taken, thus bringing the total loss to over $10,000. It is of no moment that the items were recovered and returned. <i>See Id.</i> § 2B3.1(7) (\"loss\" is defined as the value of the property <i>taken</i>); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Cruz-Santiago,</i> 12 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993) (in larceny case, finding that permanent and temporary takings are treated similarly for Guidelines purposes). Accordingly, we find that the one-point enhancement for a loss exceeding $10,000 was proper.</p>\n<p>The appellants' final argument is that the district court violated the principles of <i>Booker</i> by failing to consider the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and thus effectively treated the Guidelines as mandatory. Tied to this specific argument is their claim that their sentences  415 months for Rivera and 397 months for Sanchez  violated both section 3553(a)'s language that sentences be \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" and the \"ultimate requirement of reasonableness.\" <i>Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518. We disagree.</p>\n<p>We first note that the district court explicitly indicated that the Guidelines were advisory during each appellant's sentencing hearing. Next, as we have done in the past, we reject the appellants' argument that section 3553(a)'s \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" language is a mandate for leniency. This language \"is often cited by defendants as if it were an admonition to be lenient (and to explain a lack of leniency).\" <i>United States v. Navedo-Concepcion,</i> 450 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir. 2006). However, \"we do not think that the `not greater than necessary' language requires as a general matter that a judge, having explained why a sentence has been chosen, also explain why some lighter sentence is inadequate.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, the district judge explained that the Guideline portion of Sánchez's sentence was based in part on the fact that the instant crime was his second armed robbery, that it was committed while on supervised release, and that he has shown a violent and criminal behavior toward society while lacking respect for the criminal justice system. The trial court explained Rivera's sentence in similar terms.</p>\n<p>In our view, these explanations are sufficient to satisfy section 3553(a). This is not a situation where, for example, \"the district judge gave a one-sentence explanation\" of the sentence, without explaining the Guidelines calculations or referencing any evidence that influenced the decision. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir.2007) (remanding for re-sentencing due to district court's inadequate sentence explanation).<sup>[16]</sup> We find no sentencing error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The convictions and sentences are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\"Dissenting Opinion follows\"</h2>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that the evidence in this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> case was sufficient to allow the jury to find that appellants' robbery affected interstate commerce within the meaning of the Hobbs Act. The interstate commerce element of the statute serves the important function of establishing a federal interest in crimes that are typically the concern of state criminal law, and it is thus a critical component of a Hobbs Act violation. Although I recognize that \"a <i>de minimis</i> effect\" will suffice to meet the commerce element, <i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d 327, 335 (1st Cir.2003), the evidence here falls short of even that modest requirement. I therefore would reverse appellants' convictions on Counts One and Two.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the lottery business was impacted in ways that would establish an effect on interstate commerce <i>if</i> the business were regularly involved in such commerce. As the majority notes, the interstate commerce element of the Hobbs Act is often proven in a robbery case by showing that the crime depleted the assets of a business engaged in interstate commerce, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez-Casiano,</i> 425 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2005), or forced such a business to close, even temporarily, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> 357 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2004). Either of those situations potentially affects the company's ability to conduct business as usual, thereby \"creat[ing] `a realistic probability'\" of preventing transactions in interstate commerce. <i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 335 (\"[T]he government must show only that the . . . conduct created `a realistic probability of a <i>de minimis</i> effect on interstate commerce.'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Butt,</i> 955 F.2d 77, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992))); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 68 (1st Cir.2008). I thus agree with the majority that the lottery business's closure for a day and its loss of $9,000 would cause the kind of impact required by our cases.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> My problem is that the evidence did not show the necessary involvement by the business in interstate commerce. To be sure, Muñiz's enterprise used equipment  the lottery and gaming machines  that were manufactured outside Puerto Rico. Missing from the record, however, is any indication of future transactions in interstate commerce. There was no evidence that Muñiz purchased machines for the business regularly or planned to acquire one at any point in the foreseeable future.<sup>[19]</sup> Nor was there evidence that the business engaged in any other interstate transactions in the ordinary course of its business. Although it seems plausible that the paper used in printing lottery tickets might come from outside Puerto Rico and that the supply might need regular replenishing, or that Muñiz might have had a maintenance contract with the Rhode Island manufacturer to regularly service his machines, no evidence of such dealings was presented. Thus, the record lacks proof of <i>future</i> interstate purchasing by Muñiz's business on which the robbery could have had an impact.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority asserts that it is reasonable to infer that the lottery business was engaged in ongoing interstate commerce because \"[a] jury would need no special background knowledge or particular evidence to infer that machines, games, screens and cables become obsolete or are broken and must be replaced.\" It cites Muñiz's testimony that all of the equipment associated with the machines  \"the screens, the cables, the whole of the inside of the game\"  came from the United States mainland. But the Hobbs Act requires proof that this particular robbery potentially impeded the business's interstate dealings, <i>see </i><i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 336 (\"[T]he Hobbs Act `ensure[s], through case-by-case inquiry, that the [extortion or robbery] in question affects interstate commerce.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995)), and the possible purchase of replacement equipment at some undefined point in the future does not suffice to establish that nexus. Neither the business's closure for a day nor its loss of cash proceeds can reasonably be presumed to affect a transaction that may not occur for years.</p>\n<p>The majority contends that reading Muñiz's testimony to indicate that his business \"only dealt in interstate products one time\" would be to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> contrary to our obligation to view the testimony in the light most favorable to the verdict. I am not suggesting, however, that the jury could not reasonably infer that Muñiz <i>at some point</i> would make additional purchases of machines and parts, but only that the record contains no evidence of the frequency of such purchases or whether any such transaction was anticipated in reasonable proximity to the robbery. In the absence of such evidence, it would be rank speculation for the jury to find that this robbery had an impact on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>In relying on the lottery business's past acquisition of equipment, without any evidence of future purchases, the majority takes a significant step beyond the precedent it invokes. Implicit in the cases is a requirement that the victim company's interstate activity occur in the regular course of its business, such as when a firm's stock in trade is a product acquired from an out-of-state supplier or when, as in the case of a hotel, the business by its nature depends on out-of-state customers. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir.2006) (Puerto Rico gas station purchased gasoline from a refinery in the Virgin Islands); <i>Rodriguez-Casiano,</i> 425 F.3d at 14 (Puerto Rico businesses obtained much of their inventory from mainland suppliers); <i>United States v. Hemingway,</i> 108 Fed. App'x 83, 85 (4th Cir.2004) (noting that victim hotel was part of a national chain that received supplies from out-of-state and that most of the hotel's guests were from out-of-state); <i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 337 (car dealership that bought cars from out-of-state); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 218 F.3d 1243, 1244 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (robbery of motels); <i>United States v. Pearson,</i> 508 F.2d 595, 596-97 (5th Cir.1975) (per curiam) (robbery of a hotel). This requirement makes sense. Where the robbed establishment engages in interstate commerce on a regular basis, an interstate impact can be presumed from the mere fact that the crime occurred.</p>\n<p>Thus, the majority misses what I see as a clear distinction between businesses whose merchandise or supplies include products regularly obtained by means of interstate commerce, requiring repeated future transactions to replenish inventory, and businesses whose only connection with interstate commerce was the initial purchase of the materials or equipment needed to set up the company. A robbery of the latter type of business would potentially affect interstate commerce only coincidentally, i.e., if a purchase of replacement equipment happened to be imminent. When a business is involved in interstate commerce every day, however, there is a \"realistic probability\" that <i>any</i> depletion of assets or forced closure would have an effect on interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Hebert,</i> 131 F.3d 514, 523 n. 8 (5th Cir.1997) (\"[A] showing that the business regularly buys goods from out of state allows an inference that the robbery will impair a future purchase.\").</p>\n<p>The majority alternatively points to evidence that the lottery business served tourists from out-of-state, relying on cases involving motels and hotels to assert that evidence of past out-of-state customers is enough of a nexus to interstate commerce to satisfy the statutory requirement. The hotel context is not, however, equivalent to the circumstances in this case. The hotel industry focuses on attracting travelers from outside the local area, and out-of-state tourists routinely book hotel or motel accommodations from their home locations. In effect, out-of-state guests are part of the \"stock in trade\" of a hotel business, and many of those guests' interactions with the hotel can reasonably be presumed to occur across state lines. In addition, hotels routinely advertise their accommodations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> to residents of other states. Thus, when the evidence shows that a hotel serves out-of-state guests, a jury reasonably may infer that the business is engaged in activities that implicate interstate commerce on a regular basis, and there is a \"realistic probability\" that any depletion of its assets would affect that commerce.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>By contrast, there is no evidence in this case permitting an inference that Muñiz's sale of lottery tickets to tourists ordinarily involved interstate commerce, nor any evidence of \"`a realistic probability'\" that interstate commerce was affected by the robbery at issue here. <i>See </i><i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 335. A sale of locally produced merchandise (here, the lottery ticket) does not become an interstate transaction simply because the purchaser, who is buying locally, happens to hail from out-of-state.</p>\n<p>I recognize that, in enacting the Hobbs Act, Congress intended \"`to use all [its] constitutional power . . . to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery, or physical force.'\" <i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 7 (quoting <i>Stirone v. United States,</i> 361 U.S. 212, 215, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960)). At the same time, however, the Supreme Court's discussions of the Commerce Clause in <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), should give us pause before further expanding its reach into traditionally local concerns. Indeed, the Court in <i>Morrison</i> explicitly recognized the singular role of the states with respect to violent crime: \"[W]e can think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.\" <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 618, 120 S.Ct. 1740; <i>see also </i><i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 557, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (noting that \"the scope of the interstate commerce power `must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them . . . . would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>In <i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 335-36, we concluded that <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> did not invalidate the <i>de minimis</i> effect standard for Hobbs Act violations and replace it with a \"substantially affects\" test because  unlike the statutes at issue in those cases  the Hobbs Act includes a jurisdictional element that \"`ensure[s], through case-by-case inquiry, that the [extortion or robbery] in question affects interstate commerce.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 336 (quoting <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624). We observed that \"Congress' inclusion of a jurisdictional element in the Hobbs Act addresses the <i>Lopez</i> Court's constitutional concern that congressional authority under the Commerce Clause not become a `general police power of the sort retained by the States.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 567, 115 S.Ct. 1624).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*298</span> The Supreme Court arguably distinguished crimes with a jurisdictional element from the statutes it invalidated in <i>Lopez</i> and <i>Morrison</i> because the interstate commerce element ensures the presence of a federal interest  justifying federal prosecution  in offenses that otherwise replicate traditional state crimes. Although we concluded in <i>Capozzi</i> that the \"de minimis effect\" standard continues to be sufficient to identify the federal interest, that standard cannot be applied so loosely that the interstate commerce element no longer serves to distinguish between federal and state crimes. Otherwise, we risk turning every routine robbery into a federal offense. <i>See </i><i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 14-15 (Torruella, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>In my view, that is what the majority has done here with a de minimis effect analysis that reduces this concept to a meaningless verbal incantation. Indeed, virtually every business uses some item that was made in another state  perhaps a table or a rug or paint on the walls. If speculation about future replacement of such items suffices to establish the interstate commerce nexus, the Hobbs Act would embrace virtually all local robberies. Similarly, the happenstance that a tourist purchases locally produced merchandise does not transform that purchase into an interstate transaction. Otherwise, the robbery of a fruit peddler's stand that is patronized by tourists becomes a Hobbs Act violation. On the record before us, the majority's conclusion that the jury could find a nexus between the defendants' robbery and interstate commerce is an exercise in imagination that places this case beyond the outer boundaries of our prior precedent. I cannot agree to such an expansion of the law.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Hobbs Act provides that \"[w]hoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion. . . shall be fined . . . or imprisoned. . . .\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).</p>\n<p>[2]  Fonseca testified that Officer Martínez showed him the defendants and asked if \"these were the ones,\" while Martínez testified that he did not speak to Fonseca and that Fonseca, when he saw the defendants, volunteered that they \"`are the individuals that robbed me.'\"</p>\n<p>[3]  Defense counsel noted \"[T]he opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness' degree of attention, accuracy and level of certainty, et cetera, the length of time of the time of confrontation.. . .\"</p>\n<p>[4]  The defendants did not specifically object to the court's decision to instruct the jury, to the language of the instruction, or to testimony from Martínez and Fonseca about Fonseca's out-of-court recognition of them. Those particulars are thus not before us on appeal, nor have the appellants raised these issues on appeal.</p>\n<p>[5]  As noted earlier, Count One explicitly charged a Hobbs Act violation, while the firearms charge in Count Two is premised on the use of a firearm in connection with that crime. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (providing enhanced penalty when a firearm is used \"during and in relation to any crime of violence. . . for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States\").</p>\n<p>[6]  Arguably, the appellants have waived the argument that the government failed to produce sufficient evidence that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce. In their opening briefs, the appellants appear to concede that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce and focus instead on the prosecution's \"burden to prove the impact\" of the robbery on interstate commerce. The appellants both argue \"[u]nlike statutes that make it a federal offense to possess a[ ] weapon that has at one time traveled in interstate commerce, the Hobbs Act requires some proof of impact. It was totally lacking here.\" In their reply briefs, however, the appellants switch gears. That the robbery had a \"de minimis impact\" on interstate commerce, the appellants observe, \"is not in dispute here.\" Rather, the appellants contend that at issue \"is the adequacy of the proof that [the lottery business] was, in fact, engaged in interstate commerce, rather than the adequacy of the proof of impact.\"\n</p>\n<p>We have made clear that arguments that make their debut in a reply brief are deemed waived. <i>United States v. Vanvliet,</i> 542 F.3d 259, 264 (1st Cir.2008) (citing <i>United States v. Marti-Lon,</i> 524 F.3d 295, 299 n. 2 (1st Cir. 2008)). Nevertheless, because the waiver issue is a close one, we will address the appellants' argument on the merits.</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that although the appellants did move for a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 at the close of the government's case, neither did so on the basis that the government failed to present sufficient evidence that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce. Rather, counsel for the appellants contended that \"there is insufficient evidence for the robbery, [and] the firearm.\" <i>See </i><i>United States v. Upham,</i> 168 F.3d 532, 537 (1st Cir. 1999) (applying plain error standard or review because although \"[appellant] did move for a judgment of acquittal [he] did not raise this [particular] request or objection\"); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Pena-Lora,</i> 225 F.3d 17, 26 &amp; n. 5 (1st Cir.2000) (citing <i>United States v. Dandy,</i> 998 F.2d 1344, 1356-57 (6th Cir. 1993)). The district court denied the Rule 29 motion, commenting that \"[T]here is overwhelming evidence of the fact that this robbery took place as testified to by the witnesses.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  That such a minimal effect on interstate commerce implicates the Hobbs Act reflects the statute's broad sweep. Congress, in passing the Act, intended \"`to use all [its] constitutional power . . . to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery, or physical force.'\" <i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 7 (quoting <i>Stirone v. United States,</i> 361 U.S. 212, 215, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960)).</p>\n<p>[9]  We have noted that criminal acts directed at businesses have a more obvious effect on interstate commerce than criminal acts directed at individuals. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Casiano,</i> 425 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>United States v. McCormack,</i> 371 F.3d 22, 28-29 (1st Cir.2004)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Quigley,</i> 53 F.3d 909, 910 (8th Cir. 1995) (\"Actions normally have a lesser effect on interstate commerce when directed at individuals rather than businesses.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[10]  At trial, Muñiz was specifically asked, \"Do you ever receive clientele from outside of Puerto Rico?\" He responded: \"Yes, when tourists come. People who live in the United States and they know the business where the lottery tickets are sold, and they play in the gaming room.\"</p>\n<p>[11]  When reviewing a sufficiency claim de novo, \"we examine the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences drawn therefrom, would allow a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.\" <i>United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d 19, 26 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>[12]  While the instruction also follows verbatim the First Circuit's Pattern Jury Instructions, <i>See</i> First Circuit Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions § 4.16 (1998), these are only a guide, and not mandated by this court. <i>United States v. Tse,</i> 375 F.3d 148, 157-58 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>[13]  An extended colloquy took place at Rivera's sentencing concerning the need for the jury to hear evidence of the prior conviction with respect to both Count Three, the felon-in-possession charge, and to the harsher penalty on Count Two. The court noted that the defendants had stipulated to the fact of a prior conviction for purposes of Count Three. Rivera's counsel acknowledged the stipulation, but asserted that the fact of the stipulation was never presented to the jury, and the jury thus lacked evidence on a crucial element of the charge. The court, however, understood the stipulation to remove the prior conviction from the case, allowing the jury to decide only whether defendants had possessed firearms. If the jury found possession, the court's view was that the stipulation would kick in to complete the evidence necessary to support a guilty verdict on Count Three. With respect to the twenty-five year term imposed on Count Two  which was based on the same prior conviction  the court ultimately ruled that the penalty was \"an appropriate sentencing enhancement under the circumstances.\" Both appellants explicitly declaim any challenge to that portion of the sentence on Counts One and Three that resulted from the stipulation.</p>\n<p>[14]  In analyzing a provision relating to machine guns, § 924(c)(1)(B)(ii), we recently concluded that knowing possession of a machine gun is an element of the crime that must be proven to the jury. <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 542 F.3d 921 (1st Cir.2008). In this case, however, the appellants do not make any allegations regarding the possession of a machine gun. Rather they challenge the fact of a prior conviction, which as we further explain <i>infra,</i> the Supreme Court definitively has concluded is a sentencing enhancement that need not be proven to a jury. <i>See </i><i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p>[15]  The appellants disputed many aspects of the PSR, but neither one disputed that his predicate conviction was, in fact, for violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).</p>\n<p>[16]  We note that the trial court is not required to state the reasoning for imposing sentence at a particular point in the guideline range, as neither appellant's range exceeded 24 months. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c); <i>Navedo-Concepcion,</i> 450 F.3d at 56.</p>\n<p>[17]  As the majority notes, the defendants did not specifically refer to the interstate commerce element in making their Rule 29 motion. The district court did not give them the opportunity to do so. After the court ended a discussion concerning pretrial identification by saying that it would give the jury a specific instruction on identification procedures, the colloquy continued as follows:\n</p>\n<p>DEFENSE COUNSEL: Other than that, we pray the Court to grant a Rule 29 and enter a not guilty verdict on this particular case at this time, because I submit that there is insufficient evidence for the robbery, the firearm, and the fact </p>\n<p>COURT: I think there is overwhelming evidence of the fact that this robbery took place as testified to by the witnesses. Motion denied.</p>\n<p>OTHER DEFENSE COUNSEL: We adopt the motion.</p>\n<p>COURT: Anything else?</p>\n<p>GOVERNMENT: [returning to identification issue]</p>\n<p>In these circumstances, I would not apply plain error review. In any event, I believe the government's failure to prove the interstate commerce element constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p>[18]  The government has long prosecuted Hobbs Act cases in Puerto Rico assuming that it must prove an impact on <i>interstate</i> commerce rather than on commerce within the Commonwealth. In response to the panel's request for supplemental briefing, the government now argues that the interstate commerce requirement applies only to crimes that occur in the fifty states and not to those committed in other United States jurisdictions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Liburd,</i> 291 F.Supp.2d 383, 385-86 (D.Vi.2003) (holding the requirement inapplicable to territories or possessions). It relies on the Act's definition of \"commerce\" as including \"commerce within. . . any Territory or Possession of the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(3).\n</p>\n<p>However, as the government points out, even if the full panel agreed that it is unnecessary to prove an effect on interstate commerce for Hobbs Act violations in Puerto Rico, that construction of the statute would be inapplicable in this case because the charges were brought, and the jury was instructed, based on the interstate commerce requirement. <i>See </i><i>McCormick v. United States,</i> 500 U.S. 257, 270 n. 8, 111 S.Ct. 1807, 114 L.Ed.2d 307 (1991) (\"Appellate courts are not permitted to affirm convictions on any theory they please simply because the facts necessary to support the theory were presented to the jury.\"); <i>Chiarella v. United States,</i> 445 U.S. 222, 236, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980) (\"[W]e cannot affirm a criminal conviction on the basis of a theory not presented to the jury.\"). Thus, even if I accepted the government's new understanding of the Hobbs Act as it applies to Puerto Rico, it would not affect my view of the sufficiency of the evidence in this case. I therefore do not discuss the merits of that argument.</p>\n<p>[19]  Indeed, the evidence suggests that Muñiz did not even purchase the lottery machines himself, but obtained them from the Commonwealth's Department of the Treasury, which brought them to Puerto Rico through an arrangement with the manufacturer. Because I believe the interstate commerce element would not be satisfied even if Muñiz had purchased the machines himself, I need not dwell on this further complication.</p>\n<p>[20]  I note my agreement with the majority that the interstate commerce element would be satisfied if a business purchased its inventory from an in-state supplier that obtained the products from out of state. Such interstate activity, although indirect, is nonetheless ongoing, and a robbery of the business would have the same impact on the future purchase of out-of-state goods as it would if the products were purchased directly from an out-of-state source.</p>\n<p>[21]  The majority quotes the Eleventh Circuit's statement in <i>Rodriguez</i> that evidence that the victim motels had \"at some point\" registered out-of-state guests was enough to establish a connection to interstate commerce. I do not understand that decision to endorse a Hobbs Act conviction where the robbed business had only a past relationship with interstate commerce. Rather, the fact that the motel had previously served out-of-state guests allowed the inference that its customary operations included such customers. In other words, a jury reasonably could find based on its clientele that the motel was regularly engaged in transactions involving interstate commerce. <i>See also </i><i>Pearson,</i> 508 F.2d at 597 (noting that \"[t]he evidence established that this hotel entertained a large number of out of state visitors, thus establishing the required interstate nexus\").</p>\n\n</div>",

Rivera was sentenced to 415 months' imprisonment  more than 34 years  and Sánchez was sentenced to 397 months  just over 33 years. Both sentences included a mandatory minimum term of 25 years for the use of a firearm in relation to a violent federal felony after a previous conviction for the same offense. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(C)(i). By statute, the 25-year term was required to be imposed consecutively to any other sentence. The appellants challenge both their convictions and their sentences. They claim two trial errors: (1) the key witness's in-court identification was tainted by unnecessarily suggestive pretrial encounters, and (2) the government failed to meet its burden of proving that the robbery affected interstate commerce. They also assert multiple flaws in their sentencing, including that the court improperly imposed the 25-year mandatory minimum based on facts not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The facts of the robbery, as the jury could have found them, are as follows. Shortly after 8 a.m. on the morning of October 11, 2004, Carmelo Fonseca, the manager of the Muñiz Gallery, a small shopping mall in Caguas, opened both the front and rear entrances to the building, turned on the machines in the mall's game center, and started walking toward the office of the lottery ticket business run by the Gallery's owner, Félix Muñiz. At 8:20 a.m., before the mall was open for customers, two individuals entered the mall through the back entrance. They approached Fonseca and asked him where the lottery machines were located, and then each pulled out a gun. One of them \"loaded [his] pistol and charged it,\" and, after warning Fonseca \"not to act like some tough guy, that they would shoot [him],\" they directed Fonseca to take them to the lottery business office on the second floor. Although the men told Fonseca not to look at them, he testified that he did not comply and that \"every time I had a chance, I looked at them.\" Fonseca reported that one of the individuals was wearing a white shirt and the other wore a black shirt. On direct examination, Fonseca indicated that both men were wearing sunglasses and hats. On cross-examination, he testified that one of them was wearing dark glasses and the other was wearing a hat. One of the men was carrying a black plastic bag of the type used by retail stores.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, across the hallway from where the three men were having their initial conversation, Dr. Johanna Loyola, an optometrist who had just arrived at her office, noticed the young men with Fonseca and saw that one had a pistol. She immediately called 911 to report a robbery, describing the perpetrators as young men with dark glasses and caps, and also shouted to the mall's maintenance employee, María, to get help because Fonseca was being robbed. In her phone call to the police, Loyola stated that one of the men did not seem tall, but looked strong.</p>\n<p>María found a municipal police officer, Juan Soto, outside the mall. Soto went in through the back entrance, which he closed, proceeded to the front of the building, and padlocked the front door. He then called for backup. By this time, the two robbers had taken Fonseca upstairs, where he was forced to open the office safe. Because he was nervous, Fonseca made several attempts before he successfully <span class=\"star-pagination\">*281</span> opened the combination lock. The men then ordered him to get face down on the floor, and they tied his arms and legs with black ties taken from the black bag. They took a cash box containing $8,770 from the safe, and a gun and photographs from Muñiz's desk.</p>\n<p>Outside the building, Puerto Rico Police Department officers and municipal officers, including Soto and Caguas officer Eliseo Martínez, had gathered in response to Soto's request for backup and Loyola's call. Soto removed the padlock from the front door and prepared to enter the building. He and Martínez testified that they could see two individuals in the vicinity of Muñiz's office. One wore blue jeans and a white t-shirt, had on dark glasses and was carrying a black bag with shiny lettering; the other wore a black shirt and blue jeans and was holding a fisherman's cap in his right hand. Ignoring Soto's order to halt, the men walked to the end of the hallway, found the back door closed, and then walked back down the hallway trying the doors of the businesses they passed. None were open, and the pair went into the men's restroom at the end of the hall. As they entered the bathroom, they lifted their shirts, and Soto saw pistol butts in their waistbands. The two men  defendants Sánchez and Rivera  came out several minutes later, at which point Martínez arrested them.</p>\n<p>In a trash can in the bathroom, Soto found the black bag with the shiny letters, which contained some dollar bills; a metal box; the fisherman's cap he had seen one of the men holding; some black straps; and a .38-caliber revolver belonging to Muñiz. Soto also found two loaded pistols inside a towel dispenser.</p>\n<p>Fonseca was released by a municipal police officer and shortly thereafter saw Martínez escorting the defendants, in handcuffs, out of the building. Fonseca testified that he immediately recognized them as the robbers. He saw the defendants again about an hour later at the Caguas municipal police station, where he had gone to file charges. Fonseca testified that he happened to notice them as they walked back and forth inside a holding cell. On cross-examination, Fonseca stated that he also saw them in two locations at the courthouse where the defendants' preliminary hearing was held: in a cell at the district attorney's office and then \"standing in front of the judge.\" Soto testified that Fonseca also saw the defendants briefly as they were being moved from the police station to the patrol car to be transported to the courthouse.</p>\n<p>Charges originally were brought against Sánchez and Rivera under local law, but they were later dismissed and the men were charged in a three-count federal indictment. Count One alleged that the defendants aided and abetted each other in committing an armed robbery affecting interstate commerce in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) and 2. Count Two charged the use of a firearm in connection with the robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and 2. Count Three charged defendants with being felons-in-possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)and 924(a)(2), and alleged that they had been convicted in 1998 for an armed bank robbery.</p>\n<p>At trial, Fonseca was asked if the men who robbed him were in the courtroom, and he identified the defendants. When asked by the prosecutor and the court to explain the basis for his conclusion that these were the men, he said that he \"recognized them because they were the ones that robbed me.\" For purposes of Count Three, the felon-in-possession charge, the government and the defendants stipulated that Rivera and Sánchez had a triggering <span class=\"star-pagination\">*282</span> prior felony, and no evidence of the prior conviction was presented to the jury.</p>\n<p>At the end of the government's case, the defendants sought suppression of Fonseca's identification testimony on the ground that he had been exposed to unnecessarily suggestive pre-trial confrontations with the defendants. The court refused to suppress the statement identifying the defendants as the perpetrators, but agreed to give the jury a specific instruction on identification procedures. Defense counsel also moved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt. The court denied the motion, observing that \"there is overwhelming evidence of the fact that this robbery took place as testified to by the witnesses.\" The jury subsequently found both defendants guilty on all three counts.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the defendants renew their challenge to Fonseca's in-court identification and also seek reversal of their conviction on Count One, the Hobbs Act charge, on the ground that the government failed to present sufficient evidence that the robbery affected interstate commerce.<sup>[1]</sup> A reversal on Count One would require reversal on the Count Two firearms charge as well because proof of the Hobbs Act violation is an element of that offense. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

As described above, Fonseca came into contact with the defendants three or four times before the preliminary hearing that took place on the day of the robbery. It is undisputed that he saw them at the mall shortly after they were arrested and handcuffed, although the precise nature of that encounter was the subject of inconsistent testimony.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>There also is no dispute that the subsequent encounters were unplanned: first, at the Caguas police station, when the defendants were in a holding cell; next, according to Officer Soto, as the defendants were being transported in a police car to the courthouse; and, finally, in a holding cell near the district attorney's office at the courthouse.</p>\n<p>Although introduction of \"impermissibly suggestive\" identification evidence may violate the Due Process Clause, <i>see </i><i>Neil v.

In the end, we will affirm a district court's denial of a suppression motion if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it. <i>United States v. St. Pierre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202791\"><a href=\"/opinion/202791/united-states-v-st-pierre/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 79 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The identification issue first arose at the conclusion of Fonseca's testimony, during which defense counsel apparently learned for the first time that Fonseca had had four encounters with the defendants after the robbery. Counsel moved to suppress the identification. The court deferred ruling until after the government completed its case-in-chief, and when he restated the motion, counsel referred to the two-step inquiry set out above, recounted Fonseca's several encounters with the defendants on the day of the robbery, and argued that Fonseca's identification was unreliable because it lacked several indicia upon which courts usually rely.<sup>[3]</sup> The district court denied the motion, and instead announced its intention to specially instruct the jury on the identification issue.<sup>[4]</sup> The court later provided the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote>In any criminal case, the government must prove, of course, that the identity of the persons who committed the alleged crime, when a person's a defendant, as the person who committed the crime. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Again, I suggest that you ask yourself a number of questions: Did the witness have an adequate opportunity at the time of the crime to observe the person in question? What was the length of time that the person or the witness had to observe the persons involved? What were the prevailing conditions at the time in terms of visibility or distance and the like? Had the witnesses known or observed the person at earlier times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>You may also consider the circumstances surrounding any lack of identification, including, for example, the manner in which the defendant was presented to the witnesses for identification, and the length of time that elapsed between the incident in question and the witness' identification of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>After examining all the testimony and evidence in the case, if you have a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the defendant as the perpetrators of the offense charged, you must find the defendants not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p>Turning to the first step of our inquiry, we disagree with the appellants' assertion that an impermissibly suggestive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*284</span> episode occurred. The initial encounter at the mall was no more than a quick confirmation at the scene of the crime that the officers had detained the correct individuals. <i>See </i><i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 6 (\"Show-ups that take place immediately after the offense has been committed may be necessary in order to avoid the mistaken apprehension of the wrong person.\"). Whether Martínez asked for the confirmation or whether Fonseca volunteered that he recognized the defendants does not change the nature of that exchange. Although the appellants argue that the need for an on-the-scene identification is diminished when the police already have made their probable cause determination and arrested suspects, the appellants have also sought to cast doubt on their culpability by asserting that other individuals had the opportunity to enter the mall. Thus, notwithstanding any \"inherent element of suggestiveness\" in such a confrontation, the quick and informal confirmation that took place here was appropriate for the circumstances. <i>See </i><i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 7 (\"Here, the crime was very fresh, the police not suggestive, and had [the defendant] not been the assailant, [the victim] could easily have said so.\"). Fonseca's later views of the defendants undoubtedly reinforced his original impression, but they were chance encounters that had marginal significance given the identification at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p>Although our conclusion that no impermissibly suggestive procedures took place \"eliminates appellants' due process arguments\" <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 9, we note briefly that our review of the evidence assures us that Fonseca's in-court identification was reliable. The five factors to be considered in assessing reliability are \"(1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the defendant; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\" <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100 (citing <i>Neil,</i> 409 U.S. at 199-200, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108639\"><a href=\"/opinion/108639/neil-v-biggers/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>Here, Fonseca initially observed the defendants face-to-face, at a close distance, as they approached him. He testified that, during the robbery, he looked at them every time he had the chance and did so four or five times. His physical description of their appearance when he first saw them  including the wearing of a fisherman's cap and sunglasses  coincided with Dr. Loyola's observations. The details he recalled about the robbery, including that each had a gun, were consistent with the evidence that was later recovered in the bathroom from which the defendants exited. Although Fonseca's unquestionable nervousness caused him to fumble with the combination lock, his recollection of detail reflects attentiveness to his surroundings.</p>\n<p>None of this evidence, which was derived from Fonseca's experiences during and in the immediate aftermath of the robbery, could have been mistakenly based on his post-robbery exposures to the defendants. Moreover, both Fonseca and Martínez testified that when Fonseca first saw the defendants after the crime-an encounter we already have deemed permissible-his recognition of them was immediate. Given that reaction, we are confident that the subsequent encounters had little, if any, impact on the level of certainty of his in-court identification. Finally, as to the fifth factor, the length of time between the crime and the in-court identification, the six-month span here is de minimis compared to other cases. <i>Cf. </i><i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 101 (upholding in-court identification despite passage of two and one-half years after crime); <i>United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196112\"><a href=\"/opinion/196112/united-states-v-flores-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 331 (1st Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*285</span> 1995) (seven-year gap between crime and identification permissible where other factors were persuasive). In sum, \"we cannot say that under all the circumstances of this case there is a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Short of that point, such evidence is for the jury to weigh.\" <i>Manson v. Brathwaite,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109693\"><a href=\"/opinion/109693/manson-v-brathwaite/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 114, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109693\"><a href=\"/opinion/109693/manson-v-brathwaite/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span> (1977), <i>quoted by </i><i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 100. We therefore find no error in the district court's denial of the appellants' motion to suppress Fonseca's identification testimony.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>THE HOBBS ACT</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellants make two arguments related to the Hobbs Act.<sup>[5]</sup> First, they contend that their convictions on Counts One and Two must be reversed because the government failed to introduce sufficient evidence that their robbery of the lottery business affected interstate commerce within the meaning of the Hobbs Act. The evidence was insufficient, in their view, because the government failed to prove that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce.<sup>[6]</sup> Second, the appellants contend that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the Hobbs Act charge. Because neither of the appellants' preserved these claims below, we review both for plain error.<sup>[7]</sup><i>United States v. Griffin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203299\"><a href=\"/opinion/203299/united-states-v-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2008). Accordingly, appellants must show an error that was plain, (i.e., obvious and clear under current law), prejudicial (i.e., affected the outcome of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*286</span> district court proceedings), and that seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Sufficiency claim</h2>\n<p>To successfully prove the robbery violated the Hobbs Act, the government had to demonstrate that the robbery had an effect on interstate commerce. <i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 7. The effect need not be significant. It is well established that \"a de minimis interference with commerce is enough to sustain a Hobbs Act conviction.\" <i>United States v. Cruz-Arroyo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202375\"><a href=\"/opinion/202375/united-states-v-cruz-arroyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2007); <i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200671\"><a href=\"/opinion/200671/united-states-v-capozzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 335 (1st Cir.2003) (\"[T]o prove a Hobbs Act violation, the government must show only that the . . . conduct created `a realistic probability of a <i>de minimis</i> effect on interstate commerce.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Butt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577004\"><a href=\"/opinion/577004/united-states-v-herbert-alan-butt-aka-alan-butt-united-states-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992)).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Where a business<sup>[9]</sup> has been robbed, the government may demonstrate the robbery affected interstate commerce by demonstrating that (1) the business engaged in interstate commerce, and (2) that the robbery either depleted the assets of the business, <i>United States v. Rodríguez-Casiano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201838\"><a href=\"/opinion/201838/united-states-v-rodriguez-casiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2005), or resulted in the business's temporary or permanent closure. <i>United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200821\"><a href=\"/opinion/200821/united-states-v-cruz-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir. 2004) (expressing doubt \"that there is any serious claim of a constitutionally insufficient interstate commerce connection where a robbery directly results in the shutting down of an interstate business\"). Here, there is no dispute about the asset depletion or closure because the lottery business was robbed of nearly $9,000 and it remained closed on the day of the robbery. The focus, then, is on whether the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>Previously, we have held that a business is engaged in interstate commerce where the business purchased products from out-of-state. In <i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> we concluded that a gas station was involved in interstate commerce where, in the two months preceding robbery, the station had purchased a substantial amount of gasoline from outside of Puerto Rico. 435 F.3d at 8. In <i>United States v. Cruz-Arroyo</i><i>,</i> we concluded that the interstate commerce nexus was satisfied in an extortion case where money paid to the defendant was traceable to a Puerto Rico hospital that bought much of its equipment from the United States. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202375\"><a href=\"/opinion/202375/united-states-v-cruz-arroyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2006). And finally, in <i>Capozzi</i> we concluded that evidence that a car dealer purchased vehicles from out of state was sufficient to establish the interstate commerce nexus. 347 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p>Other cases establish that where a business serves out-of-state customers, the business is engaged in interstate commerce. For example, in <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74674\"><a href=\"/opinion/74674/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span>, 1244 (11th Cir. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*287</span> 2000), the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the defendant's conviction under the Hobbs Act for robbing five motels. The Court noted that the evidence presented established that all of the motels robbed by the defendants registered guests from out-of-state and that at least four registered guests from outside the country. <i>Id.</i> at 1244. In holding that the robbery of the motels constituted a Hobbs Act violation, the court concluded that \"evidence that [motels] have at some point registered guests from out-of-state is sufficient to establish their connection to interstate commerce.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1245; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Pearson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"324096\"><a href=\"/opinion/324096/united-states-v-richard-duncan-pearson/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span>, 596-97 (5th Cir.1975) (holding that the government's evidence, consisting of 1,000 guest registration cards from a large hotel, was sufficient to establish that the defendant robbed a hotel that was engaged in interstate commerce). And in <i>Capozzi,</i> we concluded that one of the robbery victims was engaged in an \"interstate drug business\" because he sold drugs repeatedly to out-of-state customers. 486 F.3d at 726.</p>\n<p>Here, the government introduced evidence that the lottery business purchased goods from out of state and that the business served tourists. The evidence with respect to the former consisted of both a stipulation and testimony from Muñiz. The stipulation established that the Muñiz Gallery used lottery machines that had been manufactured in Rhode Island. The stipulation provided:</p>\n<blockquote>That Mr. Pedro Zayas is the local representative of GTEC Corporation. Mr. Zayas would testify that, pursuant to a professional service agreement between the Department of the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and GTEC Latin American Corporation, which is a subsidiary of GTEC Corporation, a lottery terminal including of the type they usually use was installed at the business of Mr. Muñiz on October 11, 2004, so that he could sell online lottery, loteria electronica, out of that business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Mr. Zayas would also testify that this machine was manufactured in Rhode Island and from there was shipped to Puerto Rico for installation here.</blockquote>\n<p>Muñiz further testified that the lottery machines and \"all of the parts and cables and everything . . . they come from the States. . . . And the screens, the cables, the whole of the inside of the game, I bring it from outside.\"</p>\n<p>With respect to the lottery business's involvement in tourism, Muñiz testified that the lottery business' customers included tourists from outside of Puerto Rico.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>Even if we were reviewing the appellants' sufficiency claim de novo,<sup>[11]</sup> which we are not, we would be hard pressed to find the evidence regarding the interstate commerce nexus insufficient to support the verdict. Both the stipulation and Muñiz's testimony established that the lottery machines put out of service by the robbery, as well as associated equipment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*288</span> were interstate purchases. <i>See </i><i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 8. In addition, Muñiz's testimony that he \"bring[s] [the equipment] from outside\" is sufficient to allow a jury to infer that he also purchased equipment ancillary to the machines in the past and could do so in the future. The jury's verdict also finds support in the fact that at least some lottery customers were from the United States. <i>See </i><i>Rodriguez,</i> 218 F.3d at 1244. In sum, given the evidence adduced at trial, the appellants' sufficiency claim cannot survive plain error review.</p>\n<p>The appellants, for their part, contend that the government failed to present sufficient evidence that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce. They appear to make two arguments.</p>\n<p>Their first argument is that the lottery business had to be \"regularly engaged in buying and selling products [ ] manufactured outside of Puerto Rico\" in order to be engaged in interstate commerce. In support of this argument, the appellants cite <i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 8 and <i>United States v. Vega Molina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201589\"><a href=\"/opinion/201589/united-states-v-vega-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 527 (1st Cir.2005). In those cases, the appellants maintain, the businesses at issue regularly bought and sold out-of-state goods. Although the appellants never make the point explicitly, they appear to suggest that the lottery business's purchase of machines from Rhode Island was a one-off event and that, as a result, the business was not \"regularly engaged in buying and selling products.\" There are at least two problems with this argument.</p>\n<p>First, even assuming that a business needs to be \"regularly engaged in buying and selling [out-of-state] products\" in order to be engaged in interstate commerce, the record can be fairly read to indicate that the lottery business was so engaged. As noted above, Muñiz testified that the lottery machines and \"all of the parts and cables and everything . . . they come from the States. . . . And the screens, the cables, the whole of the inside of the game, I bring it from outside.\" If we were to read this testimony as indicating that the lottery business only dealt in interstate products one time, we would effectively be viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants. <i>Cruz-Rodriguez,</i> 541 F.3d at 19. It is well established, of course, that we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. A jury would need no special background knowledge or particular evidence to infer that machines, games, screens and cables become obsolete or are broken and must be replaced. The jury could have validly inferred  based on Muñiz's testimony  that the lottery business was regularly engaged in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>Second, the appellants' argument fails to address Muñiz's testimony that some of the lottery business's customers were from out-of-state. This evidence alone suffices to establish the requisite interstate commerce nexus. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Peterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771634\"><a href=\"/opinion/771634/united-states-v-george-peterson-and-pedro-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span> (7th Cir.2001) (\"[T]ypically in Hobbs Act cases an owner or manager of the business establishment takes the stand to testify that the business robbed <i>either</i> served out-of-state customers <i>or</i> bought inventory manufactured out-of-state.\") (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The appellants say that it was the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury, not the lottery business, that was engaged in interstate commerce. The lottery business, they note, leased the machines from the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury.</p>\n<p>We are unpersuaded by this argument for two reasons. First, the argument proceeds on a faulty premise  that the lottery business' only connection to interstate commerce was the leasing of out-of-state machines from the Department of Treasury. As we have just noted, the lottery <span class=\"star-pagination\">*289</span> business served out-of-state customers, specifically, tourists coming from the mainland United States.</p>\n<p>Second, a business may be engaged in interstate commerce indirectly. For example, if a business purchases its products from an in-state supplier who, in turn, purchases its products from out of state, that indirect link to interstate commerce suffices to establish that the business is engaged in interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zeigler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"665857\"><a href=\"/opinion/665857/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-chester/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span>, 491 (10th Cir.1994) (\"[The business] purchased goods from an [in-state] distributor who, in turn purchased the goods it supplied to [the business] from outside the state. This indirect link to interstate commerce is sufficient to establish that [the business] was engaged in interstate commerce.\"). The reason why an indirect link may establish the requisite interstate nexus is that a crime that either closes or depletes the assets of a business indirectly engaged in interstate commerce could realistically affect interstate commerce. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Elias,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777089\"><a href=\"/opinion/777089/united-states-v-alex-elias-also-known-as-puff-luis-otero-also-known-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 189 (2d Cir.2002) (rejecting defendant's argument that the government was required to show that some of the products sold by the business were purchased directly from out-of-state suppliers and holding that \"a robbery of a local [business] may be said to affect interstate commerce if the robbery impairs the ability of the [business] to acquire  whether from out-of-state or in-state suppliers  goods originating out-of-state\"); <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579496\"><a href=\"/opinion/579496/united-states-v-ronald-s-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 68 (6th Cir.1992) (\"Brown attempted to rob a tavern that . . . purchased goods from local distributors who in turn purchased goods from outside of the state. Had Brown's heist been successful, there is a realistic probability that the depletion of the bar's assets would have affected the amount of its purchases of beer having moved through interstate commerce.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Jury instruction claim</h2>\n<p>Next the appellants claim that the jury was improperly instructed on the Hobbs Act charge. They focus on one sentence within the judge's charge, which stated that in order to find defendants guilty, the jury had to find that \"the natural consequences\" of the defendants' acts \"would affect commerce in any way or in any degree.\" The appellants argue that the instruction improperly asked the jury to find whether their acts <i>would</i> affect commerce, as opposed to the correct formulation, which would have asked whether the acts <i>did</i> affect commerce. In the absence of an objection, we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773399\"><a href=\"/opinion/773399/united-states-v-daniel-paniagua-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span>, 246 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>In relevant part, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote>As I said before, it is against federal law to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce by committing robbery. For you to find the defendants guilty of this crime, you must be convinced that the government has proven each of the following things beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Fourth, that the robbery affected commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>It is not necessary for you to find that the defendants knew or intended that their actions would affect commerce. It is only necessary that the natural consequences of the acts committed by the defendants as charged in the indictment would affect commerce in any way or any degree.</blockquote>\n<p>We reject the appellants' argument. Contrary to their assertion, the trial judge specifically <i>did</i> instruct the jury that it had to find \"that the robbery affected commerce.\" Additionally, the sentence targeted by appellants, when placed in its proper context, is a correct statement of the law, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*290</span> wherein the government is not required to prove that the defendants intended to affect commerce. <i>See </i><i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 9-10 (\"Jiménez may not have intended to cause these effects, but his intent is irrelevant to establish the commerce element of a Hobbs Act offense.\"). Our task is to review jury instructions as a whole, to determine if they adequately explain the law. <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Velez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2006). It is clear that this instruction is in accord with the law.<sup>[12]</sup> We therefore find no error in the instruction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. <i>SENTENCING</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court sentenced the appellants on Counts One and Three to concurrent terms at the tops of their applicable Guidelines ranges  115 months for Rivera and 97 months for Sánchez. On Count Two, the court imposed the mandatory, consecutive sentence of twenty-five years required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(C)(I), which applies when a defendant charged with using a firearm during a violent felony has a previous conviction for such conduct. The indictment, however, charged a violation of § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), which mandates a <i>seven</i>-year consecutive minimum sentence and is applicable when a defendant \"brandishes\" a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime. The Presentence Investigation Reports (\"PSRs\") originally recommended the seven-year term, but, in response to a government objection, the PSRs were amended to take the 1998 bank robbery into account. The amended PSRs thus proposed the mandatory twenty-five year term for Count Two. At sentencing, as they do on appeal, the defendants objected to the change, asserting that the prior conviction should be viewed as an element of the § 924(c) violation and thus a fact the jury needed to find beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court rejected their argument, concluding that the twenty-five year term was a sentencing enhancement that properly could be imposed by the court.<sup>[13]</sup> In addition, the appellants argue that various Guidelines enhancements were impermissibly factored into the sentence on Counts One and Three based on facts not found by the jury, and that the district court failed to abide by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)'s call that a sentence must be \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" to achieve the objectives of sentencing.</p>\n<p>We turn first to the 25-year consecutive sentence imposed on Count Two, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*291</span> pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(C)(I), which mandates a minimum sentence of twenty five years \"[i]n the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection. . . .\" We agree with the district court's conclusion that this is a sentencing enhancement, rather than an element of the offense, and thus a jury determination on the \"second or subsequent conviction\" issue was not required. Although we have not passed on this particular subsection, we agree with the Second Circuit's conclusion that the fact of a prior conviction is not an element of § 924(c). <i>United States v. Mejia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195793\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195793/united-states-v-mejia/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span>, 207-08 (2d Cir. 2008) (<i>citing </i><i>United States v. Campbell,</i> 300 F.3d at 202, 212-13 (2d Cir.2002)).<sup>[14]</sup> We further note that this conclusion is in harmony with our construction of the mandatory minimum sentence provision of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), which is routinely considered an enhancement suitable for judicial determination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v.

The appellants attempt to shrug off the yoke of <i>Apprendi, Almendarez-Torres,</i> and <i>Mejia</i> by arguing that <i>Shepard</i> limits the district court's consideration to a charging document, written plea agreement or plea colloquy. We disagree. <i>Shepard</i> involved a determination whether certain predicate offenses were \"crimes of violence,\" within the meaning of the ACCA. Given the factual inquiry involved, the Court limited the type of fact-finding that could be permissibly conducted by the trial judge. <i>Shepard,</i> 544 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*292</span> at 24-26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span>. Here, by contrast, the district court needed only to find that the prior convictions were under section 924(c), a fact which was both undisputed by the defendants<sup>[15]</sup> and readily apparent from the PSR. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203058\"><a href=\"/opinion/203058/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 74-75 (1st Cir.2007) (district court may not rely solely on factual assertions in PSR if defendant contests them). Accordingly, we find no error in the district court's application of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(C)(i) to Count Two.</p>\n<p>Finally, we address the appellants' contention that the district court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In sentencing appellants on Counts One and Three, which were properly grouped for sentencing, the district court was bound to employ the procedures we sketched out in <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202092\"><a href=\"/opinion/202092/united-states-v-jimenez-beltre/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006) by \"engag[ing] in a sequential determination of the guideline range, including any proposed departures, followed by the further determination whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.\" <i>Id.</i> at 518-19. The court also must consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and ultimately explain the reasoning behind the sentence, even if the sentence is within the guideline range. <i>United States v. Turbides-Leonardo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202495\"><a href=\"/opinion/202495/united-states-v-turbides-leonardo/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 40-41 (1st Cir.2006). We review the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v. Alli,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202173\"><a href=\"/opinion/202173/united-states-v-alli/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>With respect to Sánchez, the district court, following the PSR, started with a base offense level of 20. U.S. Sentencing Guideline Manual § 2B3.1 (2004). Upward adjustments were added for physical restraint of the victim (two points), making a death threat (two points), theft of a firearm (one point), and loss in excess of $10,000 (one point). The resulting adjusted offense level was 26. Sánchez was assigned three criminal history points for his prior conviction, two because the subject offense occurred while he was on parole, and one because it occurred less than two years after his release from prison. The six points placed Sánchez in Criminal History Category III, resulting in an advisory Guideline range of 78 to 97 months. The district court imposed a sentence at the top of that range, 97 months. Adding the 25-year consecutive sentence from Count Two, Sánchez's sentence totaled 397 months.</p>\n<p>Rivera's sentencing calculation was different in only one respect. His record included an additional conviction which led to seven criminal history points, placing him in Criminal History Category IV, and yielding a guideline range of 92 to 115 months. The court again chose the uppermost sentence within the range, which, when combined with the 25-year sentence on Count Two, yielded a sentence of 415 months.</p>\n<p>As the appellants advance identical arguments, we treat them together. First, relying on <i>Apprendi,</i> they argue that the enhancements to their respective base offense levels needed to be determined by a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt. We have previously held, however, that <i>Apprendi</i> does not prohibit a sentencing court from making factual findings that increase a defendant's sentence as long as the sentence imposed is within the default statutory maximum based on the jury's findings. <i>United States v. Butterworth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203082\"><a href=\"/opinion/203082/united-states-v-butterworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.200). Here, the statutory maximum sentences on Counts One and Three are 20 and 10 years, respectively. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*293</span> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) and 924(a)(2). Thus, the court properly considered these enhancements.</p>\n<p>Next the appellants each argue that the court erroneously concluded that there was a total loss in excess of $10,000, as required by U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2B3.1(b)(7) (2004). We disagree. In addition to the undisputed fact that $8700 was stolen from Muniz, testimony also supported the finding that a watch and gold key ring were taken, thus bringing the total loss to over $10,000. It is of no moment that the items were recovered and returned. <i>See Id.</i> § 2B3.1(7) (\"loss\" is defined as the value of the property <i>taken</i>); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Cruz-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195101\"><a href=\"/opinion/195101/united-states-v-cruz-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1993) (in larceny case, finding that permanent and temporary takings are treated similarly for Guidelines purposes). Accordingly, we find that the one-point enhancement for a loss exceeding $10,000 was proper.</p>\n<p>The appellants' final argument is that the district court violated the principles of <i>Booker</i> by failing to consider the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and thus effectively treated the Guidelines as mandatory. Tied to this specific argument is their claim that their sentences  415 months for Rivera and 397 months for Sanchez  violated both section 3553(a)'s language that sentences be \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" and the \"ultimate requirement of reasonableness.\" <i>Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d at 518. We disagree.</p>\n<p>We first note that the district court explicitly indicated that the Guidelines were advisory during each appellant's sentencing hearing. Next, as we have done in the past, we reject the appellants' argument that section 3553(a)'s \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" language is a mandate for leniency. This language \"is often cited by defendants as if it were an admonition to be lenient (and to explain a lack of leniency).\" <i>United States v. Navedo-Concepcion,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202256\"><a href=\"/opinion/202256/united-states-v-navedo-concepcion/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir. 2006). However, \"we do not think that the `not greater than necessary' language requires as a general matter that a judge, having explained why a sentence has been chosen, also explain why some lighter sentence is inadequate.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, the district judge explained that the Guideline portion of Sánchez's sentence was based in part on the fact that the instant crime was his second armed robbery, that it was committed while on supervised release, and that he has shown a violent and criminal behavior toward society while lacking respect for the criminal justice system. The trial court explained Rivera's sentence in similar terms.</p>\n<p>In our view, these explanations are sufficient to satisfy section 3553(a). This is not a situation where, for example, \"the district judge gave a one-sentence explanation\" of the sentence, without explaining the Guidelines calculations or referencing any evidence that influenced the decision. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202688\"><a href=\"/opinion/202688/united-states-v-garcia-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir.2007) (remanding for re-sentencing due to district court's inadequate sentence explanation).<sup>[16]</sup> We find no sentencing error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The convictions and sentences are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\"Dissenting Opinion follows\"</h2>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I respectfully disagree with the majority's conclusion that the evidence in this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*294</span> case was sufficient to allow the jury to find that appellants' robbery affected interstate commerce within the meaning of the Hobbs Act. The interstate commerce element of the statute serves the important function of establishing a federal interest in crimes that are typically the concern of state criminal law, and it is thus a critical component of a Hobbs Act violation. Although I recognize that \"a <i>de minimis</i> effect\" will suffice to meet the commerce element, <i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200671\"><a href=\"/opinion/200671/united-states-v-capozzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 335 (1st Cir.2003), the evidence here falls short of even that modest requirement. I therefore would reverse appellants' convictions on Counts One and Two.<sup>[17]</sup></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the lottery business was impacted in ways that would establish an effect on interstate commerce <i>if</i> the business were regularly involved in such commerce. As the majority notes, the interstate commerce element of the Hobbs Act is often proven in a robbery case by showing that the crime depleted the assets of a business engaged in interstate commerce, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Rodríguez-Casiano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201838\"><a href=\"/opinion/201838/united-states-v-rodriguez-casiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir. 2005), or forced such a business to close, even temporarily, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Cruz-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200821\"><a href=\"/opinion/200821/united-states-v-cruz-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir. 2004). Either of those situations potentially affects the company's ability to conduct business as usual, thereby \"creat[ing] `a realistic probability'\" of preventing transactions in interstate commerce. <i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 335 (\"[T]he government must show only that the . . . conduct created `a realistic probability of a <i>de minimis</i> effect on interstate commerce.'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Butt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577004\"><a href=\"/opinion/577004/united-states-v-herbert-alan-butt-aka-alan-butt-united-states-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 80 n. 2 (1st Cir.1992))); <i>see also </i><i>United States v.

I thus agree with the majority that the lottery business's closure for a day and its loss of $9,000 would cause the kind of impact required by our cases.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*295</span> My problem is that the evidence did not show the necessary involvement by the business in interstate commerce. To be sure, Muñiz's enterprise used equipment  the lottery and gaming machines  that were manufactured outside Puerto Rico. Missing from the record, however, is any indication of future transactions in interstate commerce. There was no evidence that Muñiz purchased machines for the business regularly or planned to acquire one at any point in the foreseeable future.<sup>[19]</sup> Nor was there evidence that the business engaged in any other interstate transactions in the ordinary course of its business. Although it seems plausible that the paper used in printing lottery tickets might come from outside Puerto Rico and that the supply might need regular replenishing, or that Muñiz might have had a maintenance contract with the Rhode Island manufacturer to regularly service his machines, no evidence of such dealings was presented. Thus, the record lacks proof of <i>future</i> interstate purchasing by Muñiz's business on which the robbery could have had an impact.<sup>[20]</sup></p>\n<p>The majority asserts that it is reasonable to infer that the lottery business was engaged in ongoing interstate commerce because \"[a] jury would need no special background knowledge or particular evidence to infer that machines, games, screens and cables become obsolete or are broken and must be replaced.\" It cites Muñiz's testimony that all of the equipment associated with the machines  \"the screens, the cables, the whole of the inside of the game\"  came from the United States mainland. But the Hobbs Act requires proof that this particular robbery potentially impeded the business's interstate dealings, <i>see </i><i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 336 (\"[T]he Hobbs Act `ensure[s], through case-by-case inquiry, that the [extortion or robbery] in question affects interstate commerce.'\") (quoting <i>United States v.

Neither the business's closure for a day nor its loss of cash proceeds can reasonably be presumed to affect a transaction that may not occur for years.</p>\n<p>The majority contends that reading Muñiz's testimony to indicate that his business \"only dealt in interstate products one time\" would be to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendants, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*296</span> contrary to our obligation to view the testimony in the light most favorable to the verdict. I am not suggesting, however, that the jury could not reasonably infer that Muñiz <i>at some point</i> would make additional purchases of machines and parts, but only that the record contains no evidence of the frequency of such purchases or whether any such transaction was anticipated in reasonable proximity to the robbery. In the absence of such evidence, it would be rank speculation for the jury to find that this robbery had an impact on interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>In relying on the lottery business's past acquisition of equipment, without any evidence of future purchases, the majority takes a significant step beyond the precedent it invokes. Implicit in the cases is a requirement that the victim company's interstate activity occur in the regular course of its business, such as when a firm's stock in trade is a product acquired from an out-of-state supplier or when, as in the case of a hotel, the business by its nature depends on out-of-state customers. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Jiménez-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202004\"><a href=\"/opinion/202004/united-states-v-jimenez-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2006) (Puerto Rico gas station purchased gasoline from a refinery in the Virgin Islands); <i>Rodriguez-Casiano,</i> 425 F.3d at 14 (Puerto Rico businesses obtained much of their inventory from mainland suppliers); <i>United States v. Hemingway,</i> 108 Fed. App'x 83, 85 (4th Cir.2004) (noting that victim hotel was part of a national chain that received supplies from out-of-state and that most of the hotel's guests were from out-of-state); <i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 337 (car dealership that bought cars from out-of-state); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74674\"><a href=\"/opinion/74674/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span>, 1244 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (robbery of motels); <i>United States v.

This requirement makes sense. Where the robbed establishment engages in interstate commerce on a regular basis, an interstate impact can be presumed from the mere fact that the crime occurred.</p>\n<p>Thus, the majority misses what I see as a clear distinction between businesses whose merchandise or supplies include products regularly obtained by means of interstate commerce, requiring repeated future transactions to replenish inventory, and businesses whose only connection with interstate commerce was the initial purchase of the materials or equipment needed to set up the company. A robbery of the latter type of business would potentially affect interstate commerce only coincidentally, i.e., if a purchase of replacement equipment happened to be imminent. When a business is involved in interstate commerce every day, however, there is a \"realistic probability\" that <i>any</i> depletion of assets or forced closure would have an effect on interstate commerce. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Hebert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"13572\"><a href=\"/opinion/13572/united-states-v-hebert/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 523 n. 8 (5th Cir.1997) (\"[A] showing that the business regularly buys goods from out of state allows an inference that the robbery will impair a future purchase.\").</p>\n<p>The majority alternatively points to evidence that the lottery business served tourists from out-of-state, relying on cases involving motels and hotels to assert that evidence of past out-of-state customers is enough of a nexus to interstate commerce to satisfy the statutory requirement. The hotel context is not, however, equivalent to the circumstances in this case. The hotel industry focuses on attracting travelers from outside the local area, and out-of-state tourists routinely book hotel or motel accommodations from their home locations. In effect, out-of-state guests are part of the \"stock in trade\" of a hotel business, and many of those guests' interactions with the hotel can reasonably be presumed to occur across state lines. In addition, hotels routinely advertise their accommodations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*297</span> to residents of other states. Thus, when the evidence shows that a hotel serves out-of-state guests, a jury reasonably may infer that the business is engaged in activities that implicate interstate commerce on a regular basis, and there is a \"realistic probability\" that any depletion of its assets would affect that commerce.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>By contrast, there is no evidence in this case permitting an inference that Muñiz's sale of lottery tickets to tourists ordinarily involved interstate commerce, nor any evidence of \"`a realistic probability'\" that interstate commerce was affected by the robbery at issue here. <i>See </i><i>Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d at 335. A sale of locally produced merchandise (here, the lottery ticket) does not become an interstate transaction simply because the purchaser, who is buying locally, happens to hail from out-of-state.</p>\n<p>I recognize that, in enacting the Hobbs Act, Congress intended \"`to use all [its] constitutional power . . . to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery, or physical force.'\" <i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 7 (quoting <i>Stirone v.

Indeed, the Court in <i>Morrison</i> explicitly recognized the singular role of the states with respect to violent crime: \"[W]e can think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.\" <i>Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. at 618, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We observed that \"Congress' inclusion of a jurisdictional element in the Hobbs Act addresses the <i>Lopez</i> Court's constitutional concern that congressional authority under the Commerce Clause not become a `general police power of the sort retained by the States.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. at 567, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although we concluded in <i>Capozzi</i> that the \"de minimis effect\" standard continues to be sufficient to identify the federal interest, that standard cannot be applied so loosely that the interstate commerce element no longer serves to distinguish between federal and state crimes. Otherwise, we risk turning every routine robbery into a federal offense. <i>See </i><i>Jiménez-Torres,</i> 435 F.3d at 14-15 (Torruella, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>In my view, that is what the majority has done here with a de minimis effect analysis that reduces this concept to a meaningless verbal incantation. Indeed, virtually every business uses some item that was made in another state  perhaps a table or a rug or paint on the walls. If speculation about future replacement of such items suffices to establish the interstate commerce nexus, the Hobbs Act would embrace virtually all local robberies. Similarly, the happenstance that a tourist purchases locally produced merchandise does not transform that purchase into an interstate transaction. Otherwise, the robbery of a fruit peddler's stand that is patronized by tourists becomes a Hobbs Act violation. On the record before us, the majority's conclusion that the jury could find a nexus between the defendants' robbery and interstate commerce is an exercise in imagination that places this case beyond the outer boundaries of our prior precedent. I cannot agree to such an expansion of the law.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The Hobbs Act provides that \"[w]hoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion. . . shall be fined . . . or imprisoned. . . .\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).</p>\n<p>[2]  Fonseca testified that Officer Martínez showed him the defendants and asked if \"these were the ones,\" while Martínez testified that he did not speak to Fonseca and that Fonseca, when he saw the defendants, volunteered that they \"`are the individuals that robbed me.'\"</p>\n<p>[3]  Defense counsel noted \"[T]he opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness' degree of attention, accuracy and level of certainty, et cetera, the length of time of the time of confrontation.. . .\"</p>\n<p>[4]  The defendants did not specifically object to the court's decision to instruct the jury, to the language of the instruction, or to testimony from Martínez and Fonseca about Fonseca's out-of-court recognition of them. Those particulars are thus not before us on appeal, nor have the appellants raised these issues on appeal.</p>\n<p>[5]  As noted earlier, Count One explicitly charged a Hobbs Act violation, while the firearms charge in Count Two is premised on the use of a firearm in connection with that crime. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (providing enhanced penalty when a firearm is used \"during and in relation to any crime of violence. . . for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States\").</p>\n<p>[6]  Arguably, the appellants have waived the argument that the government failed to produce sufficient evidence that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce. In their opening briefs, the appellants appear to concede that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce and focus instead on the prosecution's \"burden to prove the impact\" of the robbery on interstate commerce. The appellants both argue \"[u]nlike statutes that make it a federal offense to possess a[ ] weapon that has at one time traveled in interstate commerce, the Hobbs Act requires some proof of impact. It was totally lacking here.\" In their reply briefs, however, the appellants switch gears. That the robbery had a \"de minimis impact\" on interstate commerce, the appellants observe, \"is not in dispute here.\" Rather, the appellants contend that at issue \"is the adequacy of the proof that [the lottery business] was, in fact, engaged in interstate commerce, rather than the adequacy of the proof of impact.\"\n</p>\n<p>We have made clear that arguments that make their debut in a reply brief are deemed waived. <i>United States v.

Nevertheless, because the waiver issue is a close one, we will address the appellants' argument on the merits.</p>\n<p>[7]  We note that although the appellants did move for a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 at the close of the government's case, neither did so on the basis that the government failed to present sufficient evidence that the lottery business was engaged in interstate commerce.

The court noted that the defendants had stipulated to the fact of a prior conviction for purposes of Count Three. Rivera's counsel acknowledged the stipulation, but asserted that the fact of the stipulation was never presented to the jury, and the jury thus lacked evidence on a crucial element of the charge. The court, however, understood the stipulation to remove the prior conviction from the case, allowing the jury to decide only whether defendants had possessed firearms. If the jury found possession, the court's view was that the stipulation would kick in to complete the evidence necessary to support a guilty verdict on Count Three. With respect to the twenty-five year term imposed on Count Two  which was based on the same prior conviction  the court ultimately ruled that the penalty was \"an appropriate sentencing enhancement under the circumstances.\" Both appellants explicitly declaim any challenge to that portion of the sentence on Counts One and Three that resulted from the stipulation.</p>\n<p>[14]  In analyzing a provision relating to machine guns, § 924(c)(1)(B)(ii), we recently concluded that knowing possession of a machine gun is an element of the crime that must be proven to the jury. <i>United States v.

In this case, however, the appellants do not make any allegations regarding the possession of a machine gun.

The district court did not give them the opportunity to do so. After the court ended a discussion concerning pretrial identification by saying that it would give the jury a specific instruction on identification procedures, the colloquy continued as follows:\n</p>\n<p>DEFENSE COUNSEL: Other than that, we pray the Court to grant a Rule 29 and enter a not guilty verdict on this particular case at this time, because I submit that there is insufficient evidence for the robbery, the firearm, and the fact </p>\n<p>COURT: I think there is overwhelming evidence of the fact that this robbery took place as testified to by the witnesses.

In response to the panel's request for supplemental briefing, the government now argues that the interstate commerce requirement applies only to crimes that occur in the fifty states and not to those committed in other United States jurisdictions. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

It relies on the Act's definition of \"commerce\" as including \"commerce within. . . any Territory or Possession of the United States.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(3).\n</p>\n<p>However, as the government points out, even if the full panel agreed that it is unnecessary to prove an effect on interstate commerce for Hobbs Act violations in Puerto Rico, that construction of the statute would be inapplicable in this case because the charges were brought, and the jury was instructed, based on the interstate commerce requirement. <i>See </i><i>McCormick v.

Thus, even if I accepted the government's new understanding of the Hobbs Act as it applies to Puerto Rico, it would not affect my view of the sufficiency of the evidence in this case. I therefore do not discuss the merits of that argument.</p>\n<p>[19]  Indeed, the evidence suggests that Muñiz did not even purchase the lottery machines himself, but obtained them from the Commonwealth's Department of the Treasury, which brought them to Puerto Rico through an arrangement with the manufacturer. Because I believe the interstate commerce element would not be satisfied even if Muñiz had purchased the machines himself, I need not dwell on this further complication.</p>\n<p>[20]  I note my agreement with the majority that the interstate commerce element would be satisfied if a business purchased its inventory from an in-state supplier that obtained the products from out of state. Such interstate activity, although indirect, is nonetheless ongoing, and a robbery of the business would have the same impact on the future purchase of out-of-state goods as it would if the products were purchased directly from an out-of-state source.</p>\n<p>[21]  The majority quotes the Eleventh Circuit's statement in <i>Rodriguez</i> that evidence that the victim motels had \"at some point\" registered out-of-state guests was enough to establish a connection to interstate commerce. I do not understand that decision to endorse a Hobbs Act conviction where the robbed business had only a past relationship with interstate commerce. Rather, the fact that the motel had previously served out-of-state guests allowed the inference that its customary operations included such customers. In other words, a jury reasonably could find based on its clientele that the motel was regularly engaged in transactions involving interstate commerce. <i>See also </i><i>Pearson,</i> 508 F.2d at 597 (noting that \"[t]he evidence established that this hotel entertained a large number of out of state visitors, thus establishing the required interstate nexus\").</p>\n\n</div>",
