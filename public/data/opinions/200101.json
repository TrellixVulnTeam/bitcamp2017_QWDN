BATIZ CHAMORRO,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                v.\n\n     PUERTO RICAN CARS, INC., D/B/A THE HERTZ CORPORATION,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jorge Martínez Luciano, and Law Offices of Pedro Ortiz\nAlvarez, PSC on brief for appellant.\n     Pedro J. Manzano-Yates, Luis F. Colón-Conde, and Fiddler\nGonzalez & Rodriguez, LLP on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 27, 2002\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.           On October 8, 1999, plaintiff-\n\nappellant José A. Batiz Chamorro (Batiz) invoked federal question\n\njurisdiction,    28    U.S.C.    §   1331,     and   brought   an   employment\n\ndiscrimination action in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico against defendant-appellee Puerto Rican\n\nCars, Inc., d/b/a The Hertz Corporation                (Hertz).     Given the\n\nposture of this appeal, the details of the underlying dispute\n\nbetween Batiz and Hertz need not concern us.            What matters is that\n\na little over two years after suit had been started, the district\n\ncourt dismissed the case with prejudice for want of prosecution and\n\nfailure to comply with the court's orders.               Batiz appeals.     We\n\naffirm.\n\n            The travel of the case is illuminating.            After receiving\n\nan extension, Hertz filed its answer on December 28, 1999.                  In\n\nFebruary of 2000, Batiz initiated a request for production of\n\ndocuments.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 34.           The parties exchanged some\n\ndesultory communications about this request, but could not achieve\n\nconsensus.    In an attempt to bring matters to a head, Hertz moved\n\nfor a     protective   order    on   grounds    that   the   document   request\n\nintruded upon time-barred periods and sought irrelevant materials.\n\nBatiz did not oppose this motion, and only a few uncontroversial\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdocuments    were    produced.1       Batiz       made   no   further    efforts    at\n\ndiscovery, and the case stalled.\n\n            On October 25, 2000, the district court noted Batiz's\n\napparent lack of interest in pressing forward and ordered him to\n\nshow cause why the action should not be dismissed for want of\n\nprosecution.       Batiz received an extension of time within which to\n\nreply and thereafter filed a response in which he (1) explained\n\nwhat steps he had taken to prosecute the action, (2) pledged \"to\n\navoid    further    delays,\"    and    (3)    beseeched       the    court    for   an\n\n\"opportunity to continue\" the pursuit of his claims.                    The district\n\ncourt did not press the show-cause order, but, rather, scheduled a\n\nstatus conference for December 15, 2000, at which time the parties\n\nwere instructed to inform the court no later than February 28,\n\n2001,    about   how    they   intended      to    proceed    with    the    diligent\n\nprosecution of the action.             Batiz ignored this order.                Hertz\n\ncomplied with it, listing various depositions that had been taken\n\nfollowing the status conference, describing the parties' informal\n\nagreement to stay further discovery until April 17, 2001, and\n\nlimning its future plans (including its intention to move for\n\nsummary judgment).\n\n             Between May and September of 2001, the parties engaged in\n\nlimited     discovery    (e.g.,   Hertz       unsuccessfully         requested      the\n\n\n\n     1\n      A magistrate judge eventually granted the unopposed motion on\nDecember 5, 2000.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fproduction of documents and deposition transcripts, and Batiz\n\neventually made a second request for production of documents).\n\nThese    maneuverings   generated   no    docket   activity.   Apparently\n\ndismayed both by the lack of activity and by Batiz's failure to\n\nfile the mandated progress report, the district court invoked Rule\n\n41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure2 and dismissed the\n\ncase with prejudice by order dated October 18, 2001.           The clerk\n\nentered the order on the docket on October 23, and Batiz filed a\n\ntimely motion to alter or amend.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).   Hertz\n\nopposed the motion.     On November 5, the district court summarily\n\ndenied reconsideration.     This appeal ensued.\n\n            Before we can address the merits of the appeal, we first\n\nmust dispel a procedural miasma created by poor draftsmanship.        As\n\na general rule, a notice of appeal must specify the orders and\n\njudgments that the appellant intends to contest.         See Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 3(c)(1)(C).    The notice of appeal in this case targets only the\n\norder denying reconsideration (to the exclusion of the order\n\ndismissing the action).     This raises the question of whether the\n\nnotice, as drafted, confers jurisdiction upon this court to review\n\nthe original order of dismissal.\n\n            Hertz's position — that Batiz has forfeited any right to\n\nhave this court review the district court's original decision – is\n\n\n     2\n      In pertinent part, this rule authorizes a district court to\ndismiss an action \"for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to\ncomply with . . . any order of the court.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fnot entirely without force.        The pendency of a timely Rule 59(e)\n\nmotion tolls the running of the appeal period from the original\n\njudgment.     See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4); Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).\n\nNevertheless, an appeal from an order denying such a motion is\n\ngenerally not considered to be an appeal from the underlying\n\njudgment.     Mariani-Giron v. Acevedo-Ruiz, 945 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n             The holding in Mariani-Giron does not mean, however, that\n\nan appellate court invariably is bound to read the notice of appeal\n\nliterally.      Such   formalism    is    not   obligatory;   instead,   our\n\nprecedents encourage us to construe notices of appeal liberally and\n\nexamine them in the context of the record as a whole.            See e.g.,\n\nKotler v. Am. Tobacco Co., 981 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1992).               That\n\nfunction proceeds with a recognition that the core purpose of a\n\nnotice of appeal is to \"facilitate a proper decision on the\n\nmerits.\"     Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962).         In light of\n\nthese principles, it is not surprising that courts faced with\n\npoorly drafted notices of appeal occasionally have been known to\n\nrescue the technically defaulted portion of an appeal.          E.g., Town\n\nof Norwood v. New Eng. Power Co., 202 F.3d 408, 415 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).     We caution, however, that such rescue missions are not\n\nautomatic, and litigants will do well to draft notices of appeal\n\nwith care.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f               Against this backdrop, we inspect Batiz's notice of\n\nappeal.    Notwithstanding          its    focus      on    the   order    denying\n\nreconsideration, the text of the notice mentions the original\n\njudgment and notes that \"[s]aid Judgment dismissed the . . . action\n\non the ground[] of want of prosecution.\"                   Read in context, this\n\nreference is consistent with a desire to have this court review the\n\npropriety of the original dismissal for want of prosecution.                   The\n\nfact that Batiz, in his appellate briefs, presents exactly the same\n\narguments as to the original order of dismissal and as to the\n\ndenial    of    his    subsequent   motion      for   reconsideration     provides\n\nfurther justification for ascribing to him an intent to seek review\n\nof both orders.         See Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 415.             Finally,\n\nboth sides have fully briefed the merits, and undertaking appellate\n\nreview of the original order of dismissal would not unfairly\n\nprejudice Hertz.         Cf. Kelly v. United States, 789 F.2d 94, 96 n.3\n\n(1st Cir. 1986) (explaining that an appellee who is not misled by\n\na misstatement in a notice of appeal is, by definition, not\n\nprejudiced by it).          We conclude, therefore, that the notice of\n\nappeal, while carelessly drafted, provides a sufficient foundation\n\nfor the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over the original order\n\nof dismissal.         See Foman, 371 U.S. at 181-82; In re San Juan Dupont\n\nPlaza Hotel Fire Litig., 45 F.3d 564, 567 (1st Cir. 1995); LeBlanc\n\nv. Great Am. Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 839-40 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f          Having resolved the jurisdictional question, we turn to\n\nthe two disputed orders.    We begin our analysis with bedrock:         the\n\neffective administration of justice requires that trial courts\n\npossess the capability to manage their own affairs.          Chambers v.\n\nNASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43 (1991).          The authority to order\n\ndismissal in appropriate cases is a necessary component of that\n\ncapability.    See Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31\n\n(1962).   Moreover, the inherent power of trial courts to dismiss\n\ncases for want of prosecution or disregard of judicial orders is\n\nreinforced and augmented by Rule 41(b).             See id.; HMG Prop.\n\nInvestors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc., 847 F.2d 908, 916\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          It   is   self-evident   that   \"courts   cannot   function   if\n\nlitigants may, with impunity, disobey lawful orders.\"          HMG Prop.\n\nInvestors, 847 F.2d at 916.    For that reason, courts must be given\n\nconsiderable leeway in exercising their admitted authority to\n\npunish laggardly or noncompliant litigants.         It follows logically\n\nthat \"the trier's determination to dismiss a case for such reasons\n\nshould be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\"         Aoude v. Mobil\n\nOil Corp., 892 F.2d 1115, 1117 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n          Even so, dismissal with prejudice is a severe sanction.\n\nTo ensure against arbitrariness, a reviewing court must balance the\n\ntrial court's authority to impose such a sanction against the\n\nobvious policy considerations that favor disposition of cases on\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fthe merits.    See Zavala Santiago v. Gonzalez Rivera, 553 F.2d 710,\n\n712 (1st Cir. 1977); Richman v. Gen. Motors Corp., 437 F.2d 196,\n\n199 (1st Cir. 1971).     This is an \"open-ended balancing test,\" HMG\n\nProp. Investors, 847 F.2d at 917 n.13, conducted with due respect\n\nfor the trial court's first-hand knowledge of the nuances of the\n\ncase and the (sometimes recondite) agendas of the parties.\n\n          In    Enlace   Mercantil   Internacional,   Inc.   v.    Senior\n\nIndustries, Inc., 848 F.2d 315, 317 (1st Cir. 1988), we said that\n\nthe sanction of dismissal for want of prosecution is appropriate\n\nonly when the plaintiff's misconduct has been \"extreme.\"          For this\n\npurpose, however, extreme misconduct comes in many shapes and\n\nforms, ranging from protracted foot-dragging to defiance of court\n\norders to ignoring warnings to other aggravating circumstances.\n\nCosme Nieves v. Deshler, 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987).       A classic\n\nform of aggravating circumstance is a wasteful expenditure of the\n\ncourt's time.    Enlace, 848 F.2d at 317.\n\n          In this instance, the district court dismissed the case\n\nbecause Batiz, after being suitably forewarned – the court earlier\n\nhad issued a show-cause order that specifically mentioned the\n\npossibility of dismissal – nevertheless flouted the court's direct\n\norder to furnish a progress report.     In the district court's view,\n\nthis stonewalling not only exhibited \"a disregard for the court's\n\ntime and schedule\" but also made manifest \"a repeated unwillingness\n\nto move this case forward.\"          These reasons, if well-founded,\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fdescribe   conduct   extreme   enough    to   warrant   dismissal.     The\n\nquestion, then, is whether the district court's description of\n\nBatiz's behavior finds adequate support in the record.           We think\n\nthat it does.\n\n           The   district   court's     decree   of   December   15,   2000\n\n\"instructed [the parties] to inform the Court by February 28, 2001,\n\nhow they will proceed with this case.\"        This was clear, direct, and\n\nto the point:    the order obligated both Hertz and Batiz to file\n\nprogress reports within the stipulated time frame. Hertz complied;\n\nBatiz did not.    That was a blatant violation of the court's order\n\n– and one that undermined the court's studied effort to manage its\n\ndocket.    See Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield, ___ F.3d\n\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2002) [No. 02-1145, slip op. at 5-6] (\"To manage\n\na crowded calendar efficiently and effectively, a trial court must\n\ntake an active role in case management.           Scheduling orders are\n\nessential tools in that process — and a party's disregard of such\n\norders robs them of their utility.\").             This conduct breached\n\nBatiz's duty to the court, see Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d\n\n312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998) (discussing a party's \"unflagging duty to\n\ncomply with clearly communicated case-management orders\"), and\n\nwasted the court's time in the bargain.\n\n           In an attempt to confess and avoid, Batiz points to\n\nHertz's progress report, tells us that he agrees with Hertz's\n\nassessment, and argues that it would have been superfluous to file\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fhis own report because such a statement would have covered the same\n\nground.   That argument smacks of post-hoc rationalization, and the\n\ndistrict court, in denying reconsideration, flatly rejected it. In\n\nall events, the argument goes wide of the mark.   The district court\n\ndirected both parties to file progress reports and it was entitled\n\nto know how each of them viewed the case.         Batiz could have\n\ncomplied with the order either by a submission that tracked Hertz's\n\nreport or by simply stating that he agreed with Hertz's summary.\n\nWhat he could not do was to take it upon himself to ignore the\n\norder and leave the district court guessing.\n\n           Batiz's other justification for noncompliance is that his\n\ncounsel was busy with a complicated jury trial.     We consistently\n\nhave refused to accept such excuses, see, e.g., Tower Ventures, ___\n\nF.3d at ___ n.7 [slip op. at 7 n.7]; Mendez v. Banco Popular de\n\nP.R., 900 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1990); Pinero Schroeder v. FNMA, 574\n\nF.2d 1117, 1118 (1st Cir. 1978) (per curiam), and we see no basis\n\nfor applying a different standard here.   The fact that an attorney\n\nhas other fish to fry is not an acceptable reason for disregarding\n\na court order.\n\n           In a last-ditch effort to salvage the case, Batiz asserts\n\nthat the district court violated its own local rules.   Focusing on\n\nD.P.R.R. 313, he argues that the rule limits a trial judge's\n\nauthority, under Rule 41(b), to dismiss a case with prejudice for\n\nwant of prosecution.   To the extent that this argument is true, it\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fdoes not help Batiz:           the district court's action was fully\n\nconsistent with D.P.R.R. 313 as presently written.                   We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n           Batiz relies on cases in which we vacated dismissals for\n\nwant of prosecution because they clashed with the District of\n\nPuerto Rico's local rules.          E.g., Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v. Diaz-\n\nMarquez, 878 F.2d 1555 (1st Cir. 1989); Martinez Class v. Caribe\n\nHilton   Hotel,   784   F.2d   12    (1st   Cir.   1986).     Each    of   those\n\ndecisions, however, was premised upon a finding that the order of\n\ndismissal conflicted with a now-defunct provision of the local\n\nrules. That provision limited dismissal for want of prosecution to\n\ncases in which \"no substantial proceedings of record have been\n\ntaken for a term of six (6) months as shown by the record docket.\"\n\nD.P.R.R. 313.1(B) (repealed Apr. 29, 1997).                 Since substantial\n\nproceedings had occurred within the proscribed six-month period, we\n\nheld that dismissal for want of prosecution was improper.                    See\n\nJardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1560; Martinez Class, 784 F.2d at 12.\n\n           The case at bar arises under a different regime.                In its\n\namended form, applicable here, the comparable provision of D.P.R.R.\n\n313.1(B) restricts the class of cases subject to dismissal for want\n\nof prosecution to those in which \"a certificate of readiness for\n\ntrial has not been filed within one (1) year after the filing of\n\nthe action.\"   Batiz does not allege that this case falls within the\n\nprophylaxis of that restriction.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f                Relatedly,      Batiz    complains    about   the   fact    that    the\n\ndismissal operates with prejudice, asseverating that this feature\n\nviolates D.P.R.R. 313.2.            But that rule allows the court to direct\n\nthat the dismissal of a case will operate as an adjudication on the\n\nmerits.        See D.P.R.R. 313.2 (stating that the dismissal of a case\n\n\"shall not operate as an adjudication of the merits, unless the\n\nCourt . . . directs otherwise\")                (emphasis supplied).        The court\n\nmade such an express direction here.\n\n                We    add   a   coda.       Although     Batiz's    arguments       are\n\nunpersuasive, the court imposed a heavy-duty sanction.                             Were\n\nBatiz's disregard of the court's order an isolated incident, this\n\nsanction — dismissal with prejudice — would give us pause.                      Here,\n\nhowever, the district court supportably viewed Batiz's failure to\n\nfile the court-ordered progress report as part of a pattern.                    On at\n\nleast two occasions, Batiz had neglected to respond to discovery\n\nrequests; he had not replied either to Hertz's motion for a\n\nprotective order or to Hertz's demands for document production; and\n\nover       a   two-year     span,   he   had   made    only   a   token    effort    at\n\ndiscovery.3          The case languished to such an extent that the court\n\n\n\n       3\n      We note that Batiz, in responding to the show-cause order on\nNovember 16, 2000, told the district court that he would \"tailor\"\na revised request for production of documents in an effort to quell\nthe objections raised in Hertz's motion for a protective order.\nDespite this pledge, a revised request was not served until\nSeptember of 2001.       This inexplicable ten-month gap aptly\nillustrates why the district court (understandably, in our view)\ngrew impatient.\n\n                                           -12-\n\fwas forced to issue a show-cause order in an effort to move it\n\nalong.   That order, although ultimately withdrawn, placed Batiz on\n\nnotice that further procrastination in the prosecution of his\n\naction would not be well-received.

Batiz Chamorro (Batiz) invoked federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, and brought an employment discrimination action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against defendant-appellee Puerto Rican Cars, Inc., d/b/a The Hertz Corporation (Hertz). Given the posture of this appeal, the details of the underlying dispute between Batiz and Hertz need not concern us. What matters is that a little over two years after suit had been started, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice for want of prosecution and failure to comply with the court's orders. Batiz appeals. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The travel of the case is illuminating. After receiving an extension, Hertz filed its answer on December 28, 1999. In February of 2000, Batiz initiated a request for production of documents. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 34. The parties exchanged some desultory communications about this request, but could not achieve consensus. In an attempt to bring matters to a head, Hertz moved for a protective order on grounds that the document request intruded upon time-barred periods and sought irrelevant materials. Batiz did not oppose this motion, and only a few uncontroversial documents were produced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Batiz made no further efforts at discovery, and the case stalled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 25, 2000, the district court noted Batiz's apparent lack of interest in pressing forward and ordered him to show cause why the action should not be dismissed for want of prosecution. Batiz received an extension of time within which to reply and thereafter filed a response in which he (1) explained what steps he had taken to prosecute the action, (2) pledged \"to avoid further delays,\" and (3) beseeched the court for an \"opportunity to continue\" the pursuit of his claims. The district court did not press the show-cause order, but, rather, scheduled a status conference for December 15, 2000, at which time the parties were instructed to inform the court no later than February 28, 2001, about how they intended to proceed with the diligent prosecution of the action. Batiz ignored this order. Hertz complied with it, listing various depositions that had been taken following the status conference, describing the parties' informal agreement to stay further discovery until April 17, 2001, and limning its future plans (including its intention to move for summary judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between May and September of 2001, the parties engaged in limited discovery (e.g., Hertz unsuccessfully requested the production of documents and deposition transcripts, and Batiz eventually made a second request for production of documents). These maneuverings generated no docket activity. Apparently dismayed both by the lack of activity and by Batiz's failure to file the mandated progress report, the district court invoked Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and dismissed the case with prejudice by order dated October 18, 2001. The clerk entered the order on the docket on October 23, and Batiz filed a timely motion to alter or amend. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Hertz opposed the motion. On November 5, the district court summarily denied reconsideration. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we can address the merits of the appeal, we first must dispel a procedural miasma created by poor draftsmanship. As a general rule, a notice of appeal must specify the orders and judgments that the appellant intends to contest. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App.P. 3(c)(1)(C). The notice of appeal in this case targets only the order denying reconsideration (to the exclusion of the order dismissing the action). This raises the question of whether the notice, as drafted, confers jurisdiction upon this court to review the original order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hertz's position &#8212; that Batiz has forfeited any right to have this court review the district court's original decision &#8212; is not entirely without force. The pendency of a timely Rule 59(e) motion tolls the running of the appeal period from the original judgment. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4); Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Nevertheless, an appeal from an order denying such a motion is generally not considered to be an appeal from the underlying judgment. <i>Mariani-Giron v. Acevedo-Ruiz,</i> 945 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The holding in <i>Mariani-Giron</i> does not mean, however, that an appellate court invariably is bound to read the notice of appeal literally. Such formalism is not obligatory; instead, our precedents encourage us to construe notices of appeal liberally and examine them in the context of the record as a whole. <i>See e.g., Kotler v. Am. Tobacco Co.,</i> 981 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir.1992). That function proceeds with a recognition that the core purpose of a notice of appeal is to \"facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\" <i>Foman v. Davis,</i> 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). In light of these principles, it is not surprising that courts faced with poorly drafted notices of appeal occasionally have been known to rescue the technically defaulted portion of an appeal. <i>E.g., Town of Norwood v. New Eng. Power Co.,</i> 202 F.3d 408, 415 (1st Cir.2000). We caution, however, that such rescue missions are not automatic, and litigants will do well to draft notices of appeal with care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we inspect Batiz's notice of appeal. Notwithstanding its focus on the order denying reconsideration, the text of the notice mentions the original judgment and notes that \"[s]aid Judgment dismissed the ... action on the ground[] of want of prosecution.\" Read in context, this reference is consistent with a desire to have this court review the propriety of the original dismissal for want of prosecution. The fact that Batiz, in his appellate briefs, presents exactly the same arguments as to the original order of dismissal and as to the denial of his subsequent motion for reconsideration provides further justification for ascribing to him an intent to seek review of both orders. <i>See Town of Norwood,</i> 202 F.3d at 415. Finally, both sides have fully briefed the merits, and undertaking appellate review of the original order of dismissal would not unfairly prejudice Hertz. <i>Cf. Kelly v. United States,</i> 789 F.2d 94, 96 n. 3 (1st Cir.1986) (explaining that an appellee who is not misled by a misstatement in a notice of appeal is, by definition, not prejudiced by it). We conclude, therefore, that the notice of appeal, while carelessly drafted, provides a sufficient foundation for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over the original order of dismissal. <i>See Foman,</i> 371 U.S. at 181-82, 83 S.Ct. 227; <i>In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.,</i> 45 F.3d 564, 567 (1st Cir.1995); <i>LeBlanc v. Great Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 6 F.3d 836, 839-40 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having resolved the jurisdictional question, we turn to the two disputed orders. We begin our analysis with bedrock: the effective administration of justice requires that trial courts possess the capability to manage their own affairs. <i>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,</i> 501 U.S. 32, 43, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). The authority to order dismissal in appropriate cases is a necessary component of that capability. <i>See Link v. Wabash R.R. Co.,</i> 370 U.S. 626, 630-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). Moreover, the inherent power of trial courts to dismiss cases for want of prosecution or disregard of judicial orders is reinforced and augmented by Rule 41(b). <i>See id.; HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc.,</i> 847 F.2d 908, 916 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is self-evident that \"courts cannot function if litigants may, with impunity, disobey lawful orders.\" <i>HMG Prop. Investors,</i> 847 F.2d at 916. For that reason, courts must be given considerable leeway in exercising their admitted authority to punish laggardly or noncompliant litigants. It follows logically that \"the trier's determination to dismiss a case for such reasons should be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> 892 F.2d 1115, 1117 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, dismissal with prejudice is a severe sanction. To ensure against arbitrariness, a reviewing court must balance the trial court's authority to impose such a sanction against the obvious policy considerations that favor disposition of cases on the merits. <i>See Zavala Santiago v. Gonzalez Rivera,</i> 553 F.2d 710, 712 (1st Cir. 1977); <i>Richman v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 437 F.2d 196, 199 (1st Cir.1971). This is an \"open-ended balancing test,\" <i>HMG Prop. Investors,</i> 847 F.2d at 917 n. 13, conducted with due respect for the trial court's first-hand knowledge of the nuances of the case and the (sometimes recondite) agendas of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Enlace Mercantil Internacional, Inc. v. Senior Industries, Inc.,</i> 848 F.2d 315, 317 (1st Cir.1988), we said that the sanction of dismissal for want of prosecution is appropriate only when the plaintiff's misconduct has been \"extreme.\" For this purpose, however, extreme misconduct comes in many shapes and forms, ranging from protracted foot-dragging to defiance of court orders to ignoring warnings to other aggravating circumstances. <i>Cosme Nieves v. Deshler,</i> 826 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987). A classic form of aggravating circumstance is a wasteful expenditure of the court's time. <i>Enlace,</i> 848 F.2d at 317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court dismissed the case because Batiz, after being suitably forewarned &#8212; the court earlier had issued a show-cause order that specifically mentioned the possibility of dismissal &#8212; nevertheless flouted the court's direct order to furnish a progress report. In the district court's view, this stonewalling not only exhibited \"a disregard for the court's time and schedule\" but also made manifest \"a repeated unwillingness to move this case forward.\" These reasons, if well-founded, describe conduct extreme enough to warrant dismissal. The question, then, is whether the district court's description of Batiz's behavior finds adequate support in the record. We think that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decree of December 15, 2000 \"instructed [the parties] to inform the Court by February 28, 2001, how they will proceed with this case.\" This was clear, direct, and to the point: the order obligated both Hertz and Batiz to file progress reports within the stipulated time frame. Hertz complied; Batiz did not. That was a blatant violation of the court's order &#8212; and one that undermined the court's studied effort to manage its docket. <i>See Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,</i> 296 F.3d 43, 46 (1st Cir.2002) (\"To manage a crowded calendar efficiently and effectively, a trial court must take an active role in case management. Scheduling orders are essential tools in that process &#8212; and a party's disregard of such orders robs them of their utility.\"). This conduct breached Batiz's duty to the court, <i>see Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez,</i> 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir.1998) (discussing a party's \"unflagging duty to comply with clearly communicated case-management orders\"), and wasted the court's time in the bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to confess and avoid, Batiz points to Hertz's progress report, tells us that he agrees with Hertz's assessment, and argues that it would have been superfluous to file his own report because such a statement would have covered the same ground. That argument smacks of post-hoc rationalization, and the district court, in denying reconsideration, flatly rejected it. In all events, the argument goes wide of the mark. The district court directed both parties to file progress reports and it was entitled to know how each of them viewed the case. Batiz could have complied with the order either by a submission that tracked Hertz's report or by simply stating that he agreed with Hertz's summary. What he could not do was to take it upon himself to ignore the order and leave the district court guessing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Batiz's other justification for noncompliance is that his counsel was busy with a complicated jury trial. We consistently have refused to accept such excuses, <i>see, e.g., Tower Ventures,</i> 296 F.3d at 47 n. 3; <i>Mendez v. Banco Popular de P.R.,</i> 900 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir.1990); <i>Pinero Schroeder v. FNMA,</i> 574 F.2d 1117, 1118 (1st Cir. 1978) (per curiam), and we see no basis for applying a different standard here. The fact that an attorney has other fish to fry is not an acceptable reason for disregarding a court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to salvage the case, Batiz asserts that the district court violated its own local rules. Focusing on D.P.R.R. 313, he argues that the rule limits a trial judge's authority, under Rule 41(b), to dismiss a case with prejudice for want of prosecution. To the extent that this argument is true, it does not help Batiz: the district court's action was fully consistent with D.P.R.R. 313 <i>as presently written.</i> We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Batiz relies on cases in which we vacated dismissals for want of prosecution because they clashed with the District of Puerto Rico's local rules. <i>E.g., Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v. Diaz-Marquez,</i> 878 F.2d 1555 (1st Cir.1989); <i>Martinez Class v. Caribe Hilton Hotel,</i> 784 F.2d 12 (1st Cir.1986). Each of those decisions, however, was premised upon a finding that the order of dismissal conflicted with a now-defunct provision of the local rules. That provision limited dismissal for want of prosecution to cases in which \"no substantial proceedings of record have been taken for a term of six (6) months as shown by the record docket.\" D.P.R.R. 313.1(B) (repealed Apr. 29, 1997). Since substantial proceedings had occurred within the proscribed six-month period, we held that dismissal for want of prosecution was improper. <i>See Jardines Bacata,</i> 878 F.2d at 1560; <i>Martinez Class,</i> 784 F.2d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at bar arises under a different regime. In its amended form, applicable here, the comparable provision of D.P.R.R. 313.1(B) restricts the class of cases subject to dismissal for want of prosecution to those in which \"a certificate of readiness for trial has not been filed within one (1) year after the filing of the action.\" Batiz does not allege that this case falls within the prophylaxis of that restriction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, Batiz complains about the fact that the dismissal operates with prejudice, asseverating that this feature violates D.P.R.R. 313.2. But that rule allows the court to direct that the dismissal of a case will operate as an adjudication on the merits. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 313.2 (stating that the dismissal of a case \"shall not operate as an adjudication of the merits, <i>unless the Court ... directs otherwise</i>\") (emphasis supplied). The court made such an express direction here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. Although Batiz's arguments are unpersuasive, the court imposed a heavy-duty sanction. Were Batiz's disregard of the court's order an isolated incident, this sanction &#8212; dismissal with prejudice &#8212; would give us pause. Here, however, the district court supportably viewed Batiz's failure to file the court-ordered progress report as part of a pattern. On at least two occasions, Batiz had neglected to respond to discovery requests; he had not replied either to Hertz's motion for a protective order or to Hertz's demands for document production; and over a two-year span, he had made only a token effort at discovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The case languished to such an extent that the court was forced to issue a show-cause order in an effort to move it along. That order, although ultimately withdrawn, placed Batiz on notice that further procrastination in the prosecution of his action would not be well-received. Under the circumstances, Batiz spurned the order to file a progress report at his peril. <i>See Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Historically, appellate courts have not lent a sympathetic ear to the importunings of those who claim that a trial judge abused his or her discretion by dismissing a case for want of prosecution. <i>E.g., Damiani v. R.I. Hosp.,</i> 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1983). This case is in that tradition. By lollygagging throughout the proceedings, Batiz set the stage for the denouement that was to follow. When he disregarded the order to file a progress report, that was the straw that broke the dromedary's back. Given that omission and what had occurred (or, more precisely put, what had not occurred) over the two-year life of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing this action for want of prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because that is so, the court, by definition, did not abuse its discretion in refusing to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A magistrate judge eventually granted the unopposed motion on December 5, 2000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In pertinent part, this rule authorizes a district court to dismiss an action \"for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with... any order of the court.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that Batiz, in responding to the show-cause order on November 16, 2000, told the district court that he would \"tailor\" a revised request for production of documents in an effort to quell the objections raised in Hertz's motion for a protective order. Despite this pledge, a revised request was not served until September of 2001. This inexplicable ten-month gap aptly illustrates why the district court (understandably, in our view) grew impatient</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> It is, of course, settled that a trial judge does not need to exhaust milder sanctions before resorting to dismissal when a noncompliant litigant has disregarded court orders and been suitably forewarned<i>E.g., Tower Ventures,</i> 296 F.3d at 46; <i>Top Entertainment Inc. v.

What matters is that a little over two years after suit had been started, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice for want of prosecution and failure to comply with the court's orders. Batiz appeals. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The travel of the case is illuminating. After receiving an extension, Hertz filed its answer on December 28, 1999. In February of 2000, Batiz initiated a request for production of documents. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 34. The parties exchanged some desultory communications about this request, but could not achieve consensus. In an attempt to bring matters to a head, Hertz moved for a protective order on grounds that the document request intruded upon time-barred periods and sought irrelevant materials. Batiz did not oppose this motion, and only a few uncontroversial documents were produced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Batiz made no further efforts at discovery, and the case stalled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 25, 2000, the district court noted Batiz's apparent lack of interest in pressing forward and ordered him to show cause why the action should not be dismissed for want of prosecution. Batiz received an extension of time within which to reply and thereafter filed a response in which he (1) explained what steps he had taken to prosecute the action, (2) pledged \"to avoid further delays,\" and (3) beseeched the court for an \"opportunity to continue\" the pursuit of his claims. The district court did not press the show-cause order, but, rather, scheduled a status conference for December 15, 2000, at which time the parties were instructed to inform the court no later than February 28, 2001, about how they intended to proceed with the diligent prosecution of the action. Batiz ignored this order. Hertz complied with it, listing various depositions that had been taken following the status conference, describing the parties' informal agreement to stay further discovery until April 17, 2001, and limning its future plans (including its intention to move for summary judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between May and September of 2001, the parties engaged in limited discovery (e.g., Hertz unsuccessfully requested the production of documents and deposition transcripts, and Batiz eventually made a second request for production of documents). These maneuverings generated no docket activity. Apparently dismayed both by the lack of activity and by Batiz's failure to file the mandated progress report, the district court invoked Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and dismissed the case with prejudice by order dated October 18, 2001. The clerk entered the order on the docket on October 23, and Batiz filed a timely motion to alter or amend. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Hertz opposed the motion. On November 5, the district court summarily denied reconsideration. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we can address the merits of the appeal, we first must dispel a procedural miasma created by poor draftsmanship. As a general rule, a notice of appeal must specify the orders and judgments that the appellant intends to contest. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App.P. 3(c)(1)(C). The notice of appeal in this case targets only the order denying reconsideration (to the exclusion of the order dismissing the action). This raises the question of whether the notice, as drafted, confers jurisdiction upon this court to review the original order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hertz's position &#8212; that Batiz has forfeited any right to have this court review the district court's original decision &#8212; is not entirely without force. The pendency of a timely Rule 59(e) motion tolls the running of the appeal period from the original judgment. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4); Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). Nevertheless, an appeal from an order denying such a motion is generally not considered to be an appeal from the underlying judgment. <i>Mariani-Giron v. Acevedo-Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568542\"><a href=\"/opinion/568542/william-mariani-giron-v-heriberto-acevedo-ruiz-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The holding in <i>Mariani-Giron</i> does not mean, however, that an appellate court invariably is bound to read the notice of appeal literally. Such formalism is not obligatory; instead, our precedents encourage us to construe notices of appeal liberally and examine them in the context of the record as a whole. <i>See e.g., Kotler v. Am. Tobacco Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596395\"><a href=\"/opinion/596395/joanne-kotler-individually-and-as-administratrix-etc-v-the-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1992). That function proceeds with a recognition that the core purpose of a notice of appeal is to \"facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\" <i>Foman v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 182, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1962). In light of these principles, it is not surprising that courts faced with poorly drafted notices of appeal occasionally have been known to rescue the technically defaulted portion of an appeal. <i>E.g., Town of Norwood v. New Eng. Power Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198812\"><a href=\"/opinion/198812/norwood-town-of-v-ne-power-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span>, 415 (1st Cir.2000). We caution, however, that such rescue missions are not automatic, and litigants will do well to draft notices of appeal with care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we inspect Batiz's notice of appeal. Notwithstanding its focus on the order denying reconsideration, the text of the notice mentions the original judgment and notes that \"[s]aid Judgment dismissed the ... action on the ground[] of want of prosecution.\" Read in context, this reference is consistent with a desire to have this court review the propriety of the original dismissal for want of prosecution. The fact that Batiz, in his appellate briefs, presents exactly the same arguments as to the original order of dismissal and as to the denial of his subsequent motion for reconsideration provides further justification for ascribing to him an intent to seek review of both orders. <i>See Town of Norwood,</i> 202 F.3d at 415. Finally, both sides have fully briefed the merits, and undertaking appellate review of the original order of dismissal would not unfairly prejudice Hertz. <i>Cf. Kelly v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469061\"><a href=\"/opinion/469061/susan-b-kelly-v-united-states-of-america-james-p-kelly-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 96 n. 3 (1st Cir.1986) (explaining that an appellee who is not misled by a misstatement in a notice of appeal is, by definition, not prejudiced by it). We conclude, therefore, that the notice of appeal, while carelessly drafted, provides a sufficient foundation for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over the original order of dismissal. <i>See Foman,</i> 371 U.S. at 181-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We begin our analysis with bedrock: the effective administration of justice requires that trial courts possess the capability to manage their own affairs. <i>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112616\"><a href=\"/opinion/112616/chambers-v-nasco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span> (1991). The authority to order dismissal in appropriate cases is a necessary component of that capability. <i>See Link v. Wabash R.R.

Moreover, the inherent power of trial courts to dismiss cases for want of prosecution or disregard of judicial orders is reinforced and augmented by Rule 41(b). <i>See id.; HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque Indus. Rio Canas, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506586\"><a href=\"/opinion/506586/hmg-property-investors-inc-v-parque-industrial-rio-canas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 916 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is self-evident that \"courts cannot function if litigants may, with impunity, disobey lawful orders.\" <i>HMG Prop. Investors,</i> 847 F.2d at 916. For that reason, courts must be given considerable leeway in exercising their admitted authority to punish laggardly or noncompliant litigants. It follows logically that \"the trier's determination to dismiss a case for such reasons should be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534524\"><a href=\"/opinion/534524/salim-aoude-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span>, 1117 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, dismissal with prejudice is a severe sanction. To ensure against arbitrariness, a reviewing court must balance the trial court's authority to impose such a sanction against the obvious policy considerations that favor disposition of cases on the merits. <i>See Zavala Santiago v.

This is an \"open-ended balancing test,\" <i>HMG Prop.

In the district court's view, this stonewalling not only exhibited \"a disregard for the court's time and schedule\" but also made manifest \"a repeated unwillingness to move this case forward.\" These reasons, if well-founded, describe conduct extreme enough to warrant dismissal. The question, then, is whether the district court's description of Batiz's behavior finds adequate support in the record. We think that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's decree of December 15, 2000 \"instructed [the parties] to inform the Court by February 28, 2001, how they will proceed with this case.\" This was clear, direct, and to the point: the order obligated both Hertz and Batiz to file progress reports within the stipulated time frame. Hertz complied; Batiz did not. That was a blatant violation of the court's order &#8212; and one that undermined the court's studied effort to manage its docket. <i>See Tower Ventures, Inc. v. City of Westfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200043\"><a href=\"/opinion/200043/tower-ventures-inc-v-city-of-westfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2002) (\"To manage a crowded calendar efficiently and effectively, a trial court must take an active role in case management. Scheduling orders are essential tools in that process &#8212; and a party's disregard of such orders robs them of their utility.\"). This conduct breached Batiz's duty to the court, <i>see Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197880\"><a href=\"/opinion/197880/rosario-diaz-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 315 (1st Cir.1998) (discussing a party's \"unflagging duty to comply with clearly communicated case-management orders\"), and wasted the court's time in the bargain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to confess and avoid, Batiz points to Hertz's progress report, tells us that he agrees with Hertz's assessment, and argues that it would have been superfluous to file his own report because such a statement would have covered the same ground. That argument smacks of post-hoc rationalization, and the district court, in denying reconsideration, flatly rejected it. In all events, the argument goes wide of the mark. The district court directed both parties to file progress reports and it was entitled to know how each of them viewed the case. Batiz could have complied with the order either by a submission that tracked Hertz's report or by simply stating that he agreed with Hertz's summary. What he could not do was to take it upon himself to ignore the order and leave the district court guessing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Batiz's other justification for noncompliance is that his counsel was busy with a complicated jury trial. We consistently have refused to accept such excuses, <i>see, e.g., Tower Ventures,</i> 296 F.3d at 47 n. 3; <i>Mendez v. Banco Popular de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539215\"><a href=\"/opinion/539215/julio-mendez-aka-julio-mendez-rodriguez-v-banco-popular-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1990); <i>Pinero Schroeder v.

The fact that an attorney has other fish to fry is not an acceptable reason for disregarding a court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to salvage the case, Batiz asserts that the district court violated its own local rules. Focusing on D.P.R.R. 313, he argues that the rule limits a trial judge's authority, under Rule 41(b), to dismiss a case with prejudice for want of prosecution. To the extent that this argument is true, it does not help Batiz: the district court's action was fully consistent with D.P.R.R. 313 <i>as presently written.</i> We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Batiz relies on cases in which we vacated dismissals for want of prosecution because they clashed with the District of Puerto Rico's local rules. <i>E.g., Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v. Diaz-Marquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526040\"><a href=\"/opinion/526040/jardines-bacata-limited-v-aniceto-diaz-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1555</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989); <i>Martinez Class v. Caribe Hilton Hotel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465036\"><a href=\"/opinion/465036/efrain-martinez-class-v-caribe-hilton-hotel-and-union-gastronomica-local/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1986). Each of those decisions, however, was premised upon a finding that the order of dismissal conflicted with a now-defunct provision of the local rules. That provision limited dismissal for want of prosecution to cases in which \"no substantial proceedings of record have been taken for a term of six (6) months as shown by the record docket.\" D.P.R.R. 313.1(B) (repealed Apr. 29, 1997). Since substantial proceedings had occurred within the proscribed six-month period, we held that dismissal for want of prosecution was improper. <i>See Jardines Bacata,</i> 878 F.2d at 1560; <i>Martinez Class,</i> 784 F.2d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at bar arises under a different regime. In its amended form, applicable here, the comparable provision of D.P.R.R. 313.1(B) restricts the class of cases subject to dismissal for want of prosecution to those in which \"a certificate of readiness for trial has not been filed within one (1) year after the filing of the action.\" Batiz does not allege that this case falls within the prophylaxis of that restriction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, Batiz complains about the fact that the dismissal operates with prejudice, asseverating that this feature violates D.P.R.R. 313.2. But that rule allows the court to direct that the dismissal of a case will operate as an adjudication on the merits. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 313.2 (stating that the dismissal of a case \"shall not operate as an adjudication of the merits, <i>unless the Court ... directs otherwise</i>\") (emphasis supplied). The court made such an express direction here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. Although Batiz's arguments are unpersuasive, the court imposed a heavy-duty sanction. Were Batiz's disregard of the court's order an isolated incident, this sanction &#8212; dismissal with prejudice &#8212; would give us pause. Here, however, the district court supportably viewed Batiz's failure to file the court-ordered progress report as part of a pattern. On at least two occasions, Batiz had neglected to respond to discovery requests; he had not replied either to Hertz's motion for a protective order or to Hertz's demands for document production; and over a two-year span, he had made only a token effort at discovery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The case languished to such an extent that the court was forced to issue a show-cause order in an effort to move it along. That order, although ultimately withdrawn, placed Batiz on notice that further procrastination in the prosecution of his action would not be well-received. Under the circumstances, Batiz spurned the order to file a progress report at his peril. <i>See Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Historically, appellate courts have not lent a sympathetic ear to the importunings of those who claim that a trial judge abused his or her discretion by dismissing a case for want of prosecution. <i>E.g., Damiani v. R.I. Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416550\"><a href=\"/opinion/416550/louis-m-damiani-md-v-rhode-island-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1983). This case is in that tradition. By lollygagging throughout the proceedings, Batiz set the stage for the denouement that was to follow. When he disregarded the order to file a progress report, that was the straw that broke the dromedary's back. Given that omission and what had occurred (or, more precisely put, what had not occurred) over the two-year life of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing this action for want of prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Because that is so, the court, by definition, did not abuse its discretion in refusing to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A magistrate judge eventually granted the unopposed motion on December 5, 2000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In pertinent part, this rule authorizes a district court to dismiss an action \"for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with... any order of the court.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We note that Batiz, in responding to the show-cause order on November 16, 2000, told the district court that he would \"tailor\" a revised request for production of documents in an effort to quell the objections raised in Hertz's motion for a protective order. Despite this pledge, a revised request was not served until September of 2001.
