We have substituted him for\nJohn Ashcroft, previous holder of that office, as the respondent.\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f              LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Petitioner Aramjit Singh, a native\n\nand citizen of India, seeks review of the denial of his application\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT) and the denial of his application\n\nfor adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i). The Immigration\n\nJudge (IJ) found that he was statutorily ineligible for adjustment\n\nof   status    because   he   was   inadmissible   pursuant   to   8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) for having made misrepresentations of material\n\nfact.      These denials were summarily affirmed by the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA).          We affirm and deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n\n                                      I.\n\n              Singh entered the United States without being admitted or\n\nparoled on October 21, 1997.          On January 20, 1998, he filed an\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under\n\nthe CAT.    In his application, he claimed persecution on account of\n\nhis Sikh religion and his involvement with the Akali Dal Mann\n\nParty, a Sikh political organization.\n\n              On March 12, 1998, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService1 (INS) issued a Notice to Appear to Singh alleging that he\n\n\n\n      1\n      On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist and its principal\nfunctions were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement in the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2205\n(codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)). We refer to the agency\nas the INS throughout this opinion.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fwas     removable        from    the   United     States    under      8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien who had entered the United States\n\nwithout being admitted or paroled.\n\n            Immigration         hearings   were   held     in   San   Francisco,\n\nCalifornia on April 6, 1998, October 15, 1999, and May 2, 2000.\n\nSingh conceded removability, but sought asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the CAT.                During the October 15\n\nhearing, Singh provided testimony and documentary evidence to\n\ncorroborate his claims.          Specifically, he alleged two instances in\n\nwhich he was arrested and beaten by the Indian police because of\n\nhis involvement with the Akali Dal Mann Party.                  He also alleged\n\nthat Indian authorities continued to seek him after he left and\n\nthat he would be harmed or killed if he returned.\n\n            The     IJ    determined    that    Singh's    testimony       was   not\n\ncredible.    She then considered the documentary evidence presented\n\nto \"determine whether they raise the level of evidence such that\n\nthe respondent's burden [of proving eligibility for asylum] will be\n\nmet.\"    After reviewing the documents, the IJ concluded that Singh\n\nhad not met his burden, and on May 2, 2000, denied his application\n\nfor all forms of relief and ordered Singh removed to India.\n\n            On May 16, 2000, Singh timely appealed to the BIA.\n\nDuring the pendency of his case, Singh had moved to Massachusetts\n\nand received an approved I-140 form filed on his behalf by the\n\nowner of a restaurant at which Singh was allegedly a cook.                   On May\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f8, 2002, Singh filed a motion with the BIA seeking remand of his\n\ncase to the IJ so that he could file an application for adjustment\n\nof status under 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).   Singh also moved for a change\n\nof venue from San Francisco to Boston.     The INS did not oppose\n\neither motion, and on July 29, 2002, the BIA granted both motions.\n\n          An immigration hearing was held in Boston on March 28,\n\n2003, to consider Singh's application for adjustment of status.\n\nThe Boston IJ found that Singh had provided false testimony and\n\ninformation both in connection with his application for asylum\n\nbefore the San Francisco IJ and adjustment of status before the\n\nBoston IJ; he was therefore inadmissible to the United States\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).   Based on this finding of\n\ninadmissibility, the IJ denied Singh's application for adjustment\n\nof status.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) (requiring admissibility as a\n\nprerequisite for adjustment of status relief).   The Boston IJ also\n\nreinstated the San Francisco IJ's decision denying the application\n\nfor asylum and allowed an appeal to be taken from that denial as\n\nwell as the denial of the application for adjustment of status.\n\n          Singh appealed both denials to the BIA on April 4, 2003.\n\nOn June 30, 2004, the BIA summarily affirmed both decisions without\n\nopinion, rendering the decisions of the IJs the final agency\n\ndeterminations for the purpose of appellate review.       8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1003.1(e)(4); see Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f                               II.\n\n          This petition comes to us after the passage of the REAL\n\nID Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 731, which alters, among\n\nother things, this court's standard of review of certain agency\n\ndeterminations and the burden of proof in asylum cases. The issues\n\nin this case do not call for application of the different standards\n\nunder the Act.   In particular, the provisions dealing with the\n\nburden of proof in asylum cases are not applicable to this case as\n\nSingh's petition was filed prior to the effective date of the\n\namendments.\n\n          Petitioner argues that neither of the IJ's conclusions\n\n(denial of asylum and denial of adjustment of status due to\n\ninadmissibility) is supported by substantial evidence.     He also\n\nmakes a denial of due process claim as to the conduct of the IJ in\n\nboth the San Francisco and Boston hearings which we dismiss as\n\nfrivolous.2\n\n\n\n     2\n      As to the San Francisco immigration proceedings, the\npetitioner argues that he was denied due process of law because the\nIJ's decision did not consider all of the relevant and probative\nevidence presented at the hearings and the IJ placed undue weight\non his demeanor during the hearing. As to the Boston immigration\nproceedings, he argues that the IJ was not impartial and drew \"only\nthe most negative conclusions\" about him and that the manner in\nwhich she stated her findings -- \"in a vacuum without explaining\nwhy she discounts the documents that the petitioner submitted\" --\nviolated due process.\n     Both of petitioner's challenges are completely undermined by\nthe record. A review of the record makes clear that the conduct of\nthe IJs did not violate the petitioner's due process rights; the\npetitioner received a full and fair hearing.\n\n                               -5-\n\fApplication for Asylum\n\n           The burden of proof for establishing eligibility for\n\nasylum lies with the petitioner.          See Diab v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d\n\n35, 39 (1st Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a).        Applicants can meet\n\nthis burden by proving past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution on account of \"race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\"         8\n\nU.S.C § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1).          An applicant's\n\ntestimony alone, \"if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the\n\nburden of proof without corroboration,\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a), but\n\nif   the   applicant   is   found    not    to   be   entirely   credible,\n\ncorroborating evidence \"may be used to bolster an applicant's\n\ncredibility.\"   Diab, 397 F.3d at 39.\n\n           The San Francisco IJ determined that Singh had not met\n\nhis burden of proof based largely on her finding that his testimony\n\nwas not credible and that the corroborating documentary evidence he\n\noffered to support his testimony conflicted with and tended to\n\ndiscredit his testimony further, rather than rehabilitate it.         The\n\npetitioner disagrees and argues that the IJ's credibility finding\n\nwas not supported by substantial evidence and that he has satisfied\n\nhis burden of proof to qualify for asylum relief under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1).\n\n           We review factual findings and credibility determinations\n\nmade by an IJ under the deferential substantial evidence standard.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fINS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992); Akinwande v.\n\nAshcroft, 380 F.3d 517, 522 (1st Cir. 2004).         This means that the\n\nIJ's determination must stand \"unless any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B); see Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).    As to issues of credibility, we will give great\n\ndeference to an IJ's determinations so long as the IJ provides\n\n\"specific reasons for those determinations.\"        Awinkwande, 380 F.3d\n\nat 522; see Syed v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 248, 251 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           There is no basis in the record to challenge the IJ's\n\nfinding.    She    articulated   four    specific   reasons   why   Singh's\n\ntestimony was not credible, each amply supported by the record.\n\nThese reasons included the findings that Singh tended to return to\n\na recitation of the story contained in his application for asylum,\n\nthat he had trouble answering specific questions which did not come\n\ndirectly from facts contained in the application, that he corrected\n\nhimself on several occasions, and that his testimony was internally\n\ninconsistent and implausible.     She then independently examined the\n\ndocuments in the record.     Those only reconfirmed the conclusion\n\nthat little of what Singh said was credible.          Indeed, the record\n\nvirtually compels the conclusion that what Singh presented was far\n\nfrom the truth and the untruths were deliberate.3\n\n\n     3\n      The IJ also correctly determined that the petitioner's claims\nfor withholding of removal and protection under the CAT failed.\nBecause Singh has not satisfied the more lenient asylum standard,\n\n                                   -7-\n\fApplication for Adjustment of Status4\n\n                 Under   8   U.S.C.   §   1255(i),   certain    aliens   who   are\n\nphysically present in the United States but have not been admitted\n\nor paroled are eligible to file an adjustment of status application\n\nwith       the    Attorney   General's     office.    Upon     receipt   of    this\n\napplication and the applicable fee, the Attorney General may adjust\n\nthe alien's status to permanent resident alien if \"(A) the alien is\n\neligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the\n\nUnited States for permanent residence; and (B) an immigrant visa is\n\nimmediately available to the alien at the time the application is\n\nfiled.\"          8 U.S.C. § 1255(i)(2)(emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\nhe also has failed to satisfy the withholding of removal standard.\nSee Albathani, 318 F.3d at 372. In addition, there is no credible\nallegation that it is more likely than not that he would be\ntortured if he returned to India; therefore, he cannot meet his\nburden for protection under the CAT. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2).\n     The United States argues that we do not have jurisdiction to\nreview these claims under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(i) because they were\nnot developed before the BIA and therefore have not been exhausted.\nWe disagree. Singh raised these challenges before the BIA (albeit\nin a perfunctory manner) and the BIA issued a summary affirmance of\nthe IJ's entire opinion, including her decision regarding the\nclaims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.\n       4\n      The United States correctly does not challenge our\njurisdiction to review the denial of the application for adjustment\nof status under 8 U.S.C § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). This provision limits\njudicial review of discretionary denials of adjustment of status\napplications.   In this case, the IJ denied Singh's application\nbased on a finding that he did not meet the statutory prerequisite\nof admissibility.    This is not a discretionary denial; it is\nmandated by the statute. 8 U.S.C. § 1252 does not limit our review\nover these types of denials.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f           An alien, in turn, is not admissible if he \"by fraud or\n\nwillfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has\n\nsought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or\n\nadmission into the United States or other benefit provided under\n\nthis chapter.\"     Id. § 1182(a)(6)(C); see Ymeri v. Ashcroft, 387\n\nF.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 2004).          8 U.S.C. § 1182(i)(1) gives the\n\nAttorney General discretion to waive this ground of inadmissibility\n\nin certain situations.      The IJ correctly determined that Singh did\n\nnot qualify for this waiver.       See Afful v. Ashcroft, 380 F.3d 1, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The   IJ's    legal   conclusions    as   to   admissibility   are\n\nreviewed   de    novo,    giving    proper     deference    to   the   BIA's\n\ninterpretation of the immigration laws.          See Gailius v. INS, 147\n\nF.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).        \"[A] decision that an alien is not\n\neligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless\n\nmanifestly contrary to law.\"       8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(4)(C).       Findings\n\nof willful misrepresentation are reviewed under the substantial\n\nevidence standard previously described. See Ymeri, 387 F.3d at 18.\n\nAs Singh has not been admitted into this country, he bears the\n\nburden of proving that he is not inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1182.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(2)(A); Ymeri, 387 F.3d at 17.\n\n           During the March 28, 2003 hearing, the Boston IJ found\n\nthe following:\n\n           [Singh] provided false information at the time\n           he applied for asylum.     He provided false\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          information again to the Immigration Judge in\n          sworn testimony on October 15, 1999. He has\n          apparently, in my view, proffered once again,\n          documents [which] were simply tailored to his\n          receiving benefits here in the United States.\n          I   believe  that   he   has   provided  false\n          information   not    only    in   his   asylum\n          application, but in connection with labor\n          certification, in connection with the I-140,\n          [and] in connection with his I-485 before this\n          court.\n\nIn a written decision she further explained her position stating,\n\n          I believe [Singh] has failed to establish\n          eligibility for any form of relief before this\n          Court insofar as I do not believe the document\n          that he submitted indicating that he worked as\n          a cook.    I do not believe [his] testimony\n          before this Court that he has been working as\n          a cook here in Cambridge. I do not believe\n          that the respondent testified truthfully\n          before the Court in San Francisco.\n\nThe IJ also found that these intentional misrepresentations were\n\nmade in an effort to receive the immigration benefits of asylum and\n\nadjustment of status in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C).\n\n          Petitioner argues that the Boston IJ's finding of willful\n\nmisrepresentation was not supported by substantial evidence because\n\nthe San Francisco IJ did not expressly find he made a willful\n\nmisrepresentation.   Although a negative credibility finding alone\n\nis not the equivalent of a finding of willful misrepresentation and\n\nthe one does not necessarily lead to the other, here, the Boston IJ\n\ncorrectly read the San Francisco IJ's lack of credibility finding\n\nas resting on deliberate falsification. More than that, the Boston\n\nIJ made her own findings that petitioner had lied in connection\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fwith his application for adjustment of status and on his employment\n\ncertification form.   We have reviewed the record and see no reason\n\nto detail each of his numerous incidents of deceit.    He lied and\n\ndid so repeatedly; that sealed his fate on admissibility.     Being\n\ninadmissible, he was not eligible for adjustment of status.\n\n          We affirm the denial of his various petitions.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

She then independently examined the documents in the record. Those only reconfirmed the conclusion that little of what Singh said was credible.

More than that, the Boston IJ made her own findings that petitioner had lied in connection with his application for adjustment of status and on his employment certification form.

In addition, there is no credible allegation that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to India; therefore, he cannot meet his burden for protection under the CAT. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The United States argues that we do not have jurisdiction to review these claims under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(5) because they were not developed before the BIA and therefore have not been exhausted.

In this case, the IJ denied Singh's application based on a finding that he did not meet the statutory prerequisite of admissibility.

She articulated four specific reasons why Singh's testimony was not credible, each amply supported by the record. These reasons included the findings that Singh tended to return to a recitation of the story contained in his application for asylum, that he had trouble answering specific questions which did not come directly from facts contained in the application, that he corrected himself on several occasions, and that his testimony was internally inconsistent and implausible. She then independently examined the documents in the record. Those only reconfirmed the conclusion that little of what Singh said was credible. Indeed, the record virtually compels the conclusion that what Singh presented was far from the truth and the untruths were deliberate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Application for Adjustment of Status</i>\n      <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i), certain aliens who are physically present in the United States but have not been admitted or paroled are eligible to file an adjustment of status application with the Attorney General's office. Upon receipt of this application and the applicable fee, the Attorney General may adjust the alien's status to permanent resident alien if \"(A) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is <i>admissible</i> to the United States for permanent residence; and (B) an immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i)(2)(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alien, in turn, is not admissible if he \"by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this chapter.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1182(a)(6)(C); <i>see Ymeri v.

The IJ correctly determined that Singh did not qualify for this waiver. <i>See Afful v.

Findings of willful misrepresentation are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard previously described. <i>See Ymeri,</i> 387 F.3d at 18. As Singh has not been admitted into this country, he bears the burden of proving that he is not inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(2)(A); <i>Ymeri,</i> 387 F.3d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the March 28, 2003 hearing, the Boston IJ found the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Singh] provided false information at the time he applied for asylum. He provided false information again to the Immigration Judge in sworn testimony on October 15, 1999. He has apparently, in my view, proffered once again, documents [which] were simply tailored to his receiving benefits here in the United States. I believe that he has provided false information not only in his asylum application, but in connection with labor certification, in connection with the I-140, [and] in connection with his I-485 before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a written decision she further explained her position stating,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe [Singh] has failed to establish eligibility for any form of relief before this Court insofar as I do not believe the document that he submitted indicating that he worked as a cook. I do not believe [his] testimony before this Court that he has been working as a cook here in Cambridge.

Although a negative credibility finding alone is not the equivalent of a finding of willful misrepresentation and the one does not necessarily lead to the other, here, the Boston IJ correctly read the San Francisco IJ's lack of credibility finding as resting on deliberate falsification. More than that, the Boston IJ made her own findings that petitioner had lied in connection with his application for adjustment of status and on his employment certification form. We have reviewed the record and see no reason to detail each of his numerous incidents of deceit. He lied and did so repeatedly; that sealed his fate on admissibility. Being inadmissible, he was not eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the denial of his various petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the United States on February 3, 2005.

As to the Boston immigration proceedings, he argues that the IJ was not impartial and drew \"only the most negative conclusions\" about him and that the manner in which she stated her findings &#8212;\"in a vacuum without explaining why she discounts the documents that the petitioner submitted\"&#8212;violated due process</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Both of petitioner's challenges are completely undermined by the record. A review of the record makes clear that the conduct of the IJs did not violate the petitioner's due process rights; the petitioner received a full and fair hearing.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The IJ also correctly determined that the petitioner's claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT failed. Because Singh has not satisfied the more lenient asylum standard, he also has failed to satisfy the withholding of removal standard<i>See Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 372. In addition, there is no credible allegation that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to India; therefore, he cannot meet his burden for protection under the CAT. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The United States argues that we do not have jurisdiction to review these claims under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(5) because they were not developed before the BIA and therefore have not been exhausted. We disagree. Singh raised these challenges before the BIA (albeit in a perfunctory manner) and the BIA issued a summary affirmance of the IJ's entire opinion, including her decision regarding the claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The United States correctly does not challenge our jurisdiction to review the denial of the application for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). This provision limits judicial review of discretionary denials of adjustment of status applications. In this case, the IJ denied Singh's application based on a finding that he did not meet the statutory prerequisite of admissibility. This is not a discretionary denial; it is mandated by the statute. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252 does not limit our review over these types of denials</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
