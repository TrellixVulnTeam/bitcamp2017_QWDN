Defendant-appellant\n\nCesar Acosta pled guilty to a one-count indictment charging him\n\nwith use and attempted use of one or more unauthorized access\n\ndevices in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1029(a)(2) and (b)(1).                        In\n\ndetermining      the    offense    level,      the   district     court   calculated\n\ntotal loss in excess of $20,000, sentencing Acosta to ten months\n\nimprisonment      and     three     years      of    supervised     release.        In\n\ncalculating restitution, the court considered suppressed evidence\n\nthat it had excluded from the loss calculation.                     Acosta appeals\n\nboth the    loss       amount,    with   its    resulting     offense     level,   and\n\nrestitution award.        We AFFIRM.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            A.    Facts\n\n            On October 2, 2000, Acosta used an American Express\n\ncard in the name of Nelson Barrera to purchase three $250 gift\n\ncards from a J.C. Penney store in Nashua, New Hampshire.                       Store\n\nsecurity    officer      Mark     Kidd   witnessed      the   purchase,     followed\n\nAcosta into the parking lot, and observed him enter the Sears\n\nstore.     Acosta’s purchase aroused Kidd’s suspicions because the\n\nstore had recently experienced losses arising from multiple gift\n\ncard purchases through counterfeit credit cards.                    At the time he\n\nobserved Acosta, Kidd was unaware that the defendant was using a\n\nfraudulent card.          Sears security videotaped Acosta as his card\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fwas   denied    when       he    attempted        to   purchase        similar      gift\n\ncertificates.       Kidd then observed Acosta enter a car, which, it\n\ndeveloped, was registered to Acosta’s girlfriend, Delva Castanos.\n\nSecurity Officer Kidd contacted American Express and learned that\n\nNelson Barrera was not a valid American Express account holder.\n\n            On October 14, 2000, Acosta purchased two more $250\n\ngift certificates from a Target store in Nashua, New Hampshire,\n\nusing a MasterCard also in the name of Nelson Barrera.                           Eleven\n\ndays later, investigators from the Nashua Police Department and\n\nSecret Service went to the apartment of Acosta’s girlfriend Delva\n\nCastanos.    Castanos identified the man in the Sears videotape as\n\nAcosta and consented to a search of her apartment and vehicle.\n\n            About    the    same   time,        Officer   Karen   Becotte      of    the\n\nNashua    Police    Department      stopped       Acosta    as    he    was    driving\n\nCastanos’s car in the parking garage of the building in which she\n\nhad an apartment.1          Acosta showed her a New Hampshire driver’s\n\nlicense in the name of Pedro Lozada.                   Becotte falsely informed\n\nAcosta that his vehicle was suspected of involvement in a hit-\n\nand-run   accident,        and   Acosta    accompanied      her    to    the     police\n\nstation in Castanos’s car.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The record suggests, but is not entirely clear, that Acosta\nwas driving out of the garage.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f           In an interview at the police station, Acosta admitted\n\nto the use of a number of aliases and stolen credit cards.                   He\n\nsaid he had obtained the cards from an individual he knew as \"Fat\n\nJohn.\"    He also indicated that Castanos's apartment contained\n\nevidence including items purchased with these cards, receipts,\n\nand   additional    fraudulent     credit    cards.     Acosta    accompanied\n\ninvestigators to the apartment, showed them the evidence, and\n\nprovided them with seventeen credit cards in several different\n\nnames.\n\n           Prior    to    Acosta’s   interrogation,     Officer     Kidd    also\n\nlearned of fraudulent credit card charges at a J.C. Penney store\n\nin Concord, New Hampshire, on February 21 and 22, 2000.                    These\n\ncharges, on a card issued to Rafael Vila, consisted of four $250\n\ngift card purchases and a $124.98 merchandise purchase, totaling\n\n$1,124.98.    The government linked Acosta to these transactions\n\nthrough his   use    of    an   American    Express   card   to   fraudulently\n\npurchase gift cards at a J.C. Penney in Salem, New Hampshire, on\n\nJanuary 10, 2000.         Later, an individual using the name Joseph\n\nTrimpin redeemed the J.C. Penney gift cards purchased by both\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fVila and Acosta at a store in Miami, Florida.2                          Through Trimpin’s\n\nactions, the government linked Acosta to the Vila transactions.\n\n                 B.    Procedural History\n\n                 On November 9, 2000, Acosta was indicted on one count\n\nof   possession          of,    with    intent     to   defraud,        fifteen    or     more\n\ncounterfeit or unauthorized access devices (credit cards), in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3).                       Acosta filed a motion to\n\nsuppress, arguing that he had been illegally arrested, questioned\n\nabsent Miranda warnings, and questioned after he had requested an\n\nattorney.        The district court granted the motion, suppressing all\n\nof   Acosta’s          statements      and   all    evidence       derived       therefrom,\n\nincluding        a     number    of    credit      cards    and    receipts       found    at\n\nCastanos’s apartment.              After this, the district court granted the\n\ngovernment’s motion to dismiss the indictment.                             On March 15,\n\n2001,      the        government       reindicted       Acosta     on     one     count     of\n\nfraudulently           using     and     attempting        to     \"use     one    or      more\n\nunauthorized access devices . . . including, but not limited to,\n\nAmerican Express Card # 371388014444020, to fraudulently obtain\n\nproperty and other items of [sic] with an aggregate value of more\n\nthan       one    thousand       dollars\"       between     January        1,     2000     and\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      Investigators also learned of various other unauthorized\nMasterCard and American Express charges that Acosta does not\ndispute on appeal.\n\n                                             -5-\n\fOctober 25, 2000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1029(a)(2) and\n\n(b)(1).        Acosta    filed    another         motion   to    suppress,        which   the\n\ndistrict   court        dismissed      as    moot     based      on    the   government’s\n\nrepresentations that it would not rely on any evidence covered by\n\nthe earlier suppression order to prove the charge in the second\n\nindictment.       The district court also dismissed as moot Acosta’s\n\nmotion    to    dismiss     or,       in    the    alternative,        for    a    bill    of\n\nparticulars      because       \"the    government      has      represented       that    the\n\nindictment’s reference to 'other access devices' refers to those\n\ncredit cards identified in its Objection to Defendant’s Motion to\n\nDismiss . . . and that its evidence will be limited to the access\n\ndevices identified in the indictment and in its objection.\"                               The\n\ngovernment      represented       in       this    motion       that   \"[n]one      of    the\n\ninformation       [in    the     second      indictment]         is    subject      to    the\n\nsuppression decision\" and that it would not attempt to use the\n\nsuppressed evidence without the court’s permission.\n\n               Acosta pled guilty to this new indictment and signed a\n\nbinding plea agreement stipulating that the amount of loss from\n\nhis charged conduct did not exceed $40,000.\n\n               The government also filed a sentencing memorandum with\n\nattachments in support of its sentencing positions.                          This report\n\nincorporated the results of a Secret Service inquiry into the use\n\nof American Express card number 371388014444020, which found that\n\n                                            -6-\n\fthe card had been legitimately issued to Olgamarina De Tunez of\n\nMiami, Florida.      The memo report contained a list of seventy-six\n\nfraudulent charges on this credit card.               Three entries reflected\n\nthe October 2 transactions that Officer Kidd had witnessed at the\n\nJ.C. Penney      store   in   Concord,       New   Hampshire.       Other    charges\n\nincluded transactions at Henri Bendel, a business in New York\n\nCity, on September 7, 2000; K-Mart in North Miami, Florida, and\n\nSam Goody in Salem, New Hampshire, all on September 14, 2000;\n\nSears Roebuck in Manchester, New Hampshire, on September 15,\n\n2000; Scoop East in New York City and Lenscrafters and Sears\n\nRoebuck in Nashua, New Hampshire, all on September 24, 2000; as\n\nwell   as   myriad       other   transactions        at     New    Hampshire      and\n\nMassachusetts     businesses.           The    fraudulent      charges      to    this\n\naccount,    an   account      known    to     investigators       prior   to     their\n\nobtaining the suppressed evidence on October 25, 2000, totaled\n\n$17,243.69.\n\n            At   sentencing,      the    district      court      ruled   that    the\n\nsuppressed evidence could not be used to calculate offense level\n\nbecause the police had acted \"egregious[ly]\" in obtaining it.\n\nThe court attributed the purchases made by Vila to Acosta and\n\nincluded them to calculate total loss.                   The court included the\n\n$1,124.98 in purchases by Vila, $17,243.69 in American Express\n\nCard   purchases,    $1,498.99        from    Acosta’s    fraudulent      use    of   a\n\n                                        -7-\n\fMasterCard,    and    $259.96   from   Acosta’s      purchases       at    Sears   to\n\ncalculate total loss for Acosta’s guideline range.                  The resulting\n\ntotal, $20,127.62, yielded a total offense level of ten with a\n\nguideline     sentencing   range      (GSR)   of    six    to     twelve    months.\n\nApplying a criminal history category of I, the court sentenced\n\nAcosta to ten months imprisonment and three years of supervised\n\nrelease.    It also ordered restitution of $37,756.30, an amount\n\nthat included the suppressed transactions.                 Without any defense\n\nobjection as to accuracy, the court adopted this restitution\n\nfigure from     the   government’s     August      23,    2001,    letter    to    the\n\nProbation Office, which referred to affidavits of loss provided\n\nby the credit card companies.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            Acosta    appeals   the    district     court’s       calculations      of\n\nloss, along with its resulting offense level, and restitution.\n\nOn loss, he contests both the $17,243.69 American Express figure,\n\narguing it should be $750.00, and the $1,124.98 figure, claiming\n\nno part of it should be attributed to him.                He contends that his\n\nsentence should be based on a loss figure of less than $5,000,\n\nresulting in an offense level of six, and a GSR of zero to six\n\nmonths.     He also contests the restitution amount, arguing that\n\nthe district court should not have considered the suppressed\n\ntransactions.      We reject both arguments.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\f            A.     Loss Calculation\n\n            Acosta       argues   that       the     district     court    erred    in\n\ncalculating his offense level by including unsuppressed credit\n\ncard charges that the government did not prove Acosta personally\n\nmade.     We review the district court’s findings of fact for clear\n\nerror.    United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nThis     Court    grants      great    deference       to   a     district   court’s\n\ncalculation of the amount of loss for sentencing purposes:\n\n             Calculating the amount of loss for purposes\n             of the sentencing guidelines is more an art\n             than a science. . . . [A] party dissatisfied\n             with the sentencing court's quantification of\n             the amount of loss in a particular case must\n             go a long way to demonstrate that the finding\n             is clearly erroneous.\n\nUnited    States    v.    Rostoff,     53    F.3d    398,   407   (1st    Cir.   1995)\n\n(citations omitted).           The government must prove the amount of\n\nloss under U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1 by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nUnited States v. Vaknin, 112 F.3d 579, 582-83 (1st Cir. 1997);\n\nUnited States v. Keifer, 198 F.3d 798, 800 (10th Cir. 1999).                       The\n\nsentencing       must    be   based   on     information     bearing      \"sufficient\n\nindicia    of     reliability     to       support    its   probable       accuracy.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 6A1.3(a), p.s. (2001).\n\n             Acosta argues that the district court and government\n\nwere merely speculating that he was the only person with access\n\nto the unauthorized American Express card number 371388014444020.\n\n                                            -9-\n\fHe points out that because the card was not a stolen card, but\n\nrather   a    card    manufactured     fraudulently       using   an     illegally-\n\nobtained card number, the likelihood was very low that a person\n\nwould go to the trouble of fraudulently obtaining a credit card\n\nnumber only to produce just one fake card and then take that card\n\nfrom Florida to New England to sell it.               Further, Acosta points\n\nout that when faced with evidence that the same credit card\n\nnumber was used on the same day at a K-Mart in North Miami,\n\nFlorida and at Sam Goody in Salem, New Hampshire, the government\n\nexplained the potential problem by saying that the Miami use was\n\nerroneously classified as fraudulent and was in fact a legitimate\n\ntransaction.3        Acosta argues that it is possible that other uses\n\nwere similarly classified as fraudulent by mistake.\n\n             Acosta     also   highlights     the   two    instances       where    a\n\nfraudulent card was used in New York and New Hampshire on the\n\nsame date to further suggest that another person was using the\n\nsame account number, and points out that no evidence was offered\n\nto   refute    this     possibility.        While   conceding      that     it     was\n\ntheoretically possible that the New York purchases were made by\n\ntelephone or that he traveled to both states on the same day,\n\nAcosta argues that these scenarios are highly unlikely and the\n\n\n\n     3\n      The Miami       charge   was   ultimately     excluded      from    the    loss\ncalculation.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fgovernment’s    evidence     linking      him    to     these    purchases     is\n\ninsufficient.\n\n            Accordingly,     Acosta    argues,         he    should    be     held\n\nresponsible    only   for   the   three    of    the    seventy-six    uses     of\n\nAmerican Express Card number 371388014444020 that occurred on\n\nOctober 2, 2000, at J.C. Penney in Nashua, New Hampshire.                       In\n\ncontrast, the government argued, and the court found, that all\n\nuses of this card, totaling $17,243.69, were attributable to\n\nAcosta.\n\n            At the sentencing hearing, the district court judge\n\nconcluded   that   the   government    had      met    its   burden   under    the\n\npreponderance of the evidence standard:\n\n            I find that the government has established by\n            a preponderance of the evidence that the\n            $17,243.69 of attributable losses is correct.\n            I’m satisfied that there’s no evidence that\n            there were multiple cards with the same\n            number. There’s certainly some questionable\n            charges   here,     but   there    are    myriad\n            explanations    as    to    how    that    could\n            happen.   .   .    .   [C]ertainly    it’s   not\n            inconceivable at all, in fact it’s very\n            plausible, that the defendant could easily\n            have made phone calls to these New York\n            Stores and ordered whatever was ordered. You\n            don’t have to be personally there. It could\n            be phone calls.     It could be whatever.     He\n            had the card in his possession.       He was in\n            the area. There’s no evidence that convinces\n            me or satisfies me that there’s a real\n            plausibility of another duplicate card out\n            there other than the original card, so I\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f            think the government’s met its burden                      of\n            proof with respect to that number.\n\nExcluding      the   suppressed        evidence     to        calculate     loss     for\n\nsentencing purposes, the court eliminated $2,831.31 and adopted\n\nthe $17,243.69 figure as charges to American Express card number\n\n371388014444020.        This excluded the Miami, Florida, charge.\n\n            Indeed,      most    of   the     charges    attributed         to    Acosta\n\noccurred    in   a   tight      geographical      area    -     New   Hampshire      and\n\nMassachusetts - and many were gift cards.                      The court concluded\n\nthat the preponderance of the evidence demonstrated Acosta likely\n\nmade the purchases.             Further, of the seventy-six transactions\n\ncharged to American Express card number 371388014444020, only\n\nthree   were     made    in     New   York,    which     is    outside      the    tight\n\ngeographical area.            The district court concluded that Acosta\n\ncould have made these charges himself, likely over the phone or\n\nin person.\n\n            Considering the argument that the purchases made on the\n\ncard issued to Vila should not be attributed to Acosta, the\n\ndistrict court recognized that the question was a \"close\" one but\n\ndetermined that the government had met its burden, establishing\n\n\"by a preponderance of the evidence . . . that [the] charge made\n\nby Mr. Vila, independently [of the] suppressed evidence, was made\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fby Mr. Acosta.\"4      The district court included this amount in the\n\ncalculation of loss.\n\n             Given the high level of deference we accord to a trial\n\ncourt’s     calculation   of    loss   for    sentencing   purposes   and   the\n\njudge’s reasoned explanations on both figures, we see no clear\n\nerror in the district court’s loss calculation.\n\n             B.   Restitution\n\n             Acosta argues that the district court erred in using\n\nthe suppressed evidence to calculate restitution.             We review this\n\nclaim of legal error de novo.          United States v. Collins, 209 F.3d\n\n1, 2 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1199\n\n(1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 618 (1st\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n\n\n\n     4\n         The district court explained:\n\n     I think it would certainly be demonstrable that Mr. Kidd\n     concluded, and certainly the Court would conclude, that\n     once it’s established that Barerra [sic] is Acosta and\n     Barrera has purchased gift certificates with a fraudulent\n     card, and the same modus operandi was used virtually\n     contemporaneously and the gift certificates were sent for\n     redemption to the same person at the same place in the\n     same state, virtually contemporaneously, for cashing in,\n     it’s certainly reasonable to draw the inference then that\n     the persons are the same people operating under different\n     names; that is Mr. Acosta.\n\n                                       -13-\n\f          1.     Use of Suppressed Evidence\n\n          This Circuit has yet to decide whether a court may use\n\nevidence suppressed under the Fourth Amendment in the context of\n\nSentencing Guidelines proceedings.        United States v. Raposa, 84\n\nF.3d 502, 503 (1st Cir. 1996) (addressing but declining to decide\n\nthe issue).      We have noted, however, that all the courts that\n\nhave addressed this issue have held that \"there is no blanket\n\nprohibition on the consideration of illegally seized evidence for\n\nthe   purposes    of   making    the   findings   required   under   the\n\nGuidelines.\"5    Id. at 504.     Indeed, ten other circuits have ruled\n\nthat in most circumstances, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary\n\nrule does not bar the introduction of suppressed evidence during\n\nsentencing proceedings.6        United States v. Ryan, 236 F.3d 1268,\n\n1271-72 (10th Cir. 2001) (citing United States v. Brimah, 214\n\n\n\n\n      Nevertheless, this rule has not been met with universal\n      5\n\n\nacclaim. Raposa, 84 F.3d at 505 (citing United States v. Jewel,\n947 F.2d 224, 238-40 (7th Cir. 1991) (Easterbrook, J., concurring);\nUnited States v. McCrory, 930 F.2d 63, 70-72 (D.C. Cir. 1991);\nWayne R. LaFave, 1 Search and Seizure § 1.6, at 40-41 (2d ed. Supp.\n1995)).\n\n      6\n      The only other circuit that has not yet addressed this issue\nafter the passage of the Sentencing Guidelines reached the same\nconclusion as the other Circuits in a pre-Guideline case. United\nStates v. Lee, 540 F.2d 1205, 1211 (4th Cir. 1976) (noting that\ndeterrent effect of extending the exclusionary rule to sentencing\n\"would be so minimal as to be insignificant\").\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fF.3d 854, 857-59 & n.4 (7th Cir. 2000) (holding exclusionary rule\n\nat sentencing should not bar introduction of evidence seized in\n\nviolation    of   Fourth    Amendment,     but   leaving    open    question   of\n\nwhether the rule applies when police intentionally act illegally\n\nto    enhance        defendant's     sentence);       United         States    v.\n\nTauil-Hernandez, 88 F.3d 576, 581 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding the\n\nexclusionary rule does not apply at sentencing); United States v.\n\nKim, 25 F.3d 1426, 1435 & n.8 (9th Cir. 1994) (admitting evidence\n\nfrom illegal search and seizure at sentencing, but leaving open\n\nthe   question       of    whether   the     rule    applies        when   police\n\nintentionally act illegally to enhance defendant's sentence or\n\nhad   an    \"undue     incentive\"    to     so   act);     United     States   v.\n\nMontoya-Ortiz, 7 F.3d 1171, 1181 & n.10 (5th Cir. 1993) (holding\n\nexclusionary      rule     is   generally    inapplicable      to     sentencing\n\nproceedings, but suggesting that illegally seized evidence could\n\nbe excluded if it was seized for the sole purpose of enhancing\n\ndefendant's sentence); United States v. Jenkins, 4 F.3d 1338,\n\n1344-45 (6th Cir. 1993) (permitting the use of illegally seized\n\nevidence after finding no indication that evidence was obtained\n\nto enhance defendant's sentence); United States v. Tejada, 956\n\nF.2d 1256, 1263 (2d Cir. 1992) (\"Absent a showing that officers\n\nobtained evidence expressly to enhance a sentence, a district\n\njudge may not refuse to consider relevant evidence at sentencing,\n\n                                     -15-\n\feven if that evidence has been seized in violation of the Fourth\n\nAmendment.\"); United States v. Lynch, 934 F.2d 1226, 1236-37 &\n\nn.15 (11th Cir. 1991) (admitting illegally obtained evidence and\n\nreserving question of whether suppression would be necessary if\n\nillegal search was done with purpose of increasing defendant's\n\nsentence); McCrory, 930 F.2d 63, 69 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (same);\n\nUnited   States    v.    Torres,    926    F.2d   321,    325   (3d    Cir.   1991)\n\n(same)).    Nine of these circuits have added or left open the\n\npossibility that the exclusionary rule will still apply if there\n\nis an indication that the police violated the defendant’s Fourth\n\nAmendment rights with the intent to secure an increased sentence.\n\nRyan, 236 F.3d at 1272; Brimah, 214 F.3d at 858 n.4; Kim, 25 F.3d\n\nat 1435 n.9; Montoya-Ortiz, 7 F.3d at 1181 n.10; Jenkins, 4 F.3d\n\nat 1345; Tejada, 956 F.2d at 1263; Torres, 926 F.2d at 325;\n\nLynch, 934 F.2d at 1237 n.15; McCrory, 930 F.2d at 69.\n\n           These       other   circuits    have   carefully     reasoned      that,\n\ninter alia, the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule does\n\nnot   outweigh    the     detrimental      effects   of    excluding     reliable\n\nevidence   on    the    court’s    ability   to   meet    its   goal    of    proper\n\nsentencing.       E.g., Tejada, 956 F.2d at 1262 (concluding that\n\nallowing   illegally       obtained       evidence   to    be    considered      at\n\nsentencing would not provide greater incentives for police to\n\nviolate the Fourth Amendment); Lynch, 934 F.2d at 1236-37.                     They\n\n                                      -16-\n\fhave also recognized that the sentencing court needs to have the\n\nfullest information available to fashion an appropriate remedy\n\nand that the Sentencing Guidelines allow the sentencing court to\n\nconsider,   without   limitation,    any    information   concerning    the\n\ndefendant’s background, character, or conduct.            E.g., McCrory,\n\n930 F.2d at 68; 18 U.S.C. § 3661 (2000);7 see also United States\n\nv. Robins, 978 F.2d 881, 891 (5th Cir. 1992) (noting that \"[i]t\n\nis a fundamental principle of sentencing that a district court\n\nmay conduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either\n\nas to the kind of information it may consider, or the source from\n\nwhich    such   information   may   come\"   (citing   United   States    v.\n\nCampbell, 684 F.2d 141, 152 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).\n\n            While never having spoken directly on this issue, the\n\nSupreme Court has recognized the exclusionary rule as\n\n            a judicially created remedy designed to\n            safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally\n            through its deterrent effect, rather than a\n            personal constitutional right of the party\n            aggrieved.    Despite its broad deterrent\n\n\n\n     7\n      18 U.S.C. § 3661 provides, \"No limitation shall be placed on\nthe information concerning the background, character, and conduct\nof a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United\nStates may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence.\"    The district court’s discretion is not\nunlimited in scope, however.     Brimah, 214 F.3d at 856 (citing\nU.S.S.G. §§ 5H1.1-1.6, 5H1.10, which list factors including, inter\nalia, age, education, and race, that are not relevant in sentencing\ndeterminations).\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f               purpose, the exclusionary rule has never been\n               interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally\n               seized evidence in all proceedings or against\n               all persons.\n\nUnited States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348 (1974) (weighing the\n\ndeterrent effect of the exclusionary rule on police misconduct\n\nagainst the potential benefit of extending the rule to grand jury\n\nproceedings).\n\n               It    is       clear    that   in     sentencing,       consideration     of\n\nevidence suppressed under the Fourth Amendment is \"consistent\n\nwith the caselaw on the exclusionary rule and follows the well-\n\nestablished practice of receiving evidence relevant to sentencing\n\nfrom a broad spectrum of sources.\"                         Torres, 926 F.2d at 325.\n\nGiven    the    great         weight    of    the    precedent       and     following   the\n\nunanimous, reasoned approach of our sister circuits, we hold that\n\nthe exclusionary rule does not bar the use of evidence seized in\n\nviolation       of        a     defendant’s         Fourth        Amendment     rights    in\n\nsentencing.8          We        leave    open      the     question     of    whether    the\n\nexclusionary        rule       would    bar   the    use     of    evidence    when   police\n\nintentionally act in violation of the Fourth Amendment in order\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      We note that the evidence suppressed by the district court\nincluded both credit cards and receipts seized in violation of\nAcosta’s Fourth Amendment rights and statements investigators\nobtained from Acosta in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.\nThe dispute before us for restitution purposes concerns only the\nsuppressed credit card receipts.\n\n                                              -18-\n\fto increase a defendant’s sentence.                 Therefore, the district\n\ncourt was not required to exclude the suppressed evidence in the\n\ncontext of sentencing in this case, even though it chose to do so\n\nin calculating the loss.           This is not a case where the officers\n\nacted with intent to enhance Acosta’s sentence.                     The district\n\ncourt   found    no    such   intent     and    neither   side     disputes   this\n\nconclusion.      Determining that the district court could properly\n\nhave considered the suppressed evidence in Acosta’s sentencing\n\nproceedings, we next examine whether the restitution order was\n\notherwise valid.\n\n            2.   Legal Requirements of a Restitution Order\n\n            The Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA) authorizes\n\na district court to order \"in addition to or . . . in lieu of any\n\nother     penalty     authorized    by    law,    that    the     defendant   make\n\nrestitution to any victim\" of the offense.                18 U.S.C. § 3663(a).\n\nThe purpose behind the statute is to \"insure that the wrongdoer\n\nmake good[], to the degree possible, the harm he has caused to\n\nthe victim.\"        Vaknin, 112 F.3d at 582 (citation and internal\n\nquotations omitted) (alteration in original).                   The Supreme Court\n\nhas held that this statute limits restitution awards to \"the loss\n\ncaused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense\n\nof conviction.\"         Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 413\n\n(1990).     In addition, where the criminal conduct includes \"an\n\n                                         -19-\n\foffense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or\n\npattern of criminal activity,\" a victim is defined as \"any person\n\ndirectly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course\n\nof the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\"                   18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2)\n\n(2000).     In such cases, the district court may order restitution\n\nwithout regard to whether the conduct that harmed the victim was\n\nconduct   underlying           the    offense   of    conviction.        E.g.,     United\n\nStates v. Hensley, 91 F.3d 274, 277 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n             It     is   undisputed        that      restitution    is     part    of      a\n\nsentence.     See, e.g., United States v. Wallen, 953 F.2d 3, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 1991) (referring to restitution imposed by the court as\n\n\"part of [the defendant’s] sentence\"); 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(A)\n\n(\"The court, when sentencing a defendant . . . may order . . .\n\nthat the defendant make restitution\" (emphasis added)).                             Thus,\n\nunder the VWPA and Hughey, the suppressed evidence in this case\n\nmay be included in the restitution award only if (1) the offense\n\ninvolved a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity;\n\nor (2) the evidence represents conduct that was the basis of the\n\noffense of conviction.               We address each issue in turn.\n\n             a.     Scheme or Conspiracy\n\n             Under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2), any conduct that is in\n\nthe   course      of     the    scheme,     conspiracy,      or     pattern       may    be\n\nconsidered     in      calculating       restitution.       Thus,     if    this        case\n\n                                           -20-\n\finvolved a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity,\n\nthe district court could properly include the suppressed evidence\n\nin the restitution order regardless of whether it was conduct of\n\nconviction.\n\n            It is clear from the record that the offense with which\n\nAcosta was charged was not one involving a scheme, conspiracy, or\n\npattern of criminal activity.          Acosta pled guilty to \"knowingly\n\nand with intent to defraud traffic[king] in or us[ing] one or\n\nmore unauthorized access devises during any one-year period, and\n\nby such conduct obtain[ing] anything of value aggregating $1,000\n\nor more during that period.\"            18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(2).            It is\n\nclear that this offense does not include as an element a scheme,\n\nconspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity.                United States v.\n\nBlake, 81 F.3d 498, 506 (4th Cir. 1996) (stating that the offense\n\nof fraudulent use of unauthorized access devices in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(2) does not \"include as an element a scheme,\n\nconspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity\").\n\n            b.    Conduct of Conviction\n\n            We now turn to the question of whether the suppressed\n\ncredit    cards   represented    conduct     that   was    the   basis    of   the\n\noffense of conviction.          Surprisingly, none of the proceedings\n\nbelow considered whether this evidence was conduct of conviction.\n\nRather,    this    evidence     was    treated      as    \"relevant      conduct\"\n\n                                      -21-\n\fthroughout.9            The    distinction       between     relevant   conduct    and\n\nconduct underlying the offense of conviction is an important one.\n\nUnless the offense involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy,\n\nor pattern of criminal activity, relevant conduct may not be\n\ntaken into account for calculation of restitution; only conduct\n\nof conviction may be considered.                     United States v. Benjamin, 30\n\nF.3d       196,   198    &    n.1     (1st    Cir.    1994).       Nevertheless,   the\n\nresponsibility          to    bring    this    issue    to   the   court’s   attention\n\nrested with the defendant.                   Because Acosta failed to raise the\n\nissue below, he has forfeited it; we therefore review the court’s\n\nuse of the suppressed evidence in calculating restitution for\n\nplain error only.             United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-32\n\n(1993).       Establishing plain error requires a four-part showing:\n\n\"that there was error; that it was plain; that the error affected\n\nthe defendant's substantial rights; and that the error adversely\n\n\n       9\n      In the Presentence Report (PSR), the suppressed transactions\nare listed under the heading \"Offense Conduct,\" along with a\nnotation that the evidence was suppressed. The PSR refers to the\nsuppressed transactions as \"relevant conduct to the offense of\nconviction.\"    In the Addendum to the Presentence Report, the\nProbation Office stated that the suppressed transactions were \"part\nof the same course of conduct to the offense of conviction.\" The\ngovernment referred to the suppressed evidence seized from\nCastanos’s apartment as \"relevant conduct\" in both its sentencing\nmemorandum and its letter to the Probation Office listing the\nrestitution amounts requested.    The district court adopted this\nletter as an exhibit and used the amounts in it to order\nrestitution. The Presentence Report also referred to these items\nas relevant conduct.\n\n                                              -22-\n\fimpacted the fairness, integrity, or public repute of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"      United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   We see no plain error here.\n\n           Acosta argues that in light of the references to the\n\nsuppressed transactions as relevant conduct below, and the fact\n\nthat the   government’s    proffer    at   the   change   of   plea   hearing\n\nincluded only the unsuppressed evidence, the evidence does not\n\nsupport the argument that the suppressed credit cards represented\n\nconduct of conviction.         He further contends that because the\n\ndistrict   court    declined   to    use   the   suppressed    evidence    in\n\ncalculating the offense level as a due process matter because the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fviolation of his rights was \"egregious,\" it should likewise not\n\nhave used the evidence to calculate restitution.10\n\n                The government counters that the district court could\n\nhave         found    that   the     suppressed   transactions      were     conduct\n\nunderlying           the   offense   to   which   Acosta   pled    guilty.      The\n\nindictment to which Acosta pled guilty was very broad,11 charging\n\n\n\n       10\n      In excluding the suppressed evidence                        from   the    loss\ncalculation, the district court reasoned:\n\n                I think I'm satisfied that, given the totality\n                of the circumstances, the fact that the\n                violation of the defendant's constitutional\n                rights was egregious, that the suppressed\n                evidence as a matter of due process should not\n                be used to enhance his sentence under the\n                applicable Sentencing Guidelines. I don't find\n                that the police officers had an intent to\n                enhance the sentence. . . . However, the\n                violations are egregious, and I think the\n                purposes underlying the exclusionary rule are\n                well served . . . where we have egregious\n                violations and where the evidence, having been\n                suppressed in one case, is attempted to be used\n                in a subsequent case to enhance the punishment.\n\n        11\n      At least in the scheme context, other circuits have\ndetermined the full amount of restitution authorized by statute by\n\"look[ing] to the scope of the indictment, which in turn defines\nthe scope of the criminal scheme for restitution purposes.\" United\nStates v. Ross, 279 F.3d 600, 609 (8th Cir. 2002) (internal\ncitations and quotations omitted) (alteration in original); United\nStates v. Ramirez, 196 F.3d 895, 900 (8th Cir. 1999) (noting that\nother circuits agree in the criminal scheme context, the indictment\ndefines the scope of the scheme for restitution purposes (citing\nUnited States v. Henoud, 81 F.3d 484, 488 (4th Cir. 1996) and cases\ncited)); United States v. Jackson, 155 F.3d 942, 949-50 (8th Cir.\n1998); United States v.

It specifically noted that\n\nthis conduct included, but was \"not limited to,\" American Express\n\ncard number 371388014444020.       The government points out that\n\ncharging the use of more than one credit card to obtain the\n\nstatutory jurisdictional amount of $1,000 is common practice.\n\n            Further, the government argues, Acosta’s reliance on\n\nHughey, 495 U.S. 411 (1990), to contend that the loss associated\n\nwith the suppressed evidence is not conduct of conviction, is\n\nmisplaced.    In Hughey, the defendant pled guilty to one count of\n\na multi-count indictment for using stolen credit cards.      Id. at\n\n413.    The Supreme Court reversed the district court’s restitution\n\norder because it had included the use of other credit cards to\n\nwhich the defendant had not pled guilty.    Id. at 422.12   Here, in\n\ncontrast, Acosta pled guilty to one charge of using one or more\n\ncards during a ten-month period.    The government argues that this\n\ncharge included all possible credit cards connected to him during\n\nthis time frame.      From discovery, Acosta was aware that the\n\ngovernment would introduce proof of his other use of cards.      The\n\n\n       12\n      Congress responded to Hughey by expanding the scope of the\nVWPA to include as victims those harmed by an offense that involves\na scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity as an\nelement. 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2).\n\n                                -25-\n\fgovernment argues that although it agreed not to introduce the\n\nsuppressed evidence, at sentencing, the district court could have\n\nconsidered that evidence conduct of conviction.\n\n           We reject Acosta’s arguments and find no plain error in\n\nthe   district    court’s    use    of    the    suppressed         evidence   in   the\n\nrestitution calculation.           We do not equate the district court’s\n\nrefusal   to    use   the   evidence      in    the    loss   calculation      with   a\n\ndetermination that the suppressed transactions were not part of\n\nthe offense of conviction.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, the district court expressed\n\nconcern   for    Acosta’s    right       to    due    process   and    excluded     the\n\nillegally obtained evidence from its calculation.                     This, however,\n\ndid not   remove      the   evidence      itself      from    the   offense    conduct\n\nactually charged in the indictment.                   A district court \"need not\n\nmake open-court findings on the statutory factors when issuing a\n\nrestitution order so long as the record on appeal reveals that\n\nthe judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced\n\nhis considerations of those factors.\"                    Neal, 36 F.3d at 1200\n\n(citing Savoie, 985 F.2d at 618).               The district court adequately\n\nexplained that the policies underlying its decision to apply the\n\nexclusionary rule in calculating offense level were different\n\nfrom the strong policy considerations underlying the victims’\n\nright to compensation:\n\n                                         -26-\n\f         I’m not sure the police misconduct should\n         inure to the detriment of a victim with\n         respect to the restitution.   That’s a whole\n         different pathway of legal social policy\n         issues to be considered.   It’s one thing to\n         say we’re not going to use evidence obtained\n         through police misconduct for the purpose of\n         enhancing your incarcerative sentence. It’s\n         quite another thing to say to an innocent\n         victim we’re going to use police misconduct\n         for the purposes of depriving you of your\n         right to restitution. . . . I think the\n         policies underlying my decision to apply the\n         exclusionary rule here would apply only to\n         the   punishment   with   respect   to   the\n         incarcerative sentence.\n\n          Had   the   district   court   considered   the   suppressed\n\nevidence in sentencing (as our preceding analysis shows it could\n\nproperly have done), it could have calculated an offense level\n\nbased on all the transactions – suppressed and unsuppressed.\n\nProhibiting the court from using this same evidence to calculate\n\nrestitution would lead to the absurd result that although the\n\ndefendant could have been serving a sentence based in part on the\n\nsuppressed offenses, the victims of these offenses would not\n\nreceive compensation for their losses.       Neither Hughey nor the\n\nVWPA, whose objective is to compensate a wide class of victims\n\nfor their losses, could have intended such an outcome.\n\n          The record is clear that the district court examined\n\nthe factors surrounding the charges in the government’s letter to\n\nthe Probation Office listing its requested restitution amounts.\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fThe letter, prepared from affidavits of actual loss submitted by\n\nthe   victim      credit     card    companies,       included       the    suppressed\n\nevidence.        Although    the     letter    (and    PSR)    referred      to    these\n\ntransactions as \"relevant conduct,\" the government argues that\n\nthey fall within the scope of Acosta’s criminal conduct in the\n\nindictment and further support the contention that the suppressed\n\nevidence    was    conduct    that    was     the    basis    for    the    offense    of\n\nconviction.       Acosta did not dispute the accuracy of the amounts\n\nin the letter; his objection rested on his argument that the\n\nsuppressed evidence should not be used to calculate restitution.\n\n            As    the   government      points       out,    the    language      of   the\n\nindictment is broad enough to encompass Acosta’s criminal conduct\n\nof using both the suppressed and unsuppressed credit cards in the\n\nten-month     period    it    covers.         See,    e.g.,        United   States     v.\n\nSilkowski, 32 F.3d 682, 689 (2d Cir. 1984) (noting that defendant\n\nmust pay restitution only for losses \"directly caused by conduct\n\nwithin the temporal limits of the offense of conviction\"); United\n\nStates v. Bailey, 975 F.2d 1028, 1033 (4th Cir. 1992) (upholding\n\nrestitution award to investors not mentioned in indictment and\n\ndistinguishing Hughey where the offense of \"defrauding investors\n\nof monies in excess of fifteen million dollars\" was \"defined\n\nbroadly in the indictment\"); see also United States v. Pepper, 51\n\nF.3d 469, 473 (5th Cir. 1995) (holding the dates specified in the\n\n                                        -28-\n\findictment, along with a description of the unlawful conduct in a\n\nscheme or defraud case, were sufficiently specific to satisfy\n\nHughey); United States v. Wise, 990 F.2d 1545, 1548 (10th Cir.\n\n1992) (holding the district court erred in ordering restitution\n\nin excess of the specific amount to which the defendant pled\n\nguilty); cf. United States v. Akande, 200 F.3d 136, 142-43 (3rd\n\nCir.   1999)    (vacating    restitution     order    for   losses   caused   by\n\nconduct that fell outside the dates of the offense where the\n\nindictment listed the time frame as \"on or about December 31,\n\n1997,\" but the plea agreement and colloquy established that the\n\noffense charged did not occur before December 31, 1997); United\n\nStates v. Hayes, 32 F.3d 171, 172-73 (5th Cir. 1994) (vacating\n\nrestitution order for losses incurred before the date of the\n\noffense of conviction); United States v.

The suppressed transactions clearly fell\n\nwithin the description of the offense and the time frame of the\n\nconduct of use or attempted use of unauthorized access devices\n\nduring a ten-month period to which Acosta pled guilty.\n\n                                      -29-\n\f            To summarize, the district court was not barred from\n\nusing the suppressed evidence in calculating restitution as part\n\nof   Acosta’s      sentence.       We   are   satisfied    that    the    indictment\n\nadequately      detailed     the   offense      of    conviction   to    enable   the\n\ndistrict     court,     in     ordering       restitution,    to    consider      the\n\nsuppressed evidence as that underlying the conduct of conviction.\n\nWe   are   satisfied     that      although     the    district    court    did   not\n\nexplicitly say it was considering the suppressed evidence conduct\n\nof conviction, it did in fact do so and therefore did not err in\n\nits restitution calculation.            Accordingly, we hold that there was\n\nno plain error in the district court’s use of the suppressed\n\nevidence to calculate restitution.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n             The    district    court’s       calculations    of   both    loss   and\n\nrestitution are AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\f",

Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 2, 2000, Acosta used an American Express card in the name of Nelson Barrera to purchase three $250 gift cards from a J.C. Penney store in Nashua, New Hampshire. Store security officer Mark Kidd witnessed the purchase, followed Acosta into the parking lot, and observed him enter the Sears store. Acosta's purchase aroused Kidd's suspicions because the store had recently experienced losses arising from multiple gift card purchases through counterfeit credit cards. At the time he observed Acosta, Kidd was unaware that the defendant was using a fraudulent card. Sears security videotaped Acosta as his card was denied when he attempted to purchase similar gift certificates. Kidd then observed Acosta enter a car, which, it developed, was registered to Acosta's girlfriend, Delva Castanos. Security Officer Kidd contacted American Express and learned that Nelson Barrera was not a valid American Express account holder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 2000, Acosta purchased two more $250 gift certificates from a Target store in Nashua, New Hampshire, using a MasterCard also in the name of Nelson Barrera. Eleven days later, investigators from the Nashua Police Department and Secret Service went to the apartment of Acosta's girlfriend Delva Castanos. Castanos identified the man in the Sears videotape as Acosta and consented to a search of her apartment and vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the same time, Officer Karen Becotte of the Nashua Police Department stopped Acosta as he was driving Castanos's car in the parking garage of the building in which she had an apartment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Acosta showed her a New Hampshire driver's license in the name of Pedro Lozada. Becotte falsely informed Acosta that his vehicle was suspected of involvement in a hit-and-run accident, and Acosta accompanied her to the police station in Castanos's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an interview at the police station, Acosta admitted to the use of a number of aliases and stolen credit cards. He said he had obtained the cards from an individual he knew as \"Fat John.\" He also indicated that Castanos's apartment contained evidence including items purchased with these cards, receipts, and additional fraudulent credit cards. Acosta accompanied investigators to the apartment, showed them the evidence, and provided them with seventeen credit cards in several different names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to Acosta's interrogation, Officer Kidd also learned of fraudulent credit card charges at a J.C. Penney store in Concord, New Hampshire, on February 21 and 22, 2000. These charges, on a card issued to Rafael Vila, consisted of four $250 gift card purchases and a $124.98 merchandise purchase, totaling $1,124.98. The government linked Acosta to these transactions through his use of an American Express card to fraudulently purchase gift cards at a J.C. Penney in Salem, New Hampshire, on January 10, 2000. Later, an individual using the name Joseph Trimpin redeemed the J.C. Penney gift cards purchased by both Vila and Acosta at a store in Miami, Florida.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Through Trimpin's actions, the government linked Acosta to the Vila transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 9, 2000, Acosta was indicted on one count of possession of, with intent to defraud, fifteen or more counterfeit or unauthorized access devices (credit cards), in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3). Acosta filed a motion to suppress, arguing that he had been illegally arrested, questioned absent <i>Miranda</i> warnings, and questioned after he had requested an attorney. The district court granted the motion, suppressing all of Acosta's statements and all evidence derived therefrom, including a number of credit cards and receipts found at Castanos's apartment. After this, the district court granted the government's motion to dismiss the indictment. On March 15, 2001, the government reindicted Acosta on one count of fraudulently using and attempting to \"use one or more unauthorized access devices ... including, but not limited to, American Express Card # 371388014444020, to fraudulently obtain property and other items of [sic] with an aggregate value of more than one thousand dollars\" between January 1, 2000 and October 25, 2000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1029(a)(2) and (b)(1). Acosta filed another motion to suppress, which the district court dismissed as moot based on the government's representations that it would not rely on any evidence covered by the earlier suppression order to prove the charge in the second indictment. The district court also dismissed as moot Acosta's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for a bill of particulars because \"the government has represented that the indictment's reference to `other access devices' refers to those credit cards identified in its Objection to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss ... and that its evidence will be limited to the access devices identified in the indictment and in its objection.\" The government represented in this motion that \"[n]one of the information [in the second indictment] is subject to the suppression decision\" and that it would not attempt to use the suppressed evidence without the court's permission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta pled guilty to this new indictment and signed a binding plea agreement stipulating that the amount of loss from his charged conduct did not exceed $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also filed a sentencing memorandum with attachments in support of its sentencing positions. This report incorporated the results of a Secret Service inquiry into the use of American Express card number 371388014444020, which found that the card had been legitimately issued to Olgamarina De Tunez of Miami, Florida. The memo report contained a list of seventy-six fraudulent charges on this credit card. Three entries reflected the October 2 transactions that Officer Kidd had witnessed at the J.C. Penney store in Concord, New Hampshire. Other charges included transactions at Henri Bendel, a business in New York City, on September 7, 2000; K-Mart in North Miami, Florida, and Sam Goody in Salem, New Hampshire, all on September 14, 2000; Sears Roebuck in Manchester, New Hampshire, on September 15, 2000; Scoop East in New York City and Lenscrafters and Sears Roebuck in Nashua, New Hampshire, all on September 24, 2000; as well as myriad other transactions at New Hampshire and Massachusetts businesses. The fraudulent charges to this account, an account known to investigators prior to their obtaining the suppressed evidence on October 25, 2000, totaled $17,243.69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court ruled that the suppressed evidence could not be used to calculate offense level because the police had acted \"egregious[ly]\" in obtaining it. The court attributed the purchases made by Vila to Acosta and included them to calculate total loss. The court included the $1,124.98 in purchases by Vila, $17,243.69 in American Express Card purchases, $1,498.99 from Acosta's fraudulent use of a MasterCard, and $259.96 from Acosta's purchases at Sears to calculate total loss for Acosta's guideline range. The resulting total, $20,127.62, yielded a total offense level of ten with a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of six to twelve months. Applying a criminal history category of I, the court sentenced Acosta to ten months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. It also ordered restitution of $37,756.30, an amount that included the suppressed transactions. Without any defense objection as to accuracy, the court adopted this restitution figure from the government's August 23, 2001, letter to the Probation Office, which referred to affidavits of loss provided by the credit card companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta appeals the district court's calculations of loss, along with its resulting offense level, and restitution. On loss, he contests both the $17,243.69 American Express figure, arguing it should be $750.00, and the $1,124.98 figure, claiming no part of it should be attributed to him. He contends that his sentence should be based on a loss figure of less than $5,000, resulting in an offense level of six, and a GSR of zero to six months. He also contests the restitution amount, arguing that the district court should not have considered the suppressed transactions. We reject both arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Loss Calculation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta argues that the district court erred in calculating his offense level by including unsuppressed credit card charges that the government did not prove Acosta personally made. We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error. <i>United States v. Brewster,</i> 1 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir.1993). This Court grants great deference to a district court's calculation of the amount of loss for sentencing purposes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calculating the amount of loss for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is more an art than a science....

He points out that because the card was not a stolen card, but rather a card manufactured fraudulently using an illegally-obtained card number, the likelihood was very low that a person would go to the trouble of fraudulently obtaining a credit card number only to produce just one fake card and then take that card from Florida to New England to sell it. Further, Acosta points out that when faced with evidence that the same credit card number was used on the same day at a K-Mart in North Miami, Florida and at Sam Goody in Salem, New Hampshire, the government explained the potential problem by saying that the Miami use was erroneously classified as fraudulent and was in fact a legitimate transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Acosta argues that it is possible that other uses were similarly classified as fraudulent by mistake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta also highlights the two instances where a fraudulent card was used in New York and New Hampshire on the same date to further suggest that another person was using the same account number, and points out that no evidence was offered to refute this possibility. While conceding that it was theoretically possible that the New York purchases were made by telephone or that he traveled to both states on the same day, Acosta argues that these scenarios are highly unlikely and the government's evidence linking him to these purchases is insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, Acosta argues, he should be held responsible only for the three of the seventy-six uses of American Express Card number 371388014444020 that occurred on October 2, 2000, at J.C. Penney in Nashua, New Hampshire. In contrast, the government argued, and the court found, that all uses of this card, totaling $17,243.69, were attributable to Acosta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court judge concluded that the government had met its burden under the preponderance of the evidence standard:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that the government has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the $17,243.69 of attributable losses is correct. I'm satisfied that there's no evidence that there were multiple cards with the same number. There's certainly some questionable charges here, but there are myriad explanations as to how that could happen.... [C]ertainly it's not inconceivable at all, in fact it's very plausible, that the defendant could easily have made phone calls to these New York Stores and ordered whatever was ordered. You don't have to be personally there. It could be phone calls. It could be whatever. He had the card in his possession. He was in the area. There's no evidence that convinces me or satisfies me that there's a real plausibility of another duplicate card out there other than the original card, so I think the government's met its burden of proof with respect to that number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Excluding the suppressed evidence to calculate loss for sentencing purposes, the court eliminated $2,831.31 and adopted the $17,243.69 figure as charges to American Express card number 371388014444020. This excluded the Miami, Florida, charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, most of the charges attributed to Acosta occurred in a tight geographical area &#8212; New Hampshire and Massachusetts &#8212; and many were gift cards. The court concluded that the preponderance of the evidence demonstrated Acosta likely made the purchases. Further, of the seventy-six transactions charged to American Express card number 371388014444020, only three were made in New York, which is outside the tight geographical area. The district court concluded that Acosta could have made these charges himself, likely over the phone or in person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the argument that the purchases made on the card issued to Vila should not be attributed to Acosta, the district court recognized that the question was a \"close\" one but determined that the government had met its burden, establishing \"by a preponderance of the evidence... that [the] charge made by Mr. Vila, independently [of the] suppressed evidence, was made by Mr. Acosta.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court included this amount in the calculation of loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the high level of deference we accord to a trial court's calculation of loss for sentencing purposes and the judge's reasoned explanations on both figures, we see no clear error in the district court's loss calculation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Nine of these circuits have added or left open the possibility that the exclusionary rule will still apply if there is an indication that the police violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights with the intent to secure an increased sentence. <i>Ryan,</i> 236 F.3d at 1272; <i>Brimah,</i> 214 F.3d at 858 n. 4; <i>Kim,</i> 25 F.3d at 1435 n. 9; <i>Montoya-Ortiz,</i> 7 F.3d at 1181 n. 10; <i>Jenkins,</i> 4 F.3d at 1345; <i>Tejada,</i> 956 F.2d at 1263; <i>Torres,</i> 926 F.2d at 325; <i>Lynch,</i> 934 F.2d at 1237 n. 15; <i>McCrory,</i> 930 F.2d at 69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These other circuits have carefully reasoned that, inter alia, the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule does not outweigh the detrimental effects of excluding reliable evidence on the court's ability to meet its goal of proper sentencing. <i>E.g., Tejada,</i> 956 F.2d at 1262 (concluding that allowing illegally obtained evidence to be considered at sentencing would not provide greater incentives for police to violate the Fourth Amendment); <i>Lynch,</i> 934 F.2d at 1236-37.

Given the great weight of the precedent and following the unanimous, reasoned approach of our sister circuits, we hold that the exclusionary rule does not bar the use of evidence seized in violation of a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights in sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> We leave open the question of whether the exclusionary rule would bar the use of evidence when police intentionally act in violation of the Fourth Amendment in order to increase a defendant's sentence. Therefore, the district court was not required to exclude the suppressed evidence in the context of sentencing in this case, even though it chose to do so in calculating the loss. This is not a case where the officers acted with intent to enhance Acosta's sentence. The district court found no such intent and neither side disputes this conclusion. Determining that the district court could properly have considered the suppressed evidence in Acosta's sentencing proceedings, we next examine whether the restitution order was otherwise valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Legal Requirements of a Restitution Order</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA) authorizes a district court to order \"in addition to or ... in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to any victim\" of the offense. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a). The purpose behind the statute is to \"insure that the wrongdoer make good[], to the degree possible, the harm he has caused to the victim.\" <i>Vaknin,</i> 112 F.3d at 582 (citation and internal quotations omitted) (alteration in original). The Supreme Court has held that this statute limits restitution awards to \"the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.\" <i>Hughey v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 411, 413, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990). In addition, where the criminal conduct includes \"an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity,\" a victim is defined as \"any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a)(2) (2000). In such cases, the district court may order restitution without regard to whether the conduct that harmed the victim was conduct underlying the offense of conviction. <i>E.g., United States v. Hensley,</i> 91 F.3d 274, 277 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that restitution is part of a sentence. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Wallen,</i> 953 F.2d 3, 4 (1st Cir.1991) (referring to restitution imposed by the court as \"part of [the defendant's] sentence\"); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a)(1)(A) (\"The court, <i>when sentencing</i> a defendant... may order ... that the defendant make restitution\" (emphasis added)). Thus, under the VWPA and <i>Hughey,</i> the suppressed evidence in this case may be included in the restitution award only if (1) the offense involved a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity; or (2) the evidence represents conduct that was the basis of the offense of conviction.

Thus, if this case involved a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, the district court could properly include the suppressed evidence in the restitution order regardless of whether it was conduct of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from the record that the offense with which Acosta was charged was not one involving a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity. Acosta pled guilty to \"knowingly and with intent to defraud traffic[king] in or us[ing] one or more unauthorized access devises during any one-year period, and by such conduct obtain[ing] anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more during that period.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(2). It is clear that this offense does not include as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity. <i>United States v. Blake,</i> 81 F.3d 498, 506 (4th Cir.1996) (stating that the offense of fraudulent use of unauthorized access devices in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(2) does not \"include as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Surprisingly, none of the proceedings below considered whether this evidence was conduct of conviction. Rather, this evidence was treated as \"relevant conduct\" throughout.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The distinction between relevant conduct and conduct underlying the offense of conviction is an important one. Unless the offense involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, relevant conduct may not be taken into account for calculation of restitution; only conduct of conviction may be considered. <i>United States v. Benjamin,</i> 30 F.3d 196, 198 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.1994). Nevertheless, the responsibility to bring this issue to the court's attention rested with the defendant. Because Acosta failed to raise the issue below, he has forfeited it; we therefore review the court's use of the suppressed evidence in calculating restitution for plain error only. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Establishing plain error requires a four-part showing: \"that there was error; that it was plain; that the error affected the defendant's substantial rights; and that the error adversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or public repute of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000). We see no plain error here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta argues that in light of the references to the suppressed transactions as relevant conduct below, and the fact that the government's proffer at the change of plea hearing included only the unsuppressed evidence, the evidence does not support the argument that the suppressed credit cards represented conduct of conviction. He further contends that because the district court declined to use the suppressed evidence in calculating the offense level as a due process matter because the violation of his rights was \"egregious,\" it should likewise not have used the evidence to calculate restitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government counters that the district court could have found that the suppressed transactions were conduct underlying the offense to which Acosta pled guilty. The indictment to which Acosta pled guilty was very broad,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> charging him with using and attempting to use \"one or more unauthorized access devices\" during a ten-month period and obtaining value of at least $1,000 from this conduct. It specifically noted that this conduct included, but was \"not limited to,\" American Express card number 371388014444020. The government points out that charging the use of more than one credit card to obtain the statutory jurisdictional amount of $1,000 is common practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the government argues, Acosta's reliance on <i>Hughey,</i> 495 U.S. 411, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990), to contend that the loss associated with the suppressed evidence is not conduct of conviction, is misplaced. In <i>Hughey,</i> the defendant pled guilty to one count of a multi-count indictment for using stolen credit cards. <i>Id.</i> at 413. The Supreme Court reversed the district court's restitution order because it had included the use of other credit cards to which the defendant had not pled guilty. <i>Id.</i> at 422.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Here, in contrast, Acosta pled guilty to one charge of using one or more cards during a ten-month period. The government argues that this charge included all possible credit cards connected to him during this time frame. From discovery, Acosta was aware that the government would introduce proof of his other use of cards. The government argues that although it agreed not to introduce the suppressed evidence, at sentencing, the district court could have considered that evidence conduct of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Acosta's arguments and find no plain error in the district court's use of the suppressed evidence in the restitution calculation. We do not equate the district court's refusal to use the evidence in the loss calculation with a determination that the suppressed transactions were not part of the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court expressed concern for Acosta's right to due process and excluded the illegally obtained evidence from its calculation. This, however, did not remove the evidence itself from the offense conduct actually charged in the indictment. A district court \"need not make open-court findings on the statutory factors when issuing a restitution order so long as the record on appeal reveals that the judge made implicit findings or otherwise adequately evinced his considerations of those factors.\" <i>Neal,</i> 36 F.3d at 1200 (citing <i>Savoie,</i> 985 F.2d at 618). The district court adequately explained that the policies underlying its decision to apply the exclusionary rule in calculating offense level were different from the strong policy considerations underlying the victims' right to compensation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm not sure the police misconduct should inure to the detriment of a victim with respect to the restitution. That's a whole different pathway of legal social policy issues to be considered. It's one thing to say we're not going to use evidence obtained through police misconduct for the purpose of enhancing your incarcerative sentence. It's quite another thing to say to an innocent victim we're going to use police misconduct for the purposes of depriving you of your right to restitution.... I think the policies underlying my decision to apply the exclusionary rule here would apply only to the punishment with respect to the incarcerative sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the district court considered the suppressed evidence in sentencing (as our preceding analysis shows it could properly have done), it could have calculated an offense level based on all the transactions &#8212; suppressed and unsuppressed. Prohibiting the court from using this same evidence to calculate restitution would lead to the absurd result that although the defendant could have been serving a sentence based in part on the suppressed offenses, the victims of these offenses would not receive compensation for their losses. Neither <i>Hughey</i> nor the VWPA, whose objective is to compensate a wide class of victims for their losses, could have intended such an outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is clear that the district court examined the factors surrounding the charges in the government's letter to the Probation Office listing its requested restitution amounts. The letter, prepared from affidavits of actual loss submitted by the victim credit card companies, included the suppressed evidence. Although the letter (and PSR) referred to these transactions as \"relevant conduct,\" the government argues that they fall within the scope of Acosta's criminal conduct in the indictment and further support the contention that the suppressed evidence was conduct that was the basis for the offense of conviction. Acosta did not dispute the accuracy of the amounts in the letter; his objection rested on his argument that the suppressed evidence should not be used to calculate restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government points out, the language of the indictment is broad enough to encompass Acosta's criminal conduct of using both the suppressed and unsuppressed credit cards in the ten-month period it covers. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Silkowski,</i> 32 F.3d 682, 689 (2d Cir.1994) (noting that defendant must pay restitution only for losses \"directly caused by conduct within the temporal limits of the offense of conviction\"); <i>United States v.

Hayes,</i> 32 F.3d 171, 172-73 (5th Cir.1994) (vacating restitution order for losses incurred before the date of the offense of conviction); <i>United States v.

The suppressed transactions clearly fell within the description of the offense and the time frame of the conduct of use or attempted use of unauthorized access devices during a ten-month period to which Acosta pled guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, the district court was not barred from using the suppressed evidence in calculating restitution as part of Acosta's sentence. We are satisfied that the indictment adequately detailed the offense of conviction to enable the district court, in ordering restitution, to consider the suppressed evidence as that underlying the conduct of conviction. We are satisfied that although the district court did not explicitly say it was considering the suppressed evidence conduct of conviction, it did in fact do so and therefore did not err in its restitution calculation. Accordingly, we hold that there was no plain error in the district court's use of the suppressed evidence to calculate restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

In determining the offense level, the district court calculated total loss in excess of $20,000, sentencing Acosta to ten months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. In calculating restitution, the court considered suppressed evidence that it had excluded from the loss calculation. Acosta appeals both the loss amount, with its resulting offense level, and restitution award. We AFFIRM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 2, 2000, Acosta used an American Express card in the name of Nelson Barrera to purchase three $250 gift cards from a J.C. Penney store in Nashua, New Hampshire. Store security officer Mark Kidd witnessed the purchase, followed Acosta into the parking lot, and observed him enter the Sears store. Acosta's purchase aroused Kidd's suspicions because the store had recently experienced losses arising from multiple gift card purchases through counterfeit credit cards. At the time he observed Acosta, Kidd was unaware that the defendant was using a fraudulent card. Sears security videotaped Acosta as his card was denied when he attempted to purchase similar gift certificates. Kidd then observed Acosta enter a car, which, it developed, was registered to Acosta's girlfriend, Delva Castanos. Security Officer Kidd contacted American Express and learned that Nelson Barrera was not a valid American Express account holder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 14, 2000, Acosta purchased two more $250 gift certificates from a Target store in Nashua, New Hampshire, using a MasterCard also in the name of Nelson Barrera. Eleven days later, investigators from the Nashua Police Department and Secret Service went to the apartment of Acosta's girlfriend Delva Castanos. Castanos identified the man in the Sears videotape as Acosta and consented to a search of her apartment and vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About the same time, Officer Karen Becotte of the Nashua Police Department stopped Acosta as he was driving Castanos's car in the parking garage of the building in which she had an apartment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Acosta showed her a New Hampshire driver's license in the name of Pedro Lozada. Becotte falsely informed Acosta that his vehicle was suspected of involvement in a hit-and-run accident, and Acosta accompanied her to the police station in Castanos's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an interview at the police station, Acosta admitted to the use of a number of aliases and stolen credit cards. He said he had obtained the cards from an individual he knew as \"Fat John.\" He also indicated that Castanos's apartment contained evidence including items purchased with these cards, receipts, and additional fraudulent credit cards. Acosta accompanied investigators to the apartment, showed them the evidence, and provided them with seventeen credit cards in several different names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to Acosta's interrogation, Officer Kidd also learned of fraudulent credit card charges at a J.C. Penney store in Concord, New Hampshire, on February 21 and 22, 2000. These charges, on a card issued to Rafael Vila, consisted of four $250 gift card purchases and a $124.98 merchandise purchase, totaling $1,124.98. The government linked Acosta to these transactions through his use of an American Express card to fraudulently purchase gift cards at a J.C. Penney in Salem, New Hampshire, on January 10, 2000. Later, an individual using the name Joseph Trimpin redeemed the J.C. Penney gift cards purchased by both Vila and Acosta at a store in Miami, Florida.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Through Trimpin's actions, the government linked Acosta to the Vila transactions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 9, 2000, Acosta was indicted on one count of possession of, with intent to defraud, fifteen or more counterfeit or unauthorized access devices (credit cards), in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3). Acosta filed a motion to suppress, arguing that he had been illegally arrested, questioned absent <i>Miranda</i> warnings, and questioned after he had requested an attorney. The district court granted the motion, suppressing all of Acosta's statements and all evidence derived therefrom, including a number of credit cards and receipts found at Castanos's apartment. After this, the district court granted the government's motion to dismiss the indictment. On March 15, 2001, the government reindicted Acosta on one count of fraudulently using and attempting to \"use one or more unauthorized access devices ... including, but not limited to, American Express Card # 371388014444020, to fraudulently obtain property and other items of [sic] with an aggregate value of more than one thousand dollars\" between January 1, 2000 and October 25, 2000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1029(a)(2) and (b)(1). Acosta filed another motion to suppress, which the district court dismissed as moot based on the government's representations that it would not rely on any evidence covered by the earlier suppression order to prove the charge in the second indictment. The district court also dismissed as moot Acosta's motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for a bill of particulars because \"the government has represented that the indictment's reference to `other access devices' refers to those credit cards identified in its Objection to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss ... and that its evidence will be limited to the access devices identified in the indictment and in its objection.\" The government represented in this motion that \"[n]one of the information [in the second indictment] is subject to the suppression decision\" and that it would not attempt to use the suppressed evidence without the court's permission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta pled guilty to this new indictment and signed a binding plea agreement stipulating that the amount of loss from his charged conduct did not exceed $40,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also filed a sentencing memorandum with attachments in support of its sentencing positions. This report incorporated the results of a Secret Service inquiry into the use of American Express card number 371388014444020, which found that the card had been legitimately issued to Olgamarina De Tunez of Miami, Florida. The memo report contained a list of seventy-six fraudulent charges on this credit card. Three entries reflected the October 2 transactions that Officer Kidd had witnessed at the J.C. Penney store in Concord, New Hampshire. Other charges included transactions at Henri Bendel, a business in New York City, on September 7, 2000; K-Mart in North Miami, Florida, and Sam Goody in Salem, New Hampshire, all on September 14, 2000; Sears Roebuck in Manchester, New Hampshire, on September 15, 2000; Scoop East in New York City and Lenscrafters and Sears Roebuck in Nashua, New Hampshire, all on September 24, 2000; as well as myriad other transactions at New Hampshire and Massachusetts businesses. The fraudulent charges to this account, an account known to investigators prior to their obtaining the suppressed evidence on October 25, 2000, totaled $17,243.69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court ruled that the suppressed evidence could not be used to calculate offense level because the police had acted \"egregious[ly]\" in obtaining it. The court attributed the purchases made by Vila to Acosta and included them to calculate total loss. The court included the $1,124.98 in purchases by Vila, $17,243.69 in American Express Card purchases, $1,498.99 from Acosta's fraudulent use of a MasterCard, and $259.96 from Acosta's purchases at Sears to calculate total loss for Acosta's guideline range. The resulting total, $20,127.62, yielded a total offense level of ten with a guideline sentencing range (GSR) of six to twelve months. Applying a criminal history category of I, the court sentenced Acosta to ten months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. It also ordered restitution of $37,756.30, an amount that included the suppressed transactions. Without any defense objection as to accuracy, the court adopted this restitution figure from the government's August 23, 2001, letter to the Probation Office, which referred to affidavits of loss provided by the credit card companies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta appeals the district court's calculations of loss, along with its resulting offense level, and restitution. On loss, he contests both the $17,243.69 American Express figure, arguing it should be $750.00, and the $1,124.98 figure, claiming no part of it should be attributed to him. He contends that his sentence should be based on a loss figure of less than $5,000, resulting in an offense level of six, and a GSR of zero to six months. He also contests the restitution amount, arguing that the district court should not have considered the suppressed transactions. We reject both arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Loss Calculation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta argues that the district court erred in calculating his offense level by including unsuppressed credit card charges that the government did not prove Acosta personally made. We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error. <i>United States v.

The government must prove the amount of loss under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1 by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>United States v. Vaknin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197346\"><a href=\"/opinion/197346/united-states-v-vaknin/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 582-83 (1st Cir. 1997); <i>United States v.

The sentencing must be based on information bearing \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a), p.s. (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta argues that the district court and government were merely speculating that he was the only person with access to the unauthorized American Express card number 371388014444020. He points out that because the card was not a stolen card, but rather a card manufactured fraudulently using an illegally-obtained card number, the likelihood was very low that a person would go to the trouble of fraudulently obtaining a credit card number only to produce just one fake card and then take that card from Florida to New England to sell it. Further, Acosta points out that when faced with evidence that the same credit card number was used on the same day at a K-Mart in North Miami, Florida and at Sam Goody in Salem, New Hampshire, the government explained the potential problem by saying that the Miami use was erroneously classified as fraudulent and was in fact a legitimate transaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Acosta argues that it is possible that other uses were similarly classified as fraudulent by mistake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acosta also highlights the two instances where a fraudulent card was used in New York and New Hampshire on the same date to further suggest that another person was using the same account number, and points out that no evidence was offered to refute this possibility. While conceding that it was theoretically possible that the New York purchases were made by telephone or that he traveled to both states on the same day, Acosta argues that these scenarios are highly unlikely and the government's evidence linking him to these purchases is insufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, Acosta argues, he should be held responsible only for the three of the seventy-six uses of American Express Card number 371388014444020 that occurred on October 2, 2000, at J.C. Penney in Nashua, New Hampshire. In contrast, the government argued, and the court found, that all uses of this card, totaling $17,243.69, were attributable to Acosta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court judge concluded that the government had met its burden under the preponderance of the evidence standard:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that the government has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the $17,243.69 of attributable losses is correct. I'm satisfied that there's no evidence that there were multiple cards with the same number. There's certainly some questionable charges here, but there are myriad explanations as to how that could happen.... [C]ertainly it's not inconceivable at all, in fact it's very plausible, that the defendant could easily have made phone calls to these New York Stores and ordered whatever was ordered. You don't have to be personally there. It could be phone calls. It could be whatever. He had the card in his possession. He was in the area. There's no evidence that convinces me or satisfies me that there's a real plausibility of another duplicate card out there other than the original card, so I think the government's met its burden of proof with respect to that number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Excluding the suppressed evidence to calculate loss for sentencing purposes, the court eliminated $2,831.31 and adopted the $17,243.69 figure as charges to American Express card number 371388014444020. This excluded the Miami, Florida, charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, most of the charges attributed to Acosta occurred in a tight geographical area &#8212; New Hampshire and Massachusetts &#8212; and many were gift cards.

In <i>Hughey,</i> the defendant pled guilty to one count of a multi-count indictment for using stolen credit cards. <i>Id.</i> at 413.

The government argues that this charge included all possible credit cards connected to him during this time frame. From discovery, Acosta was aware that the government would introduce proof of his other use of cards.

The district court adequately explained that the policies underlying its decision to apply the exclusionary rule in calculating offense level were different from the strong policy considerations underlying the victims' right to compensation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm not sure the police misconduct should inure to the detriment of a victim with respect to the restitution. That's a whole different pathway of legal social policy issues to be considered. It's one thing to say we're not going to use evidence obtained through police misconduct for the purpose of enhancing your incarcerative sentence. It's quite another thing to say to an innocent victim we're going to use police misconduct for the purposes of depriving you of your right to restitution.... I think the policies underlying my decision to apply the exclusionary rule here would apply only to the punishment with respect to the incarcerative sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the district court considered the suppressed evidence in sentencing (as our preceding analysis shows it could properly have done), it could have calculated an offense level based on all the transactions &#8212; suppressed and unsuppressed. Prohibiting the court from using this same evidence to calculate restitution would lead to the absurd result that although the defendant could have been serving a sentence based in part on the suppressed offenses, the victims of these offenses would not receive compensation for their losses. Neither <i>Hughey</i> nor the VWPA, whose objective is to compensate a wide class of victims for their losses, could have intended such an outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is clear that the district court examined the factors surrounding the charges in the government's letter to the Probation Office listing its requested restitution amounts. The letter, prepared from affidavits of actual loss submitted by the victim credit card companies, included the suppressed evidence. Although the letter (and PSR) referred to these transactions as \"relevant conduct,\" the government argues that they fall within the scope of Acosta's criminal conduct in the indictment and further support the contention that the suppressed evidence was conduct that was the basis for the offense of conviction. Acosta did not dispute the accuracy of the amounts in the letter; his objection rested on his argument that the suppressed evidence should not be used to calculate restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government points out, the language of the indictment is broad enough to encompass Acosta's criminal conduct of using both the suppressed and unsuppressed credit cards in the ten-month period it covers. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Silkowski,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676493\"><a href=\"/opinion/676493/united-states-v-ralph-j-silkowski/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span>, 689 (2d Cir.1994) (noting that defendant must pay restitution only for losses \"directly caused by conduct within the temporal limits of the offense of conviction\"); <i>United States v.

The suppressed transactions clearly fell within the description of the offense and the time frame of the conduct of use or attempted use of unauthorized access devices during a ten-month period to which Acosta pled guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, the district court was not barred from using the suppressed evidence in calculating restitution as part of Acosta's sentence. We are satisfied that the indictment adequately detailed the offense of conviction to enable the district court, in ordering restitution, to consider the suppressed evidence as that underlying the conduct of conviction. We are satisfied that although the district court did not explicitly say it was considering the suppressed evidence conduct of conviction, it did in fact do so and therefore did not err in its restitution calculation. Accordingly, we hold that there was no plain error in the district court's use of the suppressed evidence to calculate restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.
