Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n               Selya and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jeffrey B.

Shah, Assistant United States Attorneys, were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\n\n                         February 9, 2011\n\f            THOMPSON, Circuit Judge.   A federal grand jury indicted\n\nStiven Polanco on heroin-trafficking and firearm charges.     After\n\nthe district judge denied Polanco's motion to suppress a cache of\n\nincriminating evidence found in his car and apartment, a jury\n\nconvicted him on all counts.   His appeal presents three questions:\n\nWere the searches legal?     Was a DEA agent's testimony about how\n\nmuch heroin an addict could use in a day admissible?1    And was the\n\nevidence underpinning his conviction for aiding and abetting the\n\ndistribution of heroin sufficient?        We answer \"yes\" to these\n\nquestions and affirm Polanco's conviction.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n            Facts\n\n            Consistent with the standard protocol, we summarize the\n\nkey facts in the light most compatible with the verdict.        See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Troy, 618 F.3d 27, 29 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n            In the fall of 2008, a joint task force comprising\n\nfederal and local law enforcement agents zeroed in on a suspected\n\ndrug dealer, David Contreras. Posing as a lobsterman from Newport,\n\ntask force member Seth Godek bought heroin from Contreras four\n\ntimes over a two-month stretch from October through November 2008.\n\nEach deal took place at the Providence Place Mall, an upscale\n\nshopping center in downtown Providence. December was shaping up to\n\nbe more of the same.    During a recorded phone call on December 2,\n\n\n     1\n         DEA is the acronym for Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f2008, Contreras agreed to sell Godek 20 grams of heroin for $1,500.\n\nSpeaking in code, they said they would do the deal at the Mall on\n\nDecember 3.      Phone records show that Contreras and Polanco called\n\neach other a total of six times later that day.                 That was not\n\nunusual.    Records show they called each other nine times on the day\n\nof the December 3 deal, for example.\n\n            With Polanco at his side, Contreras came to the Mall as\n\npromised.    They sat in the food court and waited for Godek.               When\n\nGodek got there, Contreras told Polanco that he and Godek had to go\n\nto a nearby restroom – an area Contreras knew had no Mall security\n\ncameras.    Once there, Contreras swapped the heroin for the cash.\n\nPolanco    and   Godek   then   traded    nods   as   Godek   walked   on    by.\n\nContreras headed back to where Polanco was sitting, counting the\n\nmoney.    A surveillance camera caught Contreras and Polanco huddled\n\naround a table.     They ate lunch and then left the Mall in Polanco's\n\nred Toyota Camry.\n\n            Contreras and Godek talked again on December 9.             Godek\n\nasked for 100 grams of heroin.             He said he would pay $6,500.\n\nContreras said okay, and they agreed to rendezvous at the Mall's\n\nfood court on December 10.         Within minutes of hanging up with\n\nGodek, Contreras called Polanco. Records show a total of six calls\n\nbetween the two on December 9.           Records also show that Contreras\n\ncalled Polanco early on December 10, right after he had gotten off\n\nthe phone with Godek.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f             Agents wanted to arrest Contreras and anyone else tied to\n\nthe heroin scheme.       Contreras and Polanco showed up at the food\n\ncourt on December 10 right on cue.             But agents were concerned that\n\narresting the two in a crowded Mall might endanger others, so they\n\nchanged plans on the fly. Godek called Contreras and convinced him\n\nto do the deal at a parking lot in Warwick, Rhode Island.                     Polanco\n\nand Contreras drove to the new locale.                 Contreras was not happy.\n\n\"I have the stuff,\" he told Godek during one of their many calls.\n\n\"You better come get it.\"        Contreras said he was in a red Camry,\n\nparked with the lights on.\n\n             And so he was, sitting in the passenger seat beside\n\ndriver Polanco.       Agents arrived on the scene and arrested the two\n\non the spot.      They found no heroin on either man.                    Heavy rains\n\ncame,   so   agents    drove   Polanco's       Camry    to   a    DEA    office.     A\n\nwarrantless search of the car there revealed a hidden compartment\n\ninside an armrest that contained 94.1 grams of heroin (just shy of\n\nthe   agreed-on    amount)     and   a    loaded    handgun.            To   open   the\n\ncompartment, one had to use an electric motor to release a tension\n\nstrap so that the armrest would lift up.                         Needless to say,\n\ncontraptions like this do not come standard with Camrys.\n\n             Polanco told agents that he lived in a basement apartment\n\nat 422 Plainfield Street in Providence.                  His parents owned the\n\nbuilding and lived upstairs.             Agents then secured a warrant for\n\nPolanco's quarters and used the keys he had given them to get in.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fThey hit pay dirt:          hidden above the ceiling tiles agents found\n\n12.7 grams of heroin, plastic baggies (perfect for packaging\n\nheroin), a digital scale with heroin residue, two coffee grinders\n\n(perfect for grinding heroin), eleven rounds of ammunition, and\n\n$140 in marked bills that had passed from Godek to Contreras during\n\nthe December 3 deal (they also came across $860 in unmarked\n\ncurrency).\n\n            Proceedings\n\n            In short order, a grand jury returned a four-count\n\nindictment charging Polanco with conspiring with Contreras to\n\npossess and distribute 100 grams or more of heroin (count 1),\n\naiding and abetting Contreras in the December 3 heroin-distribution\n\nscheme (count 2), possessing with intent to distribute 100 grams or\n\nmore of heroin on December 10 (count 3), and possessing a firearm\n\nin furtherance of drug-trafficking crimes (count 4). See 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§   841(a)(1),     (b)(1)(B),      (b)(1)(C),      846   and   18   U.S.C.   §§   2,\n\n924(c)(1)(A).       Pleading not guilty, Polanco filed a motion to\n\nsuppress.          Calling    the     warrantless         search     of   his      car\n\nunconstitutional, Polanco argued that had the agents not illegally\n\nrummaged through his auto, they would not have had enough probable\n\ncause to get a search warrant for his apartment.                   So he asked the\n\ndistrict judge to suppress everything seized. After an evidentiary\n\nhearing,     the    judge    found     the    car     search     constitutionally\n\npermissible under the auto exception to the Fourth Amendment's\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fwarrant requirement, see United States v. Dickerson, 514 F.3d 60,\n\n66 (1st Cir. 2008) (permitting \"a warrantless search of a car if\n\nthere is probable cause to believe\" that it has \"contraband or\n\nevidence of a crime\") – which ruined Polanco's fruit-of-the-\n\npoisonous-tree argument concerning the apartment search.\n\n             The trial lasted two days.         A parade of agents discussed\n\nthe ins and outs of what had happened.           One also discussed how many\n\nbags of heroin most addicts purchase for personal use.                 At the end\n\nof    the   prosecution's    case,    Polanco     moved    for   a    judgment   of\n\nacquittal, which the judge denied.              Polanco opted not to present\n\nany evidence on his own behalf, and the jury found him guilty of\n\nall   charges.      The    judge   later     sentenced    him    to   120   months,\n\ncomprising concurrent sentences of 60 months each on counts 1-3 and\n\na consecutive 60-month sentence on count 4.               This appeal followed.\n\n             We   will    disclose    additional    details      as   we    discuss\n\nspecific issues.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\n             Legal Searches\n\n             Polanco insists that the district judge stumbled in\n\ndenying his suppression motion.            We review the judge's ruling de\n\nnovo, except that we assess his factual findings (which Polanco\n\ndoes not really contest) only for clear error and will affirm his\n\nruling if \"'any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.'\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fUnited States v. Bater, 594 F.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Mendez-de Jesus, 85 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n           Polanco protests that the judge failed to see that\n\nArizona v. Gant, 129 S. Ct. 1710 (2009), signals a rollback of the\n\nauto exception. Gant, he says, limits warrantless vehicle searches\n\nto situations where an arrestee is unsecured and close enough to\n\nthreaten officer safety or destroy evidence.                    And, his argument\n\ncontinues, agents had him in a cell when they combed the car for\n\nevidence at a secure location, so the search offended the Fourth\n\nAmendment.\n\n              This is a dead-end argument.                 Gant dealt with the\n\nsearch-incident-to-arrest doctrine in the vehicle context.                      Pre-\n\nGant, officers could conduct a warrantless search of \"the passenger\n\ncompartment of [the arrestee's] automobile\" under that doctrine.\n\nNew York v. Belton, 453 U.S. 454, 460 (1981).                    Some courts even\n\npermitted searches \"when . . . the handcuffed arrestee ha[d]\n\nalready left the scene.\"          Thornton v. United States, 541 U.S. 615,\n\n628 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (collecting\n\ncases   reading       Belton    broadly).        But   Gant    clarified    that   an\n\nautomobile search may fall within the search-incident-to-arrest\n\ndoctrine only in two very specific situations:                  \"when the arrestee\n\nis   unsecured    and     within      reaching    distance      of   the   passenger\n\ncompartment      at    the     time   of   the   search\"      (the   officer-safety\n\njustification), or \"when it is 'reasonable to believe evidence\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\frelevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle'\"\n\n(the evidence-preservation justification).              Gant, 129 S. Ct. at\n\n1719 (quoting Thornton, 541 U.S. at 632 (Scalia, J., concurring in\n\nthe judgment)).     Gant also noted that officers may conduct vehicle\n\nsearches under other doctrines.          Id. at 1721.\n\n            Our case does not involve the search-incident-to-arrest\n\nexception, however.      As the district judge noted, the government\n\nhad jettisoned any search-incident-to-arrest theory before the\n\nsuppression hearing.       Only the auto exception matters here – an\n\nexception that provides that \"[i]f there is probable cause to\n\nbelieve a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity,\" agents\n\ncan search without a warrant \"any area of the vehicle in which the\n\nevidence may be found.\" Id. (discussing United States v. Ross, 456\n\nU.S. 798, 820-21 (1982)). And, critically, Gant did not scrap that\n\nexception.    See id.    That is not just our opinion:         every circuit\n\nthat has considered the issue to date has either concluded or\n\nassumed that the auto exception survived under Gant.                See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Arriaza, No. 09-4957, 2010 WL 4813775, at *2 (4th\n\nCir. Nov. 24, 2010) (unpublished); United States v. Aguilera, 625\n\nF.3d 482, 485-86 (8th Cir. 2010); United States v. Hinojosa, No.\n\n09-10969,    2010   WL   3257768,   at    *1   (5th   Cir.   Aug.   16,   2010)\n\n(unpublished); United States v. Vinton, 594 F.3d 14, 25 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2010); United States v. Stotler, 591 F.3d 935, 940 (7th Cir. 2010).\n\nWe assumed as much in United States v. Bucci, 582 F.3d 108, 117\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f(1st Cir. 2009).     Now that the issue is directly before us we turn\n\nthat assumption into a holding.\n\n            Before we go further, we add a few words of caution.            The\n\nauto exception is distinct from the evidence-preservation component\n\nof   Gant's       search-incident-to-arrest         analysis     (which     for\n\nsimplicity's sake we call the Gant evidentiary justification).               We\n\ngive two examples only.           The auto exception extends beyond the\n\ncrime of arrest.          See Gant, 129 S. Ct. at 1721.         But the Gant\n\nevidentiary justification does not extend to evidence of other\n\noffenses.       See id.     Also, the auto exception requires probable\n\ncause.     See id.        But the Gant evidentiary justification only\n\nrequires    a    \"reasonable     basis.\"      See   id.   at   1719.      These\n\ndistinctions make a difference.            And, for obvious reasons, it is\n\nimportant to keep them straight.\n\n            Now    back     to   Polanco.      Measured   against      the auto\n\nexception's regime, Polanco's challenge comes up short.                Consider\n\nwhat agents knew before the December 10 car search.             The December\n\n3 heroin deal had gone down at the Mall's food court and involved\n\nContreras, Polanco, and Polanco's Camry, and the December 10 deal\n\nwas set to play out the same way until agents changed locations out\n\nof concern for the public's safety.             Agents then saw Contreras\n\nleave the Mall with Polanco in Polanco's car, and Contreras told\n\nGodek over the phone to come \"get this stuff.\"            When agents got to\n\nthe new site they spied Polanco and Contreras waiting in Polanco's\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fcar.        A pat-down search of the two turned up nothing.                    But a\n\nMirandized Contreras told all.              Polanco's car had a \"trap\" (a\n\nstreet       term    for   a   hidden   compartment),    a   nervous    Contreras\n\nwhispered to agents at the scene, and the heroin and a loaded gun\n\nwere stashed inside, he said.              He also fingered Polanco as his\n\nsupplier.2         Given these facts, we think agents had more than enough\n\nprobable cause to believe that Polanco's car contained evidence of\n\ncriminality. See generally United States v. Woodbury, 511 F.3d 93,\n\n97-98       (1st    Cir.   2007)   (emphasizing   that   probable      cause    only\n\nrequires a fair probability – which is well short of certainty –\n\nthat evidence of criminal activity will be found in a particular\n\nplace).\n\n               As a fallback defense, Polanco contends that the search\n\nflunked the auto-exception test, for three reasons: agents did not\n\nactually stop his car, they gave it a thorough going over at\n\nanother locale, and they had time to get a warrant.                      But each\n\nargument is a retread that has no traction:              an impressive convoy\n\nof auto-exception cases holds that if the requisite probable cause\n\nexists it matters not whether the vehicle was already parked, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. McCoy, 977 F.2d 706, 710 (1st Cir. 1992);\n\nUnited States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1271 (1st Cir. 1990),\n\nwhether it was searched at another locale, see, e.g., Ross, 456\n\n\n        2\n       Testimony about Contreras's confession – which the judge\nfound entirely credible – was admitted only at the suppression\nhearing.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fU.S. at 807 n.9; United States v. Lopez, 380 F.3d 538, 545 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); McCoy, 977 F.2d at 710, or even whether agents had time\n\nto obtain a warrant first, see, e.g., Ross, 456 U.S. at 807 n.9;\n\nPanitz, 907 F.2d at 1270 n.3.\n\n          The end result, then, is this.        Because probable cause\n\nexisted, the search of Polanco's Camry was lawful under the auto\n\nexception – a conclusion that spoils his fruit-of-the-poisonous-\n\ntree claim regarding the apartment search.            Consequently, the\n\ndistrict judge rightly denied Polanco's motion to suppress.\n\n          Admissible Testimony\n\n          Possession-with-intent-to-distribute          cases     require\n\nprosecutors to prove that a defendant possessed the drugs for\n\ndistribution rather than for personal use.            See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Maher, 454 F.3d 13, 23 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v.\n\nReynoso, 336 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Valle,\n\n72 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 1995).            To help prove that here,\n\nprosecutors turned to task force member Michael Naylor.             After\n\ndiscussing his long experience in drug enforcement and his intimate\n\nfamiliarity   with   the   heroin   world,   Naylor   testified   without\n\nobjection that a single gram of heroin yields 50 doses – thus the\n\nheroin seized from Polanco's Camry alone was enough for almost\n\n5,000 doses. To cement the prosecution's distribution position and\n\nundercut any claim of personal use, Naylor testified that a typical\n\nheroin addict may do 3-5 doses a day.        A heavy user may do 10-20\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fdoses a day.     Anything above that could kill a person.               Actually,\n\nNaylor added, he knew two people who died after doing 50 doses.\n\n           Polanco spends a lot of time trying to convince us that\n\nNaylor's 50-doses-may-kill-you comment was irrelevant and unduly\n\nprejudicial.     See Fed. R. Evid. 401, 403.            If properly preserved,\n\nthese issues trigger abuse-of-discretion review, see, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Gonzalez-Melendez, 594 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 2010);\n\nUnited States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 101-02 (1st Cir. 1987) – if\n\nunpreserved, plain-error review takes over, see, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Nelson-Rodriguez, 319 F.3d 12, 34 (1st Cir. 2003).                      The\n\ngovernment wonders whether Polanco did enough to preserve either\n\nissue.   We need not wrestle with that question, however.                      Even\n\ngiving Polanco the benefit of the doubt on the preservation point,\n\nwe find no fault with the judge's discretionary calls.\n\n           Relevant evidence, Rule 401 says, is \"evidence having\n\nany   tendency   to     make    the   existence    of   any   fact    that   is    of\n\nconsequence to the determination of the action more probable or\n\nless probable than it would be without the evidence.\"                    Clearly,\n\nwhether Polanco had the heroin for distribution or personal use was\n\na matter of consequence at trial.             See, e.g., Maher, 454 F.3d at\n\n23; Reynoso, 336 F.3d at 49; Valle, 72 F.3d at 214.                  And the range\n\nof daily doses that Naylor said an average heroin addict could use\n\n– from light to heavy to death-inducing – helped prove a pivotal\n\npoint:    that    the    huge    amounts   of     heroin   involved     here   were\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fconsistent with distribution as opposed to personal use.                         Cf.,\n\ne.g., Maher, 454 F.3d at 23; Reynoso, 336 F.3d at 49; Valle, 72\n\nF.3d at 214.      The long and short of it is that Naylor's testimony\n\neasily satisfied the not-too-hard-to-meet relevancy standard.\n\n            Polanco fares no better on his undue-prejudice claim.\n\nFor   the   reasons     just   given,    Naylor's      testimony      was   plainly\n\nprobative    on   the    distributive-intent          issue.     No   doubt,         the\n\ntestimony was prejudicial, in the sense that it showed that the\n\namounts of heroin were too large to represent personal use.                     But it\n\nwas not unfairly so, particularly since Naylor never intimated a\n\npossible suggestion that Polanco had supplied heavy heroin users or\n\nhad caused overdoses or deaths.          Rarely will we override a judge's\n\nbalancing of relevance and prejudice, see, e.g., United States v.\n\nWinchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 559 (1st Cir. 1999), and we see no\n\nreason to second-guess the judge's discretionary judgment here.\n\n            Sufficient Evidence\n\n            Last we come to Polanco's claim that the evidence did not\n\nsupport his aiding-and-abetting conviction – a conviction that\n\nrequired proof that he had knowingly helped Contreras commit the\n\nDecember 3 heroin crime, wanting it to succeed.                See United States\n\nv. Urciuoli, 513 F.3d 290, 299 (1st Cir. 2008) (noting Judge\n\nLearned Hand's \"classic\" definition that an aider and abetter is\n\none   who   \"'associate[s]       himself       with    the     venture,     .    .    .\n\nparticipate[s] in it as in something that he wishes to bring\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fabout,'\" and \"'seek[s] by his action to make it succeed'\") (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938)); see also\n\nUnited States v. Lugo Guerrero, 524 F.3d 5, 13 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\nPolanco's theory is simple.   He says that the evidence proved only\n\nhis presence when Contreras sold the heroin, not his knowing and\n\nintentional participation.    But a sufficiency challenge is a tough\n\nsell.    See, e.g., United States v. Aranjo, 603 F.3d 112, 116 (1st\n\nCir. 2010); United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir.\n\n2006). Polanco must show that, viewing the evidence and reasonable\n\ninferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution, no\n\nrational jury could have convicted him.     See, e.g., Aranjo, 603\n\nF.3d at 116; United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   And as part of our de novo inquiry, we cannot re-weigh the\n\nevidence or second-guess the jury's credibility decisions either.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).     Polanco's sufficiency challenge misses the mark by a\n\ncountry mile.\n\n            As Polanco says, it is not a crime to pal around with\n\ncriminals or to be there when they break the law.   Id. at 712.   But\n\nthis was more than a palling-around or mere-presence case.   Eyeing\n\nthe record from the prosecution's perspective (as we are required\n\nto do at this stage), we recap what a rational jury could have\n\nfound:\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f          1.     Polanco and Contreras called each other six times\n\njust after Godek had set up the December 3 deal and nine times on\n\nthe day of the deal.\n\n          2.   Polanco drove Contreras to the Mall in his red Camry\n\non December 3.\n\n          3.     Polanco remained close by when Contreras headed to\n\nthe bathroom to do the heroin-cash exchange with Godek.\n\n          4.   After the transaction, Contreras counted the cash as\n\nhe walked back to Polanco, and the two did something together while\n\nhunched over a table.   Also, Polanco and Godek traded nods as Godek\n\nleft the food-court area.\n\n          Polanco insists that he had a \"legitimate purpose\" for\n\nbeing at the Mall (eating lunch) and that there is nothing sinister\n\nabout two people exchanging nods (simply a \"socially ingrained\n\nautoresponse,\" he says).    But   again, we must assume that the jury\n\ncredited the prosecution's evidence and drew inferences in its\n\nfavor – not Polanco's.      See, e.g., United States v. Rodriguez-\n\nVélez, 597 F.3d 32, 38-39 (1st Cir. 2010).     That his acts may not\n\nlook \"illegal when viewed in isolation does not bar his conviction\"\n\neither – and the prosecution's \"proof at trial 'need not exclude\n\nevery reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided the record as a\n\nwhole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.'\"\n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d at 714 (quoting United States v. Victoria-Peguero,\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f920 F.2d 77, 86-87 (1st Cir. 1990)).                   Consequently, Polanco's\n\ninnocence hypotheses cannot win the day for him.\n\n              5. Polanco then drove Contreras from the Mall in his red\n\nCamry.\n\n              6.     Also devastating to Polanco's position, among the\n\ncash seized from his apartment were marked bills from the December\n\n3 drug buy, indicating that he had profited from that deal.\n\nLooking to deflect the impact of all this, Polanco contends that\n\nthe jury could not consider evidence collected or events that\n\noccurred after the December 3 deal, no matter how much light these\n\nshed on his role in that crime.                  At oral argument, his counsel\n\ncandidly conceded that he had no authority for that claim.                   We are\n\nnot surprised, given that our cases hold that evidence of events\n\nthat occur after the crime's commission can shine a spotlight on a\n\ndefendant's guilt or innocence.            See, e.g., United States v. Lara,\n\n181    F.3d   183,    204   (1st   Cir.    1999)    (collecting    cases).     Not\n\nsurprisingly, then, his claim goes nowhere.\n\n              7.   Finally, an experienced task force member testified\n\nthat     dealers     seldom   bring       innocents    to   drug   deals,    which\n\nstrengthens an already-strong inference that Polanco knowingly took\n\npart in the December 3 heroin-cash exchange.                See Ortiz, 966 F.2d\n\nat 712 (commenting in an aiding-and-abetting case that \"[j]urors\n\ncan be assumed to know that criminals rarely welcome innocent\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fpersons   as   witnesses   to   serious    crimes   and   rarely    seek   to\n\nperpetrate felonies before larger-than-necessary audiences\").\n\n            Given this factual composite (sketched in the light most\n\nflattering to the prosecution), a reasonable jury could have easily\n\nconcluded   that   Polanco   was   not    innocently   hanging     out   with\n\nContreras during the December 3 deal but rather was knowingly\n\nparticipating in a crime that he doubtless wanted to succeed.\n\nStated slightly differently and in sum, the evidence allowed a\n\nlevelheaded jury to convict Polanco on the aiding-and-abetting\n\ncount, so his sufficiency challenge fails.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n            Detecting no trace of reversible error, we affirm the\n\njudgment of conviction in all respects.\n\n            So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f",

After the district judge denied Polanco's motion to suppress a cache of incriminating evidence found in his car and apartment, a jury convicted him on all counts. His appeal presents three questions: Were the searches legal? Was a DEA agent's testimony about how much heroin an addict could use in a day admissible?<sup>[1]</sup> And was the evidence underpinning his conviction for aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin sufficient? We answer \"yes\" to these questions and affirm Polanco's conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Facts</i></h2>\n<p>Consistent with the standard protocol, we summarize the key facts in the light most compatible with the verdict. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Troy,</i> 618 F.3d 27, 29 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2008, a joint task force comprising federal and local law enforcement agents zeroed in on a suspected drug dealer, David Contreras. Posing as a lobsterman from Newport, task force member Seth Godek bought heroin from Contreras four times over a two-month stretch from October through November 2008. Each deal took place at the Providence Place Mall, an upscale shopping center in downtown Providence. December was shaping up to be more of the same. During a recorded phone call on December 2, 2008, Contreras agreed to sell Godek 20 grams of heroin for $1,500. Speaking in code, they said they would do the deal at the Mall on December 3. Phone records show that Contreras and Polanco called each other a total of six times later that day. That was not unusual. Records show they called each other nine times on the day of the December 3 deal, for example.</p>\n<p>With Polanco at his side, Contreras came to the Mall as promised. They sat in the food court and waited for Godek. When Godek got there, Contreras told Polanco that he and Godek had to go to a nearby restrooman area Contreras knew had no Mall security cameras. Once there, Contreras swapped the heroin for the cash. Polanco and Godek then traded nods as Godek walked on by. Contreras headed back to where Polanco was sitting, counting the money. A surveillance camera caught Contreras and Polanco huddled around a table. They ate lunch and then left the Mall in Polanco's red Toyota Camry.</p>\n<p>Contreras and Godek talked again on December 9. Godek asked for 100 grams of heroin. He said he would pay $6,500. Contreras said okay, and they agreed to rendezvous at the Mall's food court on December 10. Within minutes of hanging up with Godek, Contreras called Polanco. Records show a total of six calls between the two on December 9. Records also show that Contreras called Polanco early on December 10, right after he had gotten off the phone with Godek.</p>\n<p>Agents wanted to arrest Contreras and anyone else tied to the heroin scheme. Contreras and Polanco showed up at the food court on December 10 right on cue. But agents were concerned that arresting the two in a crowded Mall might endanger others, so they changed plans on the fly. Godek called Contreras and convinced him to do the deal at a parking lot in Warwick, Rhode Island. Polanco and Contreras drove to the new locale. Contreras was not happy. \"I have the stuff,\" he told Godek during one of their many calls. \"You better come get it.\" Contreras said he was in a red Camry, parked with the lights on.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> And so he was, sitting in the passenger seat beside driver Polanco. Agents arrived on the scene and arrested the two on the spot. They found no heroin on either man. Heavy rains came, so agents drove Polanco's Camry to a DEA office. A warrantless search of the car there revealed a hidden compartment inside an armrest that contained 94.1 grams of heroin (just shy of the agreed-on amount) and a loaded handgun. To open the compartment, one had to use an electric motor to release a tension strap so that the armrest would lift up. Needless to say, contraptions like this do not come standard with Camrys.</p>\n<p>Polanco told agents that he lived in a basement apartment at 422 Plainfield Street in Providence. His parents owned the building and lived upstairs. Agents then secured a warrant for Polanco's quarters and used the keys he had given them to get in. They hit pay dirt: hidden above the ceiling tiles agents found 12.7 grams of heroin, plastic baggies (perfect for packaging heroin), a digital scale with heroin residue, two coffee grinders (perfect for grinding heroin), eleven rounds of ammunition, and $140 in marked bills that had passed from Godek to Contreras during the December 3 deal (they also came across $860 in unmarked currency).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Proceedings</i></h2>\n<p>In short order, a grand jury returned a four-count indictment charging Polanco with conspiring with Contreras to possess and distribute 100 grams or more of heroin (count 1), aiding and abetting Contreras in the December 3 heroin-distribution scheme (count 2), possessing with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin on December 10 (count 3), and possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug-trafficking crimes (count 4). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C), 846 and 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A). Pleading not guilty, Polanco filed a motion to suppress. Calling the warrantless search of his car unconstitutional, Polanco argued that had the agents not illegally rummaged through his auto, they would not have had enough probable cause to get a search warrant for his apartment. So he asked the district judge to suppress everything seized. After an evidentiary hearing, the judge found the car search constitutionally permissible under the auto exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Dickerson,</i> 514 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir.2008) (permitting \"a warrantless search of a car if there is probable cause to believe\" that it has \"contraband or evidence of a crime\")which ruined Polanco's fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree argument concerning the apartment search.</p>\n<p>The trial lasted two days. A parade of agents discussed the ins and outs of what had happened. One also discussed how many bags of heroin most addicts purchase for personal use. At the end of the prosecution's case, Polanco moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the judge denied. Polanco opted not to present any evidence on his own behalf, and the jury found him guilty of all charges. The judge later sentenced him to 120 months, comprising concurrent sentences of 60 months each on counts 1-3 and a consecutive 60-month sentence on count 4. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>We will disclose additional details as we discuss specific issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Legal Searches</i></h2>\n<p>Polanco insists that the district judge stumbled in denying his suppression motion. We review the judge's ruling <i>de novo,</i> except that we assess his factual findings (which Polanco does not really contest) only for clear error and will affirm his ruling if \"`any reasonable view of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> evidence supports it.'\" <i>United States v. Bater,</i> 594 F.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir.2010) (quoting <i>United States v. Mendez-de Jesus,</i> 85 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p>Polanco protests that the judge failed to see that <i>Arizona v. Gant,</i> ___ U.S. ____, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), signals a rollback of the auto exception. <i>Gant,</i> he says, limits warrantless vehicle searches to situations where an arrestee is unsecured and close enough to threaten officer safety or destroy evidence. And, his argument continues, agents had him in a cell when they combed the car for evidence at a secure location, so the search offended the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>This is a dead-end argument. <i>Gant</i> dealt with the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine in the vehicle context. Pre-<i>Gant,</i> officers could conduct a warrantless search of \"the passenger compartment of [the arrestee's] automobile\" under that doctrine. <i>New York v. Belton,</i> 453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981). Some courts even permitted searches \"when . . . the handcuffed arrestee ha[d] already left the scene.\" <i>Thornton v. United States,</i> 541 U.S. 615, 628, 124 S.Ct. 2127, 158 L.Ed.2d 905 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (collecting cases reading <i>Belton</i> broadly). But <i>Gant</i> clarified that an automobile search may fall within the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine only in two very specific situations: \"when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search\" (the officer-safety justification), or \"when it is `reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle'\" (the evidence-preservation justification). <i>Gant,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1719 (quoting <i>Thornton,</i> 541 U.S. at 632, 124 S.Ct. 2127 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment)). <i>Gant</i> also noted that officers may conduct vehicle searches under other doctrines. <i>Id.</i> at 1721.</p>\n<p>Our case does <i>not</i> involve the search-incident-to-arrest exception, however. As the district judge noted, the government had jettisoned any search-incident-to-arrest theory before the suppression hearing. Only the auto exception matters herean exception that provides that \"[i]f there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity,\" agents can search without a warrant \"any area of the vehicle in which the evidence may be found.\" <i>Id.</i> (discussing <i>United States v. Ross,</i> 456 U.S. 798, 820-21, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982)). And, critically, <i>Gant</i> did not scrap that exception. <i>See id.</i> That is not just our opinion: every circuit that has considered the issue to date has either concluded or assumed that the auto exception survived under <i>Gant. See, e.g., United States v. Arriaza,</i> No. 09-4957, 2010 WL 4813775, at *2 (4th Cir. Nov.24, 2010) (unpublished); <i>United States v. Aguilera,</i> 625 F.3d 482, 485-86 (8th Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Hinojosa,</i> 392 Fed.Appx. 260 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished); <i>United States v. Vinton,</i> 594 F.3d 14, 25 (D.C.Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Stotler,</i> 591 F.3d 935, 940 (7th Cir.2010). We assumed as much in <i>United States v. Bucci,</i> 582 F.3d 108, 117 (1st Cir.2009). Now that the issue is directly before us we turn that assumption into a holding.</p>\n<p>Before we go further, we add a few words of caution. The auto exception is distinct from the evidence-preservation component of <i>Gant</i>'s search-incident-to-arrest analysis (which for simplicity's sake we call the <i>Gant</i> evidentiary justification). We give two examples only. The auto exception extends beyond the crime of arrest. <i>See </i><i>Gant,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1721. But the <i>Gant</i> evidentiary justification does not extend to evidence of other offenses. <i>See id.</i> Also, the auto exception requires <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> probable cause. <i>See id.</i> But the <i>Gant</i> evidentiary justification only requires a \"reasonable basis.\" <i>See id.</i> at 1719. These distinctions make a difference. And, for obvious reasons, it is important to keep them straight.</p>\n<p>Now back to Polanco. Measured against the auto exception's regime, Polanco's challenge comes up short. Consider what agents knew before the December 10 car search. The December 3 heroin deal had gone down at the Mall's food court and involved Contreras, Polanco, and Polanco's Camry, and the December 10 deal was set to play out the same way until agents changed locations out of concern for the public's safety. Agents then saw Contreras leave the Mall with Polanco in Polanco's car, and Contreras told Godek over the phone to come \"get this stuff.\" When agents got to the new site they spied Polanco and Contreras waiting in Polanco's car. A pat-down search of the two turned up nothing. But a Mirandized Contreras told all. Polanco's car had a \"trap\" (a street term for a hidden compartment), a nervous Contreras whispered to agents at the scene, and the heroin and a loaded gun were stashed inside, he said. He also fingered Polanco as his supplier.<sup>[2]</sup> Given these facts, we think agents had more than enough probable cause to believe that Polanco's car contained evidence of criminality. <i>See generally </i><i>United States v. Woodbury,</i> 511 F.3d 93, 97-98 (1st Cir.2007) (emphasizing that probable cause only requires a fair probabilitywhich is well short of certaintythat evidence of criminal activity will be found in a particular place).</p>\n<p>As a fallback defense, Polanco contends that the search flunked the auto-exception test, for three reasons: agents did not actually stop his car, they gave it a thorough going over at another locale, and they had time to get a warrant. But each argument is a retread that has no traction: an impressive convoy of auto-exception cases holds that if the requisite probable cause exists it matters not whether the vehicle was already parked, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. McCoy,</i> 977 F.2d 706, 710 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Panitz,</i> 907 F.2d 1267, 1271 (1st Cir.1990), whether it was searched at another locale, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Ross,</i> 456 U.S. at 807 n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 2157; <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 380 F.3d 538, 545 (1st Cir.2004); <i>McCoy,</i> 977 F.2d at 710, or even whether agents had time to obtain a warrant first, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Ross,</i> 456 U.S. at 807 n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 2157; <i>Panitz,</i> 907 F.2d at 1270 n. 3.</p>\n<p>The end result, then, is this. Because probable cause existed, the search of Polanco's Camry was lawful under the auto exceptiona conclusion that spoils his fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree claim regarding the apartment search. Consequently, the district judge rightly denied Polanco's motion to suppress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Admissible Testimony</i></h2>\n<p>Possession-with-intent-to-distribute cases require prosecutors to prove that a defendant possessed the drugs for distribution rather than for personal use. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Maher,</i> 454 F.3d 13, 23 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Reynoso,</i> 336 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Valle,</i> 72 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 1995). To help prove that here, prosecutors turned to task force member Michael Naylor. After discussing his long experience in drug enforcement and his intimate familiarity with the heroin world, Naylor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> testified without objection that a single gram of heroin yields 50 dosesthus the heroin seized from Polanco's Camry alone was enough for almost <i>5,000</i> doses. To cement the prosecution's distribution position and undercut any claim of personal use, Naylor testified that a typical heroin addict may do 3-5 doses a day. A heavy user may do 10-20 doses a day. Anything above that could kill a person. Actually, Naylor added, he knew two people who died after doing 50 doses.</p>\n<p>Polanco spends a lot of time trying to convince us that Naylor's 50-doses-may-kill-you comment was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401, 403. If properly preserved, these issues trigger abuse-of-discretion review, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez-Melendez,</i> 594 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d 97, 101-02 (1st Cir.1987)if unpreserved, plain-error review takes over, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d 12, 34 (1st Cir.2003). The government wonders whether Polanco did enough to preserve either issue. We need not wrestle with that question, however. Even giving Polanco the benefit of the doubt on the preservation point, we find no fault with the judge's discretionary calls.</p>\n<p>Relevant evidence, Rule 401 says, is \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Clearly, whether Polanco had the heroin for distribution or personal use was a matter of consequence at trial. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 23; <i>Reynoso,</i> 336 F.3d at 49; <i>Valle,</i> 72 F.3d at 214. And the range of daily doses that Naylor said an average heroin addict could usefrom light to heavy to death-inducinghelped prove a pivotal point: that the huge amounts of heroin involved here were consistent with distribution as opposed to personal use. <i>Cf., e.g., </i><i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 23; <i>Reynoso,</i> 336 F.3d at 49; <i>Valle,</i> 72 F.3d at 214. The long and short of it is that Naylor's testimony easily satisfied the not-too-hard-to-meet relevancy standard.</p>\n<p>Polanco fares no better on his undue-prejudice claim. For the reasons just given, Naylor's testimony was plainly probative on the distributive-intent issue. No doubt, the testimony was prejudicial, in the sense that it showed that the amounts of heroin were too large to represent personal use. But it was not <i>unfairly</i> so, particularly since Naylor never intimated a possible suggestion that Polanco had supplied heavy heroin users or had caused overdoses or deaths. Rarely will we override a judge's balancing of relevance and prejudice, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d 548, 559 (1st Cir.1999), and we see no reason to second-guess the judge's discretionary judgment here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Sufficient Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Last we come to Polanco's claim that the evidence did not support his aiding-and-abetting convictiona conviction that required proof that he had knowingly helped Contreras commit the December 3 heroin crime, wanting it to succeed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Urciuoli,</i> 513 F.3d 290, 299 (1st Cir.2008) (noting Judge Learned Hand's \"classic\" definition that an aider and abetter is one who \"`associate[s] himself with the venture, . . . participate[s] in it as in something that he wishes to bring about,'\" and \"`seek[s] by his action to make it succeed'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Peoni,</i> 100 F.2d 401, 402 (2d Cir.1938)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Lugo Guerrero,</i> 524 F.3d 5, 13 (1st Cir.2008). Polanco's theory is simple. He says that the evidence proved only his presence when Contreras sold the heroin, not his knowing and intentional participation. But a sufficiency <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> challenge is a tough sell. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Aranjo,</i> 603 F.3d 112, 116 (1st Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 447 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir.2006). Polanco must show that, viewing the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution, no rational jury could have convicted him. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Aranjo,</i> 603 F.3d at 116; <i>United States v. Baltas,</i> 236 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.2001). And as part of our <i>de novo</i> inquiry, we cannot re-weigh the evidence or second-guess the jury's credibility decisions either. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992). Polanco's sufficiency challenge misses the mark by a country mile.</p>\n<p>As Polanco says, it is not a crime to pal around with criminals or to be there when they break the law. <i>Id.</i> at 712. But this was more than a palling-around or mere-presence case. Eyeing the record from the prosecution's perspective (as we are required to do at this stage), we recap what a rational jury could have found:</p>\n<p>1. Polanco and Contreras called each other six times just after Godek had set up the December 3 deal and nine times on the day of the deal</p>\n<p>2. Polanco drove Contreras to the Mall in his red Camry on December 3.</p>\n<p>3. Polanco remained close by when Contreras headed to the bathroom to do the heroin-cash exchange with Godek.</p>\n<p>4. After the transaction, Contreras counted the cash as he walked back to Polanco, and the two did something together while hunched over a table. Also, Polanco and Godek traded nods as Godek left the food-court area.</p>\n<p>Polanco insists that he had a \"legitimate purpose\" for being at the Mall (eating lunch) and that there is nothing sinister about two people exchanging nods (simply a \"socially ingrained autoresponse,\" he says). But again, we must assume that the jury credited the prosecution's evidence and drew inferences in its favor <i>not</i> Polanco's. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Vélez,</i> 597 F.3d 32, 38-39 (1st Cir.2010). That his acts may not look \"illegal when viewed in isolation does not bar his conviction\" eitherand the prosecution's \"proof at trial `need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided the record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.'\" <i>Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d at 714 (quoting <i>United States v. Victoria-Peguero,</i> 920 F.2d 77, 86-87 (1st Cir.1990)). Consequently, Polanco's innocence hypotheses cannot win the day for him.</p>\n<p>5. Polanco then drove Contreras from the Mall in his red Camry.</p>\n<p>6. Also devastating to Polanco's position, among the cash seized from his apartment were marked bills from the December 3 drug buy, indicating that he had profited from that deal. Looking to deflect the impact of all this, Polanco contends that the jury could not consider evidence collected or events that occurred after the December 3 deal, no matter how much light these shed on his role in that crime. At oral argument, his counsel candidly conceded that he had no authority for that claim. We are not surprised, given that our cases hold that evidence of events that occur after the crime's commission can shine a spotlight on a defendant's guilt or innocence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lara,</i> 181 F.3d 183, 204 (1st Cir.1999) (collecting cases). Not surprisingly, then, his claim goes nowhere.</p>\n<p>7. Finally, an experienced task force member testified that dealers seldom bring innocents to drug deals, which strengthens an already-strong inference that Polanco knowingly took part in the December 3 heroin-cash exchange. <i>See </i><i>Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d at 712 (commenting in an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> aiding-and-abetting case that \"[j]urors can be assumed to know that criminals rarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses to serious crimes and rarely seek to perpetrate felonies before larger-than-necessary audiences\").</p>\n<p>Given this factual composite (sketched in the light most flattering to the prosecution), a reasonable jury could have easily concluded that Polanco was not innocently hanging out with Contreras during the December 3 deal but rather was knowingly participating in a crime that he doubtless wanted to succeed. Stated slightly differently and in sum, the evidence allowed a levelheaded jury to convict Polanco on the aiding-and-abetting count, so his sufficiency challenge fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Detecting no trace of reversible error, we <i>affirm</i> the judgment of conviction in all respects.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  DEA is the acronym for Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\n<p>[2]  Testimony about Contreras's confession which the judge found entirely crediblewas admitted only at the suppression hearing.</p>\n\n</div>",

After the district judge denied Polanco's motion to suppress a cache of incriminating evidence found in his car and apartment, a jury convicted him on all counts. His appeal presents three questions: Were the searches legal? Was a DEA agent's testimony about how much heroin an addict could use in a day admissible?<sup>[1]</sup> And was the evidence underpinning his conviction for aiding and abetting the distribution of heroin sufficient? We answer \"yes\" to these questions and affirm Polanco's conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Facts</i></h2>\n<p>Consistent with the standard protocol, we summarize the key facts in the light most compatible with the verdict. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Troy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174119\"><a href=\"/opinion/174119/united-states-v-troy/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2008, a joint task force comprising federal and local law enforcement agents zeroed in on a suspected drug dealer, David Contreras. Posing as a lobsterman from Newport, task force member Seth Godek bought heroin from Contreras four times over a two-month stretch from October through November 2008. Each deal took place at the Providence Place Mall, an upscale shopping center in downtown Providence. December was shaping up to be more of the same. During a recorded phone call on December 2, 2008, Contreras agreed to sell Godek 20 grams of heroin for $1,500. Speaking in code, they said they would do the deal at the Mall on December 3. Phone records show that Contreras and Polanco called each other a total of six times later that day. That was not unusual. Records show they called each other nine times on the day of the December 3 deal, for example.</p>\n<p>With Polanco at his side, Contreras came to the Mall as promised. They sat in the food court and waited for Godek. When Godek got there, Contreras told Polanco that he and Godek had to go to a nearby restrooman area Contreras knew had no Mall security cameras. Once there, Contreras swapped the heroin for the cash. Polanco and Godek then traded nods as Godek walked on by. Contreras headed back to where Polanco was sitting, counting the money. A surveillance camera caught Contreras and Polanco huddled around a table. They ate lunch and then left the Mall in Polanco's red Toyota Camry.</p>\n<p>Contreras and Godek talked again on December 9. Godek asked for 100 grams of heroin. He said he would pay $6,500. Contreras said okay, and they agreed to rendezvous at the Mall's food court on December 10. Within minutes of hanging up with Godek, Contreras called Polanco. Records show a total of six calls between the two on December 9. Records also show that Contreras called Polanco early on December 10, right after he had gotten off the phone with Godek.</p>\n<p>Agents wanted to arrest Contreras and anyone else tied to the heroin scheme. Contreras and Polanco showed up at the food court on December 10 right on cue. But agents were concerned that arresting the two in a crowded Mall might endanger others, so they changed plans on the fly. Godek called Contreras and convinced him to do the deal at a parking lot in Warwick, Rhode Island. Polanco and Contreras drove to the new locale. Contreras was not happy. \"I have the stuff,\" he told Godek during one of their many calls. \"You better come get it.\" Contreras said he was in a red Camry, parked with the lights on.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> And so he was, sitting in the passenger seat beside driver Polanco. Agents arrived on the scene and arrested the two on the spot. They found no heroin on either man. Heavy rains came, so agents drove Polanco's Camry to a DEA office. A warrantless search of the car there revealed a hidden compartment inside an armrest that contained 94.1 grams of heroin (just shy of the agreed-on amount) and a loaded handgun. To open the compartment, one had to use an electric motor to release a tension strap so that the armrest would lift up. Needless to say, contraptions like this do not come standard with Camrys.</p>\n<p>Polanco told agents that he lived in a basement apartment at 422 Plainfield Street in Providence. His parents owned the building and lived upstairs. Agents then secured a warrant for Polanco's quarters and used the keys he had given them to get in. They hit pay dirt: hidden above the ceiling tiles agents found 12.7 grams of heroin, plastic baggies (perfect for packaging heroin), a digital scale with heroin residue, two coffee grinders (perfect for grinding heroin), eleven rounds of ammunition, and $140 in marked bills that had passed from Godek to Contreras during the December 3 deal (they also came across $860 in unmarked currency).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Proceedings</i></h2>\n<p>In short order, a grand jury returned a four-count indictment charging Polanco with conspiring with Contreras to possess and distribute 100 grams or more of heroin (count 1), aiding and abetting Contreras in the December 3 heroin-distribution scheme (count 2), possessing with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin on December 10 (count 3), and possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug-trafficking crimes (count 4). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C), 846 and 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A). Pleading not guilty, Polanco filed a motion to suppress. Calling the warrantless search of his car unconstitutional, Polanco argued that had the agents not illegally rummaged through his auto, they would not have had enough probable cause to get a search warrant for his apartment. So he asked the district judge to suppress everything seized. After an evidentiary hearing, the judge found the car search constitutionally permissible under the auto exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Dickerson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203115\"><a href=\"/opinion/203115/united-states-v-dickerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 66 (1st Cir.2008) (permitting \"a warrantless search of a car if there is probable cause to believe\" that it has \"contraband or evidence of a crime\")which ruined Polanco's fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree argument concerning the apartment search.</p>\n<p>The trial lasted two days. A parade of agents discussed the ins and outs of what had happened. One also discussed how many bags of heroin most addicts purchase for personal use. At the end of the prosecution's case, Polanco moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the judge denied. Polanco opted not to present any evidence on his own behalf, and the jury found him guilty of all charges. The judge later sentenced him to 120 months, comprising concurrent sentences of 60 months each on counts 1-3 and a consecutive 60-month sentence on count 4. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p>We will disclose additional details as we discuss specific issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Legal Searches</i></h2>\n<p>Polanco insists that the district judge stumbled in denying his suppression motion. We review the judge's ruling <i>de novo,</i> except that we assess his factual findings (which Polanco does not really contest) only for clear error and will affirm his ruling if \"`any reasonable view of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> evidence supports it.'\" <i>United States v. Bater,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2010) (quoting <i>United States v.

Gant,</i> ___ U.S. ____, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145887\"><a href=\"/opinion/145887/arizona-v-gant/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span> (2009), signals a rollback of the auto exception. <i>Gant,</i> he says, limits warrantless vehicle searches to situations where an arrestee is unsecured and close enough to threaten officer safety or destroy evidence. And, his argument continues, agents had him in a cell when they combed the car for evidence at a secure location, so the search offended the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>This is a dead-end argument. <i>Gant</i> dealt with the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine in the vehicle context. Pre-<i>Gant,</i> officers could conduct a warrantless search of \"the passenger compartment of [the arrestee's] automobile\" under that doctrine. <i>New York v. Belton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110559\"><a href=\"/opinion/110559/new-york-v-belton/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 460, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110559\"><a href=\"/opinion/110559/new-york-v-belton/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span> (1981). Some courts even permitted searches \"when . . . the handcuffed arrestee ha[d] already left the scene.\" <i>Thornton v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134746\"><a href=\"/opinion/134746/thornton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span>, 628, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134746\"><a href=\"/opinion/134746/thornton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">905</span></a></span> (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (collecting cases reading <i>Belton</i> broadly). But <i>Gant</i> clarified that an automobile search may fall within the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine only in two very specific situations: \"when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search\" (the officer-safety justification), or \"when it is `reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle'\" (the evidence-preservation justification). <i>Gant,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1719 (quoting <i>Thornton,</i> 541 U.S. at 632, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134746\"><a href=\"/opinion/134746/thornton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2127</span></a></span> (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment)). <i>Gant</i> also noted that officers may conduct vehicle searches under other doctrines. <i>Id.</i> at 1721.</p>\n<p>Our case does <i>not</i> involve the search-incident-to-arrest exception, however. As the district judge noted, the government had jettisoned any search-incident-to-arrest theory before the suppression hearing. Only the auto exception matters herean exception that provides that \"[i]f there is probable cause to believe a vehicle contains evidence of criminal activity,\" agents can search without a warrant \"any area of the vehicle in which the evidence may be found.\" <i>Id.</i> (discussing <i>United States v. Ross,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110719\"><a href=\"/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span>, 820-21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110719\"><a href=\"/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span> (1982)). And, critically, <i>Gant</i> did not scrap that exception. <i>See id.</i> That is not just our opinion: every circuit that has considered the issue to date has either concluded or assumed that the auto exception survived under <i>Gant. See, e.g., United States v. Arriaza,</i> No. 09-4957, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4813775</span></span>, at *2 (4th Cir. Nov.24, 2010) (unpublished); <i>United States v. Aguilera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179344\"><a href=\"/opinion/179344/united-states-v-aguilera/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span>, 485-86 (8th Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Hinojosa,</i> 392 Fed.Appx. 260 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished); <i>United States v. Vinton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187527\"><a href=\"/opinion/187527/united-states-v-vinton/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 25 (D.C.Cir.2010); <i>United States v.

We assumed as much in <i>United States v. Bucci,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204000\"><a href=\"/opinion/204000/united-states-v-bucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 117 (1st Cir.2009). Now that the issue is directly before us we turn that assumption into a holding.</p>\n<p>Before we go further, we add a few words of caution. The auto exception is distinct from the evidence-preservation component of <i>Gant</i>'s search-incident-to-arrest analysis (which for simplicity's sake we call the <i>Gant</i> evidentiary justification). We give two examples only. The auto exception extends beyond the crime of arrest. <i>See </i><i>Gant,</i> 129 S.Ct. at 1721. But the <i>Gant</i> evidentiary justification does not extend to evidence of other offenses. <i>See id.</i> Also, the auto exception requires <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> probable cause. <i>See id.</i> But the <i>Gant</i> evidentiary justification only requires a \"reasonable basis.\" <i>See id.</i> at 1719. These distinctions make a difference. And, for obvious reasons, it is important to keep them straight.</p>\n<p>Now back to Polanco. Measured against the auto exception's regime, Polanco's challenge comes up short. Consider what agents knew before the December 10 car search. The December 3 heroin deal had gone down at the Mall's food court and involved Contreras, Polanco, and Polanco's Camry, and the December 10 deal was set to play out the same way until agents changed locations out of concern for the public's safety. Agents then saw Contreras leave the Mall with Polanco in Polanco's car, and Contreras told Godek over the phone to come \"get this stuff.\" When agents got to the new site they spied Polanco and Contreras waiting in Polanco's car. A pat-down search of the two turned up nothing. But a Mirandized Contreras told all. Polanco's car had a \"trap\" (a street term for a hidden compartment), a nervous Contreras whispered to agents at the scene, and the heroin and a loaded gun were stashed inside, he said. He also fingered Polanco as his supplier.<sup>[2]</sup> Given these facts, we think agents had more than enough probable cause to believe that Polanco's car contained evidence of criminality. <i>See generally </i><i>United States v. Woodbury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203089\"><a href=\"/opinion/203089/united-states-v-woodbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 97-98 (1st Cir.2007) (emphasizing that probable cause only requires a fair probabilitywhich is well short of certaintythat evidence of criminal activity will be found in a particular place).</p>\n<p>As a fallback defense, Polanco contends that the search flunked the auto-exception test, for three reasons: agents did not actually stop his car, they gave it a thorough going over at another locale, and they had time to get a warrant. But each argument is a retread that has no traction: an impressive convoy of auto-exception cases holds that if the requisite probable cause exists it matters not whether the vehicle was already parked, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. McCoy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593173\"><a href=\"/opinion/593173/united-states-v-james-w-mccoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 710 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Panitz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544607\"><a href=\"/opinion/544607/united-states-v-solomon-philip-panitz-united-states-of-america-v-andrew/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span>, 1271 (1st Cir.1990), whether it was searched at another locale, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Ross,</i> 456 U.S. at 807 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110719\"><a href=\"/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2157</span></a></span>; <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201204\"><a href=\"/opinion/201204/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 545 (1st Cir.2004); <i>McCoy,</i> 977 F.2d at 710, or even whether agents had time to obtain a warrant first, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Ross,</i> 456 U.S. at 807 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110719\"><a href=\"/opinion/110719/united-states-v-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2157</span></a></span>; <i>Panitz,</i> 907 F.2d at 1270 n. 3.</p>\n<p>The end result, then, is this. Because probable cause existed, the search of Polanco's Camry was lawful under the auto exceptiona conclusion that spoils his fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree claim regarding the apartment search. Consequently, the district judge rightly denied Polanco's motion to suppress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Admissible Testimony</i></h2>\n<p>Possession-with-intent-to-distribute cases require prosecutors to prove that a defendant possessed the drugs for distribution rather than for personal use. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Maher,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202307\"><a href=\"/opinion/202307/united-states-v-maher/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Reynoso,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200547\"><a href=\"/opinion/200547/united-states-v-reynoso/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Valle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196494\"><a href=\"/opinion/196494/united-states-v-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 214 (1st Cir. 1995). To help prove that here, prosecutors turned to task force member Michael Naylor. After discussing his long experience in drug enforcement and his intimate familiarity with the heroin world, Naylor <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> testified without objection that a single gram of heroin yields 50 dosesthus the heroin seized from Polanco's Camry alone was enough for almost <i>5,000</i> doses. To cement the prosecution's distribution position and undercut any claim of personal use, Naylor testified that a typical heroin addict may do 3-5 doses a day. A heavy user may do 10-20 doses a day. Anything above that could kill a person. Actually, Naylor added, he knew two people who died after doing 50 doses.</p>\n<p>Polanco spends a lot of time trying to convince us that Naylor's 50-doses-may-kill-you comment was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 401, 403. If properly preserved, these issues trigger abuse-of-discretion review, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gonzalez-Melendez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1379893\"><a href=\"/opinion/1379893/united-states-v-gonzalez-melendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488020\"><a href=\"/opinion/488020/united-states-v-barry-j-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 101-02 (1st Cir.1987)if unpreserved, plain-error review takes over, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780802\"><a href=\"/opinion/780802/united-states-v-milton-a-nelson-rodriguez-luis-a-romero-lopez-miguel-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2003). The government wonders whether Polanco did enough to preserve either issue. We need not wrestle with that question, however. Even giving Polanco the benefit of the doubt on the preservation point, we find no fault with the judge's discretionary calls.</p>\n<p>Relevant evidence, Rule 401 says, is \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Clearly, whether Polanco had the heroin for distribution or personal use was a matter of consequence at trial. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 23; <i>Reynoso,</i> 336 F.3d at 49; <i>Valle,</i> 72 F.3d at 214. And the range of daily doses that Naylor said an average heroin addict could usefrom light to heavy to death-inducinghelped prove a pivotal point: that the huge amounts of heroin involved here were consistent with distribution as opposed to personal use. <i>Cf., e.g., </i><i>Maher,</i> 454 F.3d at 23; <i>Reynoso,</i> 336 F.3d at 49; <i>Valle,</i> 72 F.3d at 214. The long and short of it is that Naylor's testimony easily satisfied the not-too-hard-to-meet relevancy standard.</p>\n<p>Polanco fares no better on his undue-prejudice claim. For the reasons just given, Naylor's testimony was plainly probative on the distributive-intent issue. No doubt, the testimony was prejudicial, in the sense that it showed that the amounts of heroin were too large to represent personal use. But it was not <i>unfairly</i> so, particularly since Naylor never intimated a possible suggestion that Polanco had supplied heavy heroin users or had caused overdoses or deaths. Rarely will we override a judge's balancing of relevance and prejudice, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Winchenbach,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198727\"><a href=\"/opinion/198727/united-states-v-winchenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span>, 559 (1st Cir.1999), and we see no reason to second-guess the judge's discretionary judgment here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Sufficient Evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Last we come to Polanco's claim that the evidence did not support his aiding-and-abetting convictiona conviction that required proof that he had knowingly helped Contreras commit the December 3 heroin crime, wanting it to succeed. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Urciuoli,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1272296\"><a href=\"/opinion/1272296/united-states-v-urciuoli/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span>, 299 (1st Cir.2008) (noting Judge Learned Hand's \"classic\" definition that an aider and abetter is one who \"`associate[s] himself with the venture, . . . participate[s] in it as in something that he wishes to bring about,'\" and \"`seek[s] by his action to make it succeed'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Peoni,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485475\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485475/united-states-v-peoni/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 402 (2d Cir.1938)); <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Lugo Guerrero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203245\"><a href=\"/opinion/203245/united-states-v-lugo-guerrero/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2008). Polanco's theory is simple. He says that the evidence proved only his presence when Contreras sold the heroin, not his knowing and intentional participation. But a sufficiency <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> challenge is a tough sell. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Aranjo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145520\"><a href=\"/opinion/145520/united-states-v-aranjo/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 116 (1st Cir.2010); <i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202188\"><a href=\"/opinion/202188/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2006). Polanco must show that, viewing the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution, no rational jury could have convicted him. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Aranjo,</i> 603 F.3d at 116; <i>United States v. Baltas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199221\"><a href=\"/opinion/199221/united-states-v-baltas/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2001). And as part of our <i>de novo</i> inquiry, we cannot re-weigh the evidence or second-guess the jury's credibility decisions either. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 711 (1st Cir.1992). Polanco's sufficiency challenge misses the mark by a country mile.</p>\n<p>As Polanco says, it is not a crime to pal around with criminals or to be there when they break the law. <i>Id.</i> at 712. But this was more than a palling-around or mere-presence case. Eyeing the record from the prosecution's perspective (as we are required to do at this stage), we recap what a rational jury could have found:</p>\n<p>1. Polanco and Contreras called each other six times just after Godek had set up the December 3 deal and nine times on the day of the deal</p>\n<p>2. Polanco drove Contreras to the Mall in his red Camry on December 3.</p>\n<p>3. Polanco remained close by when Contreras headed to the bathroom to do the heroin-cash exchange with Godek.</p>\n<p>4. After the transaction, Contreras counted the cash as he walked back to Polanco, and the two did something together while hunched over a table. Also, Polanco and Godek traded nods as Godek left the food-court area.</p>\n<p>Polanco insists that he had a \"legitimate purpose\" for being at the Mall (eating lunch) and that there is nothing sinister about two people exchanging nods (simply a \"socially ingrained autoresponse,\" he says). But again, we must assume that the jury credited the prosecution's evidence and drew inferences in its favor <i>not</i> Polanco's. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Rodriguez-Vélez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18\"><a href=\"/opinion/18/united-states-v-rodriguez-velez/\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38-39 (1st Cir.2010). That his acts may not look \"illegal when viewed in isolation does not bar his conviction\" eitherand the prosecution's \"proof at trial `need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided the record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.'\" <i>Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d at 714 (quoting <i>United States v. Victoria-Peguero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552332\"><a href=\"/opinion/552332/united-states-v-pedro-r-victoria-peguero-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 86-87 (1st Cir.1990)). Consequently, Polanco's innocence hypotheses cannot win the day for him.</p>\n<p>5. Polanco then drove Contreras from the Mall in his red Camry.</p>\n<p>6. Also devastating to Polanco's position, among the cash seized from his apartment were marked bills from the December 3 drug buy, indicating that he had profited from that deal. Looking to deflect the impact of all this, Polanco contends that the jury could not consider evidence collected or events that occurred after the December 3 deal, no matter how much light these shed on his role in that crime. At oral argument, his counsel candidly conceded that he had no authority for that claim. We are not surprised, given that our cases hold that evidence of events that occur after the crime's commission can shine a spotlight on a defendant's guilt or innocence. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Lara,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764882\"><a href=\"/opinion/764882/united-states-v-giovanni-lara-appellantno-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 204 (1st Cir.1999) (collecting cases). Not surprisingly, then, his claim goes nowhere.</p>\n<p>7. Finally, an experienced task force member testified that dealers seldom bring innocents to drug deals, which strengthens an already-strong inference that Polanco knowingly took part in the December 3 heroin-cash exchange. <i>See </i><i>Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d at 712 (commenting in an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> aiding-and-abetting case that \"[j]urors can be assumed to know that criminals rarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses to serious crimes and rarely seek to perpetrate felonies before larger-than-necessary audiences\").</p>\n<p>Given this factual composite (sketched in the light most flattering to the prosecution), a reasonable jury could have easily concluded that Polanco was not innocently hanging out with Contreras during the December 3 deal but rather was knowingly participating in a crime that he doubtless wanted to succeed. Stated slightly differently and in sum, the evidence allowed a levelheaded jury to convict Polanco on the aiding-and-abetting count, so his sufficiency challenge fails.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Detecting no trace of reversible error, we <i>affirm</i> the judgment of conviction in all respects.</p>\n<p><i>So Ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  DEA is the acronym for Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>\n<p>[2]  Testimony about Contreras's confession which the judge found entirely crediblewas admitted only at the suppression hearing.</p>\n\n</div>",
