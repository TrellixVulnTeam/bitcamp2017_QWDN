Petitioner Hai Ning Zhang\n\n(\"Zhang\") petitions us to review the Board of Immigration Appeals'\n\n(\"BIA\") denial of a motion to reopen his removal proceedings.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                             I.   Background\n\n           A.   Procedural Overview\n\n           Zhang, a native and citizen of China, lawfully entered\n\nthe United States in Los Angeles, California, on March 19, 2001.\n\nZhang had a B-1 visa valid until May 19, 2001, which he overstayed.\n\nOn April 3, 2002, Zhang filed an I-589 application seeking asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture   (\"CAT\").      On   January   9,   2003,   the   Immigration   and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\")1 served Zhang with a Notice to\n\nAppear, charging that he was removable under § 237(a)(1)(B) of the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B),\n\nas an alien admitted as a nonimmigrant who remained in the United\n\nStates for a time longer than permitted.       On March 25, 2003, Zhang\n\nconceded removability.\n\n           Zhang appeared before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") on\n\nAugust 8, 2003.      On August 22, the IJ pretermitted Zhang's asylum\n\napplication and denied his request for withholding of removal and\n\n\n1\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nFor simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this opinion as\nthe INS.\n\n                                   -2-\n\frelief under CAT.       The IJ also granted Zhang voluntary departure.\n\nZhang timely appealed to the BIA, which summarily affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision on December 17, 2004.           Zhang did not appeal this decision\n\nbut instead filed a motion to reopen and reconsider and a motion to\n\nstay deportation with the BIA, on July 26, 2005.              The BIA denied\n\nthese motions as untimely on September 2, 2005.              Zhang has timely\n\nappealed.\n\n            B.    Factual Background\n\n            The following facts are taken from Zhang's testimony\n\nbefore the IJ and from documents he presented in support of his\n\nasylum application.\n\n            Zhang, married with no children, left China for the\n\nUnited States in March 2001.            He is a practitioner of Falun Gong2\n\nand   claims     that   he   suffered    harsh   treatment   by   the   Chinese\n\ngovernment as a result.        Before he left China, Zhang had worked as\n\na deputy manager in the sales department of a computer hardware\n\ncompany (\"the Company\") since 1995 and earned the equivalent of\n\napproximately $31,000 annually.           The Company was owned jointly by\n\nthe Chinese government (60%) and by an individual named Huan Chao\n\nHe (\"He\"), whom Zhang described as a mentor, father figure, and\n\n\n2\n   Zhang described Falun Gong as a faith whose \"characteristic is\nto purify your soul. To foster your ethics, your morals . . . to\nseek the truth.\" He did not describe in great detail what this\nentails, aside from references to practicing in a park and\npurchasing instructional books and tapes.    By the time he left\nChina, he testified, he had become an \"intermediate level\"\npractitioner.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fbest friend.    Zhang testified that he earned 100,000,000 Renminbi\n\n(\"RMB\" -- Chinese currency)3 for the Company, and that for years\n\nbefore he left China, he and his wife lived in a Company-owned\n\nhouse.\n\n            Zhang   started   practicing   Falun   Gong   in   March    1998.\n\nBetween July 1999 and his departure from China in March 2001, he\n\nalleges that he was detained and abused by the Chinese government\n\non three separate occasions.       He was detained for seven days in\n\nJuly 1999, and for thirteen days in September-October 2000. During\n\nthese two detentions, Zhang suffered physical abuse, including one\n\nbeating during the second detention that left him with a broken\n\nvertebra.    Prior to the first detention, security officers seized\n\nZhang's Falun Gong materials and several personal items.               During\n\nboth detentions, either Zhang or his wife received notification of\n\nhis release date, and the detentions lasted no longer than thirteen\n\ndays, in accordance with Chinese criminal law at the time.             During\n\nthese two episodes and another minor detention in October 1999\n\nwhich lasted approximately five hours, Zhang was ordered to stop\n\npracticing Falun Gong.        He refused to sign documents renouncing\n\nFalun Gong but did limit his practice of the faith to his home.\n\n            Zhang's practice of Falun Gong, as well as the incidents\n\nwith the security officers, also caused him problems at his job.\n\n\n3\n  At all times relevant to this series of events, the value of the\nRenminbi was fixed at a rate of approximately 8.28 RMB per dollar.\nZhang thus claims to have earned over $12,000,000 for the Company.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fAfter each detention, the Company urged him to stop practicing\n\nFalun Gong.     Finally, in November 2000, shortly after his third\n\ndetention, Zhang was officially fired from his job, upon orders\n\nfrom a government security office.              The Company retained his\n\nservices unofficially, however, and he continued to work in the\n\nsales area at a reduced salary.     In preparation for a business trip\n\nto the United States, the Company secured the return of Zhang's\n\npassport, which had been seized by the security office.                  The\n\nsecurity     office,   however,   would   not    let   Zhang   receive   any\n\ncommission from the trip, which Zhang predicted would be worth\n\n$180,000.4    On March 19, 2001, Zhang entered the United States at\n\nLos Angeles, California but soon realized that the Company had lost\n\nthe deal that he had been sent to complete.            Zhang informed his\n\nboss, who became angry and soon stopped returning Zhang's phone\n\ncalls.   Zhang then contacted his friend He, who informed him that\n\nanother Falun Gong member had just received a two- to three-year\n\nprison sentence and advised him to remain in the United States and\n\npetition for asylum.\n\n             Zhang traveled to Baltimore, Maryland, on March 26, 2001,\n\nwhere he lived with a friend, and moved to Puerto Rico on June 19.\n\nOn June 21, 2001, the Company seized Zhang's home and evicted his\n\n\n\n4\n   The fact that the security office knew about the trip at all\nwould imply that it knew that Zhang was still working for the\nCompany.   Zhang does not attempt to reconcile this with his\ntestimony that the office had already ordered that he be fired.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fwife.     She was also fired from her job upon orders from the\n\nsecurity office.     Zhang testified that he still practices Falun\n\nGong and that he fears that, just like many other Falun Gong\n\npractitioners, he would be imprisoned if he returned to China.\n\n           C.   IJ's Decision and BIA's Affirmance\n\n           On August 8, 2003, Zhang appeared before an IJ in San\n\nJuan, Puerto Rico.   The IJ denied all of Zhang's claims.        She first\n\npretermitted Zhang's asylum claim because it was filed one year and\n\nsixteen days after his arrival in the United States, in violation\n\nof the one-year deadline.5\n\n           The IJ then denied Zhang's request for withholding of\n\nremoval, finding that he had wholly failed to prove that he would\n\nbe persecuted based on his Falun Gong faith if he returned to\n\nChina.    Taking Zhang's testimony as true, the IJ found that even\n\ndespite   his   detentions,   all   of    which   conformed   with   Chinese\n\ncriminal law, Zhang still enjoyed significant benefits from the\n\ngovernment in the sense that he remained employed by a company in\n\nwhich the government was a majority owner.         Therefore, the IJ held\n\nthat even though some Falun Gong practitioners were persecuted,\n\nthis did not mean that Zhang himself would be persecuted or\n\ntortured upon his return to China.         Instead, the IJ characterized\n\n\n5\n    Zhang testified that he believed that he needed his               birth\ncertificate to complete his application and was thus waiting          until\nhe received it in order to file. The IJ held that this was            not a\nvalid excuse for his tardiness, because he could have easily          filed\nby using his passport.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fZhang's decision to remain in the United States as a result of a\n\n\"business transaction turned sour\" and noted that the seizure of\n\nhis home was not related to his practice of Falun Gong, but instead\n\nto the fact that he had effectively abandoned his job, and that the\n\nCompany owned the house.       Moreover, the IJ noted, Zhang had not\n\ncorroborated his testimony with a letter from either his wife or\n\nhis mentor He, but even if he had done so, this would not have\n\ndischarged his burden of proof on this count.        Finally, the IJ held\n\nthat Zhang had provided no evidence that he was tortured in China,\n\ndefeating his claim for protection under CAT. The IJ granted Zhang\n\nvoluntary departure.\n\n           D.    Motion to Reopen\n\n           On July 26, 2005, Zhang filed a motion to reopen his\n\nremoval proceedings claiming that he could state new facts and\n\nprovide documents that he could not have been presented at the\n\nprior hearing.      The main piece of evidence was a letter from He\n\ndated   March    25,   2005,   which    generally   corroborated   Zhang's\n\ntestimony.6     It also provided additional background related to the\n\nrecent death of Zhang's father and the government's refusal to\n\nprovide compensation for his death, which He claims is evidence\n\n\n\n\n6\n   Zhang claims that He was unwilling to write on his behalf\nearlier, due to threats made by the government to He's business\ninterests.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthat the government is still \"going after\" Zhang.7           The other new\n\nitems of evidence submitted by Zhang were (i) He's Hong Kong ID\n\ncard; (ii) a business license for the Company; (iii) a shareholding\n\nstructure certificate for the company; (iv) sections from the\n\ncriminal procedure code of China; (v) a forensic report on the\n\ndeath of Zhang's father; (vi) a diagnosis report on the same; (vii)\n\nZhang's notarized birth certificate.         The BIA denied the motion to\n\nreopen on the grounds that it was filed more than 90 days after the\n\nBIA's decision, in contravention of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n           We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion.   Maryam v. Gonzáles, 421 F.3d 60, 62 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).     An abuse of discretion will be found \"where the BIA\n\nmisinterprets the law, or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.\"\n\nChen v. Gonzáles, 415 F.3d 151, 153 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           \"There are at least three independent grounds on which\n\nthe BIA may deny a motion to reopen.\"         INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94,\n\n104 (1988).   It may hold that the movant (i) has not established a\n\nprima facie case for the substantive relief sought; (ii) has not\n\nintroduced evidence that is material and was unavailable during the\n\noriginal   proceedings;   or   (iii)    is   simply   not   entitled   to   a\n\ndiscretionary grant of relief.     Id. at 104-05.       See also 8 C.F.R.\n\n\n7\n   Neither He's letter nor the other documents submitted with\nZhang's motion to reopen provide any evidence as to why Zhang would\nbe entitled to compensation for his father's death.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f§ 1003.2(c)(1) In most circumstances, a motion to reopen must be\n\nfiled within 90 days of a final administrative order of removal.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i).          An exception to this deadline is\n\nmade for evidence based on changed conditions in the country to\n\nwhich removal has been ordered, \"if such evidence is material and\n\nwas not available and would not have been discovered or presented\n\nat the previous proceeding.\"        8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).8\n\n             In this case, it is not disputed that Zhang missed the\n\n90-day deadline.        Zhang instead argues that the BIA should have\n\napplied the equitable tolling doctrine to extend his filing period.\n\nThis   doctrine    \"provides    that   in     exceptional      circumstances,    a\n\nstatute of limitations may be extended for equitable reasons not\n\nacknowledged in the statute creating the limitations period.\"\n\nNeverson v. Farquharson, 366 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir. 2004) (citations\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).                  The doctrine is to be\n\n\"sparingly invoked.\"      Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(citing Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96\n\n(1990)).\n\n             The   equitable    tolling      doctrine    \"is   read    into   every\n\nfederal statute of limitation,\"           Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S.\n\n392,   397    (1946),     but   \"deadlines       that    define       the   court's\n\njurisdiction may not be equitably tolled.\"               Neverson, 366 F.3d at\n\n\n8\n   Though Zhang did not argue for such an exception, the BIA held\nthat his new evidence in any case did not establish changed\ncircumstances in China so as to permit it.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f40; see also Soriano v. United States, 352 U.S. 270, 276 (1957).\n\nWe have not yet decided whether the motion to reopen deadline is\n\njurisdictional, and therefore whether it can be equitably tolled.\n\nSee Joumaa v. Gonzáles, 446 F.3d 244, 246 (1st Cir. 2006); Chen v.\n\nGonzáles, 415 F.3d at 154 n.3.         We need not do so here.\n\n            Zhang did not raise his equitable tolling argument before\n\nthe BIA.     Indeed his motion to reopen made at best passing\n\nreference to its untimeliness.9         Zhang therefore failed to pursue\n\nthis remedy below, and we \"may review a final order of removal only\n\nif . . . the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies\n\navailable to the alien as of right . . . .\"            8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).\n\nBecause Zhang did not exhaust all of his administrative remedies\n\nregarding his equitable tolling claim, we lack jurisdiction to\n\nadjudicate it.     See Joumaa, 446 F.3d at 246 (declining to decide\n\nwhether the equitable tolling doctrine applies to an untimely\n\nmotion to reopen because petitioner did not argue the issue before\n\nthe BIA).\n\n            We   also   note   that   even   setting    aside   the   issue   of\n\nuntimeliness, the BIA still did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\n\n\n9\n   Zhang concluded his BIA motion to reopen by stating that \"[i]n\nlight of the newly discovered material information, the respondent\nrespectfully requests that this Honorable Board reopen his removal\nproceeding.\"    It would be quite a stretch to say that this\nreference to \"newly discovered material information\" addresses the\nfact that his motion was untimely, and in any case, Zhang does not\nbrief this or any other argument regarding his failure to raise\nequitable tolling before the BIA.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fZhang's motion to reopen.            Of the documents Zhang submitted with\n\nhis    motion    to    reopen,    only   the    letter    from    He    was    arguably\n\nunavailable at the time of Zhang's original proceedings, and its\n\nmateriality to the case is minimal.10             Zhang does not show that the\n\nnew    evidence       regarding    withholding    of     compensation         after   his\n\nfather's death now establishes a prima facie case for relief, and\n\neven if it did, the BIA still had discretion to deny the motion.\n\nZhang does not argue that the BIA's decision to do so was arbitrary\n\nor capricious.          See Chen, 415 F.3d at 153.           Finally, the BIA's\n\nfailure to equitably toll the deadline when Zhang did not urge it\n\nto do so -- nor have we ever held that it even could do so -- was\n\ncertainly not a misinterpretation of the law.                    Id.\n\n              In sum, Zhang may not pursue his equitable tolling\n\nargument before this Court because he did not raise it before the\n\nBIA.     He     has    presented    no   other   legal     basis       to   excuse    the\n\nuntimeliness of his motion to reopen. Finally, even had the motion\n\nbeen timely filed, the BIA still did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying it.\n\n                                  III.   Conclusion\n\n              For all of the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition\n\nfor review and affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n10\n     Indeed He's letter serves mainly to corroborate Zhang's\ntestimony, but the IJ explicitly stated that even with such\ncorroboration Zhang could still not discharge his burden of proof.\n\n                                         -11-\n\f",

On   January   9,   2003,   the   Immigration   and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\")1 served Zhang with a Notice to\n\nAppear, charging that he was removable under § 237(a)(1)(B) of the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B),\n\nas an alien admitted as a nonimmigrant who remained in the United\n\nStates for a time longer than permitted.       On March 25, 2003, Zhang\n\nconceded removability.\n\n           Zhang appeared before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") on\n\nAugust 8, 2003.      On August 22, the IJ pretermitted Zhang's asylum\n\napplication and denied his request for withholding of removal and\n\n\n1\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nFor simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this opinion as\nthe INS.\n\n                                   -2-\n\frelief under CAT.       The IJ also granted Zhang voluntary departure.\n\nZhang timely appealed to the BIA, which summarily affirmed the IJ's\n\ndecision on December 17, 2004.           Zhang did not appeal this decision\n\nbut instead filed a motion to reopen and reconsider and a motion to\n\nstay deportation with the BIA, on July 26, 2005.              The BIA denied\n\nthese motions as untimely on September 2, 2005.              Zhang has timely\n\nappealed.\n\n            B.    Factual Background\n\n            The following facts are taken from Zhang's testimony\n\nbefore the IJ and from documents he presented in support of his\n\nasylum application.\n\n            Zhang, married with no children, left China for the\n\nUnited States in March 2001.            He is a practitioner of Falun Gong2\n\nand   claims     that   he   suffered    harsh   treatment   by   the   Chinese\n\ngovernment as a result.        Before he left China, Zhang had worked as\n\na deputy manager in the sales department of a computer hardware\n\ncompany (\"the Company\") since 1995 and earned the equivalent of\n\napproximately $31,000 annually.           The Company was owned jointly by\n\nthe Chinese government (60%) and by an individual named Huan Chao\n\nHe (\"He\"), whom Zhang described as a mentor, father figure, and\n\n\n2\n   Zhang described Falun Gong as a faith whose \"characteristic is\nto purify your soul. To foster your ethics, your morals . . . to\nseek the truth.\" He did not describe in great detail what this\nentails, aside from references to practicing in a park and\npurchasing instructional books and tapes.    By the time he left\nChina, he testified, he had become an \"intermediate level\"\npractitioner.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fbest friend.    Zhang testified that he earned 100,000,000 Renminbi\n\n(\"RMB\" -- Chinese currency)3 for the Company, and that for years\n\nbefore he left China, he and his wife lived in a Company-owned\n\nhouse.\n\n            Zhang   started   practicing   Falun   Gong   in   March    1998.\n\nBetween July 1999 and his departure from China in March 2001, he\n\nalleges that he was detained and abused by the Chinese government\n\non three separate occasions.       He was detained for seven days in\n\nJuly 1999, and for thirteen days in September-October 2000. During\n\nthese two detentions, Zhang suffered physical abuse, including one\n\nbeating during the second detention that left him with a broken\n\nvertebra.    Prior to the first detention, security officers seized\n\nZhang's Falun Gong materials and several personal items.               During\n\nboth detentions, either Zhang or his wife received notification of\n\nhis release date, and the detentions lasted no longer than thirteen\n\ndays, in accordance with Chinese criminal law at the time.             During\n\nthese two episodes and another minor detention in October 1999\n\nwhich lasted approximately five hours, Zhang was ordered to stop\n\npracticing Falun Gong.        He refused to sign documents renouncing\n\nFalun Gong but did limit his practice of the faith to his home.\n\n            Zhang's practice of Falun Gong, as well as the incidents\n\nwith the security officers, also caused him problems at his job.\n\n\n3\n  At all times relevant to this series of events, the value of the\nRenminbi was fixed at a rate of approximately 8.28 RMB per dollar.\nZhang thus claims to have earned over $12,000,000 for the Company.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fAfter each detention, the Company urged him to stop practicing\n\nFalun Gong.     Finally, in November 2000, shortly after his third\n\ndetention, Zhang was officially fired from his job, upon orders\n\nfrom a government security office.              The Company retained his\n\nservices unofficially, however, and he continued to work in the\n\nsales area at a reduced salary.     In preparation for a business trip\n\nto the United States, the Company secured the return of Zhang's\n\npassport, which had been seized by the security office.                  The\n\nsecurity     office,   however,   would   not    let   Zhang   receive   any\n\ncommission from the trip, which Zhang predicted would be worth\n\n$180,000.4    On March 19, 2001, Zhang entered the United States at\n\nLos Angeles, California but soon realized that the Company had lost\n\nthe deal that he had been sent to complete.            Zhang informed his\n\nboss, who became angry and soon stopped returning Zhang's phone\n\ncalls.   Zhang then contacted his friend He, who informed him that\n\nanother Falun Gong member had just received a two- to three-year\n\nprison sentence and advised him to remain in the United States and\n\npetition for asylum.\n\n             Zhang traveled to Baltimore, Maryland, on March 26, 2001,\n\nwhere he lived with a friend, and moved to Puerto Rico on June 19.\n\nOn June 21, 2001, the Company seized Zhang's home and evicted his\n\n\n\n4\n   The fact that the security office knew about the trip at all\nwould imply that it knew that Zhang was still working for the\nCompany.   Zhang does not attempt to reconcile this with his\ntestimony that the office had already ordered that he be fired.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fwife.     She was also fired from her job upon orders from the\n\nsecurity office.     Zhang testified that he still practices Falun\n\nGong and that he fears that, just like many other Falun Gong\n\npractitioners, he would be imprisoned if he returned to China.\n\n           C.   IJ's Decision and BIA's Affirmance\n\n           On August 8, 2003, Zhang appeared before an IJ in San\n\nJuan, Puerto Rico.   The IJ denied all of Zhang's claims.        She first\n\npretermitted Zhang's asylum claim because it was filed one year and\n\nsixteen days after his arrival in the United States, in violation\n\nof the one-year deadline.5\n\n           The IJ then denied Zhang's request for withholding of\n\nremoval, finding that he had wholly failed to prove that he would\n\nbe persecuted based on his Falun Gong faith if he returned to\n\nChina.    Taking Zhang's testimony as true, the IJ found that even\n\ndespite   his   detentions,   all   of    which   conformed   with   Chinese\n\ncriminal law, Zhang still enjoyed significant benefits from the\n\ngovernment in the sense that he remained employed by a company in\n\nwhich the government was a majority owner.         Therefore, the IJ held\n\nthat even though some Falun Gong practitioners were persecuted,\n\nthis did not mean that Zhang himself would be persecuted or\n\ntortured upon his return to China.         Instead, the IJ characterized\n\n\n5\n    Zhang testified that he believed that he needed his               birth\ncertificate to complete his application and was thus waiting          until\nhe received it in order to file. The IJ held that this was            not a\nvalid excuse for his tardiness, because he could have easily          filed\nby using his passport.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fZhang's decision to remain in the United States as a result of a\n\n\"business transaction turned sour\" and noted that the seizure of\n\nhis home was not related to his practice of Falun Gong, but instead\n\nto the fact that he had effectively abandoned his job, and that the\n\nCompany owned the house.       Moreover, the IJ noted, Zhang had not\n\ncorroborated his testimony with a letter from either his wife or\n\nhis mentor He, but even if he had done so, this would not have\n\ndischarged his burden of proof on this count.        Finally, the IJ held\n\nthat Zhang had provided no evidence that he was tortured in China,\n\ndefeating his claim for protection under CAT. The IJ granted Zhang\n\nvoluntary departure.\n\n           D.    Motion to Reopen\n\n           On July 26, 2005, Zhang filed a motion to reopen his\n\nremoval proceedings claiming that he could state new facts and\n\nprovide documents that he could not have been presented at the\n\nprior hearing.      The main piece of evidence was a letter from He\n\ndated   March    25,   2005,   which    generally   corroborated   Zhang's\n\ntestimony.6     It also provided additional background related to the\n\nrecent death of Zhang's father and the government's refusal to\n\nprovide compensation for his death, which He claims is evidence\n\n\n\n\n6\n   Zhang claims that He was unwilling to write on his behalf\nearlier, due to threats made by the government to He's business\ninterests.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fthat the government is still \"going after\" Zhang.7           The other new\n\nitems of evidence submitted by Zhang were (i) He's Hong Kong ID\n\ncard; (ii) a business license for the Company; (iii) a shareholding\n\nstructure certificate for the company; (iv) sections from the\n\ncriminal procedure code of China; (v) a forensic report on the\n\ndeath of Zhang's father; (vi) a diagnosis report on the same; (vii)\n\nZhang's notarized birth certificate.         The BIA denied the motion to\n\nreopen on the grounds that it was filed more than 90 days after the\n\nBIA's decision, in contravention of 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n           We review the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for\n\nabuse of discretion.   Maryam v. Gonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201793\"><a href=\"/opinion/201793/maryam-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).

Abudu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112016\"><a href=\"/opinion/112016/ins-v-abudu/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n104 (1988).   It may hold that the movant (i) has not established a\n\nprima facie case for the substantive relief sought; (ii) has not\n\nintroduced evidence that is material and was unavailable during the\n\noriginal   proceedings;   or   (iii)    is   simply   not   entitled   to   a\n\ndiscretionary grant of relief.     Id. at 104-05.       See also 8 C.F.R.\n\n\n7\n   Neither He's letter nor the other documents submitted with\nZhang's motion to reopen provide any evidence as to why Zhang would\nbe entitled to compensation for his father's death.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f§ 1003.2(c)(1) In most circumstances, a motion to reopen must be\n\nfiled within 90 days of a final administrative order of removal.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i).          An exception to this deadline is\n\nmade for evidence based on changed conditions in the country to\n\nwhich removal has been ordered, \"if such evidence is material and\n\nwas not available and would not have been discovered or presented\n\nat the previous proceeding.\"        8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).8\n\n             In this case, it is not disputed that Zhang missed the\n\n90-day deadline.        Zhang instead argues that the BIA should have\n\napplied the equitable tolling doctrine to extend his filing period.\n\nThis   doctrine    \"provides    that   in     exceptional      circumstances,    a\n\nstatute of limitations may be extended for equitable reasons not\n\nacknowledged in the statute creating the limitations period.\"\n\nNeverson v.

We need not do so here.\n\n            Zhang did not raise his equitable tolling argument before\n\nthe BIA.     Indeed his motion to reopen made at best passing\n\nreference to its untimeliness.9         Zhang therefore failed to pursue\n\nthis remedy below, and we \"may review a final order of removal only\n\nif . . . the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies\n\navailable to the alien as of right . . . .\"            8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).\n\nBecause Zhang did not exhaust all of his administrative remedies\n\nregarding his equitable tolling claim, we lack jurisdiction to\n\nadjudicate it.     See Joumaa, 446 F.3d at 246 (declining to decide\n\nwhether the equitable tolling doctrine applies to an untimely\n\nmotion to reopen because petitioner did not argue the issue before\n\nthe BIA).\n\n            We   also   note   that   even   setting    aside   the   issue   of\n\nuntimeliness, the BIA still did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\n\n\n9\n   Zhang concluded his BIA motion to reopen by stating that \"[i]n\nlight of the newly discovered material information, the respondent\nrespectfully requests that this Honorable Board reopen his removal\nproceeding.\"    It would be quite a stretch to say that this\nreference to \"newly discovered material information\" addresses the\nfact that his motion was untimely, and in any case, Zhang does not\nbrief this or any other argument regarding his failure to raise\nequitable tolling before the BIA.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fZhang's motion to reopen.            Of the documents Zhang submitted with\n\nhis    motion    to    reopen,    only   the    letter    from    He    was    arguably\n\nunavailable at the time of Zhang's original proceedings, and its\n\nmateriality to the case is minimal.10             Zhang does not show that the\n\nnew    evidence       regarding    withholding    of     compensation         after   his\n\nfather's death now establishes a prima facie case for relief, and\n\neven if it did, the BIA still had discretion to deny the motion.\n\nZhang does not argue that the BIA's decision to do so was arbitrary\n\nor capricious.          See Chen, 415 F.3d at 153.           Finally, the BIA's\n\nfailure to equitably toll the deadline when Zhang did not urge it\n\nto do so -- nor have we ever held that it even could do so -- was\n\ncertainly not a misinterpretation of the law.                    Id.\n\n              In sum, Zhang may not pursue his equitable tolling\n\nargument before this Court because he did not raise it before the\n\nBIA.     He     has    presented    no   other   legal     basis       to   excuse    the\n\nuntimeliness of his motion to reopen. Finally, even had the motion\n\nbeen timely filed, the BIA still did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying it.\n\n                                  III.   Conclusion\n\n              For all of the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition\n\nfor review and affirm the decision of the BIA.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n10\n     Indeed He's letter serves mainly to corroborate Zhang's\ntestimony, but the IJ explicitly stated that even with such\ncorroboration Zhang could still not discharge his burden of proof.\n\n                                         -11-\n\f</pre>",
