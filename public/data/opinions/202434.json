Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n          Torruella, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Frank Igwebuike Enwonwu, on brief pro se.\n     Dana Gershengorn, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, on Motion for Summary\nDisposition.\n\n\n\n\n                           September 26, 2006\n\f           Per Curiam. Frank I. Enwonwu, an alien who was convicted\n\nof drug trafficking in 1986 and faces deportation on that ground,1\n\nsought relief from that conviction by petitioning for a writ of\n\ncoram nobis.2    On the government's motion, the district court\n\ndenied the petition, and Enwonwu has appealed that denial to this\n\ncourt.    After Enwonwu filed his appellate brief, the government\n\nmoved for summary affirmance under 1st Cir. R. 27(c).                For the\n\nreasons   detailed   below,    we   grant   that   motion   and   affirm   the\n\ndistrict court's judgment.\n\n           Since the district court did not set forth its reasons\n\nfor denying the petition, \"we may affirm based on any dispositive\n\nissue that is both readily evident and sufficiently supported by\n\nthe record.\"    In re Pub. Offering PLE Antitrust Litig., 427 F.3d\n\n49, 52 (1st Cir. 2005).       We by-pass the threshold argument raised\n\nby the government concerning the timeliness of the petition, which\n\nturns on disputed facts not resolved by the district court, and\n\nproceed to consider whether the petition states a claim for coram\n\nnobis relief.    To the extent that the district court denied the\n\n\n\n     1\n      For background on the deportation proceedings, see Enwonwu v.\nGonzales, 438 F.3d 22 (1st Cir. 2006). Those proceedings are still\nongoing as a result of this court's remand of Enwonwu's claim for\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture to the Board of\nImmigration Appeals for further consideration. Id. at 35.\n     2\n      Alternatively, Enwonwu sought relief under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n60(b), which applies only to civil cases, Fed. R. Civ. P. 1, and\ntherefore cannot serve as a means of seeking relief from a criminal\nconviction.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fpetition on that ground, our review of that denial is de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Sawyer, 239 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Assuming, without deciding, that coram nobis relief is\n\navailable to correct legal, as opposed to factual, errors, see id.\n\nat 38 (citing Supreme Court dicta to the contrary but finding it\n\nunnecessary to decide that issue), this \"'extraordinary remedy'\n\n[is] allowed 'only under circumstances compelling such action to\n\nachieve justice,'\" id. (quoting United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S.\n\n502, 511 (1954)).         Indeed, given the other statutory remedies\n\navailable in criminal cases, the Supreme Court found it \"difficult\n\nto conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where\n\n[a   writ   of   coram   nobis]   would   be    necessary   or    appropriate.\"\n\nCarlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996).               Accordingly,\n\nto invoke the writ to vacate a conviction based on a guilty plea,\n\nas Enwonwu seeks to do here, the petitioner must \"demonstrat[e]\n\nthat an error of 'the most fundamental character,' relevant to the\n\nplea decision, occurred.\"         Hager v. United States, 993 F.2d 4, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512).\n\n            Here, the only error Enwonwu relies upon is the purported\n\nineffectiveness of his trial counsel.           This run-of-the-mill ground\n\nfor collaterally attacking a conviction, even if meritorious, is\n\nhardly so extraordinary as to warrant coram nobis relief. Indeed,\n\nit is doubtful that Enwonwu's primary claim--that his counsel was\n\nineffective      in   failing     to   advise    him   of   the    deportation\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fconsequences of his plea--constitutes error at all, see United\n\nStates v. Gonzales, 202 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2000), much less\n\n\"error of the most fundamental character\" necessary to warrant such\n\nrelief.3\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Given this conclusion, we need not address the other two\nprerequisites for coram nobis relief: justification for failure to\nseek relief from his conviction earlier and demonstration of\ncontinuing collateral consequences of the conviction.
