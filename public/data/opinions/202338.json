On October 7, 2003, the district court\n\nentered summary judgment against plaintiff Eddie Otero-Varcálcel on\n\nhis claims that his then-employer, the Puerto Rico Industrial\n\nDevelopment Company (PRIDCO), and several fellow employees, had\n\nengaged in unlawful political discrimination by stripping him of\n\nduties    and     responsibilities    as     PRIDCO's     Director    of   Labor\n\nRelations.      See Otero-Varcálcel v. Cantero Frau, Civ. No. 02-1685\n\n(PG), slip op. at 1 (D.P.R. Oct. 7, 2003) (opinion and order).               The\n\ncourt    concluded    that    the   privations    Otero    suffered    did   not\n\nimplicate his federal constitutional rights because Otero held a\n\npolicy-making      position   for   which    political    affiliation      was   a\n\npermissible requirement.        See id. at 6-9.     We affirmed the court's\n\nruling in an unpublished opinion.           See Otero-Varcálcel v. Cantero-\n\nFrau, 124 Fed. Appx. 662 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            On March 26, 2004, some five months after the district\n\ncourt's ruling, Hiram Ramírez Rangel, PRIDCO's Executive Director,\n\nterminated Otero's employment.          Thereafter, PRIDCO (through its\n\nagents) rebuffed Otero's repeated requests that he be reinstated to\n\na career position within PRIDCO. On August 20, 2004, Otero brought\n\nthe     present    action,    in    which    he   alleges    entitlement         to\n\nreinstatement under PRIDCO Personnel Regulation 5.5B, amended and\n\nreissued as Personnel Regulation VII B(B)(4)(b) following the\n\ninstitution of this lawsuit, and that the refusal to accord him his\n\nregulatory reinstatement right was prompted by unlawful political\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdiscrimination.      Once again, the district court entered summary\n\njudgment against Otero, concluding that the present claim could\n\nhave been brought in the earlier action and thus was barred by the\n\nres judicata doctrine.       See Otero-Varcálcel v. Puerto Rico Indus.\n\nDev. Co., Civil No. 04-1858 (PG), slip op. at 4-9 (D.P.R. Aug. 29,\n\n2005) (opinion and order). Otero appeals, arguing that his present\n\nclaim -- based on a refusal to reinstate following termination --\n\ndid not ripen until after the district court entered its original\n\njudgment against him.\n\n             The district court's res judicata rationale for entering\n\njudgment against Otero may be problematic, but we may affirm on any\n\nground that is supported by the record.             E.g., Stoll v. Principi,\n\n449   F.3d    263,   265    (1st     Cir.    2006).      Here,       there    is   a\n\nstraightforward alternative ground for affirmance.               The personnel\n\nregulation on which Otero relies creates a reinstatement right only\n\nfor a policy-making employee who, inter alia, has assumed his\n\nposition \"as a result of a transfer or assignment from another\n\ngovernment agency.\"        In other words, the regulation protects only\n\na former career employee whose ascension to a policy-making post\n\nwas   at   the   instigation    or    behest   of     some   third    party    with\n\nsupervisory authority over him in his career position.                  But Otero\n\nwas not \"transferred\" or \"assigned\" by a third party to the\n\nposition of Director of Labor Relations; he resigned from his\n\nformer career position at another government agency to assume the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fpost.   For this reason (at least), Otero has not met his burden of\n\nshowing   that   the   personnel   regulation   entitles     him    to\n\nreinstatement.\n\n           Otero has no response to this line of argument other than\n\nto cite a case from the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, Piñero\n\nGonzalez v. AAA, 146 D.P.R. 890 (1998), in which, Otero says, the\n\nCourt recognized a reinstatement right for a plaintiff in a policy-\n\nmaking role who, prior to assuming her new position, resigned as\n\na career employee of the Municipality of San Juan.    But Otero has\n\nnot supplied us with a certified translation of the Piñero opinion.\n\nSee Lopez-Gonzalez v. Municipality of Comerio, 404 F.3d 548, 553\n\nn.4 (1st Cir. 2005) (failure to provide certified translations of\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court opinions published only in Spanish gives\n\nrise to a waiver); see also First Circuit Local Rule 30(d).        Nor\n\nhas he argued that the Piñero Court considered whether a person who\n\nhas resigned from a career position to assume a policy-making\n\nposition can be thought to have entered the new post \"as a    result\n\nof a transfer or assignment,\" as the PRIDCO regulation requires.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we shall not construe the \"transfer or\n\nassignment\" provision of the regulation contrary to its ordinary\n\nconnotation, which does not encompass the present situation.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
