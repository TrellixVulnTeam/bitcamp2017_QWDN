Jay A. Garcia-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Eduardo A. Vera-Ramírez, with whom Eileen Landron Guardiola,\nIvette M. Berrios Hernandez, and Landrón & Vera, LLP were on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     James L. Feldesman, with whom Feldesman Tucker Leifer Fidell,\nLLP was on brief, for appellee Concilio de Salud Integral de Loiza,\nInc.\n\n\n                        February 14, 2005\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.    This case raises two issues of\n\nimportance to the administration of Medicaid funds for medically\n\nunderserved populations.    The first is whether the health centers\n\nserving those populations have enforceable rights to sue, under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, to obtain an injunction requiring that monies\n\n(called wraparound payments) be paid as they become due.             The\n\nsecond is how a federal court hearing such a prospective claim\n\nshould proceed when parallel litigation is proceeding in a state\n\ncourt, seeking damages for past overdue payments and other relief.\n\nOf course, due to the Eleventh Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, suits for such past damages may often only be brought\n\nin state court.    And so, in the world of Medicaid payments, such\n\nparallel suits are not uncommon.\n\n           Here, the Secretary of Health for the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico, Johnny Rullan, appeals from the grant of a preliminary\n\ninjunction that forced him to make a prospective interim Medicaid\n\nreimbursement payment to the plaintiff health center, Concilio de\n\nSalud Integral de Loiza, Inc. (\"Loiza\"), for the first quarter of\n\n2005.1   It is undisputed that the Secretary has not, to date, been\n\nin compliance with the special Medicaid reimbursement requirements\n\napplicable   to   federally-qualified   health   centers   (FQHCs)   like\n\nLoiza, which provide care to medically underserved populations. 42\n\n\n     1\n      The other plaintiffs to this federal action, Rio Grande\nCommunity Health Center and Dr. Jose S. Belaval, Inc., are not\nparties to this appeal.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fU.S.C. §§ 1396a(bb).   As a result of the Secretary's noncompliance\n\nwith these requirements, the plaintiff Puerto Rico FQHCs alleged\n\nthey were experiencing financial problems and Loiza, in particular,\n\nalleged that it was facing imminent foreclosure and bankruptcy.\n\nThe Secretary did not seriously deny this.\n\n           Nonetheless, the Secretary argues that the preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief given here was inappropriate. He argues that (1)\n\nthe district court should have abstained, under Younger v. Harris,\n\n401 U.S. 37 (1971), from granting relief, because of a pending\n\nlocal court action on similar issues; (2) there is no action to\n\nenforce the relevant provisions of the Medicaid law under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983; and (3) the district court otherwise abused its discretion\n\nin granting the injunction because relief was moot and for other\n\nreasons.\n\n           We affirm. Younger does not apply to the sort of ongoing\n\nlocal court action at issue here.     The exceptional circumstances\n\nnecessary for abstention due to the mere presence of a parallel\n\nstate court action, under Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.\n\nv. United States, 424 U.S. 800 (1976), are absent.     There is an\n\nimplied action under section 1983 to enforce the special provisions\n\nof the Medicaid law dealing with FQHC reimbursement, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a(bb), as these provisions vest the FQHCs with a federal right\n\nto proper reimbursement.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f                                        I.\n\nThe Medicaid scheme\n\n            Loiza operates a community \"health center\" under the\n\nPublic Health Service [PHS] Act, 42 U.S.C. § 254b.                   Such centers\n\nmust meet various requirements: most importantly, they must be\n\nlocated in a medically underserved area or serve a medically\n\nunderserved population.          42 U.S.C. § 254b(a)(1).           They must also\n\nprovide    services   to   Medicaid      recipients.         See    42    U.S.C.   §\n\n254b(k)(3)(E). As a \"health center,\" Loiza is eligible to receive,\n\nand has received, federal grant funds under section 330 of the\n\nPublic Health Service Act.         42 U.S.C. § 254b.\n\n            Loiza   alleges      that   the     Commonwealth    has      failed    to\n\nproperly    compensate     the    plaintiff      health    centers       for   their\n\ntreatment of Medicaid patients.           Some elaboration of the Medicaid\n\nscheme is needed to understand the dispute.               The Medicaid program,\n\nwhich was begun in 1965, is jointly supported with federal and\n\nstate funds and directly administered by state governments: the\n\npurpose is to provide medical assistance to indigent families with\n\ndependent children, as well as indigent disabled, blind, and aged\n\nindividuals.   42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.; see Rabin v. Wilson-Coker,\n\n362 F.3d 190, 192 (2d Cir. 2004).             The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nis such a state for Medicaid purposes, 42 U.S.C. § 1301(a)(1), and\n\nfor these purposes we refer to it as a state.                  A state need not\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fparticipate in Medicaid, but once a state decides to participate,\n\nit must comply with all federal requirements.\n\n            One   such   federal    requirement      is   that   a    state   must\n\nprovide, as a part of its Medicaid plan, certain types of health\n\nservices.    42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10).         For example, a state must\n\nprovide \"Federally-qualified health center services.\"                 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a(a)(10)(A); 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(2)(C). Such services can, by\n\nstatutory definition, only be provided by \"Federally-qualified\n\nhealth centers\" (FQHCs).     Loiza is a FQHC because it is eligible to\n\nreceive grants under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act\n\n(most importantly, it serves a medically underserved area).                     42\n\nU.S.C. § 254b.\n\n            Federal law regulates in great detail the ways in which\n\nFQHCs receive     payment   for     the   services    that   they     provide   to\n\nMedicaid patients.       The special provisions on FQHC reimbursement\n\nreflect the important public health role that these centers play.\n\nThe FQHC reimbursement scheme has changed several times, most\n\nrecently on January 1, 2001.        The system in place between 1989 and\n\n2000 required that FQHCs be reimbursed for \"100 percent . . . of\n\n[each   FQHC's]    costs    which    are    reasonable.\"         42    U.S.C.    §\n\n1396a(a)(13)(C) (repealed 2000).\n\n            A new system, which relieved centers of having to supply\n\nnew cost data every year, was put in place after fiscal year 2000.\n\nThe new system, which is the focus of this action, is referred to\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fas the prospective payment system (PPS).       The first step is to\n\ncalculate each center's total cost of providing Medicaid services\n\nfor two years, 1999 and 2000.      FQHCs must submit detailed cost\n\nreports and only \"reasonable\" costs can be considered.     42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1396a(bb)(2).    The total reasonable costs for 1999 and 2000 are\n\nthen divided by the total number of visits by Medicaid patients in\n\nthose two years to obtain an average per visit rate.      Id.   This\n\n1999 and 2000 per visit cost data becomes the baseline cost data\n\nthat will be used for all future years.    42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(2)-\n\n(3).\n\n           To obtain a center's reimbursement for fiscal year 2001,\n\nthis per visit average cost from 1999 and 2000 is multiplied by the\n\nnumber of Medicaid visits in fiscal year 2001.          42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a(bb)(2).     In subsequent years (fiscal year 2002, etc.), the\n\nper visit average cost of 1999 and 2000 is first multiplied by a\n\nMedicare Economic Index (\"MEI\" -- a standard measure of inflation)\n\nand then multiplied by the number of visits in those succeeding\n\nyears.2    The amount of the per visit payment thus automatically\n\nrises every year, because of the MEI, and costs are no longer re-\n\naudited every year as the 1999 and 2000 per visit cost figures are\n\nthe baseline for the calculation.      New visit data, of course, is\n\nnecessary for each new year.     A state may only deviate from the\n\n\n       2\n      The formula is slightly more complex because changes in the\nscope of services provided can be used to adjust the payments, both\nin fiscal year 2001 and thereafter. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(2), (3).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fvery specific payment methodology of the PPS if the FQHC involved\n\ngives its consent and there is no reduction in total payments made\n\nas compared to the PPS method.    42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(6).   No such\n\nconsent to deviate was given by Loiza here.\n\n            The system of states reimbursing FQHCs for their Medicaid\n\ncosts is complicated considerably by the fact that many states --\n\nincluding the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico -- use a managed care\n\napproach to running their Medicaid system.    Essentially, the state\n\nMedicaid agency contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs,\n\ncommonly known as health maintenance organizations or HMOs) to\n\narrange for the delivery of health care services to Medicaid\n\npatients.    The state generally pays each MCO a fixed monthly sum\n\nper Medicaid patient assigned to the MCO; in return, the MCO agrees\n\nto provide all covered services to the individual.     The MCO turns\n\na profit if its costs are less than the fixed monthly sum, and has\n\na loss if its costs are more than the fixed monthly sum.      Unless\n\nthe MCO actually owns hospitals and clinics, it then must contract\n\nwith various health care providers, including FQHCs, in order to\n\nactually provide services to Medicaid patients.\n\n            A problem arises when the MCO contract with the FQHC\n\ngives the FQHC less than the amount of compensation it is supposed\n\nto get according to the detailed per visit PPS reimbursement method\n\noutlined above.   Congress has dealt with this problem by providing\n\nthat states must pay FQHCs a supplemental or wraparound payment to\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fmake up the difference between what the MCO is paying the FQHC and\n\nwhat the FQHC is entitled to via the detailed PPS methodology.3                  42\n\nU.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(5).           Such wraparound payments must be made at\n\nleast three times each year.             Id.      Thus, even in a managed care\n\nsystem like Puerto Rico's, FQHCs are protected and must receive\n\nreimbursements equal to the PPS methodology that Congress has laid\n\nout.       Since Puerto Rico uses a managed care system, FQHCs will get\n\nMedicaid payments from two sources: first, the MCO, and second, a\n\nwraparound payment from the Commonwealth.\n\nFacts as to Puerto Rico's compliance\n\n               This    case   arose     because    the   Commonwealth     did   not\n\nestablish a PPS promptly after January 1, 2001, when the system\n\ncame into effect.        In fact, no wraparound payments at all were made\n\nby the Commonwealth to FQHCs before the federal court, and a\n\nCommonwealth court in a related case, recently ordered relief.\n\n               The commencement of a related state court case by various\n\nPuerto Rican          FQHCs   against   the     Commonwealth   on   May   10,   2002\n\napparently led the Commonwealth to begin developing a PPS, but not\n\nto make payments.             After the commencement of that case, the\n\nCommonwealth filed amendments to its state Medicaid plan adding the\n\nPPS methodology as laid out in the statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb),\n\nto its plan without adding much, if any, additional detail beyond\n\n\n       3\n      Congress created the wraparound requirement for FQHCs in 1997,\nseveral years before the PPS for FQHCs was statutorily created.\nSee 42 U.S.C § 1396a(a)(13)(C) (repealed 2000).\n\n                                          -8-\n\fwhat is stated in the statute itself.        These amendments were\n\napproved by the federal government on April 8, 2003.\n\n            In July 2003, the Commonwealth's Department of Health\n\nhired an auditor, Ramon L. Marrero Rosado (\"Marrero\"), to assist it\n\nin actually performing the calculations that would be necessary to\n\npay its obligations under the PPS.    Marrero produced a spreadsheet\n\ncontaining the data he gathered and calculations he performed,\n\ndated November 25, 2003.\n\n            Marrero attempted to calculate some of the basic data\n\nneeded. He assembled data from government agencies and MCOs on the\n\ntotal number of patients seen by each of the Puerto Rico FQHCs in\n\n1999 and 2000.    For two reasons, this was not equivalent to the\n\nnumber of Medicaid visits data required by federal law.    First, it\n\nincluded all patients, not just those using Medicaid.     To adjust\n\nfor this, Marrero multiplied the total number of patients by\n\nanother number, the percentage of patients attended to who are\n\n\"purely Medicaid.\"   It is unclear exactly what the source of this\n\n\"purely Medicaid\" data is or what precisely it means.    Second, the\n\nPPS statute speaks of a per visit rate, not a per patient rate.\n\nMarrero testified to the federal court that he could not correct\n\nfor this error because of limitations in the data.     But he stated\n\nthat the per visit number could be calculated if better data were\n\nobtained.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f            Marrero also produced data on the Medicaid costs of the\n\nvarious FQHCs, including Loiza.      Total cost data for 1999 and 2000\n\nwas obtained from each of the centers, averaged between the two\n\nyears, and adjusted slightly for reasons that are unclear.               There\n\nwere   no     significant    adjustments     to    the     cost   data     for\n\nreasonableness; the statutory requirement is that only reasonable\n\ncosts be used.    42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(2).       This total cost data was\n\nmultiplied by the \"purely Medicaid\" percentage to obtain data on\n\neach   center's    total    Medicaid-related      costs.      Marrero     then\n\nsubtracted other sources of income for the centers in 1999 and 2000\n\nfrom these total Medicaid costs.          For example, any payments made\n\nfrom the MCOs to the FQHCs in 1999 and 2000 were subtracted.             Also,\n\ngrants made to the centers under section 330 of the Public Health\n\nService Act in 1999 and 2000 were subtracted.            The plaintiffs have\n\nargued that Marrero acted illegally in subtracting section 330\n\ngrants.\n\n            Comparing the total costs for 1999/2000 with the total\n\nincome for those same years, Marrero ultimately came up with a net\n\nnumber.     This number was positive for most of the centers, but it\n\nwas negative for Loiza: $776,626.           Marrero represented this as\n\nmeaning that no wraparound payment was owed to most of the centers\n\n-- only Loiza and one other FQHC were actually owed wraparound\n\npayments.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f           Whether the data was correct as to years before 2001 need\n\nnot concern us. Marrero's calculation is not a correct calculation\n\nof the proper wraparound payment for any of the years at issue\n\nsince the January 1, 2001 establishment of the PPS.             The average\n\ncost per Medicaid visit for 1999 and 2000 is to be used as the\n\nbaseline for establishing per visit costs in every subsequent year\n\n(multiplied by the MEI after 2001).      42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(2)-(3).\n\nHowever, only these per visit costs are standardized; one still\n\nneeds new Medicaid visit and MCO payment data for each center for\n\nevery subsequent year in order to calculate the amount of the\n\nwraparound payment due in that given year.         Since there is no MCO\n\npayment or visit data on the spreadsheet for the years 2001 up to\n\nthe present (all of the income and visit data is from the 1999 and\n\n2000 periods), wraparound payments for those later years cannot be\n\ncalculated from Marrero's data.          The data on the spreadsheet\n\nappears to come closest to accurately calculating the wraparound\n\npayments due in 1999 and 2000.\n\nLoiza's Financial Situation\n\n           There was testimony on the precarious financial state of\n\nLoiza.    Jose Orlando Colon Gonzalez (\"Colon\"), an accountant,\n\ntestified on March 15, 2004, that Loiza had four sources of funds:\n\n\"program income\" from customers able to make cash payments because\n\nof private insurance or other reasons, section 330 grants from the\n\nfederal   government,   contractual     payments   from   the    MCOs,   and\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fwraparound payments from the Commonwealth to make up the difference\n\nbetween MCO payments and payments required under the PPS.                   He\n\ntestified that program income was only a small portion of the total\n\nbudget and that the MCOs had not made any payments to Loiza \"for\n\nthe last few months.\"       He further testified that neither Loiza nor\n\nany other center had ever received any wraparound payments from the\n\nPuerto Rican government.       To make matters worse, Loiza was told by\n\nthe federal government that its section 330 federal grants would be\n\nstopped on March 31, 2004, if it did not submit quarterly financial\n\nreports for the 2003 fiscal year by that date.              Colon stated that\n\nLoiza could not afford the audit needed to prepare the reports\n\nbecause it did not have the money to pay for it.\n\n             Colon prepared a monthly projected income statement for\n\nLoiza for March and April 2004.          Expenses exceeded income for each\n\nof these two months by substantial margins ($141,067 in April\n\n2004). Colon also testified that even before March 2004, Loiza was\n\nalready $688,000 behind on its mortgage payments.              He stated that\n\nthe mortgage had been overdue for eight or nine months and that the\n\nbank   had   told   Loiza   that   it    was   going   to   begin   foreclosure\n\nproceedings.\n\n                                        II.\n\nProcedural background\n\n             On May 10, 2002, some thirteen months before this federal\n\naction was filed, Loiza and 18 other FQHCs sued the Commonwealth of\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fPuerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Secretary of Health, and related\n\nparties in a Commonwealth court in San Juan. The complaint alleged\n\nthat the Commonwealth was not properly making payments under the\n\nPPS effective after January 2001 and codified at 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a(bb), and in fact that it had not yet created a system to make\n\nsuch payments.     The complaint asked that the state court issue a\n\nwrit of mandamus ordering the Secretary of Health to comply with\n\nhis duties under the PPS, that it issue a declaratory judgment that\n\nthe   defendants   were   acting    unlawfully,   and   that    it   order\n\nretroactive damages relief back to October 1, 1997.            It did not\n\nexpressly seek injunctions that future payments be made.\n\n          A year and a half later, after the federal action had\n\ncommenced, the Commonwealth court issued a partial judgment on\n\nDecember 18, 2003.     This judgment stated that it was determining\n\ntwo discrete issues related to the controversy. First, \"whether or\n\nnot the [section] 330 funds received by co-plaintiffs\" could be\n\ndeducted \"from the total amount of the costs that . . . Puerto Rico\n\nhas to reimburse the centers.\"      On this issue, the court ruled for\n\nthe plaintiffs that no deduction of section 330 grants should be\n\nallowed because section 330 grants are for special purposes and\n\ncannot be used to cover the costs of services to Medicaid patients.\n\nUsing such section 330 grants to reduce wraparound payments would\n\nbe defeating the purpose of section 330 grants by essentially\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fforcing health centers to use these grants for Medicaid purposes.4\n\nThe second issue the local court addressed in this order was\n\n\"whether . . . Puerto Rico can establish a 7.5% cap to the\n\nadministrative       expenses    incurred       by   the    community    centers   in\n\nproviding their [Medicaid] services.\" Here, the court held that no\n\nsuch 7.5% cap is in the statute or any regulations, and therefore\n\nit cannot be used.\n\n             Loiza and two of the other FQHCs that had initially filed\n\nsuit in Commonwealth court had brought suit in federal court on\n\nJune 6, 2003 and had filed an amended complaint on October 23,\n\n2003,     naming    as   a   defendant    Secretary        Rullan.5     The   amended\n\ncomplaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleged a failure by the\n\ndefendant to set up a PPS and make wraparound payments as required\n\nby   law.     The    amended     complaint      asked,      as   relief,   that    the\n\ndefendant's failure to establish a proper PPS and make wraparound\n\npayments be declared unlawful, that the defendant be enjoined to\n\n\n      4\n      The state court heard the Commonwealth's motion for\nreconsideration of the section 330 part of this partial judgment at\na hearing on June 3, 2004; it issued a partial judgment granting\nthe motion for reconsideration on June 16, 2004, notably well after\nthe   preliminary   injunction   being   appealed  here.      After\nreconsideration it partially reversed course. This new judgment\nheld that some section 330 grant funds actually could be counted as\nincome for purposes of calculating the amount of the wraparound\npayment under the PPS.\n      5\n      The initial complaint named the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\nas a party as well. After the Commonwealth moved to dismiss on\nEleventh Amendment immunity grounds, the plaintiffs amended the\ncomplaint, removing the Commonwealth as a party and leaving only\nthe Secretary of Health.\n\n                                         -14-\n\festablish a PPS, that the court enjoin the defendant to make\n\nemergency wraparound payments (based on reasonable approximations)\n\nto   the    plaintiffs     until   a    PPS     can    be    established,        and   for\n\nattorney's fees and costs.         Unlike the state court complaint, the\n\namended complaint in federal court did not ask for retroactive\n\nmonetary relief:         such   relief    would       be    clearly   barred      by   the\n\nEleventh Amendment, as the Commonwealth has not waived its immunity\n\nfrom this kind of suit in federal court.\n\n             All of the plaintiffs in the federal action filed a\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction and for summary judgment on\n\nJanuary 7, 2004, some six months after the complaint was filed,\n\narguing that the case raised no genuine issues of material fact\n\nagainst them and that the requirements for a preliminary injunction\n\nhad been met.      Before the district court had issued any ruling on\n\nthat motion, Loiza filed a motion for a temporary restraining order\n\non March 1, 2004.        The motion asked that the Secretary be ordered\n\nto   make    an   emergency     prospective       payment,       covering        Medicaid\n\nreimbursement      for    the   first    quarter       of    2004,    due   to    Loiza's\n\nprecarious financial position. A magistrate judge to whom the case\n\nwas referred for recommendation held an evidentiary hearing on that\n\nmotion on March 15, 2004, at which three witnesses testified.\n\n             Loiza argued that emergency relief was appropriate and\n\nnecessary and that given this need, the district court should use\n\nparts of the Commonwealth auditor's (Marrero) calculations, making\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fcorrections to these in a few places where this was possible and\n\nlegally   required.     The    district      court   granted   a   preliminary\n\ninjunction to Loiza on March 31, 2004, and essentially adopted\n\nLoiza's suggestions on how to modify the auditor's calculations.\n\n            The court stated first that the relief being requested\n\nposed no Eleventh Amendment immunity problems, given that no\n\nretroactive monetary relief was sought and that the Secretary was\n\nbeing sued solely so that he would fulfill prospective duties under\n\nfederal law. The court also noted that abstention under Younger v.\n\nHarris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), and Colorado River Water Conservation\n\nDist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800 (1976), was not appropriate\n\nbecause the relief sought in the state case differed from the\n\nrelief sought in the federal case, inasmuch as retroactive monetary\n\nrelief was only sought in the state case.            Further, Loiza was not\n\nseeking to sidestep an unfavorable state court ruling that was on\n\nappeal.\n\n            Finally,   the    court    considered    the   four    traditional\n\nelements of a preliminary injunction -- likelihood of success on\n\nthe merits, irreparable harm, balance of hardships, and public\n\ninterest.   See McGuire v. Reilly, 260 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThe court held that since the 2001 Medicaid law amendment requiring\n\nstates to use a PPS and make wraparound payments is clear, as is\n\nthe Commonwealth's noncompliance with that law (a fact not disputed\n\nby the Commonwealth), Loiza demonstrated a strong probability of\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fsuccess on the merits.     On the other three prongs, the court\n\nstressed that Loiza would have to close its doors if it did not get\n\na prompt payment, which would harm \"hundreds of Medicaid patients,\"\n\nwhile a single quarterly payment made by the Commonwealth would\n\nhave little effect on the public treasury.\n\n          The court's injunction ordered the Secretary to make the\n\nfirst quarter 2004 payment by April 7, 2004.     Specifically, the\n\ncourt adopted the following methodology:\n\n          2. In computing the first quarter payment, Dr. Rullan\n          shall use the number of Medicaid patients annually served\n          by Loiza during 1999-2000 [according to the auditor's\n          calculations], to wit, 8009.\n          3. The above number shall be multiplied by one fourth\n          (1/4) of the annual total average of Medicaid patient\n          cost incurred by Loiza during 1999-2000 [according to the\n          auditor], to wit, $644.49.     This fraction amounts to\n          $161.17.\n          4. Dr. Rullan, may in turn, deduct any sums paid to Loiza\n          by a managed care entity for the provisions of services\n          to Medicaid during the first quarter of 2004.\n          5. Dr. Rullan shall not deduct [section 330] grant funds\n          Loiza has received under the [PHS] Act.\n          6. If Dr. Rullan cannot . . . rapidly and effectively\n          calculate items 4-5 above, he shall base his payment\n          amount exclusively on the numbers in items 2-3, above.\n\nThe court used the government auditor Marrero's methodology and\n\nnumbers except for two changes.\n\n          First, the auditor had subtracted payments made by MCOs\n\nto Loiza in 1999/2000 from the amount of the wraparound due; the\n\ncourt did not allow this but would only allow deductions of MCO\n\npayments made in the first quarter of 2004.     This was clearly a\n\nproper correction.   Second, the auditor deducted funds received by\n\n\n                               -17-\n\fLoiza as section 330 grants from total costs when determining\n\nMedicaid payments due (this is the key issue that was before the\n\nlocal court). The district court, siding with Loiza at this stage,\n\ndid not allow section 330 grant funds to reduce Medicaid payments.\n\nSeveral other problems with the auditor's methodology were left\n\nuncorrected for purposes of this emergency order,6 given the need\n\nfor rapid relief.\n\n              On April 6, 2004, the Secretary filed a motion with the\n\ndistrict court to set aside the district court's March 31, 2004\n\norder granting a preliminary injunction; this was denied on April\n\n20,   2004.      This   motion   was    based   on   a   new   order   from   the\n\nCommonwealth court in the related local case, filed on March 30,\n\n2004, one day before the federal court order at issue, ordering the\n\npayment of $776,626 from the Commonwealth to Loiza within thirty\n\ndays. The amount that it ordered the Commonwealth to give Loiza is\n\nfrom the \"net\" column on the auditor Marrero's chart. The district\n\ncourt, in its denial of reconsideration, noted that the Secretary\n\nhad not given him any information to assess whether the local court\n\norder was prospective or retroactive relief, nor had the Secretary\n\nshown that he had complied with the local court order.                 Moreover,\n\nthe Secretary failed to provide to the district court a certified\n\n\n\n      6\n      For example, the auditor's use of a per patient rather than\nper visit scale was not corrected. As well, the number of patients\nseen in first quarter 2004 was unavailable, so the auditor's\ncalculation of patients in 1999/2000 was used instead.\n\n                                       -18-\n\fEnglish translation of the Commonwealth court order.       A motion to\n\nalter or amend the April 20 decision, filed with an English\n\ntranslation of the March 30 Commonwealth court order, was submitted\n\non April 21; this was denied as well on April 22.     It is now clear\n\nthat the Commonwealth court was ordering a retroactive damages\n\npayment in its March 30 order.7\n\nAppellate Jurisdiction\n\n          Meanwhile,   the   Secretary   had   appealed   the   district\n\ncourt's March 31 preliminary injunction on April 5, 2004.        We have\n\njurisdiction over an interlocutory order granting or denying a\n\npreliminary injunction.   28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1); Matrix Group Ltd.\n\nv. Rawlings Sporting Goods Co., 378 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          The Secretary's motion for the district court to \"set\n\naside\" its March 31, 2004 order should be considered a timely\n\nmotion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e).\n\nSee Silberstein v. IRS, 16 F.3d 858, 859 (8th Cir. 1994).          If a\n\nparty files, as here, a notice of appeal after the entry of\n\n\n     7\n      One of the filings that the Commonwealth submitted to this\ncourt, with a Rule 28(j) letter, stated explicitly that the state\ncourt had twice found that the payment it ordered was retroactive\nand for a different period than the federal preliminary injunction.\nFurther, the federal statute requires wraparound payments to be\nmade at least three times per year, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(5)(B),\nwhile the Commonwealth's Medicaid plan calls for quarterly\npayments. The payment ordered by the state court was for an entire\nyear.   If the state court was ordering prospective relief, it\npresumably would have ordered only a quarterly payment, like the\nfederal district court, and not a full annual payment. Finally,\nthe Commonwealth court made none of the corrections that the\ndistrict court used to update Marrero's 1999/2000 data for 2004.\n\n                                -19-\n\fjudgment but before the entry of orders disposing of timely motions\n\nto   alter   or   amend    a    judgment,    the   notice   of   appeal    becomes\n\neffective after the order disposing of those motions. Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 4(a)(4)(B)(i). The Secretary's notice of appeal is effective to\n\ngive us jurisdiction over the March 31 preliminary injunction\n\norder.\n\n             However, we have no jurisdiction over the April 20 order\n\nor any later orders denying motions to alter or amend the judgment.\n\nNo new notice of appeal was filed after these orders were entered,\n\nas   required     by    Fed.   R.   App.    P.   4(a)(4)(B)(ii).         Thus,   our\n\njurisdiction is confined to the earlier, March 31, 2004, order.\n\nSee, e.g., Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Greentree Transp. Trucking Co.,\n\n293 F.3d 120, 126 (3d Cir. 2002); EEOC v. Union Independiente de la\n\nAutoridad de Acueductos, 279 F.3d 49, 54 n.5 (1st Cir. 2002); Fant\n\nv. New Eng. Power Serv. Co., 239 F.3d 8, 13 n.4 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nBut see Beason v. United Techs. Corp., 337 F.3d 271, 274-75 (2d\n\nCir. 2003) (appeals court has discretion to hear at least purely\n\nlegal arguments raised on a reconsideration motion even if notice\n\nof appeal was not amended pursuant to Rule 4(a)(4)(B)(ii)).\n\n             To   the    extent     we   have    any   discretion   to    exercise\n\njurisdiction over these later orders, which is doubtful, we decline\n\nto exercise it -- the Secretary did not even reference those later\n\norders in his brief.           And even if we had discretion and chose to\n\nassume jurisdiction over these later orders, it would not change\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fthe result here, because as we have already noted, the Commonwealth\n\nlocal court payment ordered on March 30, 2004 (the basis for the\n\nmotions) was retroactive and thus for a different period than the\n\ndistrict court's order of prospective relief.\n\n              On appeal, the Secretary raises three arguments: 1) the\n\ndistrict court should have abstained from hearing the case,8 2)\n\nLoiza cannot bring a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to\n\nenforce the Medicaid provision at issue, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb), and\n\n3) granting the preliminary injunction was otherwise inappropriate.\n\nWe address these points in turn.\n\n                                    III.\n\nAbstention\n\n              Ordinarily,   our    review   of    whether    a     preliminary\n\ninjunction has been properly granted is for abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Brooks v. N.H. Supreme Court, 80 F.3d 633, 636-37 (1st Cir.\n\n1996). On the abstention issue, however, our review is necessarily\n\ncontrolled by the precise abstention doctrine at issue.                Id. at\n\n637.       Younger abstention is mandatory if its conditions are met,\n\nand our review of whether these have been met is de novo.                   Esso\n\nStandard Oil Co. v. Cotto, 389 F.3d 212, 217 (1st                Cir. 2004);\n\nBrooks, 80 F.3d at 637.            Decisions whether to grant or deny\n\nabstention      under   Colorado   River    are   reviewed   for    abuse    of\n\n\n\n       8\n     The Secretary has not argued that either the res judicata or\nRooker-Feldman doctrines apply to this case.\n\n                                     -21-\n\fdiscretion.    KPS & Assocs., Inc. v. Designs by FMC, Inc., 318 F.3d\n\n1, 10 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The Supreme Court has identified certain discrete types\n\nof abstention. See Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706,\n\n716-17 (1996) (listing the several types of abstention).                These\n\nvarieties are not \"rigid pigeonholes into which federal courts must\n\ntry to fit cases.\"        Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 11\n\nn.9 (1987); see also Cruz v. Melecio, 204 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). But the categories do matter: they are \"carefully defined,\"\n\nNew Orleans Public Service, Inc. (NOPSI) v. Council of New Orleans,\n\n491 U.S. 350, 359 (1989), and the general rule, unless a case falls\n\ninto one of those exceptions, is that federal courts have a\n\n\"virtually unflagging obligation . . . to exercise the jurisdiction\n\ngiven them.\"     Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United\n\nStates, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976).\n\nYounger abstention\n\n            Here,   the    Secretary   hangs   his   hat   on   the   type   of\n\nabstention identified in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).\n\nYounger held that abstention was required where a plaintiff who was\n\ndefending criminal charges in state court sought to get the federal\n\ncourt to enjoin the ongoing state criminal proceedings. Id. at 53-\n\n54.     Younger is grounded in notions of comity: the idea that the\n\nstate courts should not, in certain circumstances, be interfered\n\nwith.     See Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 601, 603-04\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f(1975).     For   at   least   two     reasons,    the    abstention   principle\n\nannounced in Younger does not apply to this case.\n\n            First, the ongoing state proceeding involved here is not\n\nthe proper type of proceeding to require adherence to Younger\n\nprinciples.       Younger itself occurred within the context of a\n\ncriminal state proceeding.           It has expanded beyond that context,\n\nhowever.    \"[C]ertain types of state civil proceedings\" are also\n\nsubject to Younger abstention.            Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at 716-17.\n\nThe Supreme Court has extended abstention to two types of state\n\ncivil actions.      See NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 367-68.\n\n            First and most importantly, Younger has been extended to\n\nsome    quasi-criminal     (or    at     least    \"coercive\")      state     civil\n\nproceedings -- and even administrative proceedings -- brought by\n\nthe state as enforcement actions against an individual.                     Maymo-\n\nMelendez v. Alvarez-Ramirez, 364 F.3d 27, 31-32, 34 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(applying Younger principles to state administrative disciplinary\n\nproceeding of horse trainer); see, e.g., Middlesex County Ethics\n\nComm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 432, 434-35 (1982)\n\n(Younger abstention appropriate where plaintiff sought to enjoin\n\nongoing state administrative attorney disciplinary proceedings);\n\nMoore v.    Sims,   442    U.S.   415,    423    (1979)    (Younger    abstention\n\nappropriate in context of state child removal proceedings due to\n\nallegations of child abuse); Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434,\n\n444    (1977)   (Younger   applies       to   state   proceeding      to   recover\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\ffraudulently obtained welfare payments); Huffman, 420 U.S. at 603-\n\n05   (Younger abstention   appropriate   where   plaintiff   challenged\n\nongoing state civil nuisance proceedings); Esso Standard Oil Co.,\n\n389 F.3d at 217-18 (using Younger to require abstention in case\n\nwhere environmental board brought state administrative proceedings\n\nagainst gasoline station owner seeking to fine it).\n\n           A second situation where Younger abstention has been seen\n\nas appropriate in civil cases is in those situations uniquely in\n\nfurtherance of the fundamental workings of a state's judicial\n\nsystem.   Middlesex County, 457 U.S. at 432-33; see Pennzoil, 481\n\nU.S. 1, 13 (1987) (Younger extends to challenge to post-judgment\n\nappeal bond); Juidice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327, 335-36 (1977) (Younger\n\napplies to state's enforcement of civil contempt proceedings).       It\n\nis unclear exactly how far this second rationale extends, although\n\nit is related to the coercion/enforcement rationale.9\n\n\n      9\n      Juidice and Middlesex County were both coercive enforcement\ncases brought by the state against an individual; they simply\nhappened to involve, as well, fundamental interests of the state's\njudicial system. Even the Supreme Court's furthest extension of\nthe type of proceedings to which Younger applies, in Pennzoil Co.,\ninvolved this sort of coercive context. Although the underlying\nstate action involved two private parties, Texaco lost the case,\nfaced an $11 billion judgment, and was forced under Texas law to\neither pay the judgment immediately, before appeal, or put up a\nhuge bond at least equal to the amount of the judgment. 481 U.S.\nat 4-5. Texaco brought suit in federal court to challenge those\nbond provisions: it was the \"importance to the States of enforcing\nthe orders and judgments of their courts\" that was sufficient to\nbring Younger considerations into play.     Id. at 13.    Texaco's\nchallenge involved a \"challenge[] to the processes by which the\nState compels compliance with the judgments of its courts.\" Id. at\n13-14.\n\n                                -24-\n\f            Neither of the two core rationales that the Supreme Court\n\nhas used in extending Younger to certain civil proceedings applies\n\nhere.    This is not an enforcement proceeding brought by the state\n\nor an agency against Loiza; in fact Loiza filed suit against the\n\nSecretary in order to force the Commonwealth to fulfill its federal\n\nstatutory obligations.     Nor are the fundamental workings of the\n\nstate's judicial system (like its contempt process or method of\n\nenforcing judgments) put at risk by the relief asked of the federal\n\ncourt.    As well, the Supreme Court has made it clear that it has\n\nnever \"remotely suggest[ed]\" that every pending state proceeding\n\nbetween a state and a private plaintiff justifies abstention if\n\nthat private plaintiff then sues the state in federal court.\n\nMoore, 442 U.S. at 423 n.8.\n\n            The case is close to New Orleans Public Serv., Inc.\n\n(NOPSI) v. Council of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350 (1989), where the\n\nSupreme Court refused to abstain on Younger grounds.        NOPSI, a\n\npublic utility, sought a rate increase from the New Orleans City\n\nCouncil due to increased costs.    When such an increase was denied,\n\nNOPSI filed suit both in federal district court and in state court,\n\nin both instances seeking to have the Council order set aside and\n\nthe Council enjoined to approve a rate increase.      Id. at 355-58.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that Younger abstention did not apply to\n\nthis type of state proceeding, which was a mere \"state judicial\n\nproceeding reviewing legislative or executive action,\" because\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\f\"[s]uch a broad abstention requirement would make a mockery of the\n\nrule that only exceptional circumstances\" justify abstention.                     Id.\n\nat   368.     Perhaps,      the   Court    noted,     in   some    cases   a    state\n\nadministrative      enforcement      proceeding       could   be    seen   as    the\n\nproceeding    to    which    Younger      attached,    with   the    state      court\n\nproceeding merely serving as a continuation of this administrative\n\nenforcement proceeding.           Id. at 368-69; see also Maymo-Melendez,\n\n364 F.3d at 35.      But such a theory could not work in NOPSI, where\n\nthe ratemaking before the City Council was not a judicial but\n\nrather a legislative proceeding.            491 U.S. at 371.\n\n             Here, the state court action, like that in NOPSI, is\n\njudicial review of executive action, rather than an enforcement\n\nproceeding.        As well, there was no administrative enforcement\n\nproceeding before the Commonwealth health agency that triggered the\n\nreview.     In fact there was no administrative proceeding at all\n\ninvolving Loiza; the state and federal challenges are to the\n\nSecretary of Health's failure to implement a PPS, as federal law\n\nrequires.      The state proceedings here do not trigger Younger\n\nabstention requirements.\n\n            For a second (and somewhat related) reason as well,\n\nYounger abstention is inappropriate in this case.                  Younger applies\n\nonly when the relief asked of the federal court \"interfere[s]\" with\n\nthe state proceedings.            See Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at 716.                In\n\nYounger itself, the \"interference\" was the attempt to enjoin the\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fpending state criminal proceeding from going forward. See Younger,\n\n401 U.S. at 41.      The principle, of course, is somewhat broader:\n\ninterference also clearly exists where the plaintiff is seeking a\n\ndeclaratory judgment that a prosecution, or the statute serving as\n\nits basis, is illegal or unconstitutional. See Samuels v. Mackell,\n\n401 U.S. 66, 72 (1971).       Interference is thus usually expressed as\n\na proceeding that either enjoins the state proceeding or has the\n\n\"practical effect\" of doing so. See, e.g., Gilbertson v. Albright,\n\n381 F.3d 965, 977-78 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n            There is no interference with the state court proceedings\n\nin this case.        The federal injunction that Loiza obtained in\n\nfederal court is an injunction to make the state Medicaid agency\n\nperform   certain    acts    required    by    federal   law;   it   is   not   an\n\ninjunction    that   would    stop   the      state   court   from   proceeding\n\nindependently against the state Medicaid agency as well, nor is it\n\ninconsistent with any of the Commonwealth court orders.                         The\n\nCommonwealth court relief sought concerned the full creation of a\n\nPPS and an accounting of sums due.            The Commonwealth court issued\n\na December 18, 2003 partial judgment stating that section 330 grant\n\nfunds could not be deducted from PPS payments (this was later\n\npartially    reversed,      but   only   after    the    federal     preliminary\n\ninjunction had been issued).         The federal court issued an order\n\ngranting emergency, interim relief to Loiza in a way that was\n\n\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fconsistent with the earlier state court partial judgment because it\n\nalso did not allow section 330 grant funds to be deducted.\n\n              Normal res judicata effects of federal actions on state\n\nactions -- which are possible here -- are of course not enough to\n\ntrigger Younger.        The Court noted in NOPSI that the federal\n\nproceeding \"may well affect, or for practical purposes pre-empt, a\n\nfuture -- or, as in the present circumstances, even a pending --\n\nstate-court      action,\"     yet    still     held     Younger     abstention\n\ninappropriate.      NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 373.           Another way of stating\n\nthis is that the mere possibility of inconsistent results in the\n\nfuture is insufficient to justify Younger abstention. This must be\n\nthe   rule,    otherwise    the   principles    of    Colorado    River,   which\n\nnormally apply in the circumstances of parallel federal and state\n\nlitigation, would be overrun by the Younger doctrine.\n\nColorado River abstention\n\n              Except in the very limited instances where some other\n\nform of abstention (such as Younger) applies, abstention of the\n\nfederal courts in cases involving parallel federal and state\n\nproceedings is only appropriate in the \"exceptional\" circumstances\n\nlaid out in Colorado River Water Conservation Dist., 424 U.S. at\n\n818-20.\n\n              Given the \"virtually unflagging obligation of the federal\n\ncourts to exercise the jurisdiction given them,\" and absent the\n\n\"weightier     considerations\"      that    animate   the   other   abstention\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fdoctrines, the circumstances permitting abstention under Colorado\n\nRiver for reasons of \"wise judicial administration\" are quite\n\n\"limited\" and indeed \"exceptional.\"             Id. at 818.       \"Only the\n\nclearest of justifications will warrant dismissal.\"             Id. at 819;\n\nsee also Currie v. Group Ins. Comm'n, 290 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (\"There must be some extraordinary circumstances\" in order\n\nfor a federal court to abstain on Colorado River grounds).             Thus,\n\nthe district court's discretion whether to dismiss a case on\n\nColorado     River   grounds   should     be   heavily     weighted   against\n\ndismissal.     KPS & Assocs., Inc., 318 F.3d at 10.\n\n           We have developed a list of factors -- which is not meant\n\nto be exclusive -- for when Colorado River abstention might be\n\nappropriate.     Courts have considered the following:\n\n           (1) whether either court has assumed jurisdiction over a\n           res; (2) the [geographical] inconvenience of the federal\n           forum; (3) the desirability of avoiding piecemeal\n           litigation; (4) the order in which the forums obtained\n           jurisdiction; (5) whether state or federal law controls;\n           (6) the adequacy of the state forum to protect the\n           parties' interests; (7) the vexatious or contrived nature\n           of the federal claim; and (8) respect for the principles\n           underlying removal jurisdiction.\n\nId.   No one factor is meant to be determinative, but rather courts\n\nmust make a \"carefully considered judgment taking into account both\n\nthe obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the combination of\n\nfactors counselling against that exercise.\"              Colorado River, 424\n\nU.S. at 818; see Moses H. Cone Mem. Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,\n\n460 U.S. 1, 16 (1983); KPS & Assocs., 318 F.3d at 10.\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\f          No factor weighs strongly in favor of abstention here.\n\nIt is true that the state case was filed before the federal case.\n\nHowever, the question of priority was meant to be looked at in a\n\n\"pragmatic, flexible manner[,] with a view to the realities of the\n\ncase at hand\" and should focus on how much \"progress has been made\n\nin the two actions.\"        Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 21.        Here, the\n\nstate court case has been moving quite slowly.          The relief granted\n\nhere by the federal court has far more limited purposes and can be\n\ncarried out far more quickly: it is designed solely to provide an\n\ninterim prospective payment to Loiza while a comprehensive PPS is\n\nbeing created.\n\n          Also, we note that the federal action was not filed or\n\npursued as a reaction to an adverse state court action, which would\n\nbe a factor that weighs heavily in favor of abstention.           See Cruz,\n\n204 F.3d at 23-24.        The partial state judgment issued on December\n\n18, 2003, was, in fact, highly favorable to Loiza.\n\n          There     are    other   crucial   factors   that   weigh   against\n\nabstention here.      This case involves the interpretation of a\n\ncomplicated area of federal law (Medicaid); there appear to be no\n\nstate law issues.    There is no reason to defer to the state court's\n\ninterpretation of the legal issues involved.           See Currie, 290 F.3d\n\nat 11 (stay of federal action on Colorado River grounds when case\n\ninvolved complicated state law issues that, if decided in a certain\n\nway by state courts, might resolve the federal action).           Moreover,\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fLoiza and the other FQHCs had an entirely reasonable explanation\n\nfor why they would want to file actions simultaneously in federal\n\nand state courts.     Because of Eleventh Amendment immunity, claims\n\nfor retroactive compensation can only be filed in Puerto Rico\n\nCommonwealth court.    It is true that prospective relief also could\n\nhave been sought in the Commonwealth courts.             However, it is\n\nreasonable   for   Loiza   to   want   the   federal   courts   to   devise\n\nprospective relief, given the federal courts' greater familiarity\n\nwith the Medicaid Act.\n\n          The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nrefusing to dismiss or stay the claim on Colorado River grounds.\n\n                                   IV.\n\nSection 1983\n\n          The Secretary next argues that there is no cause of\n\naction to enforce this provision of the federal Medicaid law under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.   Not so; a § 1983 action does lie for an FQHC to\n\nenforce the Secretary's obligation to make wraparound payments\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb).\n\n          Section 1983 imposes liability on anyone who, acting\n\nunder color of state law, deprives a person of any \"rights,\n\nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.     Not all violations of federal law give rise to\n\n§ 1983 actions: \"[the] plaintiff must assert the violation of a\n\nfederal right, not merely a violation of federal law.\" Blessing v.\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\fFreestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997) (emphasis in original).                   Such\n\na   right   must    be   \"unambiguously     conferred\"    by    the   statutory\n\nprovision at issue.         Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283\n\n(2002).\n\n            The Supreme Court, in Blessing, has laid out a three-part\n\ntest to act as guidance in determining whether a provision creates\n\na \"right\" that is enforceable under § 1983: 1) whether Congress\n\nintended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff, 2)\n\nwhether the right supposedly protected by the statute is vague and\n\namorphous so that its enforcement would strain judicial competence,\n\nand 3) whether the provision unambiguously imposes a binding\n\nobligation on the States.       See Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340-41.             This\n\ntest is merely a guide, however, as the ultimate inquiry is one of\n\ncongressional intent.       See Bryson v. Shumway, 308 F.3d 79, 88 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).       Gonzaga tightened up the Blessing requirements.               It\n\ndid not precisely follow the Blessing test but rather relied on\n\nseveral somewhat different factors in determining whether a right\n\nexisted: whether the provision contains \"rights-creating language,\"\n\nwhether     the    provision   had   an     aggregate    as    opposed   to     an\n\nindividualized focus, and the other sorts of enforcement provisions\n\nthat Congress has provided for.       See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287-90.10\n\n\n      10\n      We apply the more recent analysis used in Gonzaga rather than\nthe Blessing test. But it is evident from our analysis that the\nthree factors in the Blessing test are all met: Congress did intend\nfor the provision to benefit Loiza as a FQHC, the provision is not\nunduly vague or amorphous, and the provision does bind the states.\n\n                                     -32-\n\f              We start by considering post-Gonzaga precedent in this\n\ncircuit determining whether Medicaid provisions are enforceable\n\nunder § 1983.         In Bryson, we held that a provision, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a(a)(8), stating that state Medicaid plans must provide that\n\nmedical assistance \"shall be furnished with reasonable promptness\n\nto all eligible individuals\" was enforceable by Medicaid recipients\n\nunder § 1983.      308 F.3d at 88-89.         We utilized the Blessing test\n\nand   noted    that    the    provision   included   the   benefitted   class,\n\n\"eligible individuals,\" within its terms, that the provision was\n\nnot vague, and that the \"shall\" language was intended to bind the\n\nstates.    Id.\n\n              On the other hand, in Long Term Care Pharmacy Alliance v.\n\nFerguson, 362 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 2004), this court held that a\n\ndifferent provision, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(30)(A), was not enforceable\n\nby a group of Medicaid providers suing for higher reimbursement\n\nrates under § 1983.          The provision states that the state plan must\n\n              provide such methods and procedures relating to the\n              utilization of, and the payment for, care and services\n              available under the plan . . . as may be necessary . . .\n              to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,\n              economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist\n              enough providers so that care and services are available\n              under the plan at least to the extent that such care and\n              services are available to the general population in the\n              geographic area.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A).          The provision contained no \"rights-\n\ncreating       language,\"       identified     no    \"discrete    class     of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\fbeneficiaries,\" focused on the state as a regulated entity rather\n\nthan any individuals protected, and set out broad, general goals.\n\nSee Ferguson, 362 F.3d at 56-57.11\n\n           The provision that Loiza is seeking to enforce is the\n\nwraparound requirement for FQHCs, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb)(5), which\n\nreads as follows:\n\n                  (A) In general\n           In the case of services furnished by a [FQHC] . . .\n           pursuant to a contract between the center or clinic and\n           a managed care entity . . ., the State plan shall provide\n           for payment to the center or clinic by the State of a\n           supplemental payment equal to the amount (if any) by\n           which the amount determined under [the earlier paragraphs\n           describing the PPS payment system] of this subsection\n           exceeds the amount of the payments provided under the\n           contract.\n                  (B) Payment schedule\n           The supplemental payment required under subparagraph (A)\n           shall be made pursuant to a payment schedule agreed to by\n           the State and the [FQHC] . . ., but in no case less\n           frequently than every 4 months.\n\nId.   This provision meets the tests laid out by the Supreme Court\n\nfor determining whether a \"right\" was created that is enforceable\n\nunder § 1983.\n\n           The provision mentions a specific, discrete beneficiary\n\ngroup within the statutory text -- the FQHCs.     It is \"phrased in\n\n\n\n      11\n      In the same opinion, however, the court assumed that a\ndifferent provision, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(13)(A) (State plan should\nprovide \"for a public process for determination of rates of payment\nunder the plan for hospital services, nursing facility services,\nand services of intermediate care facilities\"), was enforceable\nunder section 1983 because it contained \"rights-creating language\"\nand was narrowly written with a discrete class of beneficiaries in\nmind.

Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 692 n.13\n\n(1979)); see also Bryson, 308 F.3d at 88.    The precise language at\n\nissue, that the state plan \"shall provide for payment to the center\n\n. . . by the State of a supplemental payment,\" 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a(bb)(5)(A),   is   rights-creating   language   because   it   is\n\nmandatory and has a clear focus on the benefitted FQHCs, rather\n\nthan the regulated states.     See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 279, 287\n\n(language stating that \"[n]o funds shall be made available under\n\nany applicable program to any educational agency or institution\n\nwhich has a policy or practice of permitting the release of\n\neducation records\" was not rights-creating because the \"focus is\n\ntwo steps removed from the interests of individual students and\n\nparents\"); see also Rabin v. Wilson-Coker, 362 F.3d 190, 201-02 (2d\n\nCir. 2004) (finding rights-creating language in provision, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1396r-6, stating that \"each State plan approved under this\n\nsubchapter must provide that each family which was receiving [AFDC]\n\nin at least 3 of the 6 months immediately preceding the month in\n\nwhich such family becomes ineligible for such aid . . ., remain\n\neligible for assistance under the plan . . . during the immediately\n\nsucceeding 6-month period\").\n\n            As well, the statute speaks in individualistic terms,\n\nrather than at the aggregate level of institutional policy or\n\npractice.   Nothing like the \"policy or practice\" language present\n\n\n                                -35-\n\fin the provision interpreted in Gonzaga exists here.            See Gonzaga,\n\n536 U.S. at 288; see also Rabin, 362 F.3d at 201.              The mere fact\n\nthat all the Medicaid laws are embedded within the requirements for\n\na state plan does not, by itself, make all of the Medicaid\n\nprovisions    into   ones   stating    a     mere   institutional   policy   or\n\npractice rather than creating an individual right.             See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1320a-2 (\"In an action brought to enforce a provision of this\n\nchapter [which includes the Medicaid statutes], such provision is\n\nnot to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a\n\nsection of this chapter requiring a State plan or specifying the\n\nrequired contents of a State plan.\"); Rabin, 362 F.3d at 201-02.\n\n             Additionally, the commands of § 1396a(bb) are written in\n\nhighly specific terms.       The language here is extremely clear and\n\nnarrow: it tells a state exactly how to calculate the wraparound\n\nand it gives a maximum duration (4 months) between wraparound\n\npayments.    There is thus less danger of disparate outcomes or of a\n\nright being too vague to easily enforce, as noted in Ferguson, 362\n\nF.3d at 58.\n\n             One circuit court, albeit without discussing the issue,\n\nhas recently allowed a § 1983 action to go forward based on\n\nviolations of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb).                See Cmty. Health Ctr. v.\n\nWilson-Coker, 311 F.3d 132, 136 (2d Cir. 2002).12           We conclude that\n\n\n     12\n      As well, several courts in other circuits, after Gonzaga,\nhave allowed actions to go forward under § 1983 using similar\nprovisions of the Medicaid law. See, e.g., Rabin, 362 F.3d at 201-\n\n                                      -36-\n\fa private action can be brought by an FQHC under section 1983 to\n\nenforce 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(bb).\n\n                                  V.\n\n          We    finally consider whether the district court abused\n\nits discretion in determining that the traditional requirements for\n\na preliminary injunction had been met and ordering relief.       Our\n\nreview of approval or denial of a preliminary injunction is for\n\nabuse of discretion.    See McClure v. Galvin, 386 F.3d 36, 41 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).    Many issues have not been challenged on appeal.   For\n\nexample, the Secretary does not argue that the district court's\n\nrefusal to allow the deduction of section 330 grant funds was\n\nerror, and we do not address this issue despite Loiza's urging that\n\n\n\n\n02; S.D. v.

The Seventh Circuit, in\nBruggeman v.

We consider only those challenges raised by the\n\nSecretary on appeal.\n\n            Traditionally, the test for a preliminary injunction has\n\nfour   factors:   1)   a   likelihood     of   success   on   the    merits,   2)\n\nirreparable harm to the plaintiff should preliminary relief not be\n\ngranted, 3) whether the harm to the defendant from granting the\n\npreliminary relief exceeds the harm to the plaintiff from denying\n\nit, and 4) the effect of the preliminary injunction on the public\n\ninterest.   See, e.g., Matrix Group Ltd. v. Rawlings Sporting Goods\n\nCo., 378 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nLikelihood of success on the merits\n\n            The Secretary makes two broad-based challenges to Loiza's\n\nlikelihood of prevailing on the merits.             First, he argues that\n\nLoiza has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits because\n\nthe relief sought by Loiza in fact corresponds to the period 2000-\n\n2003, and thus constitutes retroactive compensation barred by the\n\nEleventh Amendment.          Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 668-71\n\n(1974).   This statement is false: the plaintiffs' complaint in the\n\nfederal case seeks only prospective injunctive and declaratory\n\nrelief, not damages for past wrongs, and the district court's\n\npreliminary injunction only covers the prospective period.\n\n            Second,    the    Secretary    argues   that      he    had   already\n\nestablished the methodology of the PPS plan, largely as a result of\n\nthe parallel state case, and so the federal case was moot.                   See,\n\n\n                                    -38-\n\fe.g., Granite State Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. Town of Orange, 303\n\nF.3d 450, 451 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"In order to establish that there is\n\na likelihood of success on the merits, . . . the movant must\n\nestablish that the case is not likely to be moot.\").    Not so.   The\n\nSecretary's own witness (the auditor Marrero) admitted that no\n\nwraparound payments had ever been made by Puerto Rico to Loiza or\n\nthe other FQHCs. The Commonwealth essentially has admitted that it\n\nhas not been in compliance with federal Medicaid law.         It is\n\nundisputed that Loiza had not yet received the first quarter 2004\n\nwraparound payment at the time of the preliminary injunction.\n\nIrreparable injury, balance of harms, public interest\n\n          Loiza has adequately shown the presence of irreparable\n\nharm if preliminary relief were not granted.   \"Irreparable injury\"\n\nin the preliminary injunction context means an injury that cannot\n\nadequately be compensated for either by a later-issued permanent\n\ninjunction, after a full adjudication on the merits, or by a later-\n\nissued damages remedy.   See, e.g., C. Wright et. al., 11A Federal\n\nPractice & Procedure § 2948.1, at 149 (2d ed. 1995) (\"[I]f a trial\n\non the merits can be conducted before the injury would occur there\n\nis no need for interlocutory relief.\"); D. Dobbs, 1 Law of Remedies\n\n§ 2.11(2), at 260 (2d ed. 1993).      Loiza adequately demonstrated\n\nthat sort of irreparable harm here.     Its witness, the accountant\n\nColon, testified that Loiza had fallen eight or nine months behind\n\non its mortgage and that foreclosure proceedings were about to\n\n\n                               -39-\n\fbegin.    See, e.g., Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 932\n\n(1975) (threat of substantial loss of business and certainly\n\nbankruptcy qualified as the sort of irreparable harm needed to\n\nsupport preliminary injunction).\n\n            The Secretary argues, however, that Loiza has not shown\n\nany causation between its financial woes and the Secretary's\n\nfailure to pay wraparound. This too is incorrect. Colon testified\n\nthat the FQHCs' sources of revenue were fourfold: program income\n\nfrom    paying   customers     or    those       with       private     insurance,      MCO\n\npayments, the wraparound, and section 330 revenue.                             There was\n\nfurther testimony that program income was not substantial, that MCO\n\npayments were generally well below FQHC costs, and that the MCOs\n\nhad not been making payments to Loiza for the past few months.                           It\n\nis not unreasonable to jump from here to a conclusion that the lack\n\nof wraparound payments -- which are supposed to cover for any\n\ndeficiencies     in   MCO    payments      --    was    a    key      cause   of   Loiza's\n\nfinancial difficulties.\n\n            Finally, on the balance of harm and public policy prongs,\n\nwe see nothing unreasonable in the district court's finding that\n\nforcing the Commonwealth government to make a prospective interim\n\npayment to a single FQHC would have no substantial impact on the\n\nCommonwealth fisc, particularly as much of the Medicaid money is\n\nultimately federal. The Secretary argues that granting this relief\n\nhas    interfered     with   the    PPS    that    he       is   in    the    process    of\n\n\n                                          -40-\n\festablishing.     However, the granting of an interim payment, using\n\na rough methodology based on the work of the state's own expert\n\nwhile   a   permanent   PPS   is   being   established,    can     hardly   be\n\nconsidered substantial interference with the creation of that\n\npermanent system.       Finally, we fully agree with the district\n\ncourt's point that any shut down of Loiza would adversely affect\n\nhundreds of Medicaid patients.\n\n            There was no abuse of discretion in the granting of this\n\npreliminary injunction.\n\n                                    VI.\n\n            The   district    court's   grant   of   the   March    31,   2004\n\npreliminary injunction in Loiza's favor is affirmed.               Costs are\n\nawarded to Loiza.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -41-\n\f",

The first is whether the health centers serving those populations have enforceable rights to sue, under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, to obtain an injunction requiring that monies (called wraparound payments) be paid as they become due. The second is how a federal court hearing such a prospective claim should proceed when parallel litigation is proceeding in a state court, seeking damages for past overdue payments and other relief. Of course, due to the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, suits for such past damages may often only be brought in state court. And so, in the world of Medicaid payments, such parallel suits are not uncommon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Secretary of Health for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Johnny Rullan, appeals from the grant of a preliminary injunction that forced him to make a prospective interim Medicaid reimbursement payment to the plaintiff health center, Concilio de Salud Integral de Loiza, Inc. (\"Loiza\"), for the first quarter of 2005.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> It is undisputed that the Secretary has not, to date, been in compliance with the special Medicaid reimbursement requirements applicable to federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) like Loiza, which provide care to medically underserved populations. 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1396a(bb). As a result of the Secretary's noncompliance with these requirements, the plaintiff Puerto Rico FQHCs alleged they were experiencing financial problems and Loiza, in particular, alleged that it was facing imminent foreclosure and bankruptcy. The Secretary did not seriously deny this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the Secretary argues that the preliminary injunctive relief given here was inappropriate. He argues that (1) the district court should have abstained, under <i>Younger v. Harris,</i> 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), from granting relief, because of a pending local court action on similar issues; (2) there is no action to enforce the relevant provisions of the Medicaid law under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983; and (3) the district court otherwise abused its discretion in granting the injunction because relief was moot and for other reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm. <i>Younger</i> does not apply to the sort of ongoing local court action at issue here. The exceptional circumstances necessary for abstention due to the mere presence of a parallel state court action, under <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,</i> 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), are absent. There is an implied action under section 1983 to enforce the special provisions of the Medicaid law dealing with FQHC reimbursement, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb), as these provisions vest the FQHCs with a federal right to proper reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The Medicaid scheme</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza operates a community \"health center\" under the Public Health Service [PHS] Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b. Such centers must meet various requirements: most importantly, they must be located in a medically underserved area or serve a medically underserved population. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b(a)(1). They must also provide services to Medicaid recipients. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b(k)(3)(E). As a \"health center,\" Loiza is eligible to receive, and has received, federal grant funds under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza alleges that the Commonwealth has failed to properly compensate the plaintiff health centers for their treatment of Medicaid patients. Some elaboration of the Medicaid scheme is needed to understand the dispute. The Medicaid program, which was begun in 1965, is jointly supported with federal and state funds and directly administered by state governments: the purpose is to provide medical assistance to indigent families with dependent children, as well as indigent disabled, blind, and aged individuals. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396 <i>et seq.; see Rabin v. Wilson-Coker,</i> 362 F.3d 190, 192 (2d Cir.2004). The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is such a state for Medicaid purposes, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1301(a)(1), and for these purposes we refer to it as a state. A state need not participate in Medicaid, but once a state decides to participate, it must comply with all federal requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One such federal requirement is that a state must provide, as a part of its Medicaid plan, certain types of health services. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(10). For example, a state must provide \"Federally-qualified health center services.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(10)(A); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396d(a)(2)(C). Such services can, by statutory definition, only be provided by \"Federally-qualified health centers\" (FQHCs). Loiza is a FQHC because it is eligible to receive grants under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (most importantly, it serves a medically underserved area). 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal law regulates in great detail the ways in which FQHCs receive payment for the services that they provide to Medicaid patients. The special provisions on FQHC reimbursement reflect the important public health role that these centers play. The FQHC reimbursement scheme has changed several times, most recently on January 1, 2001. The system in place between 1989 and 2000 required that FQHCs be reimbursed for \"100 percent... of [each FQHC's] costs which are reasonable.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(13)(C) (repealed 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new system, which relieved centers of having to supply new cost data every year, was put in place after fiscal year 2000. The new system, which is the focus of this action, is referred to as the prospective payment system (PPS). The first step is to calculate each center's total cost of providing Medicaid services for two years, 1999 and 2000. FQHCs must submit detailed cost reports and only \"reasonable\" costs can be considered. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2). The total reasonable costs for 1999 and 2000 are then divided by the total number of visits by Medicaid patients in those two years to obtain an average per visit rate. <i>Id.</i> This 1999 and 2000 per visit cost data becomes the baseline cost data that will be used for all future years. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2)-(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain a center's reimbursement for fiscal year 2001, this per visit average cost from 1999 and 2000 is multiplied by the number of Medicaid visits in fiscal year 2001. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2). In subsequent years (fiscal year 2002, etc.), the per visit average cost of 1999 and 2000 is first multiplied by a Medicare Economic Index (\"MEI\" &#8212; a standard measure of inflation) and then multiplied by the number of visits in those succeeding years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The amount of the per visit payment thus automatically rises every year, because of the MEI, and costs are no longer re-audited every year as the 1999 and 2000 per visit cost figures are the baseline for the calculation. New visit data, of course, is necessary for each new year. A state may only deviate from the very specific payment methodology of the PPS if the FQHC involved gives its consent and there is no reduction in total payments made as compared to the PPS method. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(6). No such consent to deviate was given by Loiza here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The system of states reimbursing FQHCs for their Medicaid costs is complicated considerably by the fact that many states &#8212; including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico &#8212; use a managed care approach to running their Medicaid system. Essentially, the state Medicaid agency contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs, commonly known as health maintenance organizations or HMOs) to arrange for the delivery of health care services to Medicaid patients. The state generally pays each MCO a fixed monthly sum per Medicaid patient assigned to the MCO; in return, the MCO agrees to provide all covered services to the individual. The MCO turns a profit if its costs are less than the fixed monthly sum, and has a loss if its costs are more than the fixed monthly sum. Unless the MCO actually owns hospitals and clinics, it then must contract with various health care providers, including FQHCs, in order to actually provide services to Medicaid patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A problem arises when the MCO contract with the FQHC gives the FQHC less than the amount of compensation it is supposed to get according to the detailed per visit PPS reimbursement method outlined above. Congress has dealt with this problem by providing that states must pay FQHCs a supplemental or wraparound payment to make up the difference between what the MCO is paying the FQHC and what the FQHC is entitled to via the detailed PPS methodology.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(5). Such wraparound payments must be made at least three times each year. <i>Id.</i> Thus, even in a managed care system like Puerto Rico's, FQHCs are protected and must receive reimbursements equal to the PPS methodology that Congress has laid out. Since Puerto Rico uses a managed care system, FQHCs will get Medicaid payments from two sources: first, the MCO, and second, a wraparound payment from the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Facts as to Puerto Rico's compliance</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arose because the Commonwealth did not establish a PPS promptly after January 1, 2001, when the system came into effect. In fact, no wraparound payments at all were made by the Commonwealth to FQHCs before the federal court, and a Commonwealth court in a related case, recently ordered relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The commencement of a related state court case by various Puerto Rican FQHCs against the Commonwealth on May 10, 2002 apparently led the Commonwealth to begin developing a PPS, but not to make payments. After the commencement of that case, the Commonwealth filed amendments to its state Medicaid plan adding the PPS methodology as laid out in the statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb), to its plan without adding much, if any, additional detail beyond what is stated in the statute itself. These amendments were approved by the federal government on April 8, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2003, the Commonwealth's Department of Health hired an auditor, Ramon L. Marrero Rosado (\"Marrero\"), to assist it in actually performing the calculations that would be necessary to pay its obligations under the PPS. Marrero produced a spreadsheet containing the data he gathered and calculations he performed, dated November 25, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero attempted to calculate some of the basic data needed. He assembled data from government agencies and MCOs on the total number of patients seen by each of the Puerto Rico FQHCs in 1999 and 2000. For two reasons, this was not equivalent to the number of Medicaid visits data required by federal law. First, it included all patients, not just those using Medicaid. To adjust for this, Marrero multiplied the total number of patients by another number, the percentage of patients attended to who are \"purely Medicaid.\" It is unclear exactly what the source of this \"purely Medicaid\" data is or what precisely it means. Second, the PPS statute speaks of a per visit rate, not a per patient rate. Marrero testified to the federal court that he could not correct for this error because of limitations in the data. But he stated that the per visit number could be calculated if better data were obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero also produced data on the Medicaid costs of the various FQHCs, including Loiza. Total cost data for 1999 and 2000 was obtained from each of the centers, averaged between the two years, and adjusted slightly for reasons that are unclear. There were no significant adjustments to the cost data for reasonableness; the statutory requirement is that only reasonable costs be used. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2). This total cost data was multiplied by the \"purely Medicaid\" percentage to obtain data on each center's total Medicaid-related costs. Marrero then subtracted other sources of income for the centers in 1999 and 2000 from these total Medicaid costs. For example, any payments made from the MCOs to the FQHCs in 1999 and 2000 were subtracted. Also, grants made to the centers under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act in 1999 and 2000 were subtracted. The plaintiffs have argued that Marrero acted illegally in subtracting section 330 grants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparing the total costs for 1999/2000 with the total income for those same years, Marrero ultimately came up with a net number. This number was positive for most of the centers, but it was negative for Loiza: $776,626. Marrero represented this as meaning that no wraparound payment was owed to most of the centers &#8212; only Loiza and one other FQHC were actually owed wraparound payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the data was correct as to years before 2001 need not concern us. Marrero's calculation is not a correct calculation of the proper wraparound payment for any of the years at issue since the January 1, 2001 establishment of the PPS. The average cost per Medicaid visit for 1999 and 2000 is to be used as the baseline for establishing per visit costs in every subsequent year (multiplied by the MEI after 2001). 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2)-(3). However, only these per visit costs are standardized; one still needs new Medicaid visit and MCO payment data for each center for every subsequent year in order to calculate the amount of the wraparound payment due in that given year. Since there is no MCO payment or visit data on the spreadsheet for the years 2001 up to the present (all of the income and visit data is from the 1999 and 2000 periods), wraparound payments for those later years cannot be calculated from Marrero's data. The data on the spreadsheet appears to come closest to accurately calculating the wraparound payments due in 1999 and 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Loiza's Financial Situation</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was testimony on the precarious financial state of Loiza. Jose Orlando Colon Gonzalez (\"Colon\"), an accountant, testified on March 15, 2004, that Loiza had four sources of funds: \"program income\" from customers able to make cash payments because of private insurance or other reasons, section 330 grants from the federal government, contractual payments from the MCOs, and wraparound payments from the Commonwealth to make up the difference between MCO payments and payments required under the PPS. He testified that program income was only a small portion of the total budget and that the MCOs had not made any payments to Loiza \"for the last few months.\" He further testified that neither Loiza nor any other center had ever received any wraparound payments from the Puerto Rican government. To make matters worse, Loiza was told by the federal government that its section 330 federal grants would be stopped on March 31, 2004, if it did not submit quarterly financial reports for the 2003 fiscal year by that date. Colon stated that Loiza could not afford the audit needed to prepare the reports because it did not have the money to pay for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colon prepared a monthly projected income statement for Loiza for March and April 2004. Expenses exceeded income for each of these two months by substantial margins ($141,067 in April 2004). Colon also testified that even before March 2004, Loiza was already $688,000 behind on its mortgage payments. He stated that the mortgage had been overdue for eight or nine months and that the bank had told Loiza that it was going to begin foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Procedural background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 2002, some thirteen months before this federal action was filed, Loiza and 18 other FQHCs sued the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Secretary of Health, and related parties in a Commonwealth court in San Juan. The complaint alleged that the Commonwealth was not properly making payments under the PPS effective after January 2001 and codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb), and in fact that it had not yet created a system to make such payments. The complaint asked that the state court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the Secretary of Health to comply with his duties under the PPS, that it issue a declaratory judgment that the defendants were acting unlawfully, and that it order retroactive damages relief back to October 1, 1997. It did not expressly seek injunctions that future payments be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A year and a half later, after the federal action had commenced, the Commonwealth court issued a partial judgment on December 18, 2003. This judgment stated that it was determining two discrete issues related to the controversy. First, \"whether or not the [section] 330 funds received by co-plaintiffs\" could be deducted \"from the total amount of the costs that... Puerto Rico has to reimburse the centers.\" On this issue, the court ruled for the plaintiffs that no deduction of section 330 grants should be allowed because section 330 grants are for special purposes and cannot be used to cover the costs of services to Medicaid patients. Using such section 330 grants to reduce wraparound payments would be defeating the purpose of section 330 grants by essentially forcing health centers to use these grants for Medicaid purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The second issue the local court addressed in this order was \"whether ... Puerto Rico can establish a 7.5% cap to the administrative expenses incurred by the community centers in providing their [Medicaid] services.\" Here, the court held that no such 7.5% cap is in the statute or any regulations, and therefore it cannot be used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza and two of the other FQHCs that had initially filed suit in Commonwealth court had brought suit in federal court on June 6, 2003 and had filed an amended complaint on October 23, 2003, naming as a defendant Secretary Rullan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The amended complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleged a failure by the defendant to set up a PPS and make wraparound payments as required by law. The amended complaint asked, as relief, that the defendant's failure to establish a proper PPS and make wraparound payments be declared unlawful, that the defendant be enjoined to establish a PPS, that the court enjoin the defendant to make emergency wraparound payments (based on reasonable approximations) to the plaintiffs until a PPS can be established, and for attorney's fees and costs. Unlike the state court complaint, the amended complaint in federal court did not ask for retroactive monetary relief: such relief would be clearly barred by the Eleventh Amendment, as the Commonwealth has not waived its immunity from this kind of suit in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the plaintiffs in the federal action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and for summary judgment on January 7, 2004, some six months after the complaint was filed, arguing that the case raised no genuine issues of material fact against them and that the requirements for a preliminary injunction had been met. Before the district court had issued any ruling on that motion, Loiza filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on March 1, 2004. The motion asked that the Secretary be ordered to make an emergency prospective payment, covering Medicaid reimbursement for the first quarter of 2004, due to Loiza's precarious financial position. A magistrate judge to whom the case was referred for recommendation held an evidentiary hearing on that motion on March 15, 2004, at which three witnesses testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza argued that emergency relief was appropriate and necessary and that given this need, the district court should use parts of the Commonwealth auditor's (Marrero) calculations, making corrections to these in a few places where this was possible and legally required. The district court granted a preliminary injunction to Loiza on March 31, 2004, and essentially adopted Loiza's suggestions on how to modify the auditor's calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court stated first that the relief being requested posed no Eleventh Amendment immunity problems, given that no retroactive monetary relief was sought and that the Secretary was being sued solely so that he would fulfill prospective duties under federal law. The court also noted that abstention under <i>Younger v. Harris,</i> 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,</i> 424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), was not appropriate because the relief sought in the state case differed from the relief sought in the federal case, inasmuch as retroactive monetary relief was only sought in the state case. Further, Loiza was not seeking to sidestep an unfavorable state court ruling that was on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court considered the four traditional elements of a preliminary injunction &#8212; likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, balance of hardships, and public interest. <i>See McGuire v. Reilly,</i> 260 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.2001). The court held that since the 2001 Medicaid law amendment requiring states to use a PPS and make wraparound payments is clear, as is the Commonwealth's noncompliance with that law (a fact not disputed by the Commonwealth), Loiza demonstrated a strong probability of success on the merits. On the other three prongs, the court stressed that Loiza would have to close its doors if it did not get a prompt payment, which would harm \"hundreds of Medicaid patients,\" while a single quarterly payment made by the Commonwealth would have little effect on the public treasury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's injunction ordered the Secretary to make the first quarter 2004 payment by April 7, 2004. Specifically, the court adopted the following methodology:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. In computing the first quarter payment, Dr. Rullan shall use the number of Medicaid patients annually served by Loiza during 1999-2000 [according to the auditor's calculations], to wit, 8009.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The above number shall be multiplied by one fourth (1/4) of the annual total average of Medicaid patient cost incurred by Loiza during 1999-2000 [according to the auditor], to wit, $644.49. This fraction amounts to $161.17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Dr. Rullan, may in turn, deduct any sums paid to Loiza by a managed care entity for the provisions of services to Medicaid during the first quarter of 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Dr. Rullan shall not deduct [section 330] grant funds Loiza has received under the [PHS] Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. If Dr. Rullan cannot ... rapidly and effectively calculate items 4-5 above, he shall base his payment amount exclusively on the numbers in items 2-3, above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court used the government auditor Marrero's methodology and numbers except for two changes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the auditor had subtracted payments made by MCOs to Loiza in 1999/2000 from the amount of the wraparound due; the court did not allow this but would only allow deductions of MCO payments made in the first quarter of 2004. This was clearly a proper correction. Second, the auditor deducted funds received by Loiza as section 330 grants from total costs when determining Medicaid payments due (this is the key issue that was before the local court). The district court, siding with Loiza at this stage, did not allow section 330 grant funds to reduce Medicaid payments. Several other problems with the auditor's methodology were left uncorrected for purposes of this emergency order,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> given the need for rapid relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 2004, the Secretary filed a motion with the district court to set aside the district court's March 31, 2004 order granting a preliminary injunction; this was denied on April 20, 2004. This motion was based on a new order from the Commonwealth court in the related local case, filed on March 30, 2004, one day before the federal court order at issue, ordering the payment of $776,626 from the Commonwealth to Loiza within thirty days. The amount that it ordered the Commonwealth to give Loiza is from the \"net\" column on the auditor Marrero's chart. The district court, in its denial of reconsideration, noted that the Secretary had not given him any information to assess whether the local court order was prospective or retroactive relief, nor had the Secretary shown that he had complied with the local court order. Moreover, the Secretary failed to provide to the district court a certified English translation of the Commonwealth court order. A motion to alter or amend the April 20 decision, filed with an English translation of the March 30 Commonwealth court order, was submitted on April 21; this was denied as well on April 22. It is now clear that the Commonwealth court was ordering a retroactive damages payment in its March 30 order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Appellate Jurisdiction</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the Secretary had appealed the district court's March 31 preliminary injunction on April 5, 2004. We have jurisdiction over an interlocutory order granting or denying a preliminary injunction. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(a)(1); <i>Matrix Group Ltd. v. Rawlings Sporting Goods Co.,</i> 378 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary's motion for the district court to \"set aside\" its March 31, 2004 order should be considered a timely motion to alter or amend the judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). <i>See Silberstein v. IRS,</i> 16 F.3d 858, 859 (8th Cir.1994). If a party files, as here, a notice of appeal after the entry of judgment but before the entry of orders disposing of timely motions to alter or amend a judgment, the notice of appeal becomes effective after the order disposing of those motions. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(i). The Secretary's notice of appeal is effective to give us jurisdiction over the March 31 preliminary injunction order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we have no jurisdiction over the April 20 order or any later orders denying motions to alter or amend the judgment. No new notice of appeal was filed after these orders were entered, as required by Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii). Thus, our jurisdiction is confined to the earlier, March 31, 2004, order. <i>See, e.g., Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Greentire Transp. Trucking Co.,</i> 293 F.3d 120, 126 (3d Cir.2002); <i>EEOC v. Union Independiente de la Autoridad de Acueductos,</i> 279 F.3d 49, 54 n. 5 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Fant v. New Eng. Power Serv. Co.,</i> 239 F.3d 8, 13 n. 4 (1st Cir.2001). <i>But see Beason v. United Techs. Corp.,</i> 337 F.3d 271, 274-75 (2d Cir.2003) (appeals court has discretion to hear at least purely legal arguments raised on a reconsideration motion even if notice of appeal was not amended pursuant to Rule 4(a)(4)(B)(ii)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent we have any discretion to exercise jurisdiction over these later orders, which is doubtful, we decline to exercise it &#8212; the Secretary did not even reference those later orders in his brief. And even if we had discretion and chose to assume jurisdiction over these later orders, it would not change the result here, because as we have already noted, the Commonwealth local court payment ordered on March 30, 2004 (the basis for the motions) was retroactive and thus for a different period than the district court's order of prospective relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Secretary raises three arguments: 1) the district court should have abstained from hearing the case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> 2) Loiza cannot bring a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 to enforce the Medicaid provision at issue, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb), and 3) granting the preliminary injunction was otherwise inappropriate. We address these points in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Abstention</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, our review of whether a preliminary injunction has been properly granted is for abuse of discretion. <i>See Brooks v. N.H. Supreme Court,</i> 80 F.3d 633, 636-37 (1st Cir.1996). On the abstention issue, however, our review is necessarily controlled by the precise abstention doctrine at issue. <i>Id.</i> at 637. <i>Younger</i> abstention is mandatory if its conditions are met, and our review of whether these have been met is de novo. <i>Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Cotto,</i> 389 F.3d 212, 217 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Brooks,</i> 80 F.3d at 637. Decisions whether to grant or deny abstention under <i>Colorado River</i> are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>KPS &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Designs by FMC, Inc.,</i> 318 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has identified certain discrete types of abstention. <i>See Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 716-17, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996) (listing the several types of abstention). These varieties are not \"rigid pigeonholes into which federal courts must try to fit cases.\" <i>Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc.,</i> 481 U.S. 1, 11 n. 9, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987); <i>see also Cruz v. Melecio,</i> 204 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir.2000). But the categories do matter: they are \"carefully defined,\" <i>New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (NOPSI) v. Council of City of New Orleans,</i> 491 U.S. 350, 359, 109 S.Ct. 2506, 105 L.Ed.2d 298 (1989), and the general rule, unless a case falls into one of those exceptions, is that federal courts have a \"virtually unflagging obligation ... to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\" <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States,</i> 424 U.S. 800, 817, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Younger abstention</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Secretary hangs his hat on the type of abstention identified in <i>Younger v. Harris,</i> 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). <i>Younger</i> held that abstention was required where a plaintiff who was defending criminal charges in state court sought to get the federal court to enjoin the ongoing state criminal proceedings. <i>Id.</i> at 53-54, 91 S.Ct. 746. <i>Younger</i> is grounded in notions of comity: the idea that the state courts should not, in certain circumstances, be interfered with. <i>See Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.,</i> 420 U.S. 592, 601, 603-04, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975). For at least two reasons, the abstention principle announced in <i>Younger</i> does not apply to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the ongoing state proceeding involved here is not the proper type of proceeding to require adherence to <i>Younger</i> principles. <i>Younger</i> itself occurred within the context of a criminal state proceeding. It has expanded beyond that context, however. \"[C]ertain types of state civil proceedings\" are also subject to <i>Younger</i> abstention. <i>Quackenbush,</i> 517 U.S. at 716-17, 116 S.Ct. 1712. The Supreme Court has extended abstention to two types of state civil actions. <i>See NOPSI,</i> 491 U.S. at 367-68, 109 S.Ct. 2506.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First and most importantly, <i>Younger</i> has been extended to some quasi-criminal (or at least \"coercive\") state civil proceedings &#8212; and even administrative proceedings &#8212; brought by the state as enforcement actions against an individual. <i>Maymo-Melendez v. Alvarez-Ramirez,</i> 364 F.3d 27, 31-32, 34 (1st Cir.2004) (applying <i>Younger</i> principles to state administrative disciplinary proceeding of horse trainer); <i>see, e.g., Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n,</i> 457 U.S. 423, 432, 434-35, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982) (<i>Younger</i> abstention appropriate where plaintiff sought to enjoin ongoing state administrative attorney disciplinary proceedings); <i>Moore v. Sims,</i> 442 U.S. 415, 423, 99 S.Ct. 2371, 60 L.Ed.2d 994 (1979) (<i>Younger</i> abstention appropriate in context of state child removal proceedings due to allegations of child abuse); <i>Trainor v. Hernandez,</i> 431 U.S. 434, 444, 97 S.Ct. 1911, 52 L.Ed.2d 486 (1977) (<i>Younger</i> applies to state proceeding to recover fraudulently obtained welfare payments); <i>Huffman,</i> 420 U.S. at 603-05, 95 S.Ct. 1200 (<i>Younger</i> abstention appropriate where plaintiff challenged ongoing state civil nuisance proceedings); <i>Esso Standard Oil Co.,</i> 389 F.3d at 217-18 (using <i>Younger</i> to require abstention in case where environmental board brought state administrative proceedings against gasoline station owner seeking to fine it).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second situation where <i>Younger</i> abstention has been seen as appropriate in civil cases is in those situations uniquely in furtherance of the fundamental workings of a state's judicial system. <i>Middlesex County,</i> 457 U.S. at 432-33, 102 S.Ct. 2515; <i>see Pennzoil,</i> 481 U.S. 1, 13, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987) (<i>Younger</i> extends to challenge to post-judgment appeal bond); <i>Juidice v. Vail,</i> 430 U.S. 327, 335-36, 97 S.Ct. 1211, 51 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977) (<i>Younger</i> applies to state's enforcement of civil contempt proceedings). It is unclear exactly how far this second rationale extends, although it is related to the coercion/enforcement rationale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of the two core rationales that the Supreme Court has used in extending <i>Younger</i> to certain civil proceedings applies here. This is not an enforcement proceeding brought by the state or an agency against Loiza; in fact Loiza filed suit against the Secretary in order to force the Commonwealth to fulfill its federal statutory obligations. Nor are the fundamental workings of the state's judicial system (like its contempt process or method of enforcing judgments) put at risk by the relief asked of the federal court. As well, the Supreme Court has made it clear that it has never \"remotely suggest [ed]\" that every pending state proceeding between a state and a private plaintiff justifies abstention if that private plaintiff then sues the state in federal court. <i>Moore,</i> 442 U.S. at 423 n. 8, 99 S.Ct. 2371.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is close to <i>New Orleans Public Serv., Inc. (NOPSI) v. Council of City of New Orleans,</i> 491 U.S. 350, 109 S.Ct. 2506, 105 L.Ed.2d 298 (1989), where the Supreme Court refused to abstain on <i>Younger</i> grounds. NOPSI, a public utility, sought a rate increase from the New Orleans City Council due to increased costs. When such an increase was denied, NOPSI filed suit both in federal district court and in state court, in both instances seeking to have the Council order set aside and the Council enjoined to approve a rate increase. <i>Id.</i> at 355-58, 109 S.Ct. 2506. The Supreme Court held that <i>Younger</i> abstention did not apply to this type of state proceeding, which was a mere \"state judicial proceeding reviewing legislative or executive action,\" because \"[s]uch a broad abstention requirement would make a mockery of the rule that only exceptional circumstances\" justify abstention. <i>Id.</i> at 368, 109 S.Ct. 2506. Perhaps, the Court noted, in some cases a state administrative enforcement proceeding could be seen as the proceeding to which <i>Younger</i> attached, with the state court proceeding merely serving as a continuation of this administrative enforcement proceeding. <i>Id.</i> at 368-69, 109 S.Ct. 2506; <i>see also Maymo-Melendez,</i> 364 F.3d at 35. But such a theory could not work in <i>NOPSI,</i> where the ratemaking before the City Council was not a judicial but rather a legislative proceeding. 491 U.S. at 371, 109 S.Ct. 2506.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the state court action, like that in <i>NOPSI,</i> is judicial review of executive action, rather than an enforcement proceeding. As well, there was no administrative enforcement proceeding before the Commonwealth health agency that triggered the review. In fact there was no administrative proceeding at all involving Loiza; the state and federal challenges are to the Secretary of Health's failure to implement a PPS, as federal law requires. The state proceedings here do not trigger <i>Younger</i> abstention requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a second (and somewhat related) reason as well, <i>Younger</i> abstention is inappropriate in this case. <i>Younger</i> applies only when the relief asked of the federal court \"interfere[s]\" with the state proceedings. <i>See Quackenbush,</i> 517 U.S. at 716, 116 S.Ct. 1712. In <i>Younger</i> itself, the \"interference\" was the attempt to enjoin the pending state criminal proceeding from going forward. <i>See Younger,</i> 401 U.S. at 41, 91 S.Ct. 746. The principle, of course, is somewhat broader: interference also clearly exists where the plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that a prosecution, or the statute serving as its basis, is illegal or unconstitutional. <i>See Samuels v. Mackell,</i> 401 U.S. 66, 72, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 688 (1971). Interference is thus usually expressed as a proceeding that either enjoins the state proceeding or has the \"practical effect\" of doing so. <i>See, e.g., Gilbertson v. Albright,</i> 381 F.3d 965, 977-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no interference with the state court proceedings in this case. The federal injunction that Loiza obtained in federal court is an injunction to make the state Medicaid agency perform certain acts required by federal law; it is not an injunction that would stop the state court from proceeding independently against the state Medicaid agency as well, nor is it inconsistent with any of the Commonwealth court orders. The Commonwealth court relief sought concerned the full creation of a PPS and an accounting of sums due. The Commonwealth court issued a December 18, 2003 partial judgment stating that section 330 grant funds could not be deducted from PPS payments (this was later partially reversed, but only after the federal preliminary injunction had been issued). The federal court issued an order granting emergency, interim relief to Loiza in a way that was consistent with the earlier state court partial judgment because it also did not allow section 330 grant funds to be deducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normal res judicata effects of federal actions on state actions &#8212; which are possible here &#8212; are of course not enough to trigger <i>Younger.</i> The Court noted in <i>NOPSI</i> that the federal proceeding \"may well affect, or for practical purposes pre-empt, a future &#8212; or, as in the present circumstances, even a pending &#8212; state-court action,\" yet still held <i>Younger</i> abstention inappropriate. <i>NOPSI,</i> 491 U.S. at 373, 109 S.Ct. 2506. Another way of stating this is that the mere possibility of inconsistent results in the future is insufficient to justify <i>Younger</i> abstention. This must be the rule, otherwise the principles of <i>Colorado River,</i> which normally apply in the circumstances of parallel federal and state litigation, would be overrun by the <i>Younger</i> doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Colorado River abstention</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except in the very limited instances where some other form of abstention (such as <i>Younger</i>) applies, abstention of the federal courts in cases involving parallel federal and state proceedings is only appropriate in the \"exceptional\" circumstances laid out in <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.,</i> 424 U.S. at 818-20, 96 S.Ct. 1236.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the \"virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them,\" and absent the \"weightier considerations\" that animate the other abstention doctrines, the circumstances permitting abstention under <i>Colorado River</i> for reasons of \"wise judicial administration\" are quite \"limited\" and indeed \"exceptional.\" <i>Id.</i> at 818, 96 S.Ct. 1236. \"Only the clearest of justifications will warrant dismissal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 819, 96 S.Ct. 1236; <i>see also Currie v.

Courts have considered the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) whether either court has assumed jurisdiction over a <i>res;</i> (2) the [geographical] inconvenience of the federal forum; (3) the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation; (4) the order in which the forums obtained jurisdiction; (5) whether state or federal law controls; (6) the adequacy of the state forum to protect the parties' interests; (7) the vexatious or contrived nature of the federal claim; and (8) respect for the principles underlying removal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> No one factor is meant to be determinative, but rather courts must make a \"carefully considered judgment taking into account both the obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the combination of factors counselling against that exercise.\" <i>Colorado River,</i> 424 U.S. at 818, 96 S.Ct. 1236; <i>see Moses H. Cone Mem. Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> 460 U.S. 1, 16, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983); <i>KPS &amp; Assocs.,</i> 318 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No factor weighs strongly in favor of abstention here. It is true that the state case was filed before the federal case. However, the question of priority was meant to be looked at in a \"pragmatic, flexible manner [,] with a view to the realities of the case at hand\" and should focus on how much \"progress has been made in the two actions.\" <i>Moses H. Cone,</i> 460 U.S. at 21, 103 S.Ct. 927. Here, the state court case has been moving quite slowly. The relief granted here by the federal court has far more limited purposes and can be carried out far more quickly: it is designed solely to provide an interim prospective payment to Loiza while a comprehensive PPS is being created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, we note that the federal action was not filed or pursued as a reaction to an adverse state court action, which would be a factor that weighs heavily in favor of abstention. <i>See Cruz,</i> 204 F.3d at 23-24. The partial state judgment issued on December 18, 2003, was, in fact, highly favorable to Loiza.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other crucial factors that weigh against abstention here. This case involves the interpretation of a complicated area of federal law (Medicaid); there appear to be no state law issues. There is no reason to defer to the state court's interpretation of the legal issues involved. <i>See Currie,</i> 290 F.3d at 11 (stay of federal action on <i>Colorado River</i> grounds when case involved complicated state law issues that, if decided in a certain way by state courts, might resolve the federal action). Moreover, Loiza and the other FQHCs had an entirely reasonable explanation for why they would want to file actions simultaneously in federal and state courts. Because of Eleventh Amendment immunity, claims for retroactive compensation can only be filed in Puerto Rico Commonwealth court. It is true that prospective relief also could have been sought in the Commonwealth courts. However, it is reasonable for Loiza to want the federal courts to devise prospective relief, given the federal courts' greater familiarity with the Medicaid Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to dismiss or stay the claim on <i>Colorado River</i> grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Section 1983</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary next argues that there is no cause of action to enforce this provision of the federal Medicaid law under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.

Freestone,</i> 520 U.S. 329, 340, 117 S.Ct. 1353, 137 L.Ed.2d 569 (1997) (emphasis in original). Such a right must be \"unambiguously conferred\" by the statutory provision at issue. <i>Gonzaga Univ. v.

This test is merely a guide, however, as the ultimate inquiry is one of congressional intent. <i>See Bryson v. Shumway,</i> 308 F.3d 79, 88 (1st Cir.2002). <i>Gonzaga</i> tightened up the <i>Blessing</i> requirements. It did not precisely follow the <i>Blessing</i> test but rather relied on several somewhat different factors in determining whether a right existed: whether the provision contains \"rights-creating language,\" whether the provision had an aggregate as opposed to an individualized focus, and the other sorts of enforcement provisions that Congress has provided for. <i>See Gonzaga,</i> 536 U.S. at 287-90, 122 S.Ct. 2268.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start by considering post-<i>Gonzaga</i> precedent in this circuit determining whether Medicaid provisions are enforceable under &#167; 1983. In <i>Bryson,</i> we held that a provision, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(8), stating that state Medicaid plans must provide that medical assistance \"shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals\" was enforceable by Medicaid recipients under &#167; 1983. 308 F.3d at 88-89. We utilized the <i>Blessing</i> test and noted that the provision included the benefitted class, \"eligible individuals,\" within its terms, that the provision was not vague, and that the \"shall\" language was intended to bind the states. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, in <i>Long Term Care Pharmacy Alliance v. Ferguson,</i> 362 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.2004), this court held that a different provision, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(30)(A), was not enforceable by a group of Medicaid providers suing for higher reimbursement rates under &#167; 1983. The provision states that the state plan must</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services available under the plan ... as may be necessary ... to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(30)(A). The provision contained no \"rights-creating language,\" identified no \"discrete class of beneficiaries,\" focused on the state as a regulated entity rather than any individuals protected, and set out broad, general goals. <i>See Ferguson,</i> 362 F.3d at 56-57.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision that Loiza is seeking to enforce is the wraparound requirement for FQHCs, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(5), which reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) In general</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of services furnished by a [FQHC] ... pursuant to a contract between the center or clinic and a managed care entity ..., the State plan shall provide for payment to the center or clinic by the State of a supplemental payment equal to the amount (if any) by which the amount determined under [the earlier paragraphs describing the PPS payment system] of this subsection exceeds the amount of the payments provided under the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) Payment schedule</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supplemental payment required under subparagraph (A) shall be made pursuant to a payment schedule agreed to by the State and the [FQHC] ..., but in no case less frequently than every 4 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> This provision meets the tests laid out by the Supreme Court for determining whether a \"right\" was created that is enforceable under &#167; 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision mentions a specific, discrete beneficiary group within the statutory text &#8212; the FQHCs. It is \"phrased in terms of the persons benefitted.\" <i>Gonzaga,</i> 536 U.S. at 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (quoting <i>Cannon v.

The precise language at issue, that the state plan \"shall provide for payment to the center ... by the State of a supplemental payment,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(5)(A), is rights-creating language because it is mandatory and has a clear focus on the benefitted FQHCs, rather than the regulated states. <i>See Gonzaga,</i> 536 U.S. at 279, 287, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (language stating that \"[n]o funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records\" was not rights-creating because the \"focus is two steps removed from the interests of individual students and parents\"); <i>see also Rabin v. Wilson-Coker,</i> 362 F.3d 190, 201-02 (2d Cir.2004) (finding rights-creating language in provision, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396r-6, stating that \"each State plan approved under this subchapter must provide that each family which was receiving [AFDC] in at least 3 of the 6 months immediately preceding the month in which such family becomes ineligible for such aid ..., remain eligible for assistance under the plan ... during the immediately succeeding 6-month period\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As well, the statute speaks in individualistic terms, rather than at the aggregate level of institutional policy or practice. Nothing like the \"policy or practice\" language present in the provision interpreted in <i>Gonzaga</i> exists here. <i>See Gonzaga,</i> 536 U.S. at 288, 122 S.Ct. 2268; <i>see also Rabin,</i> 362 F.3d at 201. The mere fact that all the Medicaid laws are embedded within the requirements for a state plan does not, by itself, make all of the Medicaid provisions into ones stating a mere institutional policy or practice rather than creating an individual right. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-2 (\"In an action brought to enforce a provision of this chapter [which includes the Medicaid statutes], such provision is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of this chapter requiring a State plan or specifying the required contents of a State plan.\"); <i>Rabin,</i> 362 F.3d at 201-02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the commands of &#167; 1396a(bb) are written in highly specific terms. The language here is extremely clear and narrow: it tells a state exactly how to calculate the wraparound and it gives a maximum duration (4 months) between wraparound payments. There is thus less danger of disparate outcomes or of a right being too vague to easily enforce, as noted in <i>Ferguson,</i> 362 F.3d at 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One circuit court, albeit without discussing the issue, has recently allowed a &#167; 1983 action to go forward based on violations of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb). <i>See Cmty. Health Ctr. v. Wilson-Coker,</i> 311 F.3d 132, 136 (2d Cir.2002).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> We conclude that a private action can be brought by an FQHC under section 1983 to enforce 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We finally consider whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that the traditional requirements for a preliminary injunction had been met and ordering relief. Our review of approval or denial of a preliminary injunction is for abuse of discretion. <i>See McClure v. Galvin,</i> 386 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir.2004). Many issues have not been challenged on appeal. For example, the Secretary does not argue that the district court's refusal to allow the deduction of section 330 grant funds was error, and we do not address this issue despite Loiza's urging that we reach it. We consider only those challenges raised by the Secretary on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditionally, the test for a preliminary injunction has four factors: 1) a likelihood of success on the merits, 2) irreparable harm to the plaintiff should preliminary relief not be granted, 3) whether the harm to the defendant from granting the preliminary relief exceeds the harm to the plaintiff from denying it, and 4) the effect of the preliminary injunction on the public interest. <i>See, e.g., Matrix Group Ltd. v. Rawlings Sporting Goods Co.,</i> 378 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Likelihood of success on the merits</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary makes two broad-based challenges to Loiza's likelihood of prevailing on the merits. First, he argues that Loiza has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits because the relief sought by Loiza in fact corresponds to the period 2000-2003, and thus constitutes retroactive compensation barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <i>Edelman v. Jordan,</i> 415 U.S. 651, 668-71, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). This statement is false: the plaintiffs' complaint in the federal case seeks only prospective injunctive and declaratory relief, not damages for past wrongs, and the district court's preliminary injunction only covers the prospective period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Secretary argues that he had already established the methodology of the PPS plan, largely as a result of the parallel state case, and so the federal case was moot. <i>See, e.g., Granite State Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. Town of Orange,</i> 303 F.3d 450, 451 (2d Cir.2002) (\"In order to establish that there is a likelihood of success on the merits, ... the movant must establish that the case is not likely to be moot.\"). Not so. The Secretary's own witness (the auditor Marrero) admitted that no wraparound payments had ever been made by Puerto Rico to Loiza or the other FQHCs. The Commonwealth essentially has admitted that it has not been in compliance with federal Medicaid law. It is undisputed that Loiza had not yet received the first quarter 2004 wraparound payment at the time of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Irreparable injury, balance of harms, public interest</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza has adequately shown the presence of irreparable harm if preliminary relief were not granted. \"Irreparable injury\" in the preliminary injunction context means an injury that cannot adequately be compensated for either by a later-issued permanent injunction, after a full adjudication on the merits, or by a later-issued damages remedy. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, 11A <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 2948.1, at 149 (2d ed. 1995) (\"[I]f a trial on the merits can be conducted before the injury would occur there is no need for interlocutory relief.\"); D. Dobbs, 1 <i>Law of Remedies</i> &#167; 2.11(2), at 260 (2d ed.1993). Loiza adequately demonstrated that sort of irreparable harm here. Its witness, the accountant Colon, testified that Loiza had fallen eight or nine months behind on its mortgage and that foreclosure proceedings were about to begin. <i>See, e.g., Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc.,</i> 422 U.S. 922, 932, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975) (threat of substantial loss of business and certainly bankruptcy qualified as the sort of irreparable harm needed to support preliminary injunction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary argues, however, that Loiza has not shown any causation between its financial woes and the Secretary's failure to pay wraparound. This too is incorrect. Colon testified that the FQHCs' sources of revenue were fourfold: program income from paying customers or those with private insurance, MCO payments, the wraparound, and section 330 revenue. There was further testimony that program income was not substantial, that MCO payments were generally well below FQHC costs, and that the MCOs had not been making payments to Loiza for the past few months. It is not unreasonable to jump from here to a conclusion that the lack of wraparound payments &#8212; which are supposed to cover for any deficiencies in MCO payments &#8212; was a key cause of Loiza's financial difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on the balance of harm and public policy prongs, we see nothing unreasonable in the district court's finding that forcing the Commonwealth government to make a prospective interim payment to a single FQHC would have no substantial impact on the Commonwealth fisc, particularly as much of the Medicaid money is ultimately federal. The Secretary argues that granting this relief has interfered with the PPS that he is in the process of establishing. However, the granting of an interim payment, using a rough methodology based on the work of the state's own expert while a permanent PPS is being established, can hardly be considered substantial interference with the creation of that permanent system. Finally, we fully agree with the district court's point that any shut down of Loiza would adversely affect hundreds of Medicaid patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no abuse of discretion in the granting of this preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's grant of the March 31, 2004 preliminary injunction in Loiza's favor is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to Loiza.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The other plaintiffs to this federal action, Rio Grande Community Health Center and Dr. Jose S.

The first is whether the health centers serving those populations have enforceable rights to sue, under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, to obtain an injunction requiring that monies (called wraparound payments) be paid as they become due. The second is how a federal court hearing such a prospective claim should proceed when parallel litigation is proceeding in a state court, seeking damages for past overdue payments and other relief. Of course, due to the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, suits for such past damages may often only be brought in state court. And so, in the world of Medicaid payments, such parallel suits are not uncommon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the Secretary of Health for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Johnny Rullan, appeals from the grant of a preliminary injunction that forced him to make a prospective interim Medicaid reimbursement payment to the plaintiff health center, Concilio de Salud Integral de Loiza, Inc. (\"Loiza\"), for the first quarter of 2005.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> It is undisputed that the Secretary has not, to date, been in compliance with the special Medicaid reimbursement requirements applicable to federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs) like Loiza, which provide care to medically underserved populations. 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1396a(bb).

There is an implied action under section 1983 to enforce the special provisions of the Medicaid law dealing with FQHC reimbursement, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb), as these provisions vest the FQHCs with a federal right to proper reimbursement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>The Medicaid scheme</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza operates a community \"health center\" under the Public Health Service [PHS] Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b. Such centers must meet various requirements: most importantly, they must be located in a medically underserved area or serve a medically underserved population. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b(a)(1). They must also provide services to Medicaid recipients. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b(k)(3)(E). As a \"health center,\" Loiza is eligible to receive, and has received, federal grant funds under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza alleges that the Commonwealth has failed to properly compensate the plaintiff health centers for their treatment of Medicaid patients. Some elaboration of the Medicaid scheme is needed to understand the dispute. The Medicaid program, which was begun in 1965, is jointly supported with federal and state funds and directly administered by state governments: the purpose is to provide medical assistance to indigent families with dependent children, as well as indigent disabled, blind, and aged individuals. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396 <i>et seq.; see Rabin v. Wilson-Coker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785539\"><a href=\"/opinion/785539/ronni-rabin-individually-and-as-a-representative-of-all-persons-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span>, 192 (2d Cir.2004). The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is such a state for Medicaid purposes, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1301(a)(1), and for these purposes we refer to it as a state. A state need not participate in Medicaid, but once a state decides to participate, it must comply with all federal requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One such federal requirement is that a state must provide, as a part of its Medicaid plan, certain types of health services. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(10). For example, a state must provide \"Federally-qualified health center services.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(10)(A); 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396d(a)(2)(C). Such services can, by statutory definition, only be provided by \"Federally-qualified health centers\" (FQHCs). Loiza is a FQHC because it is eligible to receive grants under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (most importantly, it serves a medically underserved area). 42 U.S.C. &#167; 254b.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal law regulates in great detail the ways in which FQHCs receive payment for the services that they provide to Medicaid patients. The special provisions on FQHC reimbursement reflect the important public health role that these centers play. The FQHC reimbursement scheme has changed several times, most recently on January 1, 2001. The system in place between 1989 and 2000 required that FQHCs be reimbursed for \"100 percent... of [each FQHC's] costs which are reasonable.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(13)(C) (repealed 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A new system, which relieved centers of having to supply new cost data every year, was put in place after fiscal year 2000. The new system, which is the focus of this action, is referred to as the prospective payment system (PPS). The first step is to calculate each center's total cost of providing Medicaid services for two years, 1999 and 2000. FQHCs must submit detailed cost reports and only \"reasonable\" costs can be considered. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2). The total reasonable costs for 1999 and 2000 are then divided by the total number of visits by Medicaid patients in those two years to obtain an average per visit rate. <i>Id.</i> This 1999 and 2000 per visit cost data becomes the baseline cost data that will be used for all future years. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2)-(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain a center's reimbursement for fiscal year 2001, this per visit average cost from 1999 and 2000 is multiplied by the number of Medicaid visits in fiscal year 2001. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2). In subsequent years (fiscal year 2002, etc.), the per visit average cost of 1999 and 2000 is first multiplied by a Medicare Economic Index (\"MEI\" &#8212; a standard measure of inflation) and then multiplied by the number of visits in those succeeding years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The amount of the per visit payment thus automatically rises every year, because of the MEI, and costs are no longer re-audited every year as the 1999 and 2000 per visit cost figures are the baseline for the calculation. New visit data, of course, is necessary for each new year. A state may only deviate from the very specific payment methodology of the PPS if the FQHC involved gives its consent and there is no reduction in total payments made as compared to the PPS method. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(6). No such consent to deviate was given by Loiza here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The system of states reimbursing FQHCs for their Medicaid costs is complicated considerably by the fact that many states &#8212; including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico &#8212; use a managed care approach to running their Medicaid system. Essentially, the state Medicaid agency contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs, commonly known as health maintenance organizations or HMOs) to arrange for the delivery of health care services to Medicaid patients. The state generally pays each MCO a fixed monthly sum per Medicaid patient assigned to the MCO; in return, the MCO agrees to provide all covered services to the individual. The MCO turns a profit if its costs are less than the fixed monthly sum, and has a loss if its costs are more than the fixed monthly sum. Unless the MCO actually owns hospitals and clinics, it then must contract with various health care providers, including FQHCs, in order to actually provide services to Medicaid patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A problem arises when the MCO contract with the FQHC gives the FQHC less than the amount of compensation it is supposed to get according to the detailed per visit PPS reimbursement method outlined above. Congress has dealt with this problem by providing that states must pay FQHCs a supplemental or wraparound payment to make up the difference between what the MCO is paying the FQHC and what the FQHC is entitled to via the detailed PPS methodology.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(5). Such wraparound payments must be made at least three times each year. <i>Id.</i> Thus, even in a managed care system like Puerto Rico's, FQHCs are protected and must receive reimbursements equal to the PPS methodology that Congress has laid out. Since Puerto Rico uses a managed care system, FQHCs will get Medicaid payments from two sources: first, the MCO, and second, a wraparound payment from the Commonwealth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Facts as to Puerto Rico's compliance</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arose because the Commonwealth did not establish a PPS promptly after January 1, 2001, when the system came into effect. In fact, no wraparound payments at all were made by the Commonwealth to FQHCs before the federal court, and a Commonwealth court in a related case, recently ordered relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The commencement of a related state court case by various Puerto Rican FQHCs against the Commonwealth on May 10, 2002 apparently led the Commonwealth to begin developing a PPS, but not to make payments. After the commencement of that case, the Commonwealth filed amendments to its state Medicaid plan adding the PPS methodology as laid out in the statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb), to its plan without adding much, if any, additional detail beyond what is stated in the statute itself. These amendments were approved by the federal government on April 8, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2003, the Commonwealth's Department of Health hired an auditor, Ramon L. Marrero Rosado (\"Marrero\"), to assist it in actually performing the calculations that would be necessary to pay its obligations under the PPS. Marrero produced a spreadsheet containing the data he gathered and calculations he performed, dated November 25, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero attempted to calculate some of the basic data needed. He assembled data from government agencies and MCOs on the total number of patients seen by each of the Puerto Rico FQHCs in 1999 and 2000. For two reasons, this was not equivalent to the number of Medicaid visits data required by federal law. First, it included all patients, not just those using Medicaid. To adjust for this, Marrero multiplied the total number of patients by another number, the percentage of patients attended to who are \"purely Medicaid.\" It is unclear exactly what the source of this \"purely Medicaid\" data is or what precisely it means. Second, the PPS statute speaks of a per visit rate, not a per patient rate. Marrero testified to the federal court that he could not correct for this error because of limitations in the data. But he stated that the per visit number could be calculated if better data were obtained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marrero also produced data on the Medicaid costs of the various FQHCs, including Loiza. Total cost data for 1999 and 2000 was obtained from each of the centers, averaged between the two years, and adjusted slightly for reasons that are unclear. There were no significant adjustments to the cost data for reasonableness; the statutory requirement is that only reasonable costs be used. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2). This total cost data was multiplied by the \"purely Medicaid\" percentage to obtain data on each center's total Medicaid-related costs. Marrero then subtracted other sources of income for the centers in 1999 and 2000 from these total Medicaid costs. For example, any payments made from the MCOs to the FQHCs in 1999 and 2000 were subtracted. Also, grants made to the centers under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act in 1999 and 2000 were subtracted. The plaintiffs have argued that Marrero acted illegally in subtracting section 330 grants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparing the total costs for 1999/2000 with the total income for those same years, Marrero ultimately came up with a net number. This number was positive for most of the centers, but it was negative for Loiza: $776,626. Marrero represented this as meaning that no wraparound payment was owed to most of the centers &#8212; only Loiza and one other FQHC were actually owed wraparound payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the data was correct as to years before 2001 need not concern us. Marrero's calculation is not a correct calculation of the proper wraparound payment for any of the years at issue since the January 1, 2001 establishment of the PPS. The average cost per Medicaid visit for 1999 and 2000 is to be used as the baseline for establishing per visit costs in every subsequent year (multiplied by the MEI after 2001). 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(2)-(3). However, only these per visit costs are standardized; one still needs new Medicaid visit and MCO payment data for each center for every subsequent year in order to calculate the amount of the wraparound payment due in that given year. Since there is no MCO payment or visit data on the spreadsheet for the years 2001 up to the present (all of the income and visit data is from the 1999 and 2000 periods), wraparound payments for those later years cannot be calculated from Marrero's data. The data on the spreadsheet appears to come closest to accurately calculating the wraparound payments due in 1999 and 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Loiza's Financial Situation</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was testimony on the precarious financial state of Loiza. Jose Orlando Colon Gonzalez (\"Colon\"), an accountant, testified on March 15, 2004, that Loiza had four sources of funds: \"program income\" from customers able to make cash payments because of private insurance or other reasons, section 330 grants from the federal government, contractual payments from the MCOs, and wraparound payments from the Commonwealth to make up the difference between MCO payments and payments required under the PPS. He testified that program income was only a small portion of the total budget and that the MCOs had not made any payments to Loiza \"for the last few months.\" He further testified that neither Loiza nor any other center had ever received any wraparound payments from the Puerto Rican government. To make matters worse, Loiza was told by the federal government that its section 330 federal grants would be stopped on March 31, 2004, if it did not submit quarterly financial reports for the 2003 fiscal year by that date. Colon stated that Loiza could not afford the audit needed to prepare the reports because it did not have the money to pay for it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colon prepared a monthly projected income statement for Loiza for March and April 2004. Expenses exceeded income for each of these two months by substantial margins ($141,067 in April 2004). Colon also testified that even before March 2004, Loiza was already $688,000 behind on its mortgage payments. He stated that the mortgage had been overdue for eight or nine months and that the bank had told Loiza that it was going to begin foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Procedural background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, 2002, some thirteen months before this federal action was filed, Loiza and 18 other FQHCs sued the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rico Secretary of Health, and related parties in a Commonwealth court in San Juan. The complaint alleged that the Commonwealth was not properly making payments under the PPS effective after January 2001 and codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb), and in fact that it had not yet created a system to make such payments. The complaint asked that the state court issue a writ of mandamus ordering the Secretary of Health to comply with his duties under the PPS, that it issue a declaratory judgment that the defendants were acting unlawfully, and that it order retroactive damages relief back to October 1, 1997. It did not expressly seek injunctions that future payments be made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A year and a half later, after the federal action had commenced, the Commonwealth court issued a partial judgment on December 18, 2003. This judgment stated that it was determining two discrete issues related to the controversy. First, \"whether or not the [section] 330 funds received by co-plaintiffs\" could be deducted \"from the total amount of the costs that... Puerto Rico has to reimburse the centers.\" On this issue, the court ruled for the plaintiffs that no deduction of section 330 grants should be allowed because section 330 grants are for special purposes and cannot be used to cover the costs of services to Medicaid patients. Using such section 330 grants to reduce wraparound payments would be defeating the purpose of section 330 grants by essentially forcing health centers to use these grants for Medicaid purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The second issue the local court addressed in this order was \"whether ... Puerto Rico can establish a 7.5% cap to the administrative expenses incurred by the community centers in providing their [Medicaid] services.\" Here, the court held that no such 7.5% cap is in the statute or any regulations, and therefore it cannot be used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza and two of the other FQHCs that had initially filed suit in Commonwealth court had brought suit in federal court on June 6, 2003 and had filed an amended complaint on October 23, 2003, naming as a defendant Secretary Rullan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The amended complaint, brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleged a failure by the defendant to set up a PPS and make wraparound payments as required by law. The amended complaint asked, as relief, that the defendant's failure to establish a proper PPS and make wraparound payments be declared unlawful, that the defendant be enjoined to establish a PPS, that the court enjoin the defendant to make emergency wraparound payments (based on reasonable approximations) to the plaintiffs until a PPS can be established, and for attorney's fees and costs. Unlike the state court complaint, the amended complaint in federal court did not ask for retroactive monetary relief: such relief would be clearly barred by the Eleventh Amendment, as the Commonwealth has not waived its immunity from this kind of suit in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the plaintiffs in the federal action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and for summary judgment on January 7, 2004, some six months after the complaint was filed, arguing that the case raised no genuine issues of material fact against them and that the requirements for a preliminary injunction had been met. Before the district court had issued any ruling on that motion, Loiza filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on March 1, 2004. The motion asked that the Secretary be ordered to make an emergency prospective payment, covering Medicaid reimbursement for the first quarter of 2004, due to Loiza's precarious financial position. A magistrate judge to whom the case was referred for recommendation held an evidentiary hearing on that motion on March 15, 2004, at which three witnesses testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza argued that emergency relief was appropriate and necessary and that given this need, the district court should use parts of the Commonwealth auditor's (Marrero) calculations, making corrections to these in a few places where this was possible and legally required. The district court granted a preliminary injunction to Loiza on March 31, 2004, and essentially adopted Loiza's suggestions on how to modify the auditor's calculations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court stated first that the relief being requested posed no Eleventh Amendment immunity problems, given that no retroactive monetary relief was sought and that the Secretary was being sued solely so that he would fulfill prospective duties under federal law. The court also noted that abstention under <i>Younger v.

Further, Loiza was not seeking to sidestep an unfavorable state court ruling that was on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court considered the four traditional elements of a preliminary injunction &#8212; likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, balance of hardships, and public interest. <i>See McGuire v. Reilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199554\"><a href=\"/opinion/199554/mcguire-v-reilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2001). The court held that since the 2001 Medicaid law amendment requiring states to use a PPS and make wraparound payments is clear, as is the Commonwealth's noncompliance with that law (a fact not disputed by the Commonwealth), Loiza demonstrated a strong probability of success on the merits. On the other three prongs, the court stressed that Loiza would have to close its doors if it did not get a prompt payment, which would harm \"hundreds of Medicaid patients,\" while a single quarterly payment made by the Commonwealth would have little effect on the public treasury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's injunction ordered the Secretary to make the first quarter 2004 payment by April 7, 2004. Specifically, the court adopted the following methodology:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. In computing the first quarter payment, Dr. Rullan shall use the number of Medicaid patients annually served by Loiza during 1999-2000 [according to the auditor's calculations], to wit, 8009.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The above number shall be multiplied by one fourth (1/4) of the annual total average of Medicaid patient cost incurred by Loiza during 1999-2000 [according to the auditor], to wit, $644.49. This fraction amounts to $161.17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Dr. Rullan, may in turn, deduct any sums paid to Loiza by a managed care entity for the provisions of services to Medicaid during the first quarter of 2004.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Dr. Rullan shall not deduct [section 330] grant funds Loiza has received under the [PHS] Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6. If Dr. Rullan cannot ... rapidly and effectively calculate items 4-5 above, he shall base his payment amount exclusively on the numbers in items 2-3, above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court used the government auditor Marrero's methodology and numbers except for two changes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the auditor had subtracted payments made by MCOs to Loiza in 1999/2000 from the amount of the wraparound due; the court did not allow this but would only allow deductions of MCO payments made in the first quarter of 2004. This was clearly a proper correction. Second, the auditor deducted funds received by Loiza as section 330 grants from total costs when determining Medicaid payments due (this is the key issue that was before the local court). The district court, siding with Loiza at this stage, did not allow section 330 grant funds to reduce Medicaid payments. Several other problems with the auditor's methodology were left uncorrected for purposes of this emergency order,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> given the need for rapid relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 2004, the Secretary filed a motion with the district court to set aside the district court's March 31, 2004 order granting a preliminary injunction; this was denied on April 20, 2004. This motion was based on a new order from the Commonwealth court in the related local case, filed on March 30, 2004, one day before the federal court order at issue, ordering the payment of $776,626 from the Commonwealth to Loiza within thirty days. The amount that it ordered the Commonwealth to give Loiza is from the \"net\" column on the auditor Marrero's chart. The district court, in its denial of reconsideration, noted that the Secretary had not given him any information to assess whether the local court order was prospective or retroactive relief, nor had the Secretary shown that he had complied with the local court order. Moreover, the Secretary failed to provide to the district court a certified English translation of the Commonwealth court order. A motion to alter or amend the April 20 decision, filed with an English translation of the March 30 Commonwealth court order, was submitted on April 21; this was denied as well on April 22. It is now clear that the Commonwealth court was ordering a retroactive damages payment in its March 30 order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Appellate Jurisdiction</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the Secretary had appealed the district court's March 31 preliminary injunction on April 5, 2004.

This is not an enforcement proceeding brought by the state or an agency against Loiza; in fact Loiza filed suit against the Secretary in order to force the Commonwealth to fulfill its federal statutory obligations. Nor are the fundamental workings of the state's judicial system (like its contempt process or method of enforcing judgments) put at risk by the relief asked of the federal court. As well, the Supreme Court has made it clear that it has never \"remotely suggest [ed]\" that every pending state proceeding between a state and a private plaintiff justifies abstention if that private plaintiff then sues the state in federal court. <i>Moore,</i> 442 U.S. at 423 n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110105\"><a href=\"/opinion/110105/moore-v-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

NOPSI, a public utility, sought a rate increase from the New Orleans City Council due to increased costs. When such an increase was denied, NOPSI filed suit both in federal district court and in state court, in both instances seeking to have the Council order set aside and the Council enjoined to approve a rate increase. <i>Id.</i> at 355-58, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112302\"><a href=\"/opinion/112302/new-orleans-public-service-inc-v-council-of-city-of-new-orleans/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Supreme Court held that <i>Younger</i> abstention did not apply to this type of state proceeding, which was a mere \"state judicial proceeding reviewing legislative or executive action,\" because \"[s]uch a broad abstention requirement would make a mockery of the rule that only exceptional circumstances\" justify abstention. <i>Id.</i> at 368, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112302\"><a href=\"/opinion/112302/new-orleans-public-service-inc-v-council-of-city-of-new-orleans/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Perhaps, the Court noted, in some cases a state administrative enforcement proceeding could be seen as the proceeding to which <i>Younger</i> attached, with the state court proceeding merely serving as a continuation of this administrative enforcement proceeding. <i>Id.</i> at 368-69, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112302\"><a href=\"/opinion/112302/new-orleans-public-service-inc-v-council-of-city-of-new-orleans/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But such a theory could not work in <i>NOPSI,</i> where the ratemaking before the City Council was not a judicial but rather a legislative proceeding. 491 U.S. at 371, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112302\"><a href=\"/opinion/112302/new-orleans-public-service-inc-v-council-of-city-of-new-orleans/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As well, there was no administrative enforcement proceeding before the Commonwealth health agency that triggered the review. In fact there was no administrative proceeding at all involving Loiza; the state and federal challenges are to the Secretary of Health's failure to implement a PPS, as federal law requires. The state proceedings here do not trigger <i>Younger</i> abstention requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a second (and somewhat related) reason as well, <i>Younger</i> abstention is inappropriate in this case. <i>Younger</i> applies only when the relief asked of the federal court \"interfere[s]\" with the state proceedings. <i>See Quackenbush,</i> 517 U.S. at 716, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>. In <i>Younger</i> itself, the \"interference\" was the attempt to enjoin the pending state criminal proceeding from going forward. <i>See Younger,</i> 401 U.S. at 41, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span>. The principle, of course, is somewhat broader: interference also clearly exists where the plaintiff is seeking a declaratory judgment that a prosecution, or the statute serving as its basis, is illegal or unconstitutional. <i>See Samuels v. Mackell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108264\"><a href=\"/opinion/108264/george-samuels-v-thomas-j-mackell-district-attorney-fred-fernandez-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108264\"><a href=\"/opinion/108264/george-samuels-v-thomas-j-mackell-district-attorney-fred-fernandez-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span> (1971). Interference is thus usually expressed as a proceeding that either enjoins the state proceeding or has the \"practical effect\" of doing so. <i>See, e.g., Gilbertson v. Albright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787571\"><a href=\"/opinion/787571/paul-douglas-gilbertson-v-stuart-h-albright-keith-r-battleson-jack-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 977-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no interference with the state court proceedings in this case. The federal injunction that Loiza obtained in federal court is an injunction to make the state Medicaid agency perform certain acts required by federal law; it is not an injunction that would stop the state court from proceeding independently against the state Medicaid agency as well, nor is it inconsistent with any of the Commonwealth court orders. The Commonwealth court relief sought concerned the full creation of a PPS and an accounting of sums due. The Commonwealth court issued a December 18, 2003 partial judgment stating that section 330 grant funds could not be deducted from PPS payments (this was later partially reversed, but only after the federal preliminary injunction had been issued). The federal court issued an order granting emergency, interim relief to Loiza in a way that was consistent with the earlier state court partial judgment because it also did not allow section 330 grant funds to be deducted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normal res judicata effects of federal actions on state actions &#8212; which are possible here &#8212; are of course not enough to trigger <i>Younger.</i> The Court noted in <i>NOPSI</i> that the federal proceeding \"may well affect, or for practical purposes pre-empt, a future &#8212; or, as in the present circumstances, even a pending &#8212; state-court action,\" yet still held <i>Younger</i> abstention inappropriate. <i>NOPSI,</i> 491 U.S. at 373, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112302\"><a href=\"/opinion/112302/new-orleans-public-service-inc-v-council-of-city-of-new-orleans/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2506</span></a></span>. Another way of stating this is that the mere possibility of inconsistent results in the future is insufficient to justify <i>Younger</i> abstention. This must be the rule, otherwise the principles of <i>Colorado River,</i> which normally apply in the circumstances of parallel federal and state litigation, would be overrun by the <i>Younger</i> doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Colorado River abstention</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Except in the very limited instances where some other form of abstention (such as <i>Younger</i>) applies, abstention of the federal courts in cases involving parallel federal and state proceedings is only appropriate in the \"exceptional\" circumstances laid out in <i>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.,</i> 424 U.S. at 818-20, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109405\"><a href=\"/opinion/109405/colorado-river-water-cons-dist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The relief granted here by the federal court has far more limited purposes and can be carried out far more quickly: it is designed solely to provide an interim prospective payment to Loiza while a comprehensive PPS is being created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, we note that the federal action was not filed or pursued as a reaction to an adverse state court action, which would be a factor that weighs heavily in favor of abstention. <i>See Cruz,</i> 204 F.3d at 23-24.

This case involves the interpretation of a complicated area of federal law (Medicaid); there appear to be no state law issues. There is no reason to defer to the state court's interpretation of the legal issues involved. <i>See Currie,</i> 290 F.3d at 11 (stay of federal action on <i>Colorado River</i> grounds when case involved complicated state law issues that, if decided in a certain way by state courts, might resolve the federal action). Moreover, Loiza and the other FQHCs had an entirely reasonable explanation for why they would want to file actions simultaneously in federal and state courts. Because of Eleventh Amendment immunity, claims for retroactive compensation can only be filed in Puerto Rico Commonwealth court. It is true that prospective relief also could have been sought in the Commonwealth courts. However, it is reasonable for Loiza to want the federal courts to devise prospective relief, given the federal courts' greater familiarity with the Medicaid Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to dismiss or stay the claim on <i>Colorado River</i> grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Section 1983</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary next argues that there is no cause of action to enforce this provision of the federal Medicaid law under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.

It did not precisely follow the <i>Blessing</i> test but rather relied on several somewhat different factors in determining whether a right existed: whether the provision contains \"rights-creating language,\" whether the provision had an aggregate as opposed to an individualized focus, and the other sorts of enforcement provisions that Congress has provided for. <i>See Gonzaga,</i> 536 U.S. at 287-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121157\"><a href=\"/opinion/121157/gonzaga-univ-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The mere fact that all the Medicaid laws are embedded within the requirements for a state plan does not, by itself, make all of the Medicaid provisions into ones stating a mere institutional policy or practice rather than creating an individual right. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-2 (\"In an action brought to enforce a provision of this chapter [which includes the Medicaid statutes], such provision is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of this chapter requiring a State plan or specifying the required contents of a State plan.\"); <i>Rabin,</i> 362 F.3d at 201-02.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the commands of &#167; 1396a(bb) are written in highly specific terms.

Many issues have not been challenged on appeal. For example, the Secretary does not argue that the district court's refusal to allow the deduction of section 330 grant funds was error, and we do not address this issue despite Loiza's urging that we reach it. We consider only those challenges raised by the Secretary on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Traditionally, the test for a preliminary injunction has four factors: 1) a likelihood of success on the merits, 2) irreparable harm to the plaintiff should preliminary relief not be granted, 3) whether the harm to the defendant from granting the preliminary relief exceeds the harm to the plaintiff from denying it, and 4) the effect of the preliminary injunction on the public interest. <i>See, e.g., Matrix Group Ltd. v. Rawlings Sporting Goods Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201179\"><a href=\"/opinion/201179/matrix-group-limited-v-rawlings-sporting-go/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Likelihood of success on the merits</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary makes two broad-based challenges to Loiza's likelihood of prevailing on the merits. First, he argues that Loiza has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits because the relief sought by Loiza in fact corresponds to the period 2000-2003, and thus constitutes retroactive compensation barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <i>Edelman v. Jordan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108990\"><a href=\"/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 668-71, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108990\"><a href=\"/opinion/108990/edelman-v-jordan/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This statement is false: the plaintiffs' complaint in the federal case seeks only prospective injunctive and declaratory relief, not damages for past wrongs, and the district court's preliminary injunction only covers the prospective period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Secretary argues that he had already established the methodology of the PPS plan, largely as a result of the parallel state case, and so the federal case was moot. <i>See, e.g., Granite State Outdoor Adver., Inc. v. Town of Orange,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779106\"><a href=\"/opinion/779106/granite-state-outdoor-advertising-inc-v-town-of-orange-connecticut-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 451 (2d Cir.2002) (\"In order to establish that there is a likelihood of success on the merits, ... the movant must establish that the case is not likely to be moot.\"). Not so. The Secretary's own witness (the auditor Marrero) admitted that no wraparound payments had ever been made by Puerto Rico to Loiza or the other FQHCs. The Commonwealth essentially has admitted that it has not been in compliance with federal Medicaid law. It is undisputed that Loiza had not yet received the first quarter 2004 wraparound payment at the time of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Irreparable injury, balance of harms, public interest</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Loiza has adequately shown the presence of irreparable harm if preliminary relief were not granted. \"Irreparable injury\" in the preliminary injunction context means an injury that cannot adequately be compensated for either by a later-issued permanent injunction, after a full adjudication on the merits, or by a later-issued damages remedy. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, 11A <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure</i> &#167; 2948.1, at 149 (2d ed. 1995) (\"[I]f a trial on the merits can be conducted before the injury would occur there is no need for interlocutory relief.\"); D. Dobbs, 1 <i>Law of Remedies</i> &#167; 2.11(2), at 260 (2d ed.1993). Loiza adequately demonstrated that sort of irreparable harm here. Its witness, the accountant Colon, testified that Loiza had fallen eight or nine months behind on its mortgage and that foreclosure proceedings were about to begin. <i>See, e.g., Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109314\"><a href=\"/opinion/109314/doran-v-salem-inn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span>, 932, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109314\"><a href=\"/opinion/109314/doran-v-salem-inn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This too is incorrect. Colon testified that the FQHCs' sources of revenue were fourfold: program income from paying customers or those with private insurance, MCO payments, the wraparound, and section 330 revenue. There was further testimony that program income was not substantial, that MCO payments were generally well below FQHC costs, and that the MCOs had not been making payments to Loiza for the past few months. It is not unreasonable to jump from here to a conclusion that the lack of wraparound payments &#8212; which are supposed to cover for any deficiencies in MCO payments &#8212; was a key cause of Loiza's financial difficulties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on the balance of harm and public policy prongs, we see nothing unreasonable in the district court's finding that forcing the Commonwealth government to make a prospective interim payment to a single FQHC would have no substantial impact on the Commonwealth fisc, particularly as much of the Medicaid money is ultimately federal. The Secretary argues that granting this relief has interfered with the PPS that he is in the process of establishing. However, the granting of an interim payment, using a rough methodology based on the work of the state's own expert while a permanent PPS is being established, can hardly be considered substantial interference with the creation of that permanent system. Finally, we fully agree with the district court's point that any shut down of Loiza would adversely affect hundreds of Medicaid patients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no abuse of discretion in the granting of this preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's grant of the March 31, 2004 preliminary injunction in Loiza's favor is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to Loiza.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The other plaintiffs to this federal action, Rio Grande Community Health Center and Dr. Jose S.

Further, the federal statute requires wraparound payments to be made at least three times per year, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(bb)(5)(B), while the Commonwealth's Medicaid plan calls for quarterly payments. The payment ordered by the state court was for an entire year. If the state court was ordering prospective relief, it presumably would have ordered only a quarterly payment, like the federal district court, and not a full annual payment. Finally, the Commonwealth court made none of the corrections that the district court used to update Marrero's 1999/2000 data for 2004</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The Secretary has not argued that either the res judicata or<i>Rooker-Feldman</i> doctrines apply to this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> <i>Juidice</i> and <i>Middlesex County</i> were both coercive enforcement cases brought by the state against an individual; they simply happened to involve, as well, fundamental interests of the state's judicial system. Even the Supreme Court's furthest extension of the type of proceedings to which <i>Younger</i> applies, in <i>Pennzoil Co.,</i> involved this sort of coercive context. Although the underlying state action involved two private parties, Texaco lost the case, faced an $11 billion judgment, and was forced under Texas law to either pay the judgment immediately, before appeal, or put up a huge bond at least equal to the amount of the judgment. 481 U.S. at 4-5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111856\"><a href=\"/opinion/111856/pennzoil-co-v-texaco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
