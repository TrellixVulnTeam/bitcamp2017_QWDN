Petitioner Radcliffe Nicholson is a native\n                \n\nand citizen of Jamaica who  entered the United States in 1983\n\nat the age of 20  as a lawful permanent resident.   Beginning\n\nin 1985, Nicholson  became involved in a  series of incidents\n\ninvolving  illegal   drugs,  entailing   five  arrests,   two\n\npossession convictions, and ultimately his conviction in 1989\n\nof possession with intent to distribute cocaine.  This charge\n\nmade  him   deportable  under  both  the   aggravated  felony\n\nprovision and  the drug offense provision of  the law.  See 8\n                                                           \n\nU.S.C.    1251(a)(4)(B); (a)(11).\n\n     On  January 4,  1990, the  INS issued  an order  to show\n\ncause why he should not be deported.  The petitioner conceded\n\nthat he was deportable, but asked for a section 212(c) waiver\n\nof inadmissibility.   8 U.S.C.     1182(c).   The immigration\n\njudge  denied his application,  and the Board  of Immigration\n\nAppeals  affirmed this order.   Petitioner  now asks  that we\n\noverturn  the BIA's decision  or remand  for reconsideration.\n\nWe are indebted  to government  counsel for  a helpful  brief\n\nelucidating INS precedent.\n\n     Nicholson meets the statutory requirements for a section\n\n212(c) waiver,  that is, he  is a permanent resident  and has\n\nlived here continuously for at  least seven years.  Joseph v.\n                                                          \n\nINS, 909 F.2d  605, 606 n.1 (1st Cir.  1990); Gando-Coello v.\n                                                          \n\nINS, 888 F.2d 197,  198 (1st Cir. 1989).  Under  In re Marin,\n                                                            \n\n16 I&amp;N  Dec. 581  (BIA 1978), a  balancing test  is employed,\n\n                             -2-\n\nmeasuring the adverse  factors against the social  and humane\n\nconsiderations  to decide,  finally,  if it  is  in the  best\n\ninterests of the country for the individual to remain.  In re\n                                                             \n\nEdwards, Int. Dec. 3134 (BIA 1990).  The number and nature of\n       \n\nthe humane considerations necessary to tip the scales  in the\n\nindividual's favor will vary depending on the severity of the\n\nadverse factors involved.  A  serious narcotics offense is  a\n\nparticularly onerous factor to  overcome, requiring a showing\n\nof unusual  or outstanding equities.   Marin, 16 I&amp;N  Dec. at\n                                            \n\n586  n.4.  Even  a showing of  outstanding equities, however,\n\nmerely means the individual meets a threshold, not that he is\n\nguaranteed the waiver.   In re Buscemi, 19  I&amp;N Dec. 628, 634\n                                      \n\n(BIA 1988).   The  petitioner carries  the burden  of showing\n\nthat  he merits the  relief.  Hazzard  v. INS,  951 F.2d 435,\n                                             \n\n437-38 (1st Cir. 1991); Marin, 16 I&amp;N Dec. at 583.\n                             \n\n     Nicholson's claimed equities  were his relationship with\n\nhis U.S. citizen son, born out of wedlock in 1989; his strong\n\nemotional  ties  with  his  family,  including  his   mother,\n\nstepfather,  brother, and  two sisters  who  all live  in the\n\nBronx; the length of his  residence in the United States; and\n\nevidence of his rehabilitation, including the job he has held\n\nsince his release from prison.  Nicholson further pointed out\n\nthe  dismal economic conditions in Jamaica, claiming he would\n\nbe  unable  to find  work  or  to  provide any  money  toward\n\n                             -3-\n\nsupporting his two  children (he also has a  daughter born in\n\n1983 residing in Jamaica).\n\n     After weighing these factors  against Nicholson's three-\n\nyear involvement with drugs and  the number and nature of his\n\nprior convictions,  the immigration judge  denied Nicholson's\n\napplication for a  212(c) waiver.   In particular, the  judge\n\nnoted that while Nicholson had been told to provide affidavit\n\ntestimony from  the mother  of his  son confirming  financial\n\nsupport,  her  affidavit  made no  mention  of  any financial\n\nassistance  provided  by  Nicholson.    Only Nicholson's  own\n\ntestimony--and his mother's testimony that Nicholson had told\n\nher he gave his children money--indicated that he contributed\n\nanything to  their support.   Both of his children  live with\n\ntheir  mothers, and  his  own claims  about  his daughter  in\n\nJamaica  were very vague, indicating  he sent money and gifts\n\nonly sporadically.\n\n     The   judge  characterized  his   work  history  as  not\n\nsignificant, noting that petitioner had not filed tax returns\n\nfor a  number of years  during which he supported  himself by\n\ndealing drugs and by taking  occasional jobs \"off the books.\"\n\nHis income, as reflected in  tax records, for the second half\n\nof 1991 was less than $5,000.   The judge thus concluded that\n\nno one relied on Nicholson for meaningful financial support.\n\n     The  BIA  affirmed  this  decision,  finding   that  the\n\nimmigration  judge  had  taken  all  relevant  factors   into\n\n                             -4-\n\naccount.  Nicholson  argues that the immigration  judge erred\n\nin concluding  that he  provided little  support for  his son\n\nbased  on his  partial earnings for  1991.   Nicholson claims\n\nthat by working full-time, with  commissions and a raise, his\n\ncurrent  yearly salary  is approximately $16,000.   Nicholson\n\nbears the burden  of establishing his equities, Marin, 16 I&amp;N\n                                                     \n\nDec. at  583, and he  did not provide meaningful  evidence of\n\nsupport.   Nicholson lived apart  from his children,  and the\n\nBIA  is  not  required  to  assume  that  the  petitioner  is\n\nfinancially supporting his children.  Indeed, Nicholson's own\n\ntestimony makes vague references to cash, gifts, and clothes-\n\n-not a systematic, consistent source of support.\n\n     Even  if  petitioner's  gifts  to his  son  were  to  be\n\nclassified as meaningful support, and if his work record were\n\ntaken to  indicate a  greater degree  of rehabilitation  such\n\nthat  his equities met the threshold of outstanding equities,\n\nthe BIA  still has the  discretion to refuse to  grant such a\n\nwaiver, see Joseph v. INS, 909 F.2d 605, 607 (1st Cir. 1990),\n                         \n\nand  we can overturn  the decision only  if we find  it to be\n\n\"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"  Hazzard,\n                                                            \n\n951 F.2d  at 438  (quoting McLean v.  INS, 901 F.2d  204, 205\n                                         \n\n(1st Cir. 1990)).   Indeed, we  do not  require that the  BIA\n\n\"address  specifically each claim the petitioner made or each\n\npiece of evidence  the petitioner presented\"  so long as  the\n\nBIA gives \"reasoned consideration to the petition.\"  Martinez\n                                                             \n\n                             -5-\n\nv. INS, 970 F.2d 973, 974 (1st Cir. 1992).   The BIA gave the\n      \n\npetition  such   reasoned  consideration  in   affirming  the\n\nimmigration judge's  findings and  specifically commented  on\n\npetitioner's history of drug convictions.       \n\n     Petitioner  also  asks  us  to  remand  because  of  new\n\nevidence first made available to the BIA.  On  July 23, 1992,\n\npetitioner filed his appeal to  the BIA.  On August  4, 1992,\n\nanother American citizen son was  born to Nicholson.  The BIA\n\ngave petitioner  several extensions  to file  his brief,  the\n\nfinal  deadline  being January  11,  1993.    On January  19,\n\npetitioner married the  mother of his son, and  on January 27\n\nhe filed his brief  with the BIA  with two exhibits: the  New\n\nYork   birth  certificate  of   his  son  and   his  marriage\n\ncertificate.   The brief contained  a request  to remand  the\n\ncase in light of  this new evidence.  On February  26 the BIA\n\naffirmed  the immigration judge's denial of the 212(c) waiver\n\nwithout mentioning Nicholson's recent marriage and new son.\n\n     The government urges  us to cast  a suspicious eye  over\n\nevidence rapidly assembled  after an initial hearing  has not\n\ngone  well.   In  any  event, 8  C.F.R.     3.2 presents  the\n\nrequirements for a motion to reopen immigration hearings, and\n\nthe  regulations require that the evidence be unavailable and\n\nnot  discoverable at the former hearing;  here, the child was\n\nborn five months before the brief was due for the BIA review,\n\nbut  three  months  after  the  original  hearing.   The  new\n\n                             -6-\n\nevidence offered  must also  be material, that  is likely  to\n\nchange  the result if the case were  reopened.  In re Coelho,\n                                                            \n\nInt. Dec. 3172 at 13 (BIA 1992).  \n\n     Admittedly, an additional  child and a wife  do evidence\n\nstronger emotional ties and possible hardship to petitioner's\n\nfamily.    But while  Nicholson  married the  mother  of this\n\nchild,  they apparently do  not live together  and once again\n\nNicholson presents  no evidence  that he  supports the  child\n\nfinancially.   This  new factor  does  not materially  change\n\nNicholson's status.  The immigration judge thoroughly weighed\n\nthe hardship to Nicholson and to his family, noting, however,\n\nthat Nicholson has family, including a daughter, in Jamaica.\n\n     The judge  did not  weigh lightly separating  petitioner\n\nfrom  his family.   However,  he also  did not  weigh lightly\n\npetitioner's history of  drug convictions and drug use.  When\n\na petitioner has been involved in drug  distribution, the BIA\n\nhas not hesitated to uphold a denial of a 212(c) waiver, even\n\nwhen U.S. citizen  children have  been born  in the  interim.\n\nSee,  e.g., Hazzard, 951  F.2d at 436.   We see  no basis for\n                   \n\nbelieving that the new  circumstances presented by  Nicholson\n\nwould alter  the result reached by the  immigration judge and\n\nwe do not consider the BIA's refusal to remand to be an abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n     The petition for review is denied.\n                                      \n\n                             -7-\n",

The brief contained a request to remand the case in light of this new evidence.

Beginning in 1985, Nicholson became involved in a series of incidents involving illegal drugs, entailing five arrests, two possession convictions, and ultimately his conviction in 1989 of possession with intent to distribute cocaine.  This charge made him deportable under both the aggravated felony provision and the drug offense provision of the law.  See 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1251(a)(4)(B);  (a)(11).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 4, 1990, the INS issued an order to show cause why he should not be deported.  The petitioner conceded that he was deportable, but asked for a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility.  8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1182(c).  The immigration judge denied his application, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed this order.  Petitioner now asks that we overturn the BIA's decision or remand for reconsideration.  We are indebted to government counsel for a helpful brief elucidating INS precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nicholson meets the statutory requirements for a section 212(c) waiver, that is, he is a permanent resident and has lived here continuously for at least seven years.   Joseph v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545482\"><a href=\"/opinion/545482/samuel-fils-joseph-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 606 n.1 (1st Cir. 1990);   Gando-Coello v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531205\"><a href=\"/opinion/531205/dalton-fernando-gando-coello-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 198 (1st Cir. 1989).  Under In re Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. 581 (BIA 1978), a balancing test is employed, measuring the adverse factors against the social and humane considerations to decide, finally, if it is in the best interests of the country for the individual to remain.  In re Edwards, Int.  Dec. 3134 (BIA 1990).  The number and nature of the humane considerations necessary to tip the scales in the individual's favor will vary depending on the severity of the adverse factors involved.  A serious narcotics offense is a particularly onerous factor to overcome, requiring a showing of unusual or outstanding equities.  Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. at 586 n.4.  Even a showing of outstanding equities, however, merely means the individual meets a threshold, not that he is guaranteed the waiver.  In re Buscemi, 19 I &amp; N Dec. 628, 634 (BIA 1988).  The petitioner carries the burden of showing that he merits the relief.   Hazzard v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573876\"><a href=\"/opinion/573876/ronald-hazzard-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 437-38 (1st Cir. 1991);  Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. at 583.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nicholson's claimed equities were his relationship with his U.S. citizen son, born out of wedlock in 1989;  his strong emotional ties with his family, including his mother, stepfather, brother, and two sisters who all live in the Bronx;  the length of his residence in the United States;  and evidence of his rehabilitation, including the job he has held since his release from prison.  Nicholson further pointed out the dismal economic conditions in Jamaica, claiming he would be unable to find work or to provide any money toward supporting his two children (he also has a daughter born in 1983 residing in Jamaica).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After weighing these factors against Nicholson's three-year involvement with drugs and the number and nature of his prior convictions, the immigration judge denied Nicholson's application for a 212(c) waiver.  In particular, the judge noted that while Nicholson had been told to provide affidavit testimony from the mother of his son confirming financial support, her affidavit made no mention of any financial assistance provided by Nicholson.  Only Nicholson's own testimony-and his mother's testimony that Nicholson had told her he gave his children money-indicated that he contributed anything to their support.  Both of his children live with their mothers, and his own claims about his daughter in Jamaica were very vague, indicating he sent money and gifts only sporadically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge characterized his work history as not significant, noting that petitioner had not filed tax returns for a number of years during which he supported himself by dealing drugs and by taking occasional jobs \"off the books.\"  His income, as reflected in tax records, for the second half of 1991 was less than $5,000.  The judge thus concluded that no one relied on Nicholson for meaningful financial support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA affirmed this decision, finding that the immigration judge had taken all relevant factors into account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nicholson argues that the immigration judge erred in concluding that he provided little support for his son based on his partial earnings for 1991.  Nicholson claims that by working full-time, with commissions and a raise, his current yearly salary is approximately $16,000.  Nicholson bears the burden of establishing his equities, Marin, 16 I &amp; N Dec. at 583, and he did not provide meaningful evidence of support.  Nicholson lived apart from his children, and the BIA is not required to assume that the petitioner is financially supporting his children.  Indeed, Nicholson's own testimony makes vague references to cash, gifts, and clothes-not a systematic, consistent source of support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if petitioner's gifts to his son were to be classified as meaningful support, and if his work record were taken to indicate a greater degree of rehabilitation such that his equities met the threshold of outstanding equities, the BIA still has the discretion to refuse to grant such a waiver,  see Joseph v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545482\"><a href=\"/opinion/545482/samuel-fils-joseph-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 607 (1st Cir. 1990), and we can overturn the decision only if we find it to be \"arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\"   Hazzard, 951 F.2d at 438 (quoting  McLean v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540009\"><a href=\"/opinion/540009/gordon-mclean-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir. 1990)).  Indeed, we do not require that the BIA \"address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented\" so long as the BIA gives \"reasoned consideration to the petition.\"   Martinez v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587571\"><a href=\"/opinion/587571/javier-a-martinez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span>,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">974 (1st Cir. 1992).

On July 23, 1992, petitioner filed his appeal to the BIA.  On August 4, 1992, another American citizen son was born to Nicholson.  The BIA gave petitioner several extensions to file his brief, the final deadline being January 11, 1993.  On January 19, petitioner married the mother of his son, and on January 27 he filed his brief with the BIA with two exhibits:  the New York birth certificate of his son and his marriage certificate.  The brief contained a request to remand the case in light of this new evidence.
