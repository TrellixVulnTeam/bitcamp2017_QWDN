Fletcher, of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f      COFFIN,       Senior    Circuit   Judge.         Appellants,     a   group    of\n\naffiliated construction companies and related individuals, appeal\n\nfrom an order of the district court granting summary judgment to\n\nappellee, surety, on its complaint seeking indemnification from\n\nappellants for certain payments the surety made on behalf of\n\nappellants.        Finding no errors of law, we affirm.\n\n                                    I. Background\n\n      Appellants, as principals and indemnitors, entered into a\n\ncontinuing indemnity agreement with surety Fireman's Insurance\n\nCompany     of    Newark,     New   Jersey   (\"Fireman's\"),       in   March   1991.\n\nPursuant to the indemnity agreement, Fireman’s issued various\n\nbonds,      intended    to      guarantee      performance       and   payment     to\n\nsubcontractors        and     suppliers,     on   behalf    of    appellants       for\n\nconstruction projects involving companies with which appellants\n\nwere allied or in which they were beneficially interested.                          In\n\nexchange,        appellants    agreed   to     indemnify   and    hold     Fireman’s\n\nharmless for all losses and expenses it incurred under the bonds\n\nand provided Fireman's with broad discretion to determine whether\n\na   claim    should    be     paid,   settled,    or    challenged.         Although\n\nappellants also entered into indemnity agreements with Reliance\n\nInsurance Co., previously a plaintiff and an appellee in this\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcase, the Reliance portion of the district court judgment is no\n\nlonger at issue.1\n\n       In October 1993, Coken Company (\"Coken\") filed a lawsuit\n\nagainst Fireman’s in Providence County Superior Court seeking\n\n$44,371.53 for subcontracting work it had performed for companies\n\nnamed in appellants' indemnity agreement for which it had not\n\nbeen       paid.      Fireman's    did     not     file    an   answer      to   Coken's\n\ncomplaint, and no action occurred in the lawsuit until March\n\n1997, when Coken filed for summary judgment.                     Fireman's did not\n\nrespond      to    Coken’s     summary    judgment    motion     and     judgment    was\n\nentered      against    Fireman's        for    $139,326.34,    plus     interest    and\n\ncosts, in June 1997.2              An execution, incorporating costs and\n\ninterest, was subsequently obtained by Coken in the amount of\n\n$153,696.98 against Fireman’s.                 Although the record is unclear as\n\nto   when     payment    was    made,     the    parties   appear      to   agree   that\n\nFireman's          eventually     paid     Coken     $207,855.55       and       incurred\n\nattorney's fees of $17,285.79 in the matter.\n\n\n       1\n      Appellants informed the court at argument that Reliance had\nsettled its claims.    Further, appellants waived any arguments\nagainst the district court judgment as it related to Reliance by\nnot raising them before this court.\n       2\n      In its complaint, Coken sought $140,072.63 from Reliance in\naddition to the $44,371.53 it sought from Fireman's. The amounts\nawarded by the district court judgment, $53,733.56 plus interest\nand costs against Reliance and $139,326.34 plus interest and costs\nagainst Fireman's, appear to be reversed from the amounts Coken\nsought from Reliance and Fireman's in its original complaint.\nAppellants' arguments with regard to this anomaly are discussed\ninfra.\n\n                                           -3-\n\f     In August 2000, Fireman’s filed suit against appellants in\n\nthe federal district court of Rhode Island seeking recovery of\n\nmore than $315,000 that it had paid out to various claimants\n\nunder the    bonds.     The       Coken    payment    constituted       the   largest\n\npayout for    which    Fireman's      sought    repayment.         In    July   2001,\n\nFireman’s moved for summary judgment, and appellants objected,\n\nbased solely upon the payment to Coken.3                The motion was granted\n\nby the district court in October 2001 based on the recommended\n\nruling of the magistrate judge.4\n\n     Appellants allege on appeal that the district court made\n\nerrors of law in granting summary judgment to Fireman's.                            We\n\nreview the district court's order de novo, \"construing the record\n\nin the light most favorable to [the non-movant] and resolving all\n\nreasonable   inferences      in    its    favor.\"      Davric     Maine    Corp.    v.\n\nRancourt, 216 F.3d 143, 146 (1st Cir. 2000).               Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate if the evidence presented by appellants is \"'merely\n\ncolorable,   or   is   not    significantly          probative'    to     conjure    a\n\ngenuine   issue   of   material      fact.\"      Id.    (quoting        Anderson    v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986)).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      When the magistrate judge asked appellants whether they had\nobjection to any of the other claims paid by Fireman's, appellants\nresponded that they did not, waiving any such claims.\n     4\n      References to the district court opinion refer to the\nmagistrate judge's report and recommendation, which was adopted in\nwhole by the district court.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                                  II. Discussion\n\n     Appellants        allege    that    the     district          court   erred    in    two\n\nrespects when it granted appellee's motion for summary judgment.\n\nFirst, appellants argue that the district court misapplied the\n\nholding    of    the    Rhode    Island       Supreme    Court        in   Massachusetts\n\nBonding & Insurance Co. v. Gautieri, 30 A.2d 848 (R.I. 1943),\n\nand, in doing so, erroneously ignored the common law rule that\n\nevery contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and\n\nfair dealing.      Second, appellants contend that the district court\n\nincorrectly concluded that they had failed to raise a genuine\n\nissue of material fact.\n\n     A.     Applicability of Massachusetts Bonding\n\n     In granting appellee’s summary judgment motion, the district\n\ncourt relied upon the rule enunciated in Massachusetts Bonding,\n\nnamely    that   when    a    surety     brings    an     action       pursuant      to    an\n\nindemnity agreement giving the surety broad discretion to pay\n\nclaims, the only defense an indemnitor can raise is that the\n\nsurety committed fraud or collusion in paying the claim.                                   In\n\nMassachusetts      Bonding,       a     surety     sought          recovery    from       the\n\nindemnitors      for    funds   the     surety    paid        to    the    United    States\n\ngovernment due to a penalty for alleged illegal activity by the\n\nprincipals.       Massachusetts         Bonding,        the    surety,       settled      the\n\ngovernment's     claim       despite    the    principals'          urging    that    valid\n\ndefenses to the claim should be raised.\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f       The   language      of      the    indemnity        agreement       required      the\n\nindemnitors to pay Massachusetts Bonding for all sums that it\n\npaid \"on account of any damages, costs, charges, and expenses of\n\nwhatsoever     kind   or      nature.\"          The      critical      language    of     the\n\nagreement furnished Massachusetts Bonding with broad latitude to\n\ndetermine whether a claim should be paid:\n\n       \"And the Indemnitors further agree that in any\n       accounting which may be had between the indemnitors and\n       [Massachusetts Bonding], [Massachusetts Bonding] shall\n       be entitled to credit for any and all disbursements, in\n       and about matters herein contemplated, made by it in\n       good faith under the belief that it is or was liable\n       for the sums and amounts so disbursed, or that it was\n       necessary or expedient to make such disbursements,\n       whether such liability, necessity or expediency existed\n       or not\" (italics ours).\n\nMassachusetts Bonding, 30 A.2d at 850 (\"This last clause which we\n\nhave    emphasized      by      italics        is    indeed     of     a   most   sweeping\n\ncharacter.\").\n\n       The   court    held       that     the       expansive        character    of     this\n\nprovision, most notably the final clause, indicated that the\n\nparties had \"lodged in the indemnitee a discretion limited only\n\nby the bounds of fraud.\"                 Id.        As such, in order to show bad\n\nfaith by the surety, the indemnitors were required to prove that\n\nthe surety     committed        fraud     or    engaged       in    collusion     with   the\n\nUnited States in order to avoid repaying the surety.                          See id.\n\n       The   appellants'        argument       that      Massachusetts        Bonding    was\n\nincorrectly     applied         rests     on        an   alleged      critical     factual\n\ndifference    between        the   two    cases.          The      relevant   difference,\n\n                                           -6-\n\fappellants argue, is that in Massachusetts Bonding the principals\n\ncontended that the claim should not have been paid at all, while\n\nappellants here urge that they are not responsible for any amount\n\npaid by the surety over that \"actually owed\" to Coken. In other\n\nwords,    appellants     admit     potential        liability   for    the    amount\n\ninitially     claimed    by   Coken,      but    protest    liability        for   any\n\nincrease    in    that   amount    due    to    the   passage   of    time    or   the\n\npossible    incorrect     judgment       amount.5      Appellants     characterize\n\nMassachusetts Bonding as a case about liability, and the current\n\ncase as revolving around \"damages.\"\n\n     Because the essence of the Massachusetts Bonding holding\n\nderived from the nature of the agreement between the parties, we\n\nlook to     the   language    in   the    agreement     between      Fireman's     and\n\nappellants.       Similar to the agreement in Massachusetts Bonding,\n\nthe Fireman's agreement provided:\n\n     In the event of any payment by SURETY, SURETY shall be\n     entitled   in   any   accounting  with   PRINCIPAL   or\n     INDEMNITOR(S)   to  reimbursement   for  any   and  all\n     disbursements made by it in good faith in and about the\n     matters contemplated by this Agreement under the belief\n     that it is or was liable for the sums and amounts so\n     disbursed, or that it was necessary or expedient to\n\n\n     5\n      In their opposition to the summary judgment motion,\nappellants remarked that as to the original amount Coken sought\nfrom Fireman's, \"Fireman's would have a good argument that it is\ndue reimbursement of the nearly $45,000 through the indemnification\nclause in the bond agreement.\"        In their brief on appeal,\nappellants characterized the issue thus: \"[T]he dispute here is\nwhat amount Fireman's may be entitled to recover under the\nFireman's Bond -- is it entitled to recover the amounts it paid to\nCoken above what Coken was actually owed . . . ?\"\n\n                                         -7-\n\f     make such disbursements, whether or not such liability,\n     necessity, or expediency existed.\n\nFurther, the agreement placed complete and exclusive authority in\n\nFireman's to determine if claims should be paid:\n\n     SURETY shall have the exclusive right in its name or in\n     the name of PRINCIPAL to adjust, settle or compromise\n     any claim, counterclaim, demand, suit or judgment\n     involving any BOND or to take whatever other action it\n     may deem necessary, expedient or appropriate. SURETY'S\n     determination   as   to   whether   any   such   claim,\n     counterclaim, demand, suit or judgment should be\n     settled or defended shall be binding and conclusive\n     upon PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS.\n\nFinally, the agreement required that its terms be \"liberally\n\nconstrued so as to protect, exonerate, and indemnify SURETY.\"\n\nThus, the agreement affords Fireman's the same broad discretion\n\nto settle claims as given to the surety in the Massachusetts\n\nBonding agreement and in fact contains the very same language\n\nthat most impressed the court in that case.\n\n     The difference between asserting that a surety should pay\n\nnothing on a claim, as opposed to arguing that a surety paid too\n\nmuch on a claim, is insignificant to our analysis.   As the court\n\nheld in Massachusetts Bonding:\n\n     [U]nless it could be shown that such loss as the indemnitee\n     suffered in the instant case was the result of fraud on its\n     part, or of collusion between it and the agents of the\n     United States, which would be the same thing as fraud, these\n     defendants would be foreclosed by the very terms of the bond\n     from claiming that the plaintiff had not acted in good faith\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f     in settling the government's claim despite defendants' prior\n     refusal to consent to such settlement.6\n\nGiven the broad discretion provided Fireman's by the indemnity\n\nagreement      and   the   resultant     applicability   of     the   rule   of\n\nMassachusetts Bonding, appellants were required to allege and\n\nprove fraud or collusion in order to avoid repayment of the claim\n\npaid by Fireman's.\n\n     Appellants next argue that even if Massachusetts Bonding\n\napplies, it should not be construed to override the Rhode Island\n\ncommon   law    principle   that   all    contracts   contain    an   implicit\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, citing Ross-Simons of\n\nWarwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 66 F.Supp.2d 317, 329 (D.R.I.\n\n1999), aff'd, 217 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2000).             Ross-Simons, however,\n\n\n     6\n      Several courts outside of Rhode Island have defined the\nstandard slightly differently, holding that indemnification may be\navoided when the surety has exhibited \"fraud or bad faith.\"    See,\ne.g., Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Bristol Steel & Iron\nWorks, Inc., 722 F.2d 1160, 1163 (4th Cir. 1983) (\"The only\nexception to this provision arises when the payment has been made\n'through fraud or lack of good faith' on the part of the surety but\nany challenge to such payment must be rested solely on that claim\nof bad faith or fraud.\" (internal citations omitted)); Engbrock v.\nFederal Ins. Co., 370 F.2d 784, 786 (5th Cir. 1967) (\"In the face\nof these provisions [granting Surety the right to finally,\nconclusively, and unconditionally bind Indemnitor by paying\nclaims], an indemnitor may successfully attack payments made by\nSurety only by pleading and proving fraud or lack of good faith by\nSurety.\"); Ins. Co. of North America v. Bath, 726 F. Supp. 1247,\n1251 (D. Wyo. 1989) (\"Although indemnity agreements are broadly\nconstrued to effect the parties' intent, such a rule has an\nexception where the surety has performed on its bond either through\nfraud or in bad faith.\"). Nevertheless, the formulation of the\nstandard enunciated in Massachusetts Bonding, requiring fraud or\ncollusion to establish bad faith, continues to be the rule under\nRhode Island law.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fconcerned the alleged breach of a settlement agreement, a very\n\ndifferent form of contract than an indemnity agreement.\n\n     The court in Massachusetts Bonding considered the precise\n\nquestion     of   whether   the     strict      language      of   the   indemnity\n\nagreement preempted the common law rule that contracts contain an\n\nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.                         The court\n\nconcluded that common law covenants were inapplicable given the\n\nstringent language of the indemnity agreement.                 See Massachusetts\n\nBonding, 30 A.2d at 851 (finding inapplicable the cases cited by\n\nthe indemnitors that were reliant on common law principles).7\n\nFurther, the court in Massachusetts Bonding made no distinction\n\nbetween    liability    and       damages      and    we   perceive       no   such\n\ndifferentiation in the terms of the indemnity agreement itself.\n\nAppellants    must   live   by    the   terms    of   their    agreement,      which\n\nentitle Fireman's to repayment for all claims paid by it in the\n\nabsence of fraud or collusion.\n\n\n\n     7\n      Other courts have pronounced similar holdings. See Fidelity\n& Deposit Co., 722 F.2d at 1163(\"'[R]esort to implied indemnity\nprinciples is improper when an express indemnification contract\nexists.'\" (quoting Commercial Ins. Co. v. Pacific-Peru Constr., 558\nF.2d 948, 953 (9th Cir. 1977)); Associated Indemnity Corp. v. CAT\nContracting, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 276, 285 (Tex. 1998) (\"'[C]ommon law\nprinciples concerning a surety who claims reimbursements for\namounts paid out by it do not apply to indemnity contracts such as\nthe one here involved.'\" (quoting Ford v. Aetna Ins. Co., 394\nS.W.2d 693, 698 (Tex. Civ. App. 1965)); Martin v. Lyons, 558 P.2d\n1063, 1066 (Idaho 1977) (\"It is a well established principle of\nsurety law in regard to indemnification that the 'surety will . .\n. be permitted to rely on the exact terms of his agreement.'\"\n(internal citations omitted)).\n\n                                        -10-\n\f       B.      Appellants' Failure              to    Raise      a    Genuine    Issue     of\n               Material Fact\n\n       Appellants argue that the district court erred in holding\n\nthat    they     did    not    raise     a    genuine       issue     of    material     fact.\n\nSpecifically,          they    contend       that     their     allegations       regarding\n\nFireman's conduct were sufficient to raise a question of whether\n\nFireman's committed constructive fraud.\n\n       In     Massachusetts         Bonding,        the    principals        presented    the\n\nfollowing evidence to suggest that the surety had colluded with\n\nthe government: the government had waited over four years to make\n\nits claim,        accepted a relatively small amount in settlement of\n\nits     claim,    and       never    brought         any    legal     suit    against      the\n\nprincipals.       These facts were not, however, sufficient to raise a\n\ngenuine       issue    of     material       fact    as    to   whether      collusion     had\n\noccurred.       See id. at 852.\n\n       Before     the       magistrate         judge,       appellants        alleged     the\n\nfollowing        facts        as    proof       of        Fireman's        \"arbitrary      and\n\nunreasonabl[e] conduct\": \"complete and unreasonable inactivity\"\n\nin delaying several years before paying the Coken claim, failing\n\nto answer Coken's complaint or oppose Coken's motion for summary\n\njudgment, and neglecting to attempt settlement of Coken's claim.\n\nPrior    to    the     hearing      on   appellee's         summary    judgment     motion,\n\nappellants alleged that the amount of the Coken judgment against\n\nFireman's resulted directly from Fireman's delay in paying the\n\nclaim.        At the hearing before the magistrate judge, however,\n\n                                              -11-\n\fappellants    alleged       that    the   Providence   County     Superior    Court\n\nerroneously transposed the amounts due Coken from Fireman's and\n\nReliance.     Although the magistrate judge offered appellants the\n\nopportunity      to   provide      additional    information      regarding    this\n\nassertion, appellants neglected to do so.\n\n     Fireman's pointed out at argument that the record revealed\n\nthat Coken had prepared the judgments that were entered by the\n\ncourt.     Fireman's posited that it was therefore possible that\n\nCoken reversed the amounts sought from Fireman's and Reliance in\n\nthe original complaint, but corrected the error when it drafted\n\nthe judgments.        Whatever the cause of the changes in the amounts\n\noriginally sought and those awarded, appellants have failed to\n\npresent any evidence whatsoever that the manner in which this\n\nhappened implied fraud or collusion on Fireman's part.\n\n     In     fact,     the   first    time    that    appellants    alleged     that\n\nFireman's had committed fraud was in their objections to the\n\nmagistrate judge's report, filed with the district court.                        As\n\nsuch,    their   arguments      on   this    front   must   be    deemed   waived.\n\nSee Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840\n\nF.2d 985, 990-91 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"We hold categorically that an\n\nunsuccessful party is not entitled as of right to de novo review\n\nby the judge of an argument never seasonably raised before the\n\nmagistrate.\"); Barden v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 836 F.2d\n\n4, 6 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Parties must take before the magistrate,\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f'not only their \"best shot\" but all of their shots.'\" (quoting\n\nSingh v. Superintending Sch. Comm., 593 F.Supp. 1315, 1318 (D.\n\nMe. 1984)).   Even if their arguments made after the issuance of\n\nthe magistrate judge's report are considered, appellants raised\n\nno new facts, and instead merely recast what previously had been\n\ntermed \"unreasonable\" as \"constructive fraud.\"\n\n     As in Massachusetts Bonding, appellants have barely \"hinted\n\nat the possibility\" of fraud and have provided no evidence in\n\nsupport of their claim.8   In short, the district court properly\n\nheld that the facts alleged by appellants were insufficient to\n\nraise a genuine issue of material fact.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Appellants rely upon two cases to argue that they have\nsufficiently pled constructive fraud: Thornley Supply Co. v.\nMadigan, 154 A. 277, 278 (1931) (\"It is a familiar principle of\nequity that where one of two persons must suffer a loss, the loss\nmust be borne by the one who caused it.\") and Cardoso v. Mendes,\n1998 R.I. Super.        LEXIS 15, 30 (R.I. Super. Ct. 1998)\n(\"'Constructive fraud is the breach of some legal or equitable duty\nwhich, irrespective of moral guilt, the law declares fraudulent\nbecause of its tendency to deceive others, to violate confidence,\nor injure public interests.'\" (internal citations omitted)).\nNeither of these cases, however, relate to the definition of fraud\nin cases such as this; both consider fraud in the context of common\nlaw equitable claims.\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

Finding no errors of law, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants, as principals and indemnitors, entered into a continuing indemnity agreement with surety Fireman's Insurance Company of Newark, New Jersey (\"Fireman's\"), in March 1991. Pursuant to the indemnity agreement, Fireman's issued various bonds, intended to guarantee performance and payment to subcontractors and suppliers, on behalf of appellants for construction projects involving companies with which appellants were allied or in which they were beneficially interested. In exchange, appellants agreed to indemnify and hold Fireman's harmless for all losses and expenses it incurred under the bonds and provided Fireman's with broad discretion to determine whether a claim should be paid, settled, or challenged. Although appellants also entered into indemnity agreements with Reliance Insurance Co., previously a plaintiff and an appellee in this case, the Reliance portion of the district court judgment is no longer at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, Coken Company (\"Coken\") filed a lawsuit against Fireman's in Providence County Superior Court seeking $44,371.53 for subcontracting work it had performed for companies named in appellants' indemnity agreement for which it had not been paid. Fireman's did not file an answer to Coken's complaint, and no action occurred in the lawsuit until March 1997, when Coken filed for summary judgment. Fireman's did not respond to Coken's summary judgment motion and judgment was entered against Fireman's for $139,326.34, plus interest and costs, in June 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> An execution, incorporating costs and interest, was subsequently obtained by Coken in the amount of $153,696.98 against Fireman's. Although the record is unclear as to when payment was made, the parties appear to agree that Fireman's eventually paid Coken $207,855.55 and incurred attorney's fees of $17,285.79 in the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2000, Fireman's filed suit against appellants in the federal district court of Rhode Island seeking recovery of more than $315,000 that it had paid out to various claimants under the bonds. The Coken payment constituted the largest payout for which Fireman's sought repayment. In July 2001, Fireman's moved for summary judgment, and appellants objected, based solely upon the payment to Coken.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The motion was granted by the district court in October 2001 based on the recommended ruling of the magistrate judge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants allege on appeal that the district court made errors of law in granting summary judgment to Fireman's. We review the district court's order <i>de novo,</i> \"construing the record in the light most favorable to [the non-movant] and resolving all reasonable inferences in its favor.\" <i>Davric Maine Corp. v. Rancourt,</i> 216 F.3d 143, 146 (1st Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence presented by appellants is \"`merely colorable, or is not significantly probative' to conjure a genuine issue of material fact.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants allege that the district court erred in two respects when it granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. First, appellants argue that the district court misapplied the holding of the Rhode Island Supreme Court in <i>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Co. v. Gautieri,</i> 69 R.I. 70, 30 A.2d 848 (1943), and, in doing so, erroneously ignored the common law rule that every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Second, appellants contend that the district court incorrectly concluded that they had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Applicability of Massachusetts Bonding</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting appellee's summary judgment motion, the district court relied upon the rule enunciated in <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> namely that when a surety brings an action pursuant to an indemnity agreement giving the surety broad discretion to pay claims, the only defense an indemnitor can raise is that the surety committed fraud or collusion in paying the claim. In <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> a surety sought recovery from the indemnitors for funds the surety paid to the United States government due to a penalty for alleged illegal activity by the principals. Massachusetts Bonding, the surety, settled the government's claim despite the principals' urging that valid defenses to the claim should be raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the indemnity agreement required the indemnitors to pay Massachusetts Bonding for all sums that it paid \"on account of any damages, costs, charges, and expenses of whatsoever kind or nature.\" The critical language of the agreement furnished Massachusetts Bonding with broad latitude to determine whether a claim should be paid:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"And the Indemnitors further agree that in any accounting which may be had between the indemnitors and [Massachusetts Bonding], [Massachusetts Bonding] shall be entitled to credit for any and all disbursements, in and about matters herein contemplated, made by it in good faith under the belief that it is or was liable for the sums and amounts so disbursed, or that it was necessary or expedient to make such disbursements, <i>whether such liability, necessity or expediency existed or not</i>\" (italics ours).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> 30 A.2d at 850 (\"This last clause which we have emphasized by italics is indeed of a most sweeping character.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held that the expansive character of this provision, most notably the final clause, indicated that the parties had \"lodged in the indemnitee a discretion limited only by the bounds of fraud.\" <i>Id.</i> As such, in order to show bad faith by the surety, the indemnitors were required to prove that the surety committed fraud or engaged in collusion with the United States in order to avoid repaying the surety. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' argument that <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> was incorrectly applied rests on an alleged critical factual difference between the two cases. The relevant difference, appellants argue, is that in <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> the principals contended that the claim should not have been paid at all, while appellants here urge that they are not responsible for any amount paid by the surety over that \"actually owed\" to Coken. In other words, appellants admit potential liability for the amount initially claimed by Coken, but protest liability for any increase in that amount due to the passage of time or the possible incorrect judgment amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Appellants characterize <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> as a case about liability, and the current case as revolving around \"damages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the essence of the <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> holding derived from the nature of the agreement between the parties, we look to the language in the agreement between Fireman's and appellants. Similar to the agreement in <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> the Fireman's agreement provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event of any payment by SURETY, SURETY shall be entitled in any accounting with PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITOR(S) to reimbursement for any and all disbursements made by it in good faith in and about the matters contemplated by this Agreement under the belief that it is or was liable for the sums and amounts so disbursed, or that it was necessary or expedient to make such disbursements, <i>whether or not such liability, necessity, or expediency existed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the agreement placed complete and exclusive authority in Fireman's to determine if claims should be paid:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SURETY shall have the exclusive right in its name or in the name of PRINCIPAL to adjust, settle or compromise any claim, counterclaim, demand, suit or judgment involving any BOND or to take whatever other action it may deem necessary, expedient or appropriate. SURETY'S determination as to whether any such claim, counterclaim, demand, suit or judgment should be settled or defended shall be binding and conclusive upon PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the agreement required that its terms be \"liberally construed so as to protect, exonerate, and indemnify SURETY.\" Thus, the agreement affords Fireman's the same broad discretion to settle claims as given to the surety in the <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> agreement and in fact contains the very same language that most impressed the court in that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difference between asserting that a surety should pay nothing on a claim, as opposed to arguing that a surety paid too much on a claim, is insignificant to our analysis. As the court held in <i>Massachusetts Bonding:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[U]nless it could be shown that such loss as the indemnitee suffered in the instant case was the result of fraud on its part, or of collusion between it and the agents of the United States, which would be the same thing as fraud, these defendants would be foreclosed by the very terms of the bond from claiming that the plaintiff had not acted in good faith in settling the government's claim despite defendants' prior refusal to consent to such settlement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Given the broad discretion provided Fireman's by the indemnity agreement and the resultant applicability of the rule of <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> appellants were required to allege and prove fraud or collusion in order to avoid repayment of the claim paid by Fireman's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next argue that even if <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> applies, it should not be construed to override the Rhode Island common law principle that all contracts contain an implicit covenant of good faith and fair dealing, citing <i>Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> 66 F.Supp.2d 317, 329 (D.R.I.1999), <i>aff'd,</i> 217 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.2000). <i>Ross-Simons,</i> however, concerned the alleged breach of a settlement agreement, a very different form of contract than an indemnity agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court in <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> considered the precise question of whether the strict language of the indemnity agreement preempted the common law rule that contracts contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court concluded that common law covenants were inapplicable given the stringent language of the indemnity agreement. <i>See Massachusetts Bonding,</i> 30 A.2d at 851 (finding inapplicable the cases cited by the indemnitors that were reliant on common law principles).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Further, the court in <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> made no distinction between liability and damages and we perceive no such differentiation in the terms of the indemnity agreement itself. Appellants must live by the terms of their agreement, which entitle Fireman's to repayment for all claims paid by it in the absence of fraud or collusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Appellants' Failure to Raise a Genuine Issue of Material Fact</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the district court erred in holding that they did not raise a genuine issue of material fact. Specifically, they contend that their allegations regarding Fireman's conduct were sufficient to raise a question of whether Fireman's committed constructive fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> the principals presented the following evidence to suggest that the surety had colluded with the government: the government had waited over four years to make its claim, accepted a relatively small amount in settlement of its claim, and never brought any legal suit against the principals. These facts were not, however, sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether collusion had occurred. <i>See id.</i> at 852.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the magistrate judge, appellants alleged the following facts as proof of Fireman's \"arbitrary and unreasonabl[e] conduct\": \"complete and unreasonable inactivity\" in delaying several years before paying the Coken claim, failing to answer Coken's complaint or oppose Coken's motion for summary judgment, and neglecting to attempt settlement of Coken's claim. Prior to the hearing on appellee's summary judgment motion, appellants alleged that the amount of the Coken judgment against Fireman's resulted directly from Fireman's delay in paying the claim. At the hearing before the magistrate judge, however, appellants alleged that the Providence County Superior Court erroneously transposed the amounts due Coken from Fireman's and Reliance. Although the magistrate judge offered appellants the opportunity to provide additional information regarding this assertion, appellants neglected to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fireman's pointed out at argument that the record revealed that Coken had prepared the judgments that were entered by the court. Fireman's posited that it was therefore possible that Coken reversed the amounts sought from Fireman's and Reliance in the original complaint, but corrected the error when it drafted the judgments. Whatever the cause of the changes in the amounts originally sought and those awarded, appellants have failed to present any evidence whatsoever that the manner in which this happened implied fraud or collusion on Fireman's part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the first time that appellants alleged that Fireman's had committed fraud was in their objections to the magistrate judge's report, filed with the district court. As such, their arguments on this front must be deemed waived. <i>See Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> 840 F.2d 985, 990-91 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"We hold categorically that an unsuccessful party is not entitled as of right to de novo review by the judge of an argument never seasonably raised before the magistrate.\"); <i>Borden v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs.,</i> 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1987) (\"Parties must take before the magistrate, `not only their \"best shot\" but all of their shots.'\") (quoting <i>Singh v. Superintending Sch. Comm.,</i> 593 F.Supp. 1315, 1318 (D.Me.1984)). Even if their arguments made after the issuance of the magistrate judge's report are considered, appellants raised no new facts, and instead merely recast what previously had been termed \"unreasonable\" as \"constructive fraud.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> appellants have barely \"hinted at the possibility\" of fraud and have provided no evidence in support of their claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In short, the district court properly held that the facts alleged by appellants were insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

Pursuant to the indemnity agreement, Fireman's issued various bonds, intended to guarantee performance and payment to subcontractors and suppliers, on behalf of appellants for construction projects involving companies with which appellants were allied or in which they were beneficially interested. In exchange, appellants agreed to indemnify and hold Fireman's harmless for all losses and expenses it incurred under the bonds and provided Fireman's with broad discretion to determine whether a claim should be paid, settled, or challenged. Although appellants also entered into indemnity agreements with Reliance Insurance Co., previously a plaintiff and an appellee in this case, the Reliance portion of the district court judgment is no longer at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, Coken Company (\"Coken\") filed a lawsuit against Fireman's in Providence County Superior Court seeking $44,371.53 for subcontracting work it had performed for companies named in appellants' indemnity agreement for which it had not been paid. Fireman's did not file an answer to Coken's complaint, and no action occurred in the lawsuit until March 1997, when Coken filed for summary judgment. Fireman's did not respond to Coken's summary judgment motion and judgment was entered against Fireman's for $139,326.34, plus interest and costs, in June 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> An execution, incorporating costs and interest, was subsequently obtained by Coken in the amount of $153,696.98 against Fireman's. Although the record is unclear as to when payment was made, the parties appear to agree that Fireman's eventually paid Coken $207,855.55 and incurred attorney's fees of $17,285.79 in the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2000, Fireman's filed suit against appellants in the federal district court of Rhode Island seeking recovery of more than $315,000 that it had paid out to various claimants under the bonds. The Coken payment constituted the largest payout for which Fireman's sought repayment. In July 2001, Fireman's moved for summary judgment, and appellants objected, based solely upon the payment to Coken.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The motion was granted by the district court in October 2001 based on the recommended ruling of the magistrate judge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants allege on appeal that the district court made errors of law in granting summary judgment to Fireman's.

First, appellants argue that the district court misapplied the holding of the Rhode Island Supreme Court in <i>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Co. v. Gautieri,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></span> (1943), and, in doing so, erroneously ignored the common law rule that every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Second, appellants contend that the district court incorrectly concluded that they had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Applicability of Massachusetts Bonding</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting appellee's summary judgment motion, the district court relied upon the rule enunciated in <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> namely that when a surety brings an action pursuant to an indemnity agreement giving the surety broad discretion to pay claims, the only defense an indemnitor can raise is that the surety committed fraud or collusion in paying the claim. In <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> a surety sought recovery from the indemnitors for funds the surety paid to the United States government due to a penalty for alleged illegal activity by the principals. Massachusetts Bonding, the surety, settled the government's claim despite the principals' urging that valid defenses to the claim should be raised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the indemnity agreement required the indemnitors to pay Massachusetts Bonding for all sums that it paid \"on account of any damages, costs, charges, and expenses of whatsoever kind or nature.\" The critical language of the agreement furnished Massachusetts Bonding with broad latitude to determine whether a claim should be paid:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"And the Indemnitors further agree that in any accounting which may be had between the indemnitors and [Massachusetts Bonding], [Massachusetts Bonding] shall be entitled to credit for any and all disbursements, in and about matters herein contemplated, made by it in good faith under the belief that it is or was liable for the sums and amounts so disbursed, or that it was necessary or expedient to make such disbursements, <i>whether such liability, necessity or expediency existed or not</i>\" (italics ours).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> 30 A.2d at 850 (\"This last clause which we have emphasized by italics is indeed of a most sweeping character.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held that the expansive character of this provision, most notably the final clause, indicated that the parties had \"lodged in the indemnitee a discretion limited only by the bounds of fraud.\" <i>Id.</i> As such, in order to show bad faith by the surety, the indemnitors were required to prove that the surety committed fraud or engaged in collusion with the United States in order to avoid repaying the surety. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' argument that <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> was incorrectly applied rests on an alleged critical factual difference between the two cases. The relevant difference, appellants argue, is that in <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> the principals contended that the claim should not have been paid at all, while appellants here urge that they are not responsible for any amount paid by the surety over that \"actually owed\" to Coken. In other words, appellants admit potential liability for the amount initially claimed by Coken, but protest liability for any increase in that amount due to the passage of time or the possible incorrect judgment amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Appellants characterize <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> as a case about liability, and the current case as revolving around \"damages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the essence of the <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> holding derived from the nature of the agreement between the parties, we look to the language in the agreement between Fireman's and appellants. Similar to the agreement in <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> the Fireman's agreement provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event of any payment by SURETY, SURETY shall be entitled in any accounting with PRINCIPAL or INDEMNITOR(S) to reimbursement for any and all disbursements made by it in good faith in and about the matters contemplated by this Agreement under the belief that it is or was liable for the sums and amounts so disbursed, or that it was necessary or expedient to make such disbursements, <i>whether or not such liability, necessity, or expediency existed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the agreement placed complete and exclusive authority in Fireman's to determine if claims should be paid:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SURETY shall have the exclusive right in its name or in the name of PRINCIPAL to adjust, settle or compromise any claim, counterclaim, demand, suit or judgment involving any BOND or to take whatever other action it may deem necessary, expedient or appropriate. SURETY'S determination as to whether any such claim, counterclaim, demand, suit or judgment should be settled or defended shall be binding and conclusive upon PRINCIPAL and INDEMNITORS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the agreement required that its terms be \"liberally construed so as to protect, exonerate, and indemnify SURETY.\" Thus, the agreement affords Fireman's the same broad discretion to settle claims as given to the surety in the <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> agreement and in fact contains the very same language that most impressed the court in that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difference between asserting that a surety should pay nothing on a claim, as opposed to arguing that a surety paid too much on a claim, is insignificant to our analysis. As the court held in <i>Massachusetts Bonding:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[U]nless it could be shown that such loss as the indemnitee suffered in the instant case was the result of fraud on its part, or of collusion between it and the agents of the United States, which would be the same thing as fraud, these defendants would be foreclosed by the very terms of the bond from claiming that the plaintiff had not acted in good faith in settling the government's claim despite defendants' prior refusal to consent to such settlement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Given the broad discretion provided Fireman's by the indemnity agreement and the resultant applicability of the rule of <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> appellants were required to allege and prove fraud or collusion in order to avoid repayment of the claim paid by Fireman's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next argue that even if <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> applies, it should not be construed to override the Rhode Island common law principle that all contracts contain an implicit covenant of good faith and fair dealing, citing <i>Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2489088\"><a href=\"/opinion/2489088/ross-simons-of-warwick-inc-v-baccarat-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 329 (D.R.I.1999), <i>aff'd,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></span> (1st Cir.2000). <i>Ross-Simons,</i> however, concerned the alleged breach of a settlement agreement, a very different form of contract than an indemnity agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court in <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> considered the precise question of whether the strict language of the indemnity agreement preempted the common law rule that contracts contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The court concluded that common law covenants were inapplicable given the stringent language of the indemnity agreement. <i>See Massachusetts Bonding,</i> 30 A.2d at 851 (finding inapplicable the cases cited by the indemnitors that were reliant on common law principles).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Further, the court in <i>Massachusetts Bonding</i> made no distinction between liability and damages and we perceive no such differentiation in the terms of the indemnity agreement itself. Appellants must live by the terms of their agreement, which entitle Fireman's to repayment for all claims paid by it in the absence of fraud or collusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Appellants' Failure to Raise a Genuine Issue of Material Fact</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the district court erred in holding that they did not raise a genuine issue of material fact. Specifically, they contend that their allegations regarding Fireman's conduct were sufficient to raise a question of whether Fireman's committed constructive fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Massachusetts Bonding,</i> the principals presented the following evidence to suggest that the surety had colluded with the government: the government had waited over four years to make its claim, accepted a relatively small amount in settlement of its claim, and never brought any legal suit against the principals. These facts were not, however, sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether collusion had occurred. <i>See id.</i> at 852.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the magistrate judge, appellants alleged the following facts as proof of Fireman's \"arbitrary and unreasonabl[e] conduct\": \"complete and unreasonable inactivity\" in delaying several years before paying the Coken claim, failing to answer Coken's complaint or oppose Coken's motion for summary judgment, and neglecting to attempt settlement of Coken's claim. Prior to the hearing on appellee's summary judgment motion, appellants alleged that the amount of the Coken judgment against Fireman's resulted directly from Fireman's delay in paying the claim. At the hearing before the magistrate judge, however, appellants alleged that the Providence County Superior Court erroneously transposed the amounts due Coken from Fireman's and Reliance. Although the magistrate judge offered appellants the opportunity to provide additional information regarding this assertion, appellants neglected to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fireman's pointed out at argument that the record revealed that Coken had prepared the judgments that were entered by the court. Fireman's posited that it was therefore possible that Coken reversed the amounts sought from Fireman's and Reliance in the original complaint, but corrected the error when it drafted the judgments. Whatever the cause of the changes in the amounts originally sought and those awarded, appellants have failed to present any evidence whatsoever that the manner in which this happened implied fraud or collusion on Fireman's part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the first time that appellants alleged that Fireman's had committed fraud was in their objections to the magistrate judge's report, filed with the district court. As such, their arguments on this front must be deemed waived. <i>See Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec.

The amounts awarded by the district court judgment, $53,733.56 plus interest and costs against Reliance and $139,326.34 plus interest and costs against Fireman's, appear to be reversed from the amounts Coken sought from Reliance and Fireman's in its original complaint.
