McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                         December 26, 2007\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.       On September 5, 2005, federal\n\nauthorities obtained a search warrant for the home of Justin\n\nWoodbury located at 7 Leisure Lane, Windham, Maine, \"believed to\n\nbe\" the bottom-floor left apartment. The warrant named Woodbury as\n\nthe occupant and authorized a nighttime no-knock entry.              Federal\n\nand local authorities, directed to his second-floor apartment by\n\nthe occupant of the bottom-floor apartment, executed the warrant\n\nand seized a .40 caliber pistol and drug paraphernalia.             Woodbury\n\nentered a plea of not guilty to a federal indictment for a single\n\ncount of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and filed\n\na motion to suppress, alleging that for purposes of the Fourth\n\nAmendment, the warrant (1) lacked probable cause and (2) was\n\ninsufficiently     particular.     Woodbury's      suppression   motion   was\n\ndenied, and he now appeals.          After careful consideration, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                            I.    Background\n\n            On May 5, 2005, Sgt. R. Michael Denbow, a state police\n\nofficer, told federal agent Earnest MacVane that an informant had\n\nreported that he planned to deliver cocaine to Woodbury at an\n\napartment on Lamb Street in Windham. Two days later, the informant\n\nstated that Woodbury had claimed to have purchased a .40 or .44\n\ncaliber pistol and even bragged that he was a convicted felon.            The\n\ninformant    had   previously    provided    the    police   with   truthful\n\ninformation.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f          On September 9, 2005, Windham police office Robert Hunt\n\nstopped a speeding car. The driver was noticeably anxious and said\n\nthat he had just come from Woodbury's apartment.    He informed the\n\npolice that Woodbury dealt in cocaine and possessed a .40 caliber\n\nhandgun which he did not carry outside of his apartment.      Based\n\nboth on this information and that provided by the prior police\n\ninformant in May, MacVane believed there was probable cause that\n\nWoodbury was trafficking at 7 Leisure Lane.\n\n          On September 9, 2005, a Maine state court judge granted\n\nMacVane's request for a search warrant.       The person, place, or\n\nlocation to be searched read:\n\n          #7 Leisure Lane Windham, Maine believed to be\n          the bottom floor left apartment.         Said\n          structure is a white multi-unit dwelling with\n          a covered front porch, and a grey shingled\n          roof.\n\nThe warrant unmistakably identified the appellant in the warrant as\n\n\"Justin WOODBURY/ DOB:   05-15-1981, White male 5'9\" / 175 pound,\n\nwith brown hair and blue eyes,\" and authorized a nighttime no-knock\n\nentry.\n\n          The warrant was based on a September 9 application and\n\naffidavit submitted by MacVane.   The affidavit named Woodbury as\n\nthe occupant of 7 Leisure Lane, but also described Woodbury's\n\napartment as being on Lamb Street.1   Attached to the affidavit was\n\n\n1\n  The reference to Lamb Street came from information the driver of\nthe speeding car gave Hunt when he stopped the car as it was\nentering Route 35 from Lamb Street. Leisure Lane is the name of a\n\n                                -3-\n\fa black and white photograph of 7 Leisure Lane.                   The affidavit\n\nprovided a rough physical description of Woodbury, but stipulated\n\nthat it did not contain all of the information that MacVane\n\npossessed in relation to Woodbury's alleged cocaine trafficking.\n\n              That   same    evening,    federal      and     local   authorities\n\nattempted to execute the warrant at the location specified therein,\n\nwhich directed them to the bottom-floor left apartment at 7 Leisure\n\nLane.    Woodbury did not reside there.         The agents were redirected\n\nby the unknown occupant of the bottom-floor left apartment to the\n\nsecond-floor left apartment, where the occupant believed Woodbury\n\nresided. After knocking and waiting approximately twenty to thirty\n\nseconds, the officers heard a commotion and movement inside of the\n\napartment.      The agents forced open the door and saw Woodbury run\n\nfrom    the   kitchen   to   the   bedroom    where    they    apprehended   him.\n\nPursuant to the warrant, the officers searched the apartment and\n\nfound a .40 caliber pistol in a shoe box in the bedroom closet.\n\nThe shoe box also contained a copy of a bail slip issued to\n\nWoodbury from a prior arrest which specified that one condition of\n\nhis release was a prohibition on possessing firearms. Elsewhere in\n\nWoodbury's apartment, the police found drug paraphernalia laced\n\nwith cocaine residue.         MacVane read Woodbury his Miranda rights,\n\nwhich Woodbury chose to waive. Woodbury admitted to being the sole\n\n\n\ndriveway off of Lamb Street. It is clear from the application and\nthe affidavit that the application was for a unit on Leisure Lane.\n\n                                        -4-\n\foccupant of the apartment and to knowing that a gun was in his\n\ncloset.      He denied owning the gun but refused to disclose how he\n\nhad acquired it.      Woodbury was then arrested for possession of a\n\nfirearm by a felon.\n\n             On   March   31,     2006,    Woodbury    moved     to   suppress   the\n\nevidence resulting from the search on three separate grounds: (1)\n\nthe warrant did not authorize entry into the upstairs apartment\n\nthat was actually searched; (2) regardless, there was no probable\n\ncause to search the Leisure Lane premises because the informants\n\nonly connected Woodbury to Lamb Street; and (3) there was no\n\nprobable      cause      because     the        informants'      information     was\n\nuncorroborated and unreliable.2\n\n             On May 24, 2006, the Magistrate Judge (\"MJ\") recommended\n\nthat   the    district    court    deny    Woodbury's      motion     to   suppress.\n\nAddressing each argument in turn, the MJ found that (1) considered\n\nin a common sense manner, the warrant made clear that the apartment\n\noccupied     by   Woodbury   was    the    target     of   the    search;   (2)\"the\n\nreferences in the affidavit to an apartment on Lamb Street were\n\nsufficiently vague that it was reasonable to conclude that the Lamb\n\nStreet apartment was the same as #7 Leisure Lane\"; and (3) a\n\nsufficient number of factors were present to permit MacVane's\n\nconclusion that the informants' information was reliable. Finally,\n\n\n\n2\n  On appeal, Woodbury does not directly challenge the informants'\nreliability.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fthe MJ concluded that even if the warrant was invalid, the good\n\nfaith exception to the exclusionary rule would apply under United\n\nStates v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984).\n\n           Woodbury then modified his suppression motion, alleging\n\nthat the executing officers knowingly acted outside the scope of\n\nthe warrant.    In response, the MJ stated that when \"most sensibly\n\nread,\" the warrant was \"not so facially deficient that executing\n\nofficers could not reasonably have presumed it to be valid.\"\n\nAccordingly, the MJ recommended that the motion be denied.                  On\n\nJuly 27, 2006, the district court entered an order adopting the\n\nMJ's   report   and   recommendation.      The   district   court's    order\n\nconcluded that the Leon good faith exception applied to this case\n\nand found that the warrant was legally executed.\n\n                            II.    Discussion\n\n           On   appeal,   Woodbury    challenges   the   validity     of   the\n\nwarrant and the district court's denial of his motion to suppress,\n\ncontending that the search violated the Fourth Amendment.                  His\n\nargument is without merit.        The warrant meets the probable cause\n\nrequirement, and its execution is valid under the Leon good faith\n\nexception.\n\n           A.   Standard of Review\n\n           \"In this Circuit, appellate review of a suppression\n\nmotion is bifurcated.\"     United States v. Charles, 213 F.3d 10, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).      We review de novo the legal conclusions of the\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fdistrict court, \"including the determination that a given set of\n\nfacts constituted probable cause.\"       Id. at 18 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279, 282 (1st Cir. 1997)).   We also\n\nreview the applicability of the Leon good faith exception de novo.\n\nSee United States v. Brunette, 256 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 2001).   By\n\ncontrast, we review the district court's findings of fact for clear\n\nerror.   Charles, 213 F.3d at 18.     \"A clear error exists only if,\n\nafter considering all of the evidence, we are left with a definite\n\nand firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\"      Id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n\"[W]e will uphold a district court's decision to deny a suppression\n\nmotion provided that any reasonable view of the evidence supports\n\nthe decision.\"   Id. 213 F.3d at 18 (quoting McCarthy, 77 F.3d at\n\n529).\n\n          B.   Probable Cause\n\n          The Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement is meant to\n\nprotect people from unreasonable intrusion by the government into\n\ntheir homes. The Warrant Clause guarantees that \"no Warrants shall\n\nissue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,\n\nand particularly describing the place to be searched, and the\n\npersons or things to be seized.\"       U.S. Const. amend. IV.   \"Any\n\nsearch intruding upon [an individual's] privacy interest must be\n\njustified by probable cause and must satisfy the particularity\n\nrequirement, which limits the scope and intensity of the search.\"\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fUnited States v. Bonner, 808 F.2d 864, 867 (1st Cir. 1986) (citing\n\nUnited States v. Heldt, 688 F.2d 1238, 1256 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).\n\n\"When investigators fail to limit themselves to the particulars in\n\nthe warrant, both the particularity requirement and the probable\n\ncause requirement are drained of all significance as restraining\n\nmechanisms,     and     the   warrant     limitation    becomes     a    practical\n\nnullity.\"      United States v. Ferreras, 192 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n1999). The issuance of a warrant must satisfy two requirements for\n\nconstitutionality        under   the       Fourth   Amendment.      \"A     warrant\n\napplication must demonstrate probable cause to believe that (1) a\n\ncrime   has    been     committed--the      'commission'    element,      and   (2)\n\nenumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to be\n\nsearched--the so-called 'nexus' element.\"              United States v. Feliz,\n\n182 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing United States v. Zayas-\n\nDíaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir. 1996)).                   Woodbury does not\n\nchallenge the commission element, so we need not address it here.\n\n              Woodbury asserts that the warrant was not supported by\n\nprobable cause because there was no evidence of a nexus between his\n\nalleged criminal activities and 7 Leisure Lane.                    Specifically,\n\nWoodbury contends that the officers had no personal knowledge that\n\nhe lived at 7 Leisure Lane, and he points to the discrepancy in the\n\naffidavit over a reference to Lamb Street.              He claims that because\n\nthere was not \"a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a\n\ncrime   [would]    be    found   in   a    particular    place,\"    namely,     his\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fapartment, there was no probable cause to support the warrant.\n\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983).\n\n           Woodbury      argues    that     MacVane's     determination     that\n\nWoodbury resided at 7 Leisure Lane was the only link, and that the\n\nresulting issuance of a warrant was a \"mere ratification of the\n\nbare conclusions of others.\"        Id. at 239.       Woodbury maintains that\n\nconclusory statements in MacVane's affidavit could not constitute\n\na \"substantial basis\" for the issuing judge's determination of\n\nprobable cause.     United States v. Caswell, 436 F.3d 894, 897 (8th\n\nCir. 2006) (interpreting Gates to require something more than a\n\n\"bare bones\" recitation of conclusory statements by the affiant for\n\na substantial basis to exist).\n\n           The Government argues that the link between Woodbury's\n\ndrug trafficking and his place of residence could reasonably have\n\nbeen inferred from the facts.             We agree.     See United States v.\n\nMateras, 483 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Common sense dictates\n\nthat evidence of [defendant's] possession could probably be found\n\nin the location where he sold drugs two days before.\"); Feliz, 182\n\nF.3d at 88.       The warrant clearly identified Woodbury to be the\n\noccupant of the searched premises and also provided a physical\n\ndescription of him.       While MacVane's affidavit in support of the\n\nwarrant did mention that Woodbury's activities occurred at Lamb\n\nStreet, the affidavit and application for the warrant clearly\n\nindicate   that    the   warrant   was     specifically    being   sought    for\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fWoodbury's apartment, which the police determined to be on Leisure\n\nLane.3   The Government informants' mistake as to the actual street\n\nname is not enough to invalidate the warrant.   See United States v.\n\nCruz, 594 F.2d 268, 273-73 (1st Cir. 1979) (holding warrant valid\n\nwhere mistake of key fact was understandable and unintentional\n\nmisstatement and not necessary to finding of probable cause since\n\naffidavit on its face established probable cause for search of\n\ndefendant's residence).\n\n           The application for the warrant clearly indicates that\n\naccording to the informants' statements, at least part of the\n\ncriminal activity occurred at \"his (WOODBURY'S) apartment.\"      The\n\npolice were provided two first-hand accounts of criminal activity\n\nat Woodbury's apartment by law enforcement informants.   One of the\n\ninformants had just left the apartment the night the officers\n\nsought the warrant, and told police that he had been a frequent\n\nvisitor there and personally observed Woodbury receiving drugs.\n\nThis same informant also told police that Woodbury showed him a .40\n\ncaliber handgun and that Woodbury usually kept it in his closet.\n\nSee United States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 333-34 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(finding police had probable cause where warrant sought was based\n\non tip from informant and corroborated with first-hand knowledge of\n\nweapons used in a crime).\n\n\n\n\n3\n    Leisure Lane is the name of a driveway off of Lamb Street.\n\n                                -10-\n\f            We \"examine [an] affidavit in a practical, commonsense\n\nfashion,\" Feliz, 182 F.3d at 86, and give \"considerable deference\"\n\nto the issuing magistrate's conclusion that probable cause has been\n\nestablished,     id.       (quoting      Zayas-Díaz,    95    F.3d      at    111).      The\n\nrelevant inquiry is \"whether the facts presented in the affidavit\n\nwould    'warrant      a    man    of   reasonable     caution'        to    believe    that\n\nevidence of crime will be found.\"                  Feliz, 182 F.3d at 87 (quoting\n\nTexas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742 (1983)).                 We do not require \"that\n\nthe belief be shown to be necessarily correct or more likely true\n\nthan false.\"     Id.        We find that the facts MacVane presented in his\n\naffidavit and application demonstrate that he reasonably believed\n\nthe evidence of a crime would be found at Woodbury's apartment.\n\n            In    Feliz       we    urged    a     weighing       of   the    factors    in\n\ndetermining probable cause while reiterating that such weighing\n\n\"may result in the inference of probable cause to believe that\n\ncriminal objects are located in a particular place, such as a\n\nsuspect's residence, to which they have not been tied by direct\n\nevidence.\"       Id. at 88.             Even without direct evidence, \"common\n\nsense,    buttressed        by     affiant's     opinion     as    a   law    enforcement\n\nofficer,\" might permit the inference \"that [the defendant] would be\n\nlikely to keep [evidence] relating to drug transactions at his\n\napartment.\"      Id.       Here, the informants actually recounted criminal\n\nactivity at Woodbury's place of residence. In light of these facts\n\nand \"the experience and training of the affiant,\" United States v.\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fJordan, 999 F.2d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 1993), a sufficient basis existed\n\nto find probable cause for the warrant.\n\n            C.   The Leon Good Faith Exception\n\n            Woodbury contends that the warrant fails the Fourth\n\nAmendment's particularity requirement as it is particularized only\n\nwith respect to the Lamb Street apartment.        The Government admits,\n\nand it is plain from the face of the warrant, that the wrong unit\n\nwas specified on the warrant.       We need not address Woodbury's\n\nparticularity arguments because we find that the Leon good faith\n\nexception applies.     \"The usual remedy for seizures made with [a\n\ndefective   warrant   is   suppression]   in    order    to   deter   future\n\nviolations of the Fourth Amendment.\"           Brunette, 256 F.3d at 19\n\n(citing Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 391-93, (1914)).\n\nSuppression, however, is not always necessary.          \"This exclusionary\n\nrule does not obtain . . . where an objectively reasonable law\n\nenforcement officer relied in good faith on a defective warrant\n\nbecause suppression in that instance would serve no deterrent\n\npurpose.\"    Id. (citing Leon, 468 U.S. at 920-21).\n\n            Woodbury argues that the Leon good faith exception to\n\nsuppression cannot apply because (1) the officers acted outside the\n\nscope of the warrant, United States v. Fuccillo, 808 F.2d 173, 177\n\n(1st Cir. 1987), and (2) the warrant was \"so lacking in indicia of\n\nprobable cause,\" Leon, 468 U.S. at 923 (quoting Brown v. Illinois,\n\n422 U.S. 590, 610-11 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring in part))\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f(internal    quotation     marks     omitted),    that   \"no   reasonably     well\n\ntrained officer should rely on\" it, id.              Woodbury overstates the\n\nalleged problem with the warrant. The warrant was not \"so facially\n\ndeficient\" that the officers could not have presumed it valid. Id.\n\nThe police officers mistook which apartment within the multi-unit\n\ndwelling belonged to Woodbury, but it was reasonable for them to\n\nbelieve that the warrant was valid.              See Bonner, 808 F.2d at 868\n\n(upholding scope of warrant and validating search where warrant\n\n\"did not leave so much to the discretion of the officers executing\n\nthe warrant\").\n\n            Under      Leon,   the   good   faith   exception     applies     when\n\ngovernment agents rely on a warrant in objective good faith and in\n\nthe interest of justice suppression is generally inappropriate.\n\nSee Brunette, 256 F.3d at 19.           We find that to be the case here.\n\nAlthough the good faith exception applies in some cases, it is\n\ninapplicable      in   certain   circumstances.          The   Leon   good   faith\n\nexception does not apply where an officer's good faith reliance on\n\na warrant was \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render\n\nofficial belief in its existence entirely unreasonable,\" or a\n\nwarrant    that   is    \"'so   facially     deficient--i.e.     in    failing   to\n\nparticularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized--\n\nthat the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be\n\nvalid.'\"    United States v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 745 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(quoting Leon, 486 U.S. at 923).            The facts here and the analysis\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fabove, however, demonstrate that the warrant was issued with\n\nprobable cause.        The   police also reasonably presumed the warrant\n\nto be valid.\n\n            \"The good fath exception 'assumes . . . that the officers\n\nproperly executed the warrant and searched only those places and\n\nfor those objects that it was reasonable to believe were covered by\n\nthe warrant.'\"        Fuccillo, 808 F.2d at 178 (quoting Leon, 468 U.S.\n\nat 918 n.19).         The police officers acted within the scope of the\n\nwarrant in searching Woodbury's apartment.                   The warrant specifies\n\nthat it is for Woodbury's apartment.                 Though the warrant listed\n\nwhat MacVane \"believed to be\" the bottom-floor left apartment, with\n\nreasonable   effort       and    without      mistakenly     searching    the      wrong\n\napartment, the police were able to execute the warrant against\n\ntheir intended target.          After knocking on the door to the bottom-\n\nfloor left apartment, the police were told by the occupant that\n\nWoodbury did not live there but lived in the second-floor left\n\napartment.   The police immediately proceeded upstairs and executed\n\nthe   warrant    there.         By   refraining      from    searching    the      wrong\n\napartment,      the    officers      made    clear   their    good    faith     in   the\n\nwarrant's    limitations         and    their      understanding      that    it     was\n\nrestricted to the search of Woodbury's apartment.                    See Bonner, 808\n\nF.2d at 866.\n\n            We cannot say that the search warrant for Woodbury's\n\napartment was so facially deficient that it failed the standard\n\n\n                                            -14-\n\foutlined in Leon and as applied by this Court.       See Owens, 167 F.3d\n\nat 745; United States v. Díaz, 841 F.2d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nThough listing the wrong unit, the warrant made clear reference to\n\nthe apartment occupied by Woodbury.          Woodbury's claims of facial\n\ndeficiency do not rise to the level that we have found in other\n\ncases.   See United States v. Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d 8, 16 (1st Cir.\n\n1993) (invalidating a warrant that \"contained non-technical defects\n\nreadily observable to experienced postal inspectors and . . . that\n\nthe   inspectors'   omissions   in    the   warrant-application   process\n\nconstituted    a    second,   independently     sufficient   ground   for\n\ndistinguishing this case from Leon\").\n\n           In Fuccillo, officers seized the contents of an entire\n\nwarehouse instead of the cartons of women's clothing specified on\n\nthe warrant.   Fuccillo, 808 F.2d at 177-78.       The facts in Fuccillo\n\nprecluded any assumption that the officers \"'searched only those\n\nplaces and for those objects that it was reasonable to believe were\n\ncovered by the warrant,'\" and we thus declined to apply the Leon\n\ngood faith exception.     Id. at 178 (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 918\n\nn.19).    We also said in Fuccillo that where \"the agents were\n\nreckless in not including in the affidavit information which was\n\nknown or easily accessible to them,\" we would decline to apply the\n\nLeon good faith exception.        Id.       There, the agents failed to\n\n\"[take] every step that could reasonably be expected of them\" by\n\nneglecting to make any effort to obtain information that would have\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fidentified the criminally related goods and distinguished them from\n\nthe rest of the goods in the warehouse. Id. (quoting Massachusetts\n\nv. Sheppard, 468 U.S. 981, 989 (1984)).               In the absence of any\n\ndirection for identification of the stolen cartons, the warrant was\n\n\"facially deficient\" and could not have been presumed valid by the\n\nexecuting officers.       Id. at 178 (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 923).\n\nIn   seizing   the    contents   of   the    entire   warehouse    anyway,   the\n\nexecuting officers acted recklessly such that we found application\n\nof the Leon good faith exception to be improper.             Id.\n\n           The facts of the present case do not rise to the same\n\nlevel of defectiveness.      The warrant was not so facially deficient\n\nthat the executing officers could not reasonably have presumed it\n\nto be valid.         The Leon good faith exception applies, and the\n\nwarrant was therefore legally executed.\n\n                             III.     Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons explained above, we affirm the judgment\n\nof the district court denying Woodbury's motion to suppress.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                       (Concurrence opinion follows)\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring.      The panel opinion\n\nconvincingly resolves the Fourth Amendment challenge by invoking\n\nthe Leon doctrine: it shows that the police acted in good faith\n\neven if it were assumed that the warrant itself was in some measure\n\ndefective.   It may still be useful to say something about the\n\nalleged defect because   searches in multi-apartment buildings are\n\ncommon and the problem of the uncertain apartment number recurs.\n\n          In this case there were two different glitches.      The\n\nfirst was whether the building containing Woodbury's apartment was\n\nat 7 Leisure Lane or at Lamb Street.        However, this initial\n\nuncertainty was not in any way a defect in the warrant, which\n\ncorrectly specified that the building was at 7 Leisure Lane.   And,\n\ndespite the informant's reference to Lamb Street (from which\n\nLeisure Lane is a kind of driveway), there was ample probable cause\n\nfor a warrant specifying the Leisure Lane address as the location\n\nof well verified likely drug dealing by Woodbury.\n\n          The warrant thus said clearly that it was for a search of\n\nWoodbury's apartment at 7 Leisure Lane--indeed, specifying the\n\nbuilding as \"a white multi-unit dwelling with a covered front\n\nporch, and a grey shingled roof\"; the arguable defect came in the\n\nfurther statement that Woodbury's own unit was \"believed to be the\n\nbottom floor left apartment.\"   This was an accurate statement of\n\nthe officer's belief when the application and affidavit were\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fsubmitted; but, arriving at the building, the agents learned from\n\na neighbor that Woodbury's apartment was on the second floor.\n\n          Under the case law, the Woodbury warrant would be valid\n\nand sufficient even if it had not said anything about the location\n\nof Woodbury's apartment within the building. \"[A] warrant has been\n\nconsidered valid if it specifies the name of the occupant of the\n\napartment against which it is directed, despite the absence of any\n\nphysical description of the particular apartment.\"   United States\n\nv. Bedford, 519 F.2d 650, 655 (3d Cir. 1975).4    That the warrant\n\nadded that the apartment was \"probably\" in a specific location\n\nought not make it \"defective\" so as to imply its legal invalidity.\n\n          The supposition was correctly stated as merely \"probable\"\n\nand so it is hardly surprising that the agents made further inquiry\n\non arriving at the building.   In such cases, as where no apartment\n\nnumber is specified at all, the correct apartment can often be\n\nverified from letter boxes or building directories in the lobby; in\n\nthis case, the information was secured from a neighbor. No attempt\n\nwas made to enter the apartment until its correct location in the\n\nbuilding had been ascertained.\n\n\n\n\n4\n   Accord United States v. Vaughan, 875 F. Supp. 36, 42 (D. Mass.\n1995) (\"The particularity requirement with respect to multiunit\nbuildings 'may be satisfied by giving the address of the building\n. . . and naming the person whose apartment is to be searched . . .\n.'\") (quoting United States v. Hinton, 219 F.2d 324, 326 (7th Cir.\n1955)); 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 4.5(b) & n.60 (4th\ned. 2004).\n\n                                 -18-\n\f           This is thus not a case where a warrant inaccurately\n\nauthorized a search of a specific apartment: the search authorized\n\nwas of Woodbury's apartment in a specific building.    It made sense\n\nto add   further information about its probable location just as it\n\nmade sense to describe the structure as a white frame building.\n\nBut no one would describe the warrant as legally \"defective\" if the\n\nwarrant had said that the building was at 7 Leisure Lane, adding\n\nincorrectly that the building was \"probably\" gray.\n\n           So while Leon is \"belt and suspenders,\" the premise that\n\nthere was any defect casting doubt on the validity of the warrant\n\nis merely an arguendo assumption.        Leon might well have been\n\nessential if the warrant had definitively misstated the location of\n\nthe place to be searched.     See United States v. Lora-Solano, 330\n\nF.3d 1288, 1294-95 (10th Cir. 2003); cf. United States v. Clement,\n\n747 F.2d 460, 461 (8th Cir. 1984).     In this case, it is merely the\n\neasiest path to affirmance.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f",

Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, and SCHWARZER,<sup>[*]</sup> Senior District Judge.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>On September 9, 2005, federal authorities obtained a search warrant for the home of Justin Woodbury located at 7 Leisure Lane, Windham, Maine, \"believed to be\" the bottom-floor left apartment. The warrant named Woodbury as the occupant and authorized a nighttime noknock entry. Federal and local authorities, directed to his second-floor apartment by the occupant of the bottom-floor apartment, executed the warrant and seized a .40 caliber pistol and drug paraphernalia. Woodbury entered a plea of not guilty to a federal indictment for a single count of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and filed a motion to suppress, alleging that for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, the warrant (1) lacked probable cause and (2) was insufficiently particular. Woodbury's suppression motion was denied, and he now appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On May 5, 2005, Sgt. R. Michael Denbow, a state police officer, told federal agent Earnest MacVane that an informant had reported that he planned to deliver cocaine to Woodbury at an apartment on Lamb Street in Windham. Two days later, the informant stated that Woodbury had claimed to have purchased a .40 or .44 caliber pistol and even bragged that he was a convicted felon. The informant had previously provided the police with truthful information.</p>\n<p>On September 9, 2005, Windham police office Robert Hunt stopped a speeding car. The driver was noticeably anxious and said that he had just come from Woodbury's apartment. He informed the police that Woodbury dealt in cocaine and possessed a .40 caliber handgun which he did not carry outside of his apartment. Based both on this information and that provided by the prior police informant in May, MacVane believed there was probable cause that Woodbury was trafficking at 7 Leisure Lane.</p>\n<p>On September 9, 2005, a Maine state court judge granted MacVane's request for a search warrant. The person, place, or location to be searched read:</p>\n<blockquote># 7 Leisure Lane Windham, Maine believed to be the bottom floor left apartment. Said structure is a white multi-unit dwelling with a covered front porch, and a grey shingled roof.</blockquote>\n<p>The warrant unmistakably identified the appellant in the warrant as \"Justin WOODBURY/ DOB: 05-15-1981, White male 5'9\" / 175 pound, with brown hair and blue eyes,\" and authorized a nighttime noknock entry.</p>\n<p>The warrant was based on a September 9 application and affidavit submitted by MacVane. The affidavit named Woodbury as the occupant of 7 Leisure Lane, but also described Woodbury's apartment as being on Lamb Street.<sup>[1]</sup> Attached to the affidavit was a black and white photograph of 7 Leisure Lane. The affidavit provided a rough physical description of Woodbury, but stipulated that it did not contain all of the information that MacVane possessed in relation to Woodbury's alleged cocaine trafficking.</p>\n<p>That same evening, federal and local authorities attempted to execute the warrant at the location specified therein, which directed them to the bottom-floor left apartment at 7 Leisure Lane. Woodbury did not reside there. The agents were redirected by the unknown occupant of the bottom-floor left apartment to the second-floor left apartment, where the occupant believed Woodbury resided. After knocking and waiting approximately twenty to thirty seconds, the officers heard a commotion and movement inside of the apartment. The agents forced open the door and saw Woodbury run from the kitchen to the bedroom where they apprehended him. Pursuant to the warrant, the officers searched the apartment and found a .40 caliber pistol in a shoe box in the bedroom closet. The shoe box also contained a copy of a bail slip issued to Woodbury from a prior arrest which specified that one condition of his release was a prohibition on possessing firearms. Elsewhere in Woodbury's apartment, the police found drug paraphernalia laced with cocaine residue. MacVane read Woodbury his <i>Miranda</i> rights, which Woodbury chose to waive. Woodbury admitted to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*96</span> being the sole occupant of the apartment and to knowing that a gun was in his closet. He denied owning the gun but refused to disclose how he had acquired it. Woodbury was then arrested for possession of a firearm by a felon.</p>\n<p>On March 31, 2006, Woodbury moved to suppress the evidence resulting from the search on three separate grounds: (1) the warrant did not authorize entry into the upstairs apartment that was actually searched; (2) regardless, there was no probable cause to search the Leisure Lane premises because the informants only connected Woodbury to Lamb Street; and (3) there was no probable cause because the informants' information was uncorroborated and unreliable.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On May 24, 2006, the Magistrate Judge (\"MJ\") recommended that the district court deny Woodbury's motion to suppress. Addressing each argument in turn, the MJ found that (1) considered in a common sense manner, the warrant made clear that the apartment occupied by Woodbury was the target of the search; (2)\"the references in the affidavit to an apartment on Lamb Street were sufficiently vague that it was reasonable to conclude that the Lamb Street apartment was the same as # 7 Leisure Lane\"; and (3) a sufficient number of factors were present to permit MacVane's conclusion that the informants' information was reliable. Finally, the MJ concluded that even if the warrant was invalid, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule would apply under <i>United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984).</p>\n<p>Woodbury then modified his suppression motion, alleging that the executing officers knowingly acted outside the scope of the warrant. In response, the MJ stated that when \"most sensibly read,\" the warrant was \"not so facially deficient that executing officers could not reasonably have presumed it to be valid.\" Accordingly, the MJ recommended that the motion be denied. On July 27, 2006, the district court entered an order adopting the MJ's report and recommendation. The district court's order concluded that the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception applied to this case and found that the warrant was legally executed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Woodbury challenges the validity of the warrant and the district court's denial of his motion to suppress, contending that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. His argument is without merit. The warrant meets the probable cause requirement, and its execution is valid under the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>\"In this Circuit, appellate review of a suppression motion is bifurcated.\" <i>United States v. Charles,</i> 213 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir.2000). We review <i>de novo</i> the legal conclusions of the district court, \"including the determination that a given set of facts constituted probable cause.\" <i>Id.</i> at 18 (quoting <i>United States v. Khounsavanh,</i> 113 F.3d 279, 282 (1st Cir.1997)). We also review the applicability of the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception <i>de novo. See </i><i>United States v. Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir.2001). By contrast, we review the district court's findings of fact for clear error. <i>Charles,</i> 213 F.3d at 18. \"A clear error exists only if, after considering all of the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir.1996)). \"[W]e will uphold a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion provided <span class=\"star-pagination\">*97</span> that any reasonable view of the evidence supports the decision.\" <i>Id.</i> 213 F.3d at 18 (quoting <i>McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d at 529).</p>\n<p>B. <i>Probable Cause</i></p>\n<p>The Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement is meant to protect people from unreasonable intrusion by the government into their homes. The Warrant Clause guarantees that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. \"Any search intruding upon [an individual's] privacy interest must be justified by probable cause and must satisfy the particularity requirement, which limits the scope and intensity of the search.\" <i>United States v. Bonner,</i> 808 F.2d 864, 867 (1st Cir.1986) (citing <i>United States v. Heldt,</i> 668 F.2d 1238, 1256 (D.C.Cir.1981)). \"When investigators fail to limit themselves to the particulars in the warrant, both the particularity requirement and the probable cause requirement are drained of all significance as restraining mechanisms, and the warrant limitation becomes a practical nullity.\" <i>United States v. Ferreras,</i> 192 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir.1999). The issuance of a warrant must satisfy two requirements for constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment. \"A warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to believe that (1) a crime has been committed-the `commission' element, and (2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to be searched-the so-called `nexus' element.\" <i>United States v. Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.1999) (citing <i>United States v. Zayas-Díaz,</i> 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1996)). Woodbury does not challenge the commission element, so we need not address it here.</p>\n<p>Woodbury asserts that the warrant was not supported by probable cause because there was no evidence of a nexus between his alleged criminal activities and 7 Leisure Lane. Specifically, Woodbury contends that the officers had no personal knowledge that he lived at 7 Leisure Lane, and he points to the discrepancy in the affidavit over a reference to Lamb Street. He claims that because there was not \"a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime [would] be found in a particular place,\" namely, his apartment, there was no probable cause to support the warrant. <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p>Woodbury argues that MacVane's determination that Woodbury resided at 7 Leisure Lane was the only link, and that the resulting issuance of a warrant was a \"mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239, 103 S.Ct. 2317. Woodbury maintains that conclusory statements in MacVane's affidavit could not constitute a \"substantial basis\" for the issuing judge's determination of probable cause. <i>United States v. Caswell,</i> 436 F.3d 894, 897 (8th Cir.2006) (interpreting <i>Gates</i> to require something more than a \"bare bones\" recitation of conclusory statements by the affiant for a substantial basis to exist).</p>\n<p>The Government argues that the link between Woodbury's drug trafficking and his place of residence could reasonably have been inferred from the facts. We agree. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Materas,</i> 483 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.2007) (\"Common sense dictates that evidence of [defendant's] possession could probably be found in the location where he sold drugs two days before.\"); <i>Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d at 88. The warrant clearly identified Woodbury to be the occupant of the searched premises and also provided a physical description of him. While MacVane's affidavit in support of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> the warrant did mention that Woodbury's activities occurred at Lamb Street, the affidavit and application for the warrant clearly indicate that the warrant was specifically being sought for Woodbury's apartment, which the police determined to be on Leisure Lane.<sup>[3]</sup> The Government informants' mistake as to the actual street name is not enough to invalidate the warrant. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cruz,</i> 594 F.2d 268, 273-73 (1st Cir.1979) (holding warrant valid where mistake of key fact was understandable and unintentional misstatement and not necessary to finding of probable cause since affidavit on its face established probable cause for search of defendant's residence).</p>\n<p>The application for the warrant clearly indicates that according to the informants' statements, at least part of the criminal activity occurred at \"his (WOODBURY'S) apartment.\" The police were provided two first-hand accounts of criminal activity at Woodbury's apartment by law enforcement informants. One of the informants had just left the apartment the night the officers sought the warrant, and told police that he had been a frequent visitor there and personally observed Woodbury receiving drugs. This same informant also told police that Woodbury showed him a .40 caliber handgun and that Woodbury usually kept it in his closet. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Capozzi,</i> 347 F.3d 327, 333-34 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding police had probable cause where warrant sought was based on tip from informant and corroborated with first-hand knowledge of weapons used in a crime).</p>\n<p>We \"examine [an] affidavit in a practical, commonsense fashion,\" <i>Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d at 86, and give \"considerable deference\" to the issuing magistrate's conclusion that probable cause has been established, <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Zayas-Díaz,</i> 95 F.3d at 111). The relevant inquiry is \"whether the facts presented in the affidavit would `warrant a man of reasonable caution' to believe that evidence of crime will be found.\" <i>Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d at 87 (quoting <i>Texas v. Brown,</i> 460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983)). We do not require \"that the belief be shown to be necessarily correct or more likely true than false.\" <i>Id.</i> We find that the facts MacVane presented in his affidavit and application demonstrate that he reasonably believed the evidence of a crime would be found at Woodbury's apartment.</p>\n<p>In <i>Feliz</i> we urged a weighing of the factors in determining probable cause while reiterating that such weighing \"may result in the inference of probable cause to believe that criminal objects are located in a particular place, such as a suspect's residence, to which they have not been tied by direct evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 88. Even without direct evidence, \"common sense, buttressed by affiant's opinion as a law enforcement officer,\" might permit the inference \"that [the defendant] would be likely to keep [evidence] relating to drug transactions at his apartment.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, the informants actually recounted criminal activity at Woodbury's place of residence. In light of these facts and \"the experience and training of the affiant,\" <i>United States v. Jordan,</i> 999 F.2d 11, 14 (1st Cir.1993), a sufficient basis existed to find probable cause for the warrant.</p>\n<p>C. <i>The Leon Good Faith Exception</i></p>\n<p>Woodbury contends that the warrant fails the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement as it is particularized only with respect to the Lamb Street apartment. The Government admits, and it is plain from the face of the warrant, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*99</span> that the wrong unit was specified on the warrant. We need not address Woodbury's particularity arguments because we find that the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception applies. \"The usual remedy for seizures made with [a defective warrant is suppression] in order to deter future violations of the Fourth Amendment.\" <i>Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d at 19 (citing <i>Weeks v. United States,</i> 232 U.S. 383, 391-93, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652, (1914)). Suppression, however, is not always necessary. \"This exclusionary rule does not obtain . . . where an objectively reasonable law enforcement officer relied in good faith on a defective warrant because suppression in that instance would serve no deterrent purpose.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 920-21, 104 S.Ct. 3405).</p>\n<p>Woodbury argues that the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception to suppression cannot apply because (1) the officers acted outside the scope of the warrant, <i>United States v. Fuccillo,</i> 808 F.2d 173, 177 (1st Cir.1987), and (2) the warrant was \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause,\" <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (quoting <i>Brown v. Illinois,</i> 422 U.S. 590, 610-11, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring in part)) (internal quotation marks omitted), that \"no reasonably well trained officer should rely on\" it, <i>id.</i> Woodbury overstates the alleged problem with the warrant. The warrant was not \"so facially deficient\" that the officers could not have presumed it valid. <i>Id.</i> The police officers mistook which apartment within the multi-unit dwelling belonged to Woodbury, but it was reasonable for them to believe that the warrant was valid. <i>See </i><i>Bonner,</i> 808 F.2d at 868 (upholding scope of warrant and validating search where warrant \"did not leave so much to the discretion of the officers executing the warrant\").</p>\n<p>Under <i>Leon,</i> the good faith exception applies when government agents rely on a warrant in objective good faith and in the interest of justice suppression is generally inappropriate. <i>See </i><i>Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d at 19. We find that to be the case here. Although the good faith exception applies in some cases, it is inapplicable in certain circumstances. The <i>Leon</i> good faith exception does not apply where an officer's good faith reliance on a warrant was \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable,\" or a warrant that is \"`so facially deficient  <i>i.e.</i> in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized  that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.'\" <i>United States v. Owens,</i> 167 F.3d 739, 745 (1st Cir.1999) (quoting <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405). The facts here and the analysis above, however, demonstrate that the warrant was issued with probable cause. The police also reasonably presumed the warrant to be valid.</p>\n<p>\"The good faith exception `assumes . . . that the officers properly executed the warrant and searched only those places and for those objects that it was reasonable to believe were covered by the warrant.'\" <i>Fuccillo,</i> 808 F.2d at 178 (quoting <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 918 n. 19, 104 S.Ct. 3405). The police officers acted within the scope of the warrant in searching Woodbury's apartment. The warrant specifies that it is for Woodbury's apartment. Though the warrant listed what MacVane \"believed to be\" the bottom-floor left apartment, with reasonable effort and without mistakenly searching the wrong apartment, the police were able to execute the warrant against their intended target. After knocking on the door to the bottom-floor left apartment, the police were told by the occupant that Woodbury did not live there but lived in the second-floor left apartment. The police immediately proceeded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> upstairs and executed the warrant there. By refraining from searching the wrong apartment, the officers made clear their good faith in the warrant's limitations and their understanding that it was restricted to the search of Woodbury's apartment. <i>See </i><i>Bonner,</i> 808 F.2d at 866.</p>\n<p>We cannot say that the search warrant for Woodbury's apartment was so facially deficient that it failed the standard outlined in <i>Leon</i> and as applied by this Court. <i>See </i><i>Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 745; <i>United States v. Díaz,</i> 841 F.2d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1988). Though listing the wrong unit, the warrant made clear reference to the apartment occupied by Woodbury. Woodbury's claims of facial deficiency do not rise to the level that we have found in other cases. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ricciardelli,</i> 998 F.2d 8, 16 (1st Cir.1993) (invalidating a warrant that \"contained non-technical defects readily observable to experienced postal inspectors and . . . that the inspectors' omissions in the warrant-application process constituted a second, independently sufficient ground for distinguishing this case from <i>Leon</i>\").</p>\n<p>In <i>Fuccillo,</i> officers seized the contents of an entire warehouse instead of the cartons of women's clothing specified on the warrant. <i>Fuccillo,</i> 808 F.2d at 177-78. The facts in <i>Fuccillo</i> precluded any assumption that the officers \"`searched only those places and for those objects that it was reasonable to believe were covered by the warrant,'\" and we thus declined to apply the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception. <i>Id.</i> at 178 (quoting <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 918 n. 19, 104 S.Ct. 3405). We also said in <i>Fuccillo</i> that where \"the agents were reckless in not including in the affidavit information which was known or easily accessible to them,\" we would decline to apply the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception. <i>Id.</i> There, the agents failed to \"[take] every step that could reasonably be expected of them\" by neglecting to make any effort to obtain information that would have identified the criminally related goods and distinguished them from the rest of the goods in the warehouse. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Massachusetts v. Sheppard,</i> 468 U.S. 981, 989, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984)). In the absence of any direction for identification of the stolen cartons, the warrant was \"facially deficient\" and could not have been presumed valid by the executing officers. <i>Id.</i> at 178 (quoting <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3430). In seizing the contents of the entire warehouse anyway, the executing officers acted recklessly such that we found application of the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception to be improper. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The facts of the present case do not rise to the same level of defectiveness. The warrant was not so facially deficient that the executing officers could not reasonably have presumed it to be valid. The <i>Leon</i> good faith exception applies, and the warrant was therefore legally executed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons explained above, we affirm the judgment of the district court denying Woodbury's motion to suppress.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>The panel opinion convincingly resolves the Fourth Amendment challenge by invoking the <i>Leon</i> doctrine: it shows that the police acted in good faith even if it were assumed that the warrant itself was in some measure defective. It may still be useful to say something about the alleged defect because searches in multi-apartment buildings are common and the problem of the uncertain apartment number recurs.</p>\n<p>In this case there were two different glitches. The first was whether the building <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> containing Woodbury's apartment was at 7 Leisure Lane or at Lamb Street. However, this initial uncertainty was not in any way a defect in the warrant, which correctly specified that the building was at 7 Leisure Lane. And, despite the informant's reference to Lamb Street (from which Leisure Lane is a kind of driveway), there was ample probable cause for a warrant specifying the Leisure Lane address as the location of well verified likely drug dealing by Woodbury.</p>\n<p>The warrant thus said clearly that it was for a search of Woodbury's apartment at 7 Leisure Laneindeed, specifying the building as \"a white multi-unit dwelling with a covered front porch, and a grey shingled roof\"; the arguable defect came in the further statement that Woodbury's own unit was \"believed to be the bottom floor left apartment.\" This was an accurate statement of the officer's belief when the application and affidavit were submitted; but, arriving at the building, the agents learned from a neighbor that Woodbury's apartment was on the second floor.</p>\n<p>Under the case law, the Woodbury warrant would be valid and sufficient even if it had not said anything about the location of Woodbury's apartment within the building. \"[A] warrant has been considered valid if it specifies the name of the occupant of the apartment against which it is directed, despite the absence of any physical description of the particular apartment.\" <i>United States v. Bedford,</i> 519 F.2d 650, 655 (3d Cir.1975).<sup>[4]</sup> That the warrant added that the apartment was \"probably\" in a specific location ought not make it \"defective\" so as to imply its legal invalidity.</p>\n<p>The supposition was correctly stated as merely \"probable\" and so it is hardly surprising that the agents made further inquiry on arriving at the building. In such cases, as where no apartment number is specified at all, the correct apartment can often be verified from letter boxes or building directories in the lobby; in this case, the information was secured from a neighbor. No attempt was made to enter the apartment until its correct location in the building had been ascertained.</p>\n<p>This is thus not a case where a warrant inaccurately authorized a search of a specific apartment: the search authorized was of <i>Woodbury's apartment</i> in a specific building. It made sense to add further information about its probable location just as it made sense to describe the structure as a white frame building. But no one would describe the warrant as legally \"defective\" if the warrant had said that the building was at 7 Leisure Lane, adding incorrectly that the building was \"probably\" gray.</p>\n<p>So while <i>Leon</i> is \"belt and suspenders,\" the premise that there was any defect casting doubt on the validity of the warrant is merely an arguendo assumption. <i>Leon</i> might well have been essential if the warrant had definitively misstated the location of the place to be searched. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lora-Solano,</i> 330 F.3d 1288, 1294-95 (10th Cir.2003); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. Clement,</i> 747 F.2d 460, 461 (8th Cir.1984).

The warrant named Woodbury as the occupant and authorized a nighttime noknock entry. Federal and local authorities, directed to his second-floor apartment by the occupant of the bottom-floor apartment, executed the warrant and seized a .40 caliber pistol and drug paraphernalia. Woodbury entered a plea of not guilty to a federal indictment for a single count of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and filed a motion to suppress, alleging that for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, the warrant (1) lacked probable cause and (2) was insufficiently particular. Woodbury's suppression motion was denied, and he now appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*95</span> I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On May 5, 2005, Sgt. R. Michael Denbow, a state police officer, told federal agent Earnest MacVane that an informant had reported that he planned to deliver cocaine to Woodbury at an apartment on Lamb Street in Windham. Two days later, the informant stated that Woodbury had claimed to have purchased a .40 or .44 caliber pistol and even bragged that he was a convicted felon. The informant had previously provided the police with truthful information.</p>\n<p>On September 9, 2005, Windham police office Robert Hunt stopped a speeding car. The driver was noticeably anxious and said that he had just come from Woodbury's apartment. He informed the police that Woodbury dealt in cocaine and possessed a .40 caliber handgun which he did not carry outside of his apartment. Based both on this information and that provided by the prior police informant in May, MacVane believed there was probable cause that Woodbury was trafficking at 7 Leisure Lane.</p>\n<p>On September 9, 2005, a Maine state court judge granted MacVane's request for a search warrant. The person, place, or location to be searched read:</p>\n<blockquote># 7 Leisure Lane Windham, Maine believed to be the bottom floor left apartment. Said structure is a white multi-unit dwelling with a covered front porch, and a grey shingled roof.</blockquote>\n<p>The warrant unmistakably identified the appellant in the warrant as \"Justin WOODBURY/ DOB: 05-15-1981, White male 5'9\" / 175 pound, with brown hair and blue eyes,\" and authorized a nighttime noknock entry.</p>\n<p>The warrant was based on a September 9 application and affidavit submitted by MacVane. The affidavit named Woodbury as the occupant of 7 Leisure Lane, but also described Woodbury's apartment as being on Lamb Street.<sup>[1]</sup> Attached to the affidavit was a black and white photograph of 7 Leisure Lane. The affidavit provided a rough physical description of Woodbury, but stipulated that it did not contain all of the information that MacVane possessed in relation to Woodbury's alleged cocaine trafficking.</p>\n<p>That same evening, federal and local authorities attempted to execute the warrant at the location specified therein, which directed them to the bottom-floor left apartment at 7 Leisure Lane. Woodbury did not reside there. The agents were redirected by the unknown occupant of the bottom-floor left apartment to the second-floor left apartment, where the occupant believed Woodbury resided. After knocking and waiting approximately twenty to thirty seconds, the officers heard a commotion and movement inside of the apartment. The agents forced open the door and saw Woodbury run from the kitchen to the bedroom where they apprehended him. Pursuant to the warrant, the officers searched the apartment and found a .40 caliber pistol in a shoe box in the bedroom closet. The shoe box also contained a copy of a bail slip issued to Woodbury from a prior arrest which specified that one condition of his release was a prohibition on possessing firearms. Elsewhere in Woodbury's apartment, the police found drug paraphernalia laced with cocaine residue. MacVane read Woodbury his <i>Miranda</i> rights, which Woodbury chose to waive. Woodbury admitted to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*96</span> being the sole occupant of the apartment and to knowing that a gun was in his closet. He denied owning the gun but refused to disclose how he had acquired it. Woodbury was then arrested for possession of a firearm by a felon.</p>\n<p>On March 31, 2006, Woodbury moved to suppress the evidence resulting from the search on three separate grounds: (1) the warrant did not authorize entry into the upstairs apartment that was actually searched; (2) regardless, there was no probable cause to search the Leisure Lane premises because the informants only connected Woodbury to Lamb Street; and (3) there was no probable cause because the informants' information was uncorroborated and unreliable.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On May 24, 2006, the Magistrate Judge (\"MJ\") recommended that the district court deny Woodbury's motion to suppress. Addressing each argument in turn, the MJ found that (1) considered in a common sense manner, the warrant made clear that the apartment occupied by Woodbury was the target of the search; (2)\"the references in the affidavit to an apartment on Lamb Street were sufficiently vague that it was reasonable to conclude that the Lamb Street apartment was the same as # 7 Leisure Lane\"; and (3) a sufficient number of factors were present to permit MacVane's conclusion that the informants' information was reliable. Finally, the MJ concluded that even if the warrant was invalid, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule would apply under <i>United States v. Leon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span> (1984).</p>\n<p>Woodbury then modified his suppression motion, alleging that the executing officers knowingly acted outside the scope of the warrant. In response, the MJ stated that when \"most sensibly read,\" the warrant was \"not so facially deficient that executing officers could not reasonably have presumed it to be valid.\" Accordingly, the MJ recommended that the motion be denied. On July 27, 2006, the district court entered an order adopting the MJ's report and recommendation. The district court's order concluded that the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception applied to this case and found that the warrant was legally executed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On appeal, Woodbury challenges the validity of the warrant and the district court's denial of his motion to suppress, contending that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. His argument is without merit. The warrant meets the probable cause requirement, and its execution is valid under the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception.</p>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>\"In this Circuit, appellate review of a suppression motion is bifurcated.\" <i>United States v.

By contrast, we review the district court's findings of fact for clear error. <i>Charles,</i> 213 F.3d at 18. \"A clear error exists only if, after considering all of the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v.

The issuance of a warrant must satisfy two requirements for constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment. \"A warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to believe that (1) a crime has been committed-the `commission' element, and (2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to be searched-the so-called `nexus' element.\" <i>United States v.

Woodbury does not challenge the commission element, so we need not address it here.</p>\n<p>Woodbury asserts that the warrant was not supported by probable cause because there was no evidence of a nexus between his alleged criminal activities and 7 Leisure Lane. Specifically, Woodbury contends that the officers had no personal knowledge that he lived at 7 Leisure Lane, and he points to the discrepancy in the affidavit over a reference to Lamb Street. He claims that because there was not \"a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime [would] be found in a particular place,\" namely, his apartment, there was no probable cause to support the warrant. <i>Illinois v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span> (1983).</p>\n<p>Woodbury argues that MacVane's determination that Woodbury resided at 7 Leisure Lane was the only link, and that the resulting issuance of a warrant was a \"mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2317</span></a></span>. Woodbury maintains that conclusory statements in MacVane's affidavit could not constitute a \"substantial basis\" for the issuing judge's determination of probable cause. <i>United States v. Caswell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793201\"><a href=\"/opinion/793201/united-states-v-thomas-caswell/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">894</span></a></span>, 897 (8th Cir.2006) (interpreting <i>Gates</i> to require something more than a \"bare bones\" recitation of conclusory statements by the affiant for a substantial basis to exist).</p>\n<p>The Government argues that the link between Woodbury's drug trafficking and his place of residence could reasonably have been inferred from the facts. We agree. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Materas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202702\"><a href=\"/opinion/202702/united-states-v-materas/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2007) (\"Common sense dictates that evidence of [defendant's] possession could probably be found in the location where he sold drugs two days before.\"); <i>Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d at 88. The warrant clearly identified Woodbury to be the occupant of the searched premises and also provided a physical description of him. While MacVane's affidavit in support of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*98</span> the warrant did mention that Woodbury's activities occurred at Lamb Street, the affidavit and application for the warrant clearly indicate that the warrant was specifically being sought for Woodbury's apartment, which the police determined to be on Leisure Lane.<sup>[3]</sup> The Government informants' mistake as to the actual street name is not enough to invalidate the warrant. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364163\"><a href=\"/opinion/364163/united-states-v-herminio-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span>, 273-73 (1st Cir.1979) (holding warrant valid where mistake of key fact was understandable and unintentional misstatement and not necessary to finding of probable cause since affidavit on its face established probable cause for search of defendant's residence).</p>\n<p>The application for the warrant clearly indicates that according to the informants' statements, at least part of the criminal activity occurred at \"his (WOODBURY'S) apartment.\" The police were provided two first-hand accounts of criminal activity at Woodbury's apartment by law enforcement informants. One of the informants had just left the apartment the night the officers sought the warrant, and told police that he had been a frequent visitor there and personally observed Woodbury receiving drugs. This same informant also told police that Woodbury showed him a .40 caliber handgun and that Woodbury usually kept it in his closet. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

The warrant was not \"so facially deficient\" that the officers could not have presumed it valid. <i>Id.</i> The police officers mistook which apartment within the multi-unit dwelling belonged to Woodbury, but it was reasonable for them to believe that the warrant was valid. <i>See </i><i>Bonner,</i> 808 F.2d at 868 (upholding scope of warrant and validating search where warrant \"did not leave so much to the discretion of the officers executing the warrant\").</p>\n<p>Under <i>Leon,</i> the good faith exception applies when government agents rely on a warrant in objective good faith and in the interest of justice suppression is generally inappropriate. <i>See </i><i>Brunette,</i> 256 F.3d at 19. We find that to be the case here. Although the good faith exception applies in some cases, it is inapplicable in certain circumstances. The <i>Leon</i> good faith exception does not apply where an officer's good faith reliance on a warrant was \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable,\" or a warrant that is \"`so facially deficient  <i>i.e.</i> in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized  that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.'\" <i>United States v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3405</span></a></span>). The facts here and the analysis above, however, demonstrate that the warrant was issued with probable cause. The police also reasonably presumed the warrant to be valid.</p>\n<p>\"The good faith exception `assumes . . . that the officers properly executed the warrant and searched only those places and for those objects that it was reasonable to believe were covered by the warrant.'\" <i>Fuccillo,</i> 808 F.2d at 178 (quoting <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 918 n. 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3405</span></a></span>). The police officers acted within the scope of the warrant in searching Woodbury's apartment. The warrant specifies that it is for Woodbury's apartment. Though the warrant listed what MacVane \"believed to be\" the bottom-floor left apartment, with reasonable effort and without mistakenly searching the wrong apartment, the police were able to execute the warrant against their intended target. After knocking on the door to the bottom-floor left apartment, the police were told by the occupant that Woodbury did not live there but lived in the second-floor left apartment. The police immediately proceeded <span class=\"star-pagination\">*100</span> upstairs and executed the warrant there. By refraining from searching the wrong apartment, the officers made clear their good faith in the warrant's limitations and their understanding that it was restricted to the search of Woodbury's apartment. <i>See </i><i>Bonner,</i> 808 F.2d at 866.</p>\n<p>We cannot say that the search warrant for Woodbury's apartment was so facially deficient that it failed the standard outlined in <i>Leon</i> and as applied by this Court. <i>See </i><i>Owens,</i> 167 F.3d at 745; <i>United States v. Díaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502477\"><a href=\"/opinion/502477/united-states-v-leoncio-l-diaz-aka-leonel-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5-6 (1st Cir.1988). Though listing the wrong unit, the warrant made clear reference to the apartment occupied by Woodbury. Woodbury's claims of facial deficiency do not rise to the level that we have found in other cases. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ricciardelli,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610895\"><a href=\"/opinion/610895/united-states-v-steven-ricciardelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1993) (invalidating a warrant that \"contained non-technical defects readily observable to experienced postal inspectors and . . . that the inspectors' omissions in the warrant-application process constituted a second, independently sufficient ground for distinguishing this case from <i>Leon</i>\").</p>\n<p>In <i>Fuccillo,</i> officers seized the contents of an entire warehouse instead of the cartons of women's clothing specified on the warrant. <i>Fuccillo,</i> 808 F.2d at 177-78. The facts in <i>Fuccillo</i> precluded any assumption that the officers \"`searched only those places and for those objects that it was reasonable to believe were covered by the warrant,'\" and we thus declined to apply the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception. <i>Id.</i> at 178 (quoting <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 918 n. 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We also said in <i>Fuccillo</i> that where \"the agents were reckless in not including in the affidavit information which was known or easily accessible to them,\" we would decline to apply the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception. <i>Id.</i> There, the agents failed to \"[take] every step that could reasonably be expected of them\" by neglecting to make any effort to obtain information that would have identified the criminally related goods and distinguished them from the rest of the goods in the warehouse. <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Massachusetts v. Sheppard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111263\"><a href=\"/opinion/111263/massachusetts-v-sheppard/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">981</span></a></span>, 989, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111263\"><a href=\"/opinion/111263/massachusetts-v-sheppard/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the absence of any direction for identification of the stolen cartons, the warrant was \"facially deficient\" and could not have been presumed valid by the executing officers. <i>Id.</i> at 178 (quoting <i>Leon,</i> 468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3430). In seizing the contents of the entire warehouse anyway, the executing officers acted recklessly such that we found application of the <i>Leon</i> good faith exception to be improper. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The facts of the present case do not rise to the same level of defectiveness. The warrant was not so facially deficient that the executing officers could not reasonably have presumed it to be valid. The <i>Leon</i> good faith exception applies, and the warrant was therefore legally executed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons explained above, we affirm the judgment of the district court denying Woodbury's motion to suppress.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>BOUDIN, Chief Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>The panel opinion convincingly resolves the Fourth Amendment challenge by invoking the <i>Leon</i> doctrine: it shows that the police acted in good faith even if it were assumed that the warrant itself was in some measure defective. It may still be useful to say something about the alleged defect because searches in multi-apartment buildings are common and the problem of the uncertain apartment number recurs.</p>\n<p>In this case there were two different glitches. The first was whether the building <span class=\"star-pagination\">*101</span> containing Woodbury's apartment was at 7 Leisure Lane or at Lamb Street. However, this initial uncertainty was not in any way a defect in the warrant, which correctly specified that the building was at 7 Leisure Lane. And, despite the informant's reference to Lamb Street (from which Leisure Lane is a kind of driveway), there was ample probable cause for a warrant specifying the Leisure Lane address as the location of well verified likely drug dealing by Woodbury.</p>\n<p>The warrant thus said clearly that it was for a search of Woodbury's apartment at 7 Leisure Laneindeed, specifying the building as \"a white multi-unit dwelling with a covered front porch, and a grey shingled roof\"; the arguable defect came in the further statement that Woodbury's own unit was \"believed to be the bottom floor left apartment.\" This was an accurate statement of the officer's belief when the application and affidavit were submitted; but, arriving at the building, the agents learned from a neighbor that Woodbury's apartment was on the second floor.</p>\n<p>Under the case law, the Woodbury warrant would be valid and sufficient even if it had not said anything about the location of Woodbury's apartment within the building. \"[A] warrant has been considered valid if it specifies the name of the occupant of the apartment against which it is directed, despite the absence of any physical description of the particular apartment.\" <i>United States v. Bedford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328845\"><a href=\"/opinion/328845/united-states-v-murrell-bedford/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span>, 655 (3d Cir.1975).<sup>[4]</sup> That the warrant added that the apartment was \"probably\" in a specific location ought not make it \"defective\" so as to imply its legal invalidity.</p>\n<p>The supposition was correctly stated as merely \"probable\" and so it is hardly surprising that the agents made further inquiry on arriving at the building. In such cases, as where no apartment number is specified at all, the correct apartment can often be verified from letter boxes or building directories in the lobby; in this case, the information was secured from a neighbor. No attempt was made to enter the apartment until its correct location in the building had been ascertained.</p>\n<p>This is thus not a case where a warrant inaccurately authorized a search of a specific apartment: the search authorized was of <i>Woodbury's apartment</i> in a specific building. It made sense to add further information about its probable location just as it made sense to describe the structure as a white frame building. But no one would describe the warrant as legally \"defective\" if the warrant had said that the building was at 7 Leisure Lane, adding incorrectly that the building was \"probably\" gray.</p>\n<p>So while <i>Leon</i> is \"belt and suspenders,\" the premise that there was any defect casting doubt on the validity of the warrant is merely an arguendo assumption. <i>Leon</i> might well have been essential if the warrant had definitively misstated the location of the place to be searched. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Lora-Solano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163519\"><a href=\"/opinion/163519/united-states-v-lora-solano/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1288</span></a></span>, 1294-95 (10th Cir.2003); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v.
