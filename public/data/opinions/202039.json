R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-1868\n\n                      UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                 Appellee,\n\n                                      v.\n\n                           MAYRA DIAZ, ETC.,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n\n         [Hon. Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n              Selya, Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Tamara A. Barney, by appointment of the court, on brief for\nappellant.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Susan M.\nPoswistilo, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                            January 30, 2006\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.             A federal grand jury in the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts indicted defendant-appellant Mayra Diaz\n\non various charges.      See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2.    Five other persons were accused in the original indictment,\n\nincluding Diaz's live-in boyfriend, Santiago Pache.                 After a four-\n\nday jury trial, Diaz was found guilty on two drug-trafficking\n\ncounts.     On May 20, 2003, the district court sentenced her to a\n\n151-month    incarcerative       term    (the     bottom    of     the    guideline\n\nsentencing range).      This appeal ensued.\n\n            We need not tarry.          This is a single-issue appeal in\n\nwhich Diaz asserts that because she was sentenced prior to the\n\ndecision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), and\n\nunder the mandatory guidelines system then in effect, resentencing\n\nis    required.      Diaz   concedes     that     this     claim    of    error   is\n\nunpreserved.       It is, therefore, relegated to plain error review.\n\nSee United States v. Guzmán, 419 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nUnited States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            In order to establish an entitlement to relief under the\n\nplain error standard, an appellant must show \"(1) that an error\n\noccurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected [her] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired\n\nthe    fairness,    integrity,     or    public     reputation       of    judicial\n\nproceedings.\"      United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    The first two prongs of the plain error test are satisfied\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fwhere, as here, the sentencing court treated the guidelines as\n\nmandatory rather than advisory.     See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at\n\n75.   Consequently, we proceed directly to the third and fourth\n\nprongs of the test.\n\n            With respect to these prongs, the appellant must show at\n\na bare minimum that, had the error not occurred, there is a\n\n\"reasonable probability\" that she would have received a lesser\n\nsentence.    Id.   We have held that in many cases this third-prong\n\nshowing will be \"sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\n\nof the proceeding,\" id. at 78 (quoting United States v. Dominguez\n\nBenitez, 542 U.S. 74, 83 (2004)), and, thus, will satisfy the\n\nfourth prong as well.\n\n            In light of the foregoing, the pivotal issue is whether,\n\nbut for the then-mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines, \"it\n\nis reasonably likely that the district court would have imposed a\n\nmore lenient sentence.\"   Guzmán, 419 F.3d at 30.   In answering this\n\nquestion, our reading of the record will neither be pettifogging\n\nnor overly strict.     See United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220,\n\n224 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            In this case, we believe that Diaz has satisfied the\n\nrequirements for showing plain error.    The district judge not only\n\nsentenced her to the shortest possible prison term available under\n\nthe applicable guideline sentencing range but also characterized\n\nthat sentence as \"very severe.\"    In virtually the same breath, the\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fjudge noted pointedly that \"the limits of [judicial] authority\n\n[were] provided by the Sentencing Guidelines.\"                               He went on to\n\nexplain that he was bound to follow the dictates of the Sentencing\n\nCommission and, indirectly, of Congress. These allusions, taken in\n\ncontext, tend to show a belief that the then-mandatory guidelines\n\ntied the judge's hands.1\n\n              To     cinch      matters,    the    record     reveals        three     special\n\ncircumstances that suggest a reasonable likelihood of a lower\n\nsentence      under       an    advisory     guidelines        regime.          First,    the\n\nsentencing          judge      appeared    to     be   sensitive        to     the     abusive\n\nrelationship         that      existed     between     Diaz    and   her       codefendant,\n\nSantiago Pache.           While the judge found that this relationship did\n\nnot justify a departure based on coercion, see supra note 1, he\n\nnonetheless concluded that the \"dysfunctional relationship\" placed\n\nDiaz       \"under     a     degree   of     duress.\"          Second,        Diaz's     family\n\ncircumstances, especially in relation to the care of her young\n\nchild, were immaterial under the mandatory guidelines regime; now,\n\nhowever, the judge could very well find them compelling.                              Finally,\n\nthe judge was sufficiently concerned about Diaz's cognitive ability\n\nand mental health that he ordered the Bureau of Prisons to conduct\n\na psychiatric evaluation.                 Although the evaluation revealed that\n\n\n       1\n      The judge's statements regarding his denial of Diaz's request\nfor a downward departure reinforce this view. When handing down\nthe sentence, he stated trenchantly that his \"perception of\nintellectual honesty concerning the availability of departures\"\nconstrained him to stay within the guideline sentencing range.\n\n                                             -4-\n\fDiaz was able to proceed to sentencing and to serve a sentence of\n\nincarceration, it confirmed that she suffered from an adjustment\n\ndisorder.\n\n            We need go no further.    Because the record, taken as a\n\nwhole, indicates that the district court, if acting under an\n\nadvisory guidelines system, might well have imposed a more lenient\n\nsentence, we vacate Diaz's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\nIf we have misread the district judge's inclination, it will be\n\neasy enough for him simply to reimpose the same sentence.     At any\n\nrate, that is for the able district judge; for our part, we\n\nintimate no view as to what sentence should be imposed in the\n\nresentencing proceeding.\n\n            The appellant's sentence is vacated and the case is\n\nremanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
