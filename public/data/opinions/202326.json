Camille L. Velez-Rive, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n               Selya, Lipez, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Edward W.

Resolved in the district court on\n\nthe basis of its admiralty jurisdiction, this case involves a\n\ncontract dispute over the disposal of a sunken ship.                    We must\n\ndecide whether the district court had admiralty jurisdiction over\n\nthis matter and, if so, whether the district court correctly ruled\n\nthat the relief sought by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority (\"PRPA\")\n\nwas barred by the doctrine of laches.             Because we answer both\n\nquestions   in   the   affirmative,    we   affirm    the    judgment   of    the\n\ndistrict court.1\n\n                                      I.\n\n            In 1989, the vessel \"La Isla Nena\" sunk in the navigable\n\nwaters of San Juan Harbor during Hurricane Hugo.                In 1991, the\n\nUnited States Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") instructed the\n\nPRPA, the owner of La Isla Nena, to remove the vessel because it\n\nwas obstructing navigation.           In January 1992, Defendants Jose\n\nAlberto Umpierre Solares, Divers Service Center, Inc., Milton\n\nAndrews-Figueroa,      and   Milton     Andrews      Crane    Service,       Inc.\n\n(collectively, \"Defendants\")2 submitted a proposal to the PRPA for\n\nthe removal of the vessel from San Juan Harbor.                 The proposal\n\npresented two alternatives:      Defendants could raise and put the\n\n\n1\n  All references to the district court herein refer to the\nmagistrate judge exercising her consent authority pursuant to Rule\n73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n2\n  Umpierre Solares is an officer of Divers Service Center, Inc.\nMilton Andrews-Figueroa is the sole shareholder of Milton Andrews\nCrane Service Center, Inc.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fvessel on shore for $75,000, or raise and dispose of the vessel for\n\n$85,000.     In April 1992, the PRPA and Defendants entered into a\n\ncontract (\"Contract\") for \"the removal and disposition of the\n\nvessel Isla Nena, sunken at the bottom of the sea in the area of\n\nthe Army Terminal\" in exchange for payment of $85,000.         Defendants\n\nsubsequently raised the vessel and moored it at a shipyard in the\n\ncity of Cataño.    When required permits made re-sinking the vessel\n\nunfeasible, the parties modified the Contract in September 1992.\n\nThe PRPA agreed to pay Defendants $84,000 (instead of $85,000) to\n\ndispose of the vessel \"in the most convenient and speedy way\n\npossible.\"    The PRPA issued payment to Defendants on September 9,\n\n1992.    The vessel is presently partially sunk (as the result of a\n\nstorm) at the shipyard in Cataño.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            On October 31, 2003, the PRPA and its Executive Director,\n\nMiguel     Soto-LaCourt3   (collectively,    \"Plaintiffs\"),     filed   a\n\ncomplaint    in   Puerto   Rico   Superior   Court   seeking     specific\n\nperformance under the Contract to remove and dispose of La Isla\n\nNena. Invoking admiralty jurisdiction, Defendants removed the case\n\nto the district court.     Defendants subsequently filed a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, claiming that the action was time-barred pursuant\n\n\n3\n  Aside from the complaint, the only filings in which Soto-\nLaCourt's name appears are Plaintiffs' motion to remand and the\njoint discovery report.     All other filings in opposition to\nDefendants, including the Notice of Appeal and Amended Notice of\nAppeal, were brought solely by the PRPA.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fto the laches doctrine, and that the Contract was a salvage\n\ncontract subject to a two-year statute of limitations.                   The PRPA\n\nfiled its opposition, arguing that laches did not apply, and that\n\nthe Contract was a contract for professional services, not a\n\nsalvage   contract,   and     subject    to    a     fifteen-year   statute     of\n\nlimitations.     On   March      1,   2005,   the     district   court    granted\n\nDefendants' motion for summary judgment under the laches doctrine,\n\nand dismissed Plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice.\n\n           On March 16, 2005, the PRPA, through new legal counsel,\n\nfiled a motion to alter, amend, or vacate judgment (\"Motion to\n\nAlter/Amend\"), arguing for the first time that the district court\n\nlacked admiralty jurisdiction under the \"dead ship\" doctrine.                   On\n\nMarch 30, 2005, the PRPA appealed the district court's grant of\n\nDefendants' motion for summary judgment.              We refused to entertain\n\nthe   appeal   pending    the     outcome      of     Defendants'      Motion   to\n\nAlter/Amend,   pursuant     to    Federal     Rule    of   Appellate    Procedure\n\n4(a)(4)(A).4   On June 1, 2005, the district court denied the PRPA's\n\nMotion to Alter/Amend because there were issues of fact as to\n\nwhether La Isla Nena was a \"dead ship.\"5                The PRPA subsequently\n\n4\n  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)(A) provides that\n\"[i]f a party timely files in the district court [a motion to alter\nor amend the judgment under Rule 59, or a motion for relief under\nRule 60] the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the\nentry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.\"\n5\n  It is unclear from the record why the district court denied the\nPRPA's Motion to Alter/Amend and let stand its prior order granting\nDefendants' motion for summary judgment, despite finding that there\nwere \"significant controversies of fact to be elucidated\" regarding\n\n                                       -4-\n\famended its notice of appeal to include the district court's June\n\n1 decision.\n\n                                   III.\n\n          We review grants of summary judgment de novo. DeNovellis\n\nv. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 305 (1st Cir. 1997).           Summary judgment is\n\nproper   when      \"the     pleadings,         depositions,    answers     to\n\ninterrogatories,    and    admissions     on    file,   together   with   the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).        We review a district\n\ncourt's denial of a motion to alter or amend judgment for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Earnhardt v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 744 F.2d\n\n1, 2 (1st Cir. 1984).      We may affirm a district court decision on\n\nany ground supported by the record.       See Doe v. Anrig, 728 F.2d 30,\n\n32 (1st Cir. 1984) (appellate court free to affirm based on any\n\nground supported by the record).\n\n                                   IV.\n\nA.        Jurisdiction\n\n          The PRPA argues that the district court lacked admiralty\n\njurisdiction over the removed action because La Isla Nena was a\n\n\nthe jurisdictional issue. The logical next step, we think, would\nhave been for the court to grant the PRPA's Motion to Alter/Amend,\nvacate the summary judgment order, and resolve the jurisdictional\nissue.   Nevertheless, because we affirm the district court's\nadmiralty jurisdiction over this dispute on other grounds, this\napparent inconsistency in the district court's ruling poses no\nproblem on appeal.\n\n                                   -5-\n\f\"dead ship.\"6       Under the dead ship doctrine, a ship loses its\n\nstatus as a vessel subject to admiralty jurisdiction \"when its\n\nfunction is so changed that it has no further navigation function.\"\n\nMullane v. Chambers, 333 F.3d 322, 328 (1st Cir. 2003) (internal\n\ncitation and quotation marks omitted).           Defendants argue that the\n\nremoved    action    was   within    the   district    court's    admiralty\n\njurisdiction because the Contract relates to the removal and\n\ndisposal of La Isla Nena – \"a marine peril [of which the Corps] had\n\ndemand[ed] removal . . . [because it] posed a risk to the maritime\n\nnavigation and maritime commerce traveling the navigable waters of\n\nSan Juan Bay.\"7      We agree with Defendants that the Contract was\n\nmaritime    in   nature    and,     therefore,     within   the   admiralty\n\njurisdiction of the district court.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Defendants argue that the PRPA waived this jurisdictional claim\nby not raising it prior to the district court's grant of summary\njudgment in Defendants' favor. This argument is without merit.\n\"[T]he objection to subject matter jurisdiction is not waivable and\nmay be raised for the first time on appeal.\"       F.A.C., Inc. v.\nCooperativa de Seguros de Vida de Puerto Rico, 449 F.3d 185, 189\n(1st Cir. 2006). Here, the PRPA raised its objection in a Motion\nto Alter/Amend filed before its Notice of Appeal and, thus, the\ndistrict court did not err in reaching the merits of the objection.\n7\n  Defendants raise several additional – albeit somewhat convoluted\n– arguments in favor of admiralty jurisdiction, namely, that: the\nContract is a \"salvage contract\" and is therefore subject to\nadmiralty jurisdiction; and La Isla Nena sank \"in the navigable\nwaters of San Juan Bay\" and, therefore, \"admiralty jurisdiction\n[is] apparent on its face.\" Because we agree with Defendants that\nadmiralty jurisdiction extends to this action because the Contract\nrelates to the removal and disposal of an obstruction to\nnavigation, we do not address Defendants' alternative arguments.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f            Section 1333(1) of Title 28 U.S.C. provides that federal\n\ndistrict courts shall have jurisdiction over \"[a]ny civil case of\n\nadmiralty    or   maritime   jurisdiction.\"    The   Supreme    Court   has\n\nreiterated that \"the fundamental interest giving rise to maritime\n\njurisdiction is the protection of maritime commerce.\"          Exxon Corp.\n\nv. Cent. Gulf Lines, Inc., 500 U.S. 603, 608 (1991) (internal\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).        Therefore, in determining\n\nwhether a contract falls within maritime jurisdiction, we focus our\n\ninquiry on \"whether the nature of the transaction was maritime,\"\n\nid. at 611, that is, whether the contract \"relate[s] to the\n\nnavigation, business or commerce of the sea.\"            Cunningham v.\n\nDirector, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 377 F.3d 98,\n\n109 n.11 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Nacirema Co. v. Johnson, 396 U.S.\n\n212, 215 n.7 (1969)); see also Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Kirby, 543\n\nU.S. 14, 23-24 (2004) (\"To ascertain whether a contract is a\n\nmaritime one . . . the answer depends upon the nature and character\n\nof the contract, and the true criterion is whether it has reference\n\nto maritime service or maritime transactions.\" (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted)).\n\n            After La Isla Nena sunk in the navigable waters of San\n\nJuan Harbor, the Corps issued a \"Mark and Removal Order\" to the\n\nPRPA to remove the obstruction, pursuant to Section 15 of the\n\nRivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (\"RHA\"), 33 U.S.C. § 409.8         Section\n\n8\n    Section 15 of the RHA states, in relevant part, that:\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f15   of   the   RHA,   entitled   \"Obstruction   of   navigable   waters   by\n\nvessels; floating timber; marking and removal of sunken vessels,\"\n\nseeks \"to maintain and promote the safety of navigation,\" The\n\nBohemian Club v. Moller, 320 U.S. 462, 466 (1943), by providing for\n\nthe prompt removal of obstructions to navigation.             Accordingly,\n\nwhen the PRPA entered into a contract with Defendants for the\n\nremoval of La Isla Nena from the navigable waters of San Juan\n\nHarbor, this transaction was maritime in nature because it related\n\nto the removal of an obstruction to the \"navigation, business or\n\ncommerce of the sea.\"       Cunningham, 377 F.3d at 109 n.11; compare\n\nD.M. Picton & Co., Inc. v. Eastes, 160 F.2d 189, 192-93 (5th Cir.\n\n1947) (stating that \"it would be difficult to imagine a contract\n\nmore completely maritime\" than a contract for removal of damaged\n\npilings and timber which constituted \"menaces to navigation,\" and\n\nholding that claim for breach of contract \"to remove hazards to\n\nnavigation\" was, therefore, within admiralty jurisdiction), with R.\n\nMaloblocki & Assocs., Inc. v. Metro. Sanitary Dist., 369 F.2d 483,\n\n485 (7th Cir. 1966) (holding that contract for dredging navigable\n\nwaterway was not maritime in nature because the purpose of the\n\n\n\n      It shall not be lawful to . . . sink, or permit or cause\n      to be sunk, vessels or other craft in navigable channels\n      . . . . And whenever a vessel, raft or other craft is\n      wrecked and sunk in a navigable channel, it shall be the\n      duty of the owner, lessee, or operator of such sunken\n      craft to . . . commence the immediate removal of the\n      same, and prosecute such removal diligently . . . .\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fcontract was flood control and that \"any effect the project may\n\nhave had upon navigability was, at best, incidental.\" (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).            The district court therefore had\n\nadmiralty jurisdiction to entertain the removed action.\n\n              We acknowledge the PRPA's reliance upon a line of cases\n\nholding that contracts involving \"dead ships\" are not maritime in\n\nnature and thus are not subject to admiralty jurisdiction.              See,\n\ne.g., Robert E. Blake, Inc. v. Excel Envtl., 104 F.3d 1158, 1160,\n\n1162 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding that indemnity claim arising under\n\ncontract involving repair and activation of ship which had been\n\nstored for several years and had been deactivated was outside\n\nadmiralty jurisdiction); Murray v. Schwartz, 175 F.2d 72, 72-73 (2d\n\nCir. 1949) (\"A wharfage contract touching a dead ship is not\n\nmaritime, and a contract which is not maritime cannot create a lien\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of admiralty.\").             This reliance is\n\nmisplaced.      Not one of the cases cited by the PRPA involves a\n\ncontract for the removal of a ship obstructing navigable waters.\n\nWhether La Isla Nena was \"live\" or \"dead\" when it was lying at the\n\nbottom   of    San   Juan   Harbor,   obstructing   navigation,   is   of   no\n\nconsequence to our jurisdictional inquiry. What matters is that La\n\nIsla Nena was lying at the bottom of San Juan Harbor, obstructing\n\nnavigation, and that the Contract related to the removal of this\n\nobstruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f          The PRPA's reliance upon our decision in Luvi Trucking,\n\nInc. v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., 650 F.2d 371 (1st Cir. 1981), is\n\nlikewise unavailing.    In that case, we held that a trucking\n\ncompany's contract with a sea carrier to haul cargo containers\n\noverland from one ocean pier to another was not maritime in nature,\n\nand relied on an influential treatise for the proposition that a\n\ncontract is not maritime in nature\n\n     merely because the services to be performed under the\n     contract have reference to a ship, or to its business, or\n     that the ship is the object of such services or that it\n     has reference to navigable waters. In order that such\n     character should attach, there must be present a direct\n     and proximate juridical link between the contract and the\n     operation of the ship, its navigation or its management\n     afloat . . . .\n\nId. at 373 (quoting 1 Benedict on Admiralty § 182, at 11-5 (6th ed.\n\n1974)).   The PRPA argues that admiralty jurisdiction does not\n\nattach in this case because the Contract is not linked to \"the\n\noperation, navigation or management of a vessel afloat,\" but rather\n\nto La Isla Nena, which \"is not a vessel, but rather a dead ship.\"\n\nWe decline to adopt the PRPA's strained reading of the language\n\nquoted in Luvi.\n\n          In Luvi, the jurisdictional inquiry did not turn on\n\nwhether a ship was \"live\" or \"dead\".    Rather, the issue in that\n\ncase was whether admiralty jurisdiction should attach to a contract\n\nfor services provided by a trucking company which \"never came in\n\ncontact with a ship,\" and which \"merely picked up the [cargo\n\ncontainers] at one terminal and drove them to the other.\"   Id. at\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f373-74. We concluded that these services were too far removed from\n\nmaritime   matters   to   provide   \"a     basis   for   characterizing   the\n\ncontract as maritime.\"     Id. at 374; see also Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n\nBalfour Maclaine Int'l, Ltd., 968 F.2d 196, 200 (2d Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"[T]he subject matter of the dispute is so attenuated from the\n\nbusiness of maritime commerce that it does not implicate the\n\nconcerns underlying admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.\").           Here,\n\nit is undisputed that Defendants came in contact with La Isla Nena\n\n– they removed it from the bottom of San Juan Harbor and moored it\n\nat a shipyard in the city of Cataño.          Unlike the overland hauling\n\ncontract in Luvi, the removal services provided by Defendants under\n\nthe Contract closely relate to maritime commerce and thus provide\n\na firm basis for characterizing the Contract as maritime in nature,\n\nregardless of whether La Isla Nena was a dead ship.\n\nB.         Laches\n\n           Having concluded that the district court had admiralty\n\njurisdiction over this action, we now turn to whether the district\n\ncourt erred in holding that the PRPA's breach-of-contract action\n\nwas barred by laches.     The district court so held because the PRPA\n\nwaited more than eleven years to file its claim. Specifically, the\n\ncourt held that the PRPA's commencement of this action in 2003,\n\n\"when [the PRPA] knew at least since 1992 [that] 'La Isla Nena' had\n\nnot been re-sunk and [] was re-floated and navigated to Cataño,\"\n\nconstituted \"excessive and unreasonable\" delay and economically\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fprejudiced Defendants.         The PRPA does not dispute this delay,\n\nconceding    that    \"12   years    elapsed   since   the   execution    of    the\n\nContract.\"     Nevertheless, the PRPA argues that laches does not\n\napply because the Contract was for professional services and was\n\ntherefore subject to a fifteen-year statute of limitations under\n\nArticle 1864 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n5294.9\n\n            \"In an admiralty case, maritime law and the equitable\n\ndoctrine of laches\" – not federal or state statutes of limitations\n\n– \"govern the time to sue.\"         TAG/ICIB Servs., Inc. v. Pan American\n\nGrain Co., Inc., 215 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2000); accord Puerto\n\nRican-American Ins. Co. v. Benjamin Shipping Co. Ltd., 829 F.2d\n\n281, 283 (1st Cir. 1987); Pierre v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp.,\n\n624 F.2d 445, 450 (3d Cir. 1980) (\"[D]elay in bringing suit on an\n\nadmiralty    claim    is   barred    by   laches,   not   by   any   statute    of\n\nlimitations.\"); Hill v.

Federal courts sitting in admiralty\n\"traditionally have been, and still are, governed by formal\nAdmiralty Rules and by a body of judge-made remedial law [which] .\n. . has borrowed much from equity, including the rule of laches,\nand the employment of local statutes of limitations 'by analogy'\nwhere not inconsistent with admiralty principles.\" Alfred Hill,\nState Procedural Law in Federal Nondiversity Litigation, 69 Harv.\nL.

Section 730 states, in\nrelevant part, that \"[a] suit for the recovery of remuneration for\nrendering assistance or salvage services shall not be maintainable\nif brought later than two years from the date when such assistance\nor salvage was rendered.\"\n\n                               -13-\n\fthis period of time does not save the action from being barred by\n\nlaches.    Rather, this fact merely shifts the burden of proving\n\nunreasonable delay and prejudice onto Defendants.\n\n            The uncontested facts demonstrate that the PRPA knew at\n\nleast since 1992 that La Isla Nena had not been re-sunk and was\n\ninstead moored at a shipyard in Cataño.         Nevertheless, as noted by\n\nthe district court, \"the record is devoid of any evidence to show\n\nplaintiffs made any extra-judicial or judicial effort during the\n\neleven (11) year-period to request from defendants the specific\n\nperformance of the contract.\" In light of this undisputed evidence\n\nof inaction on the part of the PRPA, and the absence of any\n\nreasonable    explanation    for   such    inaction,   we   agree   with   the\n\ndistrict court that the PRPA's eleven-year delay in bringing this\n\naction was unreasonable.         See Cornetta, 851 F.2d at 1375 (\"The\n\ndoctrine of laches . . . [i]s premised on the maxim vigilantibus\n\nnon dormientibus aequitas subvenit, equity aids the vigilant not\n\nthose who slumber on their rights.\").\n\n            It is also undisputed that in 1998, approximately four\n\nyears after Defendants refloated La Isla Nena and moored it at the\n\nshipyard    in   Cataño,   the   vessel    became   partially   sunk   again.\n\nDefendants argue that they would be prejudiced if the PRPA were to\n\n\"obtain a free second refloat of 'La Isla Nena' at no cost to the\n\nPRPA.\"     We agree with the district court that Defendants would\n\nunquestionably be prejudiced by the cost of a second re-float.

We must decide whether the district court had admiralty jurisdiction over this matter and, if so, whether the district court correctly ruled that the relief sought by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority (\"PRPA\") was barred by the doctrine of laches.

In 1991, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") instructed the PRPA, the owner of La Isla Nena, to remove the vessel because it was obstructing navigation. In January 1992, Defendants Jose Alberto Umpierre Solares, Divers Service Center, Inc., Milton Andrews-Figueroa, and Milton Andrews Crane Service, Inc. (collectively, \"Defendants\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> submitted a proposal to the PRPA for the removal of the vessel from San Juan Harbor. The proposal presented two alternatives: Defendants could raise and put the vessel on shore for $75,000, or raise and dispose of the vessel for $85,000. In April 1992, the PRPA and Defendants entered into a contract (\"Contract\") for \"the removal and disposition of the vessel Isla Nena, sunken at the bottom of the sea in the area of the Army Terminal\" in exchange for payment of $85,000. Defendants subsequently raised the vessel and moored it at a shipyard in the city of Cata&#241;o. When required permits made re-sinking the vessel unfeasible, the parties modified the Contract in September 1992. The PRPA agreed to pay Defendants $84,000 (instead of $85,000) to dispose of the vessel \"in the most convenient and speedy way possible.\" The PRPA issued payment to Defendants on September 9, 1992. The vessel is presently partially sunk (as the result of a storm) at the shipyard in Cata&#241;o.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2003, the PRPA and its Executive Director, Miguel Soto-LaCourt<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), filed a complaint in Puerto Rico Superior Court seeking specific performance under the Contract to remove and dispose of La Isla Nena. Invoking admiralty jurisdiction, Defendants removed the case to the district court. Defendants subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that the action was time-barred pursuant to the laches doctrine, and that the Contract was a salvage contract subject to a two-year statute of limitations. The PRPA filed its opposition, arguing that laches did not apply, and that the Contract was a contract for professional services, not a salvage contract, and subject to a fifteen-year statute of limitations. On March 1, 2005, the district court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment under the laches doctrine, and dismissed Plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 2005, the PRPA, through new legal counsel, filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate judgment (\"Motion to Alter/Amend\"), arguing for the first time that the district court lacked admiralty jurisdiction under the \"dead ship\" doctrine.

Accordingly, when the PRPA entered into a contract with Defendants for the removal of La Isla Nena from the navigable waters of San Juan Harbor, this transaction was maritime in nature because it related to the removal of an obstruction to the \"navigation, business or commerce of the sea.\" <i>Cunningham,</i> 377 F.3d at 109 n. 11; <i>compare D.M. Picton &amp; Co., Inc. v. Eastes,</i> 160 F.2d 189, 192-93 (5th Cir.1947) (stating that \"it would be difficult to imagine a contract more completely maritime\" than a contract for removal of damaged pilings and timber which constituted \"menaces to navigation,\" and holding that claim for breach of contract \"to remove hazards to navigation\" was, therefore, within admiralty jurisdiction), <i>with R.

Blake, Inc. v.

This reliance is misplaced. Not one of the cases cited by the PRPA involves a contract for the removal of a ship obstructing navigable waters. Whether La Isla Nena was \"live\" or \"dead\" when it was lying at the bottom of San Juan Harbor, obstructing navigation, is of no consequence to our jurisdictional inquiry. What matters is that La Isla Nena was lying at the bottom of San Juan Harbor, obstructing navigation, and that the Contract related to the removal of this obstruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PRPA's reliance upon our decision in <i>Luvi Trucking, Inc. v.

In that case, we held that a trucking company's contract with a sea carrier to haul cargo containers overland from one ocean pier to another was not maritime in nature, and relied on an influential treatise for the proposition that a contract is not maritime in nature</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">merely because the services to be performed under the contract have reference to a ship, or to its business, or that the ship is the object of such services or that it has reference to navigable waters.

The PRPA argues that admiralty jurisdiction does not attach in this case because the Contract is not linked to \"the operation, navigation or management of a vessel afloat,\" but rather to La Isla Nena, which \"is not a vessel, but rather a dead ship.\" We decline to adopt the PRPA's strained reading of the language quoted in <i>Luvi.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Luvi,</i> the jurisdictional inquiry did not turn on whether a ship was \"live\" or \"dead\". Rather, the issue in that case was whether admiralty jurisdiction should attach to a contract for services provided by a trucking company which \"never came in contact with a ship,\" and which \"merely picked up the [cargo containers] at one terminal and drove them to the other.\" <i>Id.</i> at 373-74. We concluded that these services were too far removed from maritime matters to provide \"a basis for characterizing the contract as maritime.\" <i>Id.</i> at 374; <i>see also Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v.

Here, it is undisputed that Defendants came in contact with La Isla Nena&#8212;they removed it from the bottom of San Juan Harbor and moored it at a shipyard in the city of Cata&#241;o. Unlike the overland hauling contract in <i>Luvi,</i> the removal services provided by Defendants under the Contract closely relate to maritime commerce and thus provide a firm basis for characterizing the Contract as maritime in nature, regardless of whether La Isla Nena was a dead ship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

The district court so held because the PRPA waited more than eleven years to file its claim. Specifically, the court held that the PRPA's commencement of this action in 2003, \"when [the PRPA] knew at least since 1992 [that] `La Isla Nena' had not been re-sunk and [ ] was re-floated and navigated to Cata&#241;o,\" constituted \"excessive and unreasonable\" delay and economically prejudiced Defendants. The PRPA does not dispute this delay, conceding that \"12 years elapsed since the execution of the Contract.\" Nevertheless, the PRPA argues that laches does not apply because the Contract was for professional services and was therefore subject to a fifteen-year statute of limitations under Article 1864 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 P.R.

In 1991, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\"Corps\") instructed the PRPA, the owner of La Isla Nena, to remove the vessel because it was obstructing navigation. In January 1992, Defendants Jose Alberto Umpierre Solares, Divers Service Center, Inc., Milton Andrews-Figueroa, and Milton Andrews Crane Service, Inc. (collectively, \"Defendants\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> submitted a proposal to the PRPA for the removal of the vessel from San Juan Harbor. The proposal presented two alternatives: Defendants could raise and put the vessel on shore for $75,000, or raise and dispose of the vessel for $85,000. In April 1992, the PRPA and Defendants entered into a contract (\"Contract\") for \"the removal and disposition of the vessel Isla Nena, sunken at the bottom of the sea in the area of the Army Terminal\" in exchange for payment of $85,000. Defendants subsequently raised the vessel and moored it at a shipyard in the city of Cata&#241;o. When required permits made re-sinking the vessel unfeasible, the parties modified the Contract in September 1992. The PRPA agreed to pay Defendants $84,000 (instead of $85,000) to dispose of the vessel \"in the most convenient and speedy way possible.\" The PRPA issued payment to Defendants on September 9, 1992. The vessel is presently partially sunk (as the result of a storm) at the shipyard in Cata&#241;o.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, 2003, the PRPA and its Executive Director, Miguel Soto-LaCourt<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), filed a complaint in Puerto Rico Superior Court seeking specific performance under the Contract to remove and dispose of La Isla Nena. Invoking admiralty jurisdiction, Defendants removed the case to the district court. Defendants subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that the action was time-barred pursuant to the laches doctrine, and that the Contract was a salvage contract subject to a two-year statute of limitations. The PRPA filed its opposition, arguing that laches did not apply, and that the Contract was a contract for professional services, not a salvage contract, and subject to a fifteen-year statute of limitations. On March 1, 2005, the district court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment under the laches doctrine, and dismissed Plaintiffs' complaint with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 2005, the PRPA, through new legal counsel, filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate judgment (\"Motion to Alter/Amend\"), arguing for the first time that the district court lacked admiralty jurisdiction under the \"dead ship\" doctrine.

Rather, the issue in that case was whether admiralty jurisdiction should attach to a contract for services provided by a trucking company which \"never came in contact with a ship,\" and which \"merely picked up the [cargo containers] at one terminal and drove them to the other.\" <i>Id.</i> at 373-74. We concluded that these services were too far removed from maritime matters to provide \"a basis for characterizing the contract as maritime.\" <i>Id.</i> at 374; <i>see also Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v.

Here, it is undisputed that Defendants came in contact with La Isla Nena&#8212;they removed it from the bottom of San Juan Harbor and moored it at a shipyard in the city of Cata&#241;o. Unlike the overland hauling contract in <i>Luvi,</i> the removal services provided by Defendants under the Contract closely relate to maritime commerce and thus provide a firm basis for characterizing the Contract as maritime in nature, regardless of whether La Isla Nena was a dead ship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Laches</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the district court had admiralty jurisdiction over this action, we now turn to whether the district court erred in holding that the PRPA's breach-of-contract action was barred by laches. The district court so held because the PRPA waited more than eleven years to file its claim. Specifically, the court held that the PRPA's commencement of this action in 2003, \"when [the PRPA] knew at least since 1992 [that] `La Isla Nena' had not been re-sunk and [ ] was re-floated and navigated to Cata&#241;o,\" constituted \"excessive and unreasonable\" delay and economically prejudiced Defendants. The PRPA does not dispute this delay, conceding that \"12 years elapsed since the execution of the Contract.\" Nevertheless, the PRPA argues that laches does not apply because the Contract was for professional services and was therefore subject to a fifteen-year statute of limitations under Article 1864 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 P.R.

Nevertheless, as noted by the district court, \"the record is devoid of any evidence to show plaintiffs made any extra-judicial or judicial effort during the eleven (11) year-period to request from defendants the specific performance of the contract.\" In light of this undisputed evidence of inaction on the part of the PRPA, and the absence of any reasonable explanation for such inaction, we agree with the district court that the PRPA's eleven-year delay in bringing this action was unreasonable. <i>See Cornetta,</i> 851 F.2d at 1375 (\"The doctrine of laches . . .

Defendants argue that they would be prejudiced if the PRPA were to \"obtain a free second refloat of `La Isla Nena' at no cost to the PRPA.\" We agree with the district court that Defendants would unquestionably be prejudiced by the cost of a second re-float.
