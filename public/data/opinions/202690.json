William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     David J. Apfel, with whom Jennifer W. Fischesser, William J.\nTrach, and Goodwin Procter LLP were on brief, for appellant.\n     Susan M. Poswistilo, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 3, 2007\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. William Tejeda was convicted after\n\na twelve-day jury trial of conspiracy to possess with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine base in the amount of 50 grams or more.                 Tejeda\n\nwas a New York supplier of drugs for a Cape Cod drug ring.                      This\n\ncriminal appeal attacks both Tejeda's conviction and the sentence\n\nimposed.    The attack on the conviction is based largely on an\n\nincident in the courtroom in which a spectator made a throat-\n\nslitting gesture.\n\n            Four of Tejeda's co-conspirators pled guilty, and two,\n\nAmanda Eldridge and Desiree Alves, testified against him.                  Tejeda\n\nand   a   co-conspirator,        Carmen    Figueroa,     went    to   trial;    she\n\ntestified, he did not.          Both were convicted.      Tejeda was sentenced\n\nto twenty years' imprisonment, five years of supervised release,\n\nand a special assessment of $100.\n\n            As    to    his    conviction,      Tejeda   does   not   attack    the\n\nsufficiency      of    the    evidence.      The   evidence     against   him   was\n\nextremely strong, a point discussed later.               He does argue that the\n\ntrial court committed two errors that deprived him of a fair trial\n\nand require his conviction be set aside.             The first claim of error\n\nis that the court should have granted a mistrial when an older man\n\nsitting in the gallery of the courtroom on the first day of trial\n\n(and later possibly connected to defendant by the evidence) made a\n\nthroat-slitting gesture.          That gesture was seen by two jurors and\n\ndiscussed by them with other jurors.                 The second trial error\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\falleged was that the court erred in not severing Tejeda's trial\n\nfrom co-defendant Figueroa's or bifurcating the trial so as to\n\nisolate the case against him.\n\n          Tejeda also attacks his sentence on the grounds that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously relied on the Guidelines applicable to\n\ncrack cocaine offenses and that the sentence was unreasonable.\n\n          Acknowledging the able advocacy on both sides, we affirm\n\nthe conviction and sentence.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The facts in evidence at the trial fairly establish the\n\nfollowing.\n\n          From January 2003 through March 2004, Tejeda supplied\n\ncrack cocaine to a drug distribution ring operating in Cape Cod,\n\nMassachusetts.    Tejeda   was   based   in   New   York;   his   address,\n\nironically, was 1234 Boston Road, in the Bronx.       The Cape Cod ring\n\nwas headed by Manuel Mendes, a co-defendant, who operated the ring\n\nwhile imprisoned at the Plymouth County House of Correction.          That\n\nimprisonment limited Mendes in his mobility and in his command\n\noperations, but it did not stop him.     Mendes operated the drug ring\n\nby giving instructions to co-defendant Figueroa, and sometimes to\n\nco-defendant Alves, both of whom he was permitted to telephone.\n\nFigueroa, in turn, contacted Tejeda and the other conspirators.\n\n          On Mendes' instructions, testifying co-conspirator Amanda\n\nEldridge drove to New York in January 2003, along with Carmen\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fFigueroa and Desiree Alves, to pick up crack from Tejeda. Eldridge\n\nalready knew Tejeda from prior drug transactions.      She identified\n\nTejeda in court and had done so in an earlier photo array.\n\nEldridge testified that in New York she met with Tejeda alone in a\n\nred van, picked up the drugs, and returned to Cape Cod.    Eldridge's\n\ntestimony was corroborated by Alves, who testified that these drug\n\ntrips to New York took place about every two weeks.\n\n          Eldridge testified that, under Mendes' direction, she\n\nmade the trip to New York to pick up drugs from Tejeda every week\n\nor so for a four-month period.      Eldridge then drove back to Cape\n\nCod and gave the drugs to either Alves or Figueroa.        Each time,\n\nTejeda gave Eldridge disk-shaped packages containing crack cocaine.\n\nEldridge also identified Tejeda's voice in a call recorded by the\n\ngovernment.   The recording captured Tejeda and Figueroa arranging\n\na drug transaction for February 17, 2004 in New York.\n\n          The February 17, 2004 transaction went off as planned, as\n\nwas established by the testimony of Alves and two drug enforcement\n\nofficers who witnessed the event.      Co-defendant Christopher Custer\n\nwas the courier this time.   Alves did not go on the trip, but she\n\ndid give Custer the money to purchase the drugs the night before,\n\nand she received the drugs at her home in Yarmouth from Custer when\n\nhe returned from his successful trip to New York.\n\n          The DEA had established surveillance over Tejeda's home\n\nin the Bronx and observed Custer's arrival and actions on February\n\n                                 -4-\n\f17.   Tejeda left his home and entered the red van.              A short while\n\nlater, Custer arrived, parked behind the van, and entered the van.\n\nPhotographs of Tejeda at the scene of the February 17 deal were\n\nadmitted    into   evidence   at     trial.      Within   approximately     five\n\nminutes, Custer got back into his car and left.               He was tracked by\n\npolice as he drove back to Cape Cod and was seen entering Alves'\n\nhome with a black bag and emerging without it.\n\n            The    police   made    arrests     immediately    after   observing\n\nanother drug deal, this one on March 16, 2004.            Custer, after again\n\nobtaining money on Cape Cod to pay for the crack, went to New York.\n\nAgents saw Tejeda leave the Boston Road address in the Bronx.\n\nTejeda then got in a car, and police tracked the car to Manhattan.\n\nIn Manhattan, an agent observed Custer on the same street as the\n\ncar carrying Tejeda.        A short time later, after losing sight of\n\nCuster, the agent saw Tejeda get out of the front passenger seat of\n\nthe car, and Custer get out of the back passenger seat and into the\n\nfront passenger seat of the car. The police thereafter stopped the\n\ncar; in it were two disk-like objects, which later tested positive\n\nfor cocaine base.       That evening Tejeda was arrested.\n\n            The government's case rested primarily on this evidence,\n\nand   not   on    the   testimony    of   the    non-pleading    co-defendant,\n\nFigueroa.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f                            II.    Trial Error Claims\n\nA.            The Throat-Slitting Gesture and Fair Trial Rights\n\n              1.   Facts And Procedural History\n\n              On the morning of the third day of trial, Friday, May 6,\n\n2005, the government's witness was Lt. Balcom. During questioning,\n\nLt. Balcom indicated that on one occasion he had observed some of\n\nthe   individuals     in    the    courtroom    in   the   red   van.      At   the\n\nprosecutor's request, Lt. Balcom pointed out these people in the\n\ncourtroom.\n\n              During the morning break, a juror reported privately to\n\nthe   court    that   she    and    another    juror   had    seen   one   of   the\n\nindividuals identified by Lt. Balcom make a throat-slitting gesture\n\non the second day of trial, Wednesday, May 4.                After the break and\n\noutside of the presence of the jury, the court inquired and was\n\ntold by defense counsel that the man in question was Tejeda's\n\ngrandfather.       The jury was never informed of this fact.\n\n              The court reported to counsel, outside the presence of\n\nthe jury, that a juror had stated that she had observed Tejeda's\n\ngrandfather making a throat-slitting gesture.                    The court then\n\nordered the gesturer and his wife to leave the courthouse and\n\nbarred them from the courthouse and the surrounding vicinity.                    At\n\nleast some members of the jury were later informed of the court's\n\norder.   On the record, the court described the man barred from the\n\ncourtroom as an \"obviously frail appearing, old man.\"\n\n                                        -6-\n\f           Tejeda and Figueroa both moved for mistrial.    When the\n\ncourt discussed holding voir dire of the two jurors who reportedly\n\nhad seen the gesture, Tejeda's counsel expressed concern that the\n\nproposed voir dire would only heighten the issue for the jury.\n\n           Before starting the trial again that Friday, the court\n\nsaid to the jurors:\n\n           A matter has been conveyed to . . . me and I\n           have taken care of it completely. Put it out\n           of your mind. It has nothing to do with this\n           case. Have in mind, while the report is fully\n           appropriate, indeed we want such a report, do\n           not discuss the case among yourselves, the\n           case now, in the jury room.\n\nTejeda did not object to the instruction, and the trial continued\n\nfor the day.   Later, several of the jurors, on query, said that the\n\njury had complied with this instruction. Assuming that to be true,\n\nany discussion amongst the jurors occurred before the court dealt\n\nwith the report of the gesture.\n\n           On Sunday, May 8, Tejeda submitted a written mistrial\n\nmotion.   On Monday, May 9, the court denied the motion but told the\n\nparties it would grant their request to voir dire the juror who had\n\nreported the gesture, Juror 11.\n\n           The court then individually questioned Juror 11.      She\n\nsaid that she was concerned about the gesture but did not report it\n\non the day she saw it.   It was only after she heard the testimony\n\nof Lt. Balcom identifying the spectator as having been at the red\n\nvan that she started to feel uncomfortable about what she had seen\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe spectator do two days earlier.       After hearing Lt. Balcom's\n\ntestimony on Friday morning, she reported the gesture to several of\n\nthe other jurors, some of whom told her she should disclose it to\n\nthe court, and so she did.     The court had earlier instructed the\n\njurors not to discuss the case.\n\n            When asked whether she had linked the individual making\n\nthe gesture to any particular party in the case, Juror 11 answered\n\nthat she didn't know whether the older gentleman and the lady who\n\nhad been sitting with him had anything to do with a particular\n\nperson or side.    The juror stated that all she knew was that Lt.\n\nBalcom had testified to seeing one of them in the red van.     While\n\nshe recognized the public nature of the courtroom setting, she was\n\nconcerned that people in the courtroom could know the names of the\n\njurors.    The court asked whether she could put the incident out of\n\nher mind when evaluating the case and be fair to all parties.    She\n\nanswered affirmatively, and the court, observing her, found her to\n\nbe forthcoming.    Tejeda again moved for mistrial.\n\n            The court then questioned Juror 6, who also had seen the\n\ngesture.    Juror 6 described the gesture as odd and a strange thing\n\nto do in the middle of a court proceeding but did not think there\n\nwas anything to it.     She said that it was unclear to her toward\n\nwhom the gesture was directed.    Juror 6, like Juror 11, answered in\n\nthe affirmative as to her ability to be fair and impartial.      The\n\ncourt then denied the motion for mistrial.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f            At the request of Tejeda's counsel, on the fifth day of\n\ntrial, Tuesday, May 10, 2005, the court conducted a voir dire of\n\nthe remaining jurors.       None of the other jurors had seen the\n\nincident; all but one said that they had heard of it from Jurors 11\n\nand/or 6.     The jurors reported that they did not discuss the\n\nincident other than on the Friday morning before it was reported.\n\n            Each juror was asked whether he or she could be fair and\n\nimpartial, and every one responded in the affirmative.                 While\n\nseveral of the jurors indicated that they thought the gesture was\n\ninappropriate, no juror expressed fear for his or her safety.             Two\n\njurors   reported    that   the    gesture   had   been     unsettling    or\n\ndisconcerting for the jurors who had seen it.             One juror stated\n\nthat the reported gesture put pressure on the jury, but that the\n\nremedial action taken by the court had been appropriate.           Another\n\njuror stated that there could be safety concerns, but after hearing\n\nof the court's order barring the gesturer from the courthouse, she\n\nstated that she was satisfied with her own safety.              One juror\n\nreported that he knew nothing of the gesture.\n\n            Following the voir dire of the entire jury, Tejeda\n\nrenewed his motion for a mistrial and also requested that the jury\n\nforeperson, Juror 11, be deemed an alternate so she would not\n\nparticipate    in   the   jury    deliberation.    These     motions     were\n\nultimately denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f           The jury returned a verdict of conviction.     Thereafter,\n\nTejeda filed a motion for new trial based on, inter alia, the\n\nthroat-slitting incident.   At that time, Tejeda did not argue that\n\nthe purported error was a structural one, or that the court was\n\nrequired to apply a presumption of prejudice to the gesture.      The\n\ncourt denied the new trial motion.\n\n           2.   Appropriate Analytical Framework\n\n           a.   Structural Error\n\n           Tejeda argues that it is clear that the jury here was not\n\nimpartial, despite the trial judge's finding to the contrary and\n\nthe jurors' individual declarations that the incident did not\n\nrender any of them unable to remain impartial in reaching a\n\nverdict.\n\n           Tejeda leaps from this purported factual certainty to an\n\nargument, presented for the first time on appeal, that this issue\n\nmust be analyzed as structural error.     Tejeda would like this to be\n\nso because in structural error cases the defendant is entitled to\n\nautomatic reversal.    We reject Tejeda's argument.\n\n           Structural error analysis has been constricted in its use\n\nto a limited category of claimed errors, none of which fits this\n\ncase.   The Supreme Court has held that it is structural error for\n\na criminal defendant to be tried before a judge who has a financial\n\ninterest in convicting him.   Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 523, 535\n\n(1927).    Tejeda infers from Tumey that his claim that a juror is\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fbiased must also be analyzed as a structural error.    This is not a\n\nsituation in which one or more jurors has a financial interest in\n\nconvicting the defendant. We reject Tejeda's argument. The law is\n\nclear both that this is not the stuff of structural error and that\n\nTejeda's jury bias claim is subject to a different standard of\n\nreview.    On review, the appellate court asks whether the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying a mistrial.    That standard\n\ngives deference to the trial judge, who is in the best position to\n\nevaluate the matter.\n\n            Mere error in the trial process itself is not structural\n\nerror.    United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 126 S. Ct. 2557, 2563-64\n\n(2006).    Structural errors are reserved for cases where criminal\n\ndefendants are denied basic protections which \"necessarily render\n\na trial fundamentally unfair\" such that \"no criminal punishment may\n\nbe regarded as fundamentally fair.\"     Neder v. United States, 527\n\nU.S. 1, 8-9 (1999) (quoting Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 577-78\n\n(1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted).      Tejeda's claim of\n\njuror bias is not within this very limited class of cases.      See\n\nUnited States v. Mackey, 114 F.3d 470, 474 (4th Cir. 1997) (juror\n\nbias and misconduct claims are not structural errors).1\n\n\n\n\n     1\n            As the Ninth Circuit has noted, it would be inconsistent\nwith the   Supreme Court's decision in Remmer v. United States, 347\nU.S. 227   (1954), discussed below, to apply structural error review\nto these   sorts of jury bias issues. See United States v. Dutkel,\n192 F.3d   893, 899 n.4 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                 -11-\n\f               b.   The Remmer Presumption of Prejudice\n\n               On appeal, Tejeda also argues for the first time2 that he\n\nis entitled to a presumption of prejudice under Remmer v. United\n\nStates, 347 U.S. 227 (1954).        We hold that the Remmer presumption\n\ndoes not apply here.\n\n               In Remmer, the defendant learned after his conviction\n\nthat a third party had attempted to bribe a juror to get a verdict\n\nfavorable to the defendant, and he moved for a new trial.           Id. at\n\n228.       The court had not informed defense counsel of the bribe, but\n\nhad initiated an investigation of the bribe and had held an ex\n\nparte meeting with the prosecution.           Id.   The defendant's motion\n\nfor new trial was denied.       Id. at 229.    The Supreme Court held that\n\nRemmer was not entitled to an automatic reversal, but rather to a\n\nhearing before the trial court, and that the jury tampering would\n\nbe presumed to be prejudicial.        Id. at 229-30.\n\n               There is an ongoing debate in the circuits about the\n\nlimits on and the ongoing vitality of the presumption of prejudice\n\nrule announced in Remmer.        Compare United States v. Pennell, 737\n\nF.2d 521, 532-33 (6th Cir. 1984) (presumption of prejudice no\n\nlonger exists), with United States v. Sylvester, 143 F.3d 923, 934\n\n(5th Cir. 1998) (proper inquiry is whether likelihood of prejudice\n\nis high enough to assign to the government the burden of proving\n\n\n\n       2\n          Tejeda claims that he made this argument below, but we\nare unable to find support for that assertion in the record.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fharmlessness), United States v. Williams-Davis, 90 F.3d 490, 497\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1996) (same), United States v. Lloyd, 269 F.3d 228, 238\n\n(3d   Cir.     2001)   (presumption    applies     \"when    the   extraneous\n\ninformation is of a considerably serious nature,\" such as \"when a\n\njuror is directly contacted by third-parties\"), United States v.\n\nDutkel, 192 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 1999) (\"[A] presumption of\n\nprejudice arises if a juror was subjected to coercion or bribery,\n\nand if this intrusion may have affected the juror in the exercise\n\nof his judgment.\"), United States v. Scull, 321 F.3d 1270, 1280\n\n(10th Cir. 2003) (prejudice presumed \"[w]hen members of a jury are\n\nexposed to extraneous information about a matter pending before\n\n[them]\"), and United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d 158, 173 (2d Cir.\n\n2000) (similar). As we discussed in United States v. Bradshaw, 281\n\nF.3d 278, 287 (1st Cir. 2002), two later Supreme Court cases,\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 737-39 (1993), and Smith v.\n\nPhillips, 455 U.S. 209, 215-17 (1982), narrowed the broad language\n\nin Remmer.\n\n             This court has already rejected defendant's argument that\n\nthe   Remmer   presumption   applies   to    all   claims   of    juror   bias\n\nresulting from extraneous contacts.         See, e.g., Bradshaw, 281 F.3d\n\nat 288-89; United States v. Gomes, 177 F.3d 76, 82-83 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 260-62 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f            We employed the presumption of prejudice in United States\n\nv. Gaston-Brito, 64 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 1995), where a trial court\n\nsummarily denied, without conducting any inquiry, a motion for\n\nmistrial made before the verdict.            Id. at 13.      We did so in the\n\ncontext of holding that a trial court is obligated to \"conduct a\n\nsufficient inquiry to determine whether the communication was\n\nharmless.\"      Id. (quoting United States v. O'Brien, 972 F.2d 12, 14\n\n(1st Cir. 1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Tejeda relies\n\non Gaston-Brito to argue that given \"the jurors' expressions of\n\nfear and concern . . . , it [was] error to find that . . . Tejeda\n\nwas not prejudiced by the throat-slitting gesture.\"\n\n            Gaston-Brito      is   inapposite.          In   Gaston-Brito,    a\n\ncooperating witness was asked to identify the person who had\n\nthreatened to kill his daughter if his wife did not turn over drug\n\nproceeds.    A case agent seated at the prosecution table pointed to\n\nthe   defense    table,    possibly   indicating   to    the   jury   that   the\n\ndefendants had made the threat, although no evidence established\n\nthat.   Id. at 12.        The gesture at issue here is of a completely\n\ndifferent nature.\n\n            There are other distinctions. As Gaston-Brito noted, the\n\ngovernment created the problem there when a case agent for the\n\nprosecution made an inappropriate gesture conveying substantive\n\nevidence.    Id. at 13.      Since the jury could well think that the\n\nagent had inside information, there was a risk the jurors would\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fconsider the information during deliberations.    Id.    The court in\n\nGaston-Brito said it was applying a heightened standard when the\n\nprosecution was responsible for improper ex parte conduct.3       Id.\n\nHere, the gesture did not come from the prosecution and was not an\n\neffort to put evidence in front of the jury.   We add that there are\n\ndifferent considerations at play when a defendant attempts to\n\nvacate a conviction, in the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt,\n\non the basis that someone associated with the defense made an\n\nimproper gesture to the jury.    For example, we would not want to\n\ncreate an incentive for such gesturing by individuals associated\n\nwith defendants.\n\n          3.   Merits Analysis\n\n          Our usual standard of review once the trial judge has\n\nmade an appropriate inquiry, and the one that we utilize here, is\n\nan abuse of discretion standard, which recognizes that the district\n\ncourt \"has wide discretion in deciding how to handle and how to\n\nrespond to allegations of juror bias and misconduct that arise\n\nduring a trial.\" United States v. Rodríguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d 18, 23\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); see also United States v. Mikutowicz, 365 F.3d 65,\n\n74 (1st Cir. 2004); Bradshaw, 281 F.3d at 286-87.       We review the\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          Similarly, in O'Brien, we applied a presumption of\nprejudice when a police officer who had been summoned to testify on\nbehalf of the government (but who had not yet testified) engaged in\nconversation with three jurors in the hallway outside the courtroom\nduring a recess. 972 F.2d at 13.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fdistrict court's factual findings for clear error.    Bradshaw, 281\n\nF.3d at 291.\n\n          Where a colorable claim of jury taint surfaces before\n\njury deliberations occur, our law describes the sequence of steps\n\na trial judge should take.    See id. at 289.      The judge should\n\ninvestigate the allegation promptly, addressing whether the taint-\n\nproducing event occurred, and if so, assessing the magnitude and\n\nextent of any prejudice caused.    Id.     The trial court has wide\n\ndiscretion in how it goes about this inquiry.      Id. at 290.   The\n\ndistrict court, if faced with the issue initially post-verdict, may\n\nconvene an evidentiary hearing, but it is not obligated to do so.\n\nBoylan, 898 F.2d at 258.\n\n          If the court determines that there is a taint-producing\n\nevent and a significant potential for prejudice, the trial court\n\nshould then examine whether prophylactic measures will alleviate\n\nthe prejudice (and if so, take them), or whether the threat can\n\notherwise be dispelled or disproved.     Bradshaw, 281 F.3d at 289.\n\nThe court may determine that no curative measures will suffice and\n\ngrant a timely motion for a mistrial.    Id.\n\n          Here, the court followed every step in the procedure.\n\nThere is no realistic objection to the process it used.     Rather,\n\nTejeda's attack is on the court's conclusion that any potential\n\nprejudice had been adequately addressed.    The court did not apply\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fan incorrect legal standard, so we review its conclusion for abuse\n\nof discretion.\n\n           This case involves (1) a risk of a perception by a juror\n\nof an implicit threat from someone who might, in the juror's view,\n\nbe associated with the defendant; and (2) the risk that this\n\n\"threat\"   might   influence   the     juror's    ability   to   impartially\n\nevaluate   the   evidence.     These   risks     are   weighed   against   the\n\nindividual jurors' own statements that they were not so influenced\n\nand the trial judge's findings of fact that the jurors could fairly\n\nand impartially reach a verdict.\n\n           The risks in this case are considerably weaker than those\n\nposed by the facts in Rodríguez-Ortiz, where we upheld a district\n\ncourt's denial of mistrial.       455 F.3d at 23-24.        There, a juror\n\nreported he had received an explicit death threat related to the\n\ncase.   Id. at 24.     On inquiry, the juror said he could remain\n\nimpartial, and the court concluded he could do so.                Id.   Other\n\ncircuits have likewise affirmed the denial of a mistrial when a\n\njuror was threatened but assured the court that he could remain\n\nimpartial in deciding the case.           See, e.g., United States v.\n\nSimmons, No. 99-50381, 2000 WL 429704, at *1-2 (9th Cir. Apr. 20,\n\n2000) (unpublished table decision) (mem.) (affirming denial of\n\nmistrial when spectator made gestures during closing arguments that\n\nmade some jurors feel threatened); Leisher v. Conrad, 41 F.3d 753,\n\n754-55 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (affirming denial of mistrial when two\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fjurors misinterpreted as menacing a gesture made by defendant\n\noutside of courtroom); United States v. Garner, No. 90-5613, 1991\n\nWL 150788, at *2, 3 (6th Cir. Aug. 6, 1991) (unpublished table\n\ndecision) (per curiam) (affirming denial of mistrial when juror was\n\nthreatened by men presumed to be affiliated with defendant who made\n\nnoise like a gunshot outside the courtroom); United States v.\n\nZelinka, 862 F.2d 92, 93, 94-96 (6th Cir. 1988) (affirming denial\n\nof mistrial when spectator who appeared to be associated with\n\ndefendant made statement that it would be too bad if the elevator\n\nthe jurors were boarding should crash, causing fear on the part of\n\nsome of the jurors).\n\n            Tejeda argues that more than a single juror is involved,\n\nwhich increases the risk of taint.         This, he says, necessarily\n\nrequires a different result from that reached in Rodríguez-Ortiz.\n\nIt does not.      The implicit threat, while serious, was of a\n\ndifferent   nature   than   the   direct   threat   in   Rodríguez-Ortiz.\n\nFurther, it is unclear here to whom the gesture was intended, and\n\nhere there was a possible, but not direct, association between the\n\nthreat and the case.\n\n            Importantly, the district court did not ignore the risk\n\nthat one or more of the jurors could perceive this gesture as a\n\nthreat or that a threat might impair impartiality.            First, the\n\ncourt took immediate remedial action.       The court had the spectator\n\nwho was the source of the \"threat\" removed from the courtroom and\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\finformed the jurors not to be concerned. The elderly spectator was\n\nno longer present when the evidence connecting the red van to the\n\ndefendant became stronger at trial, and at least some of the jurors\n\nwere informed that the spectator was not permitted to be in the\n\nvicinity of the courthouse.       Second, the court queried each juror\n\nabout whether the throat-slitting gesture would render him or her\n\nunable to impartially evaluate the evidence.            The court observed\n\nthe demeanor of each juror and concluded that each could be\n\nimpartial.\n\n            Nor   did   the   court    leave   the   incident   for   further\n\nconversation and musings among the jurors.            The court instructed\n\nthem not to discuss it, and, those who were later questioned said\n\nthe jurors had complied with that instruction. Normally, if jurors\n\nsay they have followed instructions, their statements are credited.\n\nCf. Penry v. Johnson, 532 U.S. 782, 799 (2001); Boylan, 898 F.2d at\n\n263.4\n\n            There are, of course, extreme cases in which jurors'\n\nresponses will not be credited.         See Bruton v. United States, 391\n\nU.S. 123, 135-36 (1968) (\"[T]here are some contexts in which the\n\n\n        4\n          Similarly, where the claim is that jurors have been\ntainted by exposure to improperly admitted inflammatory evidence,\nour rule is that jurors are presumed to properly follow curative\ninstructions. See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1185\n(1st Cir. 1993). That presumption is overcome only by a showing\nthat it is probable that (1) responsible jurors will be unable to\ndisregard the evidence, and (2) the evidence likely will have a\nseriously prejudicial effect on the defendant. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d\nat 285.\n\n                                      -19-\n\frisk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so\n\ngreat, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant,\n\nthat the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot\n\nbe ignored. Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully\n\nincriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands\n\naccused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread\n\nbefore the jury in a joint trial.\"           (citations omitted)).     This is\n\nthe argument that Tejeda makes -- that the incident was so strongly\n\nand indelibly harmful that no instruction and no voir dire could\n\ncure   it.     Tejeda   adds   that   the    jurors'   voir   dire   responses\n\ndemonstrated that they would not be able to disregard the gesture\n\nin reaching a decision in the case.            We disagree for the reasons\n\nstated above.\n\n             The district court did not abuse its discretion in its\n\nhandling of the throat-slitting gesture.               Rather, it responded\n\nsensitively and correctly.\n\nB.           Severance and Bifurcation\n\n             Appellate review of trial court decisions to sever trials\n\nof criminal co-defendants is for manifest abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. DeLeon, 187 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 1999); Boylan,\n\n898 F.2d at 246.        Ordinarily, criminal co-defendants are to be\n\ntried together.     United States v. Houle, 237 F.3d 71, 75-76 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).    This rule has particular resonance in drug conspiracy\n\ncases, where multiple defendants often share a single indictment.\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\fSee United States v. Soto-Beníquez, 356 F.3d 1, 29 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nTejeda bears the burden of making \"a strong showing of prejudice\"\n\nin order to gain a new trial.      Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Porter, 764 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1985)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n            Tejeda twice moved to sever his trial from that of his\n\nco-defendants.   He did so as to all co-defendants by motion before\n\ntrial.   Later, on the first day of trial, he orally moved to sever\n\nhis trial from that of co-defendant Figueroa, after he learned that\n\nFigueroa would testify and present a battered woman defense as to\n\nher relationship with Mendes.5   Her testimony would be that Mendes\n\nregularly beat her.     Her proffer indicated that she would not\n\nimplicate Tejeda in the abuse she suffered.\n\n            On appeal, the only issue has to do with the motions to\n\nsever the case against Figueroa.    Tejeda's severance motion argued\n\nthat it was likely that Figueroa would take the stand and admit her\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy, but present a case of duress because\n\nshe had been under the influence of Mendes, who had pled guilty.\n\nThe court denied the motion for severance saying Tejeda could\n\ncross-examine Figueroa, and that no inconsistent defenses were\n\ninvolved.\n\n\n\n     5\n          Figueroa had informed the court and counsel of this\ndefense when she moved on April 27, 2005 to continue the trial so\nshe could prepare such a duress defense.    The court denied the\nmotion for a continuance.\n\n                                 -21-\n\f                  On May 12, 2005, Tejeda proposed to the trial court that\n\nit bifurcate the trial, differentiating the evidence applicable to\n\nhis case and to Figueroa's.            Specifically, Tejeda proposed that he\n\nput on his case, the prosecution put on its rebuttal, then the jury\n\ndecide on Tejeda's guilt or innocence alone.               Thereafter, Figueroa\n\nwould present her defense, the prosecution its rebuttal, and the\n\njury would then render its verdict as to Figueroa.                     The court\n\ndenied Tejeda's motion.          The motion was renewed at the close of the\n\nprosecution's case-in-chief and again denied.\n\n                  The prosecution questions whether the severance motion on\n\nthe day of trial and the bifurcation motion6 were timely.                  See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(D) (severance motions must be made before\n\ntrial).       We bypass the question and rule on the merits.\n\n                  Severance   should   be    granted   where   \"defenses    are   so\n\nirreconcilable as to involve fundamental disagreement over core and\n\nbasic facts.\"          United States v. Peña-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 34 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (quoting United States v. Paradis, 802 F.2d 553, 561\n\n(1st       Cir.    1986)   (emphases    added))    (internal    quotation    marks\n\nomitted).          But where there is merely some dissonance, where the\n\ndefenses are just \"somewhat antagonistic,\" we will usually not\n\nreverse a trial court's denial of severance.                   United States v.\n\nSerafino, 281 F.3d 327, 329 (1st Cir. 2002).                   Tejeda relies on\n\n       6\n          Although unusual, bifurcation has been used. See United\nStates v. Zarnes, 33 F.3d 1454, 1471-72 (7th Cir. 1994); United\nStates v. Joshi, 896 F.2d 1303, 1306-09 (11th Cir. 1990).\n\n                                            -22-\n\fUnited States v. Johnson, 478 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir. 1973), to argue\n\nthat severance was necessary in this case.   But in Johnson, the co-\n\ndefendants' theories of defense were truly antagonistic.       While\n\nJohnson defended on the basis that he was not present when the\n\ncharged crime was committed, his co-defendant made a confession\n\nexplicitly and necessarily incriminating Johnson and defended only\n\non the basis that he lacked the necessary mens rea.     Id. at 1131-\n\n32.\n\n            Here, by contrast, there was no true antagonism of\n\ndefenses.    Tejeda's defense explicitly acknowledged there was a\n\ndrug conspiracy; he simply argued the prosecution could not prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that he was the New York source of drugs\n\nfor the conspiracy. Thus, Figueroa's defense that there was a drug\n\nconspiracy, but that she had acted under duress, was not an\n\nantagonistic defense at all.    Her defense did not in any way hinge\n\non Tejeda's participation in the conspiracy.     Indeed, even if the\n\njury accepted her duress defense it could either accept or reject\n\nTejeda's defense.    Severance is not required every time a duress\n\ndefense is asserted by one defendant.     Peña-Lora, 225 F.3d at 34;\n\nUnited States v. Arias-Villaneuva, 998 F.2d 1491, 1507 (9th Cir.\n\n1993), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Jimenez-\n\nOrtega, 472 F.3d 1102, 1102-04 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n            Even if Tejeda had shown that severance from Figueroa was\n\nappropriate in this drug conspiracy case, it was his burden to show\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fprejudice.       Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246; Porter, 764 F.2d at 12.\n\n\"[P]rejudice means more than just a better chance of acquittal at\n\na separate trial.\"       Boylan, 898 F.2d at 246 (quoting United States\n\nv. Martinez, 479 F.2d 824, 828 (1st Cir. 1973)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).        \"Garden variety\" prejudice, which always exists\n\nwhen more than one defendant or offense are tried together, does\n\nnot warrant a new trial.       Id.     Tejeda has not met his burden here.\n\n            Tejeda's real argument is not one of antagonism.              It is\n\nthat Figueroa's testimony about being regularly beaten by her\n\nboyfriend Mendes, the head of the conspiracy, would spill over to\n\nTejeda,    who   was    accused   of    conspiring   with   Mendes   in    drug\n\ndistribution.      This is a sort of argument that \"you are known by\n\nthe friends you keep,\" and bad friends will taint you in the jury's\n\neyes.     It is almost inherent in drug conspiracy cases that a co-\n\nconspirator may have engaged in other types of blameworthy conduct.\n\nThat is not enough to warrant severance of co-defendants' trials.\n\nWhile Mendes' treatment of Figueroa may have been more shocking\n\nthan run-of-the-mill blameworthy conduct from drug co-conspirators,\n\nTejeda's role in the conspiracy -- as a geographically-removed\n\nsupplier several states distant -- lessened the risk that the\n\njurors might ascribe Mendes' conduct to him.           Moreover, the trial\n\njudge instructed the jury that evidence of Mendes' mistreatment of\n\nFigueroa was not to be considered in the case against Tejeda.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f           Figueroa did identify Tejeda in court as the drug ring's\n\nNew York source of supply. She also testified about numerous trips\n\nto New York to pick up drugs.    But all of this testimony, including\n\nthe identification, was cumulative of Eldridge's testimony.           There\n\nwas more than sufficient evidence against Tejeda without Figueroa's\n\nidentification.     In any event, Figueroa's testimony regarding\n\nTejeda was admissible against Tejeda regardless of whether the\n\ntrials were severed.        Further, Tejeda was permitted to cross-\n\nexamine Figueroa at trial, minimizing any thought of misconduct by\n\nassociation.\n\n           The district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying   the   severance   motion.      Nor   was   there   any   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion in the denial of the bifurcation procedure.               Such a\n\nprocedure risked confusion of the jury and unwarranted singling out\n\nof the case against Tejeda.\n\n           Given that we have found no error in the district court's\n\nhandling of the throat-slitting gesture or the severance and\n\nbifurcation motions, Tejeda's cumulative error claim is without\n\nmerit.\n\n                       III.    Sentencing Claims\n\nA.         Application of Crack Cocaine Guidelines\n\n           We review de novo sentencing issues involving questions\n\nof law.   United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 535 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\f              The government argues that Tejeda has forfeited his claim\n\nthat    the   district   court    erred   in   applying   the   crack   cocaine\n\nSentencing Guidelines, and that review therefore should be only for\n\nplain error.     See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); see also Olano, 507 U.S.\n\nat 732-35.      The government notes that Tejeda failed to object to\n\nthe district court's limiting of the verdict slip to refer only to\n\n\"cocaine base\" and not \"crack.\"           Nor did he object to the district\n\ncourt's statement at the charge conference that it would decide the\n\ncrack issue in a jury-waived proceeding, or the district court's\n\ninstruction to the jury, which equated crack with cocaine base.\n\nThe    prosecution    argues     that   Tejeda's   presentencing   motion   to\n\npreclude application of the crack Guidelines was insufficient to\n\npreserve the claim because it was at that time too late to present\n\nthe issue to the jury.      See United States v. Pacheco, 434 F.3d 106,\n\n115 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              We bypass the question of forfeiture because even if\n\nTejeda preserved his claim, it fails on the merits.                 As Tejeda\n\nconceded before the district court, our decision in United States\n\nv. Medina, 427 F.3d 88 (1st Cir. 2005), forecloses any argument\n\nthat as a general matter the government must prove to the jury\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the cocaine base at issue is crack\n\ncocaine.      In Medina, the defendant was convicted of, inter alia,\n\npossession with intent to distribute over fifty grams of cocaine\n\nbase.    Id. at 90.      On appeal, Medina argued that the trial court\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fhad erred in not instructing the jury that the government was\n\nrequired to prove that the cocaine base he possessed was crack\n\ncocaine.7   Id. at 92.   This court held that \"the government is not\n\nrequired to prove that the substance involved in a given case is\n\ncrack in order to secure a conviction under\" 21 U.S.C. § 841, the\n\nstatute specifying the substantive offense that was the object of\n\nthe conspiracy for which Tejeda was convicted.     Id.   The fact that\n\nthe cocaine base was crack was \"only relevant to the court at\n\nsentencing.\"     Id. at 92 n.3.     Moreover, in United States v.\n\nO'Brien, 435 F.3d 36 (1st Cir. 2006), we held that, as long as the\n\nstatutory maximum is not affected, a sentencing judge is permitted\n\nto determine by a preponderance of the evidence the factual basis\n\nfor a sentencing enhancement.    Id. at 41.   Such was the case here.\n\nThere was no error in the district court's determining that the\n\ncocaine base at issue in this case was crack.8\n\n            Tejeda argues that the sentencing court was not permitted\n\nto make the crack determination in his case because it was the law\n\nof the case that all sentencing enhancements be proved to the jury\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.      This argument is without merit.    At\n\n\n\n     7\n          The issue in Medina was different. Medina argued that\nthe jury instruction was error because the statute at issue, 21\nU.S.C. § 841, regulated only possession of crack, not cocaine base\nmore generally. 427 F.3d at 92.\n     8\n          Tejeda does not dispute that there was sufficient\nevidence presented at trial to conclude that the drugs at issue\nwere crack.\n\n                                 -27-\n\ftimes the court did state that it would require the government to\n\nprove sentencing enhancements to the jury beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt; but it also determined that whether the cocaine base at\n\nissue    was    crack   cocaine   would   be   decided   in   a   jury-waived\n\nproceeding, and it further decided at sentencing that it was\n\npermitted to make the determination that the cocaine base was\n\ncrack.   The court was not prohibited from revising its position on\n\nproof of sentencing enhancements to the jury.                 See Harlow v.\n\nChildren's Hosp., 432 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[L]aw of the\n\ncase permits a lower court to review prior interlocutory orders as\n\nlong as that review is not an abuse of discretion.\"); Fiori v.\n\nTruck Drivers, Local 170, 354 F.3d 84, 90 (1st Cir. 2004) (stating\n\nthat law of the case doctrine does not bar the district court from\n\nrevising a prior ruling, as long as prejudice does not result).\n\n               Tejeda argues that he was prejudiced by the district\n\ncourt's change of position because (1) the court never conducted a\n\njury-waived proceeding to determine whether the cocaine base at\n\nissue was crack cocaine and (2) the court had promised this\n\njury-waived proceeding, and as a result, the trial record, on which\n\nthe district court relied in determining that the cocaine base was\n\ncrack, was underdeveloped with respect to the crack issue.\n\n               Tejeda is correct that the district court repeatedly\n\nstated that the government would not be able to seek a sentencing\n\nenhancement for crack unless it had pled and proved the issue to\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\fthe jury.     It is possible that the court's about-face at the\n\nsentencing disposition9 might have constituted \"unfair surprise.\"\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Moody, 903 F.2d 321, 331 (5th Cir.\n\n1990) (\"There is also an element of unfair surprise in the court's\n\nbelated reversal concerning Bauman's testimony. . . . By reversing\n\nits earlier ruling, . . . the district court was obliged to provide\n\nMoody an opportunity for surrebuttal, assuming of course that the\n\ndefense could proffer evidence to parry the expanded government\n\ncase.\")     It would have been better for the court here to have\n\nexplicitly   informed   the   parties    of   its   ruling   that   it   could\n\ndetermine the crack enhancement in the absence of a jury verdict\n\nand allowed the parties to submit factual evidence with regards to\n\nthe enhancement.\n\n\n     9\n          The district court did in fact conduct a jury-waived\nproceeding on the crack issue on September 22, 2005.       At that\nproceeding, Tejeda offered an expert to testify to the difference\nbetween crack and other forms of cocaine base.        However, the\nparties all agreed that crack was merely one form of cocaine base,\nand there was no factual dispute as to whether crack and cocaine\nbase were one and the same. Tejeda also offered his expert to cast\ndoubt that the drugs seized on March 16, 2004 from the car in which\nTejeda had been riding were crack. He proffered that his expert\nwould testify that while the DEA had concluded that a different\ndrug sample -- seized from co-conspirator Custer's home -- was\ncrack, the DEA had not concluded that the drugs linked to Tejeda\nwere crack. This was an inaccurate characterization of the DEA's\nconclusions, as the prosecution pointed out.       The parties had\nstipulated that the DEA had concluded that both tested samples\ncontained cocaine base. The DEA had made no finding as to whether\neither sample contained crack cocaine.      As a result, Tejeda's\nexpert's testimony would not have been informative on any factual\ndispute. The district court solicited additional briefs from the\nparties and stated that if necessary, it would convene an\nevidentiary hearing at some point in the future.\n\n                                  -29-\n\f            The evidence that Tejeda states he would have offered,\n\nhowever, would not have precluded the court from finding that the\n\ncrack Guidelines were applicable.                Prior to sentencing, Tejeda\n\nsubmitted a brief to the district court in which he claimed -- in\n\na footnote -- as he does now, that the DEA's test results showed\n\nthat the drug sample linked to Tejeda had not tested positive for\n\nsodium bicarbonate, a \"signature ingredient\" of crack.                Tejeda did\n\nnot purport to have performed any independent tests of the drug\n\nsample connected to him, but rather relied solely on the DEA's\n\nanalysis.    Tejeda attached to his brief the DEA's work papers and\n\ntest results.    As a result, at the point it made its determination\n\nthat the drugs at issue in the case were crack, the district court\n\nhad before it the very results on which Tejeda's expert would have\n\noffered testimony.       Moreover, even if Tejeda is correct that the\n\nparticular   sample      tested     by   the    DEA   did   not   contain    sodium\n\nbicarbonate, there nonetheless was ample evidence at trial for the\n\ndistrict    court   to    conclude       that   the    drugs   involved     in    the\n\nconspiracy were crack.         Three law enforcement officers testified,\n\nbased on visual observation, that the drugs seized from the car on\n\nMarch 16 were crack, and Eldridge and Figueroa both testified that\n\nthe drugs regularly purchased from Tejeda were crack.                 See United\n\nStates v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Proof based\n\non scientific analysis or expert testimony is not required to prove\n\nthe   illicit   nature    of    a   substance,        and   identification       of   a\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fsubstance as a drug may be based on the opinion of a knowledgeable\n\nlay person.\").     The identity of the drugs that Tejeda dealt does\n\nnot hinge on this one sample.\n\n            As to Tejeda's second argument, it is unpersuasive for\n\nTejeda to suggest that he would have presented an expert at trial\n\nhad   he   known   what   would   be    the   nature   of   the   jury-waived\n\nproceeding.     Tejeda did attempt to have his expert testify at\n\ntrial.     In his proffer Tejeda indicated that the expert would\n\ntestify about the difference between cocaine base and crack cocaine\n\nand the difficulty of telling the two apart visually. The district\n\ncourt, however, refused to allow the expert to testify because the\n\nrequest was not timely,10 and because, the court concluded, the\n\ntestimony would confuse the jury.         The court did say at the time it\n\nprecluded the expert from testifying that it would hear the expert\n\nat the time of sentencing.        But this was not the reason that the\n\nexpert was precluded from testifying at trial.11\n\n            The jury was not required to find that the cocaine base\n\npossessed by Tejeda was crack.          The district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion when it revised its position on proof of sentencing\n\n\n\n      10\n            Tejeda conceded this in the district court.\n      11\n          Tejeda also refers to thwarted attempts to cross-examine\nthe government's witnesses about the differences between crack and\ncocaine base.   Tejeda was precluded from questioning government\nwitnesses about the chemical differences between crack and other\ntypes of cocaine base because the witnesses in question were not\nchemists and were not qualified to testify on the subject.\n\n                                       -31-\n\fenhancements.      Tejeda was not prejudiced by the district court's\n\nrevision of its prior ruling.\n\n            Finally, Tejeda argues that the district court's deciding\n\nthat the crack cocaine Guidelines applied violated his protection\n\nagainst   double    jeopardy   and   his    due   process   rights.      Tejeda\n\nessentially argues that the government failed to prove at trial\n\nthat the drugs were crack, and that he should not have been forced\n\nat sentencing to once again mount a defense to such a charge.\n\nThere was no error in the district court's application of the crack\n\ncocaine Guidelines, much less a due process violation.                Likewise,\n\ndouble jeopardy principles are inapplicable here.            Double jeopardy\n\nconcerns arise only when a jury verdict or a trial court's ruling,\n\n\"whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or\n\nnot, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense\n\ncharged.\"    Pacheco, 434 F.3d at 112 (quoting United States v.\n\nMartin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 571 (1977)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).       There was no such trial court ruling\n\nhere.   Whether or not the cocaine base at issue was crack is not a\n\nfactual element of the offense charged.           Medina, 427 F.3d at 92 &\n\nn.3.\n\nB.          Reasonableness of Tejeda's Sentence\n\n            Tejeda argues that his sentence is unreasonable as a\n\nmatter of law.     See United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514,\n\n519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).             He argues that the nature and\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\fcircumstances      of     his     offense,       his    personal     history    and\n\ncharacteristics,        his   potential      for    rehabilitation,       sentences\n\nimposed by other federal courts, and the sentences imposed on his\n\nco-defendants all weigh in favor of his receiving the mandatory\n\nminimum sentence of 120 months. Tejeda's counsel made all of these\n\narguments to the district court at his sentencing hearing.\n\n             The district court explained its reasons for imposing a\n\ntwenty-year sentence.         It discussed the fact that Tejeda was \"the\n\nsupplier in a massive [crack] distribution ring\" and stated that\n\n\"crack cocaine is one of the most addictive, dangerous substances\n\nknown to our society.\"          The court stated that its sentence took\n\nrehabilitation into account, although the court did not think\n\nrehabilitation particularly likely,12 and it referred to Tejeda's\n\nfamily circumstances, concluding that while they were tragic, they\n\nhad   been   caused     by    Tejeda.      The     court   further    stated   that\n\ncomparison to the average sentence imposed by other courts for the\n\noffense in question was not necessarily instructive since that\n\naverage    did   not    account    for    factors      such   as   drug   quantity.\n\nFinally, we note that \"[a]lthough a district court may consider\n\ndisparities among co-defendants in determining a sentence, [a\n\n      12\n           We disagree with Tejeda's assertion that the district\ncourt did not consider his particular potential for rehabilitation.\nThe   court   stated  that   the   sentence   did  not   \"emphasize\nrehabilitation due to the nature of the offense.\" We understand\nthis to mean that given the particulars of Tejeda's offense, not\ndrug offenses in general, the court did not think rehabilitation\nparticularly likely.\n\n                                         -33-\n\fdefendant's] sentence [is not] unreasonable simply because his\n\nco-defendants agreed to help the government in exchange for reduced\n\nsentences.\"   United States v. Vázquez-Rivera, 470 F.3d 443, 449\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).   Tejeda's sentence is not unreasonable.\n\n          Tejeda's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -34-\n\f",

Tejeda was a New York supplier of drugs for a Cape Cod drug ring. This criminal appeal attacks both Tejeda's conviction and the sentence imposed. The attack on the conviction is based largely on an incident in the courtroom in which a spectator made a throat-slitting gesture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four of Tejeda's co-conspirators pled guilty, and two, Amanda Eldridge and Desiree Alves, testified against him. Tejeda and a co-conspirator, Carmen Figueroa, went to trial; she testified, he did not. Both were convicted. Tejeda was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment, five years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to his conviction, Tejeda does not attack the sufficiency of the evidence. The evidence against him was extremely strong, a point discussed later. He does argue that the trial court committed two errors that deprived him of a fair trial and require his conviction be set aside. The first claim of error is that the court should have granted a mistrial when an older man sitting in the gallery of the courtroom on the first day of trial (and later possibly connected to defendant by the evidence) made a throat-slitting gesture. That gesture was seen by two jurors and discussed by them with other jurors. The second trial error alleged was that the court erred in not severing Tejeda's trial from co-defendant Figueroa's or bifurcating the trial so as to isolate the case against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda also attacks his sentence on the grounds that the district court erroneously relied on the Guidelines applicable to crack cocaine offenses and that the sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acknowledging the able advocacy on both sides, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts in evidence at the trial fairly establish the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From January 2003 through March 2004, Tejeda supplied crack cocaine to a drug distribution ring operating in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Tejeda was based in New York; his address, ironically, was 1234 Boston Road, in the Bronx. The Cape Cod ring was headed by Manuel Mendes, a co-defendant, who operated the ring while imprisoned at the Plymouth County House of Correction. That imprisonment limited Mendes in his mobility and in his command operations, but it did not stop him. Mendes operated the drug ring by giving instructions to co-defendant Figueroa, and sometimes to co-defendant Alves, both of whom he was permitted to telephone. Figueroa, in turn, contacted Tejeda and the other conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Mendes' instructions, testifying co-conspirator Amanda Eldridge drove to New York in January 2003, along with Carmen Figueroa and Desiree Alves, to pick up crack from Tejeda. Eldridge already knew Tejeda from prior drug transactions. She identified Tejeda in court and had done so in an earlier photo array. Eldridge testified that in New York she met with Tejeda alone in a red van, picked up the drugs, and returned to Cape Cod. Eldridge's testimony was corroborated by Alves, who testified that these drug trips to New York took place about every two weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eldridge testified that, under Mendes' direction, she made the trip to New York to pick up drugs from Tejeda every week or so for a four-month period. Eldridge then drove back to Cape Cod and gave the drugs to either Alves or Figueroa. Each time, Tejeda gave Eldridge disk-shaped packages containing crack cocaine. Eldridge also identified Tejeda's voice in a call recorded by the government. The recording captured Tejeda and Figueroa arranging a drug transaction for February 17, 2004 in New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The February 17, 2004 transaction went off as planned, as was established by the testimony of Alves and two drug enforcement officers who witnessed the event. Co-defendant Christopher Custer was the courier this time. Alves did not go on the trip, but she did give Custer the money to purchase the drugs the night before, and she received the drugs at her home in Yarmouth from Custer when he returned from his successful trip to New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DEA had established surveillance over Tejeda's home in the Bronx and observed Custer's arrival and actions on February 17. Tejeda left his home and entered the red van. A short while later, Custer arrived, parked behind the van, and entered the van. Photographs of Tejeda at the scene of the February 17 deal were admitted into evidence at trial. Within approximately five minutes, Custer got back into his car and left. He was tracked by police as he drove back to Cape Cod and was seen entering Alves' home with a black bag and emerging without it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police made arrests immediately after observing another drug deal, this one on March 16, 2004. Custer, after again obtaining money on Cape Cod to pay for the crack, went to New York. Agents saw Tejeda leave the Boston Road address in the Bronx. Tejeda then got in a car, and police tracked the car to Manhattan. In Manhattan, an agent observed Custer on the same street as the car carrying Tejeda. A short time later, after losing sight of Custer, the agent saw Tejeda get out of the front passenger seat of the car, and Custer get out of the back passenger seat and into the front passenger seat of the car. The police thereafter stopped the car; in it were two disk-like objects, which later tested positive for cocaine base. That evening Tejeda was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case rested primarily on this evidence, and not on the testimony of the non-pleading co-defendant, Figueroa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Trial Error Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Throat-Slitting Gesture and Fair Trial Rights</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Facts And Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of the third day of trial, Friday, May 6, 2005, the government's witness was Lt. Balcom. During questioning, Lt. Balcom indicated that on one occasion he had observed some of the individuals in the courtroom in the red van. At the prosecutor's request, Lt. Balcom pointed out these people in the courtroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the morning break, a juror reported privately to the court that she and another juror had seen one of the individuals identified by Lt. Balcom make a throat-slitting gesture on the second day of trial, Wednesday, May 4. After the break and outside of the presence of the jury, the court inquired and was told by defense counsel that the man in question was Tejeda's grandfather. The jury was never informed of this fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court reported to counsel, outside the presence of the jury, that a juror had stated that she had observed Tejeda's grandfather making a throat-slitting gesture. The court then ordered the gesturer and his wife to leave the courthouse and barred them from the courthouse and the surrounding vicinity. At least some members of the jury were later informed of the court's order. On the record, the court described the man barred from the courtroom as an \"obviously frail appearing, old man.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda and Figueroa both moved for mistrial. When the court discussed holding voir dire of the two jurors who reportedly had seen the gesture, Tejeda's counsel expressed concern that the proposed voir dire would only heighten the issue for the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before starting the trial again that Friday, the court said to the jurors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A matter has been conveyed to . . . me and I have taken care of it completely. Put it out of your mind. It has nothing to do with this case. Have in mind, while the report is fully appropriate, indeed we want such a report, do not discuss the case among yourselves, the case now, in the jury room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda did not object to the instruction, and the trial continued for the day. Later, several of the jurors, on query, said that the jury had complied with this instruction. Assuming that to be true, any discussion amongst the jurors occurred before the court dealt with the report of the gesture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Sunday, May 8, Tejeda submitted a written mistrial motion. On Monday, May 9, the court denied the motion but told the parties it would grant their request to voir dire the juror who had reported the gesture, Juror 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then individually questioned Juror 11. She said that she was concerned about the gesture but did not report it on the day she saw it. It was only after she heard the testimony of Lt. Balcom identifying the spectator as having been at the red van that she started to feel uncomfortable about what she had seen the spectator do two days earlier. After hearing Lt. Balcom's testimony on Friday morning, she reported the gesture to several of the other jurors, some of whom told her she should disclose it to the court, and so she did. The court had earlier instructed the jurors not to discuss the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked whether she had linked the individual making the gesture to any particular party in the case, Juror 11 answered that she didn't know whether the older gentleman and the lady who had been sitting with him had anything to do with a particular person or side. The juror stated that all she knew was that Lt. Balcom had testified to seeing one of them in the red van. While she recognized the public nature of the courtroom setting, she was concerned that people in the courtroom could know the names of the jurors. The court asked whether she could put the incident out of her mind when evaluating the case and be fair to all parties. She answered affirmatively, and the court, observing her, found her to be forthcoming. Tejeda again moved for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then questioned Juror 6, who also had seen the gesture. Juror 6 described the gesture as odd and a strange thing to do in the middle of a court proceeding but did not think there was anything to it. She said that it was unclear to her toward whom the gesture was directed. Juror 6, like Juror 11, answered in the affirmative as to her ability to be fair and impartial. The court then denied the motion for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of Tejeda's counsel, on the fifth day of trial, Tuesday, May 10, 2005, the court conducted a voir dire of the remaining jurors. None of the other jurors had seen the incident; all but one said that they had heard of it from Jurors 11 and/or 6. The jurors reported that they did not discuss the incident other than on the Friday morning before it was reported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each juror was asked whether he or she could be fair and impartial, and every one responded in the affirmative. While several of the jurors indicated that they thought the gesture was inappropriate, no juror expressed fear for his or her safety. Two jurors reported that the gesture had been unsettling or disconcerting for the jurors who had seen it. One juror stated that the reported gesture put pressure on the jury, but that the remedial action taken by the court had been appropriate. Another juror stated that there could be safety concerns, but after hearing of the court's order barring the gesturer from the courthouse, she stated that she was satisfied with her own safety. One juror reported that he knew nothing of the gesture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the voir dire of the entire jury, Tejeda renewed his motion for a mistrial and also requested that the jury foreperson, Juror 11, be deemed an alternate so she would not participate in the jury deliberation. These motions were ultimately denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict of conviction. Thereafter, Tejeda filed a motion for new trial based on, inter alia, the throat-slitting incident. At that time, Tejeda did not argue that the purported error was a structural one, or that the court was required to apply a presumption of prejudice to the gesture. The court denied the new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Appropriate Analytical Framework</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Structural Error</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda argues that it is clear that the jury here was not impartial, despite the trial judge's finding to the contrary and the jurors' individual declarations that the incident did not render any of them unable to remain impartial in reaching a verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda leaps from this purported factual certainty to an argument, presented for the first time on appeal, that this issue must be analyzed as structural error. Tejeda would like this to be so because in structural error cases the defendant is entitled to automatic reversal. We reject Tejeda's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Structural error analysis has been constricted in its use to a limited category of claimed errors, none of which fits this case. The Supreme Court has held that it is structural error for a criminal defendant to be tried before a <i>judge</i> who has a financial interest in convicting him. <i>Tumey v. Ohio,</i> 273 U.S. 510, 523, 535, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927). Tejeda infers from <i>Tumey</i> that his claim that a <i>juror</i> is biased must also be analyzed as a structural error. This is not a situation in which one or more jurors has a financial interest in convicting the defendant. We reject Tejeda's argument. The law is clear both that this is not the stuff of structural error and that Tejeda's jury bias claim is subject to a different standard of review. On review, the appellate court asks whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a mistrial. That standard gives deference to the trial judge, who is in the best position to evaluate the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mere error in the trial process itself is not structural error. <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___- ___, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 2563-64, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006). Structural errors are reserved for cases where criminal defendants are denied basic protections which \"necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair\" such that \"no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\" <i>Neder v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 1, 8-9, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (quoting <i>Rose v. Clark,</i> 478 U.S. 570, 577-78, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Tejeda's claim of juror bias is not within this very limited class of cases. <i>See United States v. Mackey,</i> 114 F.3d 470, 474 (4th Cir.1997) (juror bias and misconduct claims are not structural errors).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>The</i> Remmer <i>Presumption of Prejudice</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Tejeda also argues for the first time<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> that he is entitled to a presumption of prejudice under <i>Remmer v. United States,</i> 347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954). We hold that the <i>Remmer</i> presumption does not apply here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Remmer,</i> the defendant learned after his conviction that a third party had attempted to bribe a juror to get a verdict favorable to the defendant, and he moved for a new trial. <i>Id.</i> at 228, 74 S.Ct. 450. The court had not informed defense counsel of the bribe, but had initiated an investigation of the bribe and had held an ex parte meeting with the prosecution. <i>Id.</i> The defendant's motion for new trial was denied. <i>Id.</i> at 229, 74 S.Ct. 450. The Supreme Court held that Remmer was not entitled to an automatic reversal, but rather to a hearing before the trial court, and that the jury tampering would be presumed to be prejudicial. <i>Id.</i> at 229-30, 74 S.Ct. 450.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an ongoing debate in the circuits about the limits on and the ongoing vitality of the presumption of prejudice rule announced in <i>Remmer. Compare United States v. Pennell,</i> 737 F.2d 521, 532-33 (6th Cir.1984) (presumption of prejudice no longer exists), <i>with United States v. Sylvester,</i> 143 F.3d 923, 934 (5th Cir. 1998) (proper inquiry is whether likelihood of prejudice is high enough to assign to the government the burden of proving harmlessness), <i>United States v.

Dutkel,</i> 192 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir.1999) (\"[A] presumption of prejudice arises if a juror was subjected to coercion or bribery, and if this intrusion may have affected the juror in the exercise of his judgment.\"), <i>United States v.

Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 737-39, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), and <i>Smith v. Phillips,</i> 455 U.S. 209, 215-17, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982), narrowed the broad language in <i>Remmer.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has already rejected defendant's argument that the <i>Remmer</i> presumption applies to all claims of juror bias resulting from extraneous contacts. <i>See, e.g., Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d at 288-89; <i>United States v. Gomes,</i> 177 F.3d 76, 82-83 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d 230, 260-62 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We employed the presumption of prejudice in <i>United States v. Gaston-Brito,</i> 64 F.3d 11 (1st Cir.1995), where a trial court summarily denied, without conducting any inquiry, a motion for mistrial made before the verdict. <i>Id.</i> at 13. We did so in the context of holding that a trial court is obligated to \"conduct a sufficient inquiry to determine whether the communication was harmless.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 972 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Tejeda relies on <i>Gaston-Brito</i> to argue that given \"the jurors' expressions of fear and concern . . ., it [was] error to find that . . . Tejeda was not prejudiced by the throat-slitting gesture.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Gaston-Brito</i> is inapposite. In <i>Gaston-Brito,</i> a cooperating witness was asked to identify the person who had threatened to kill his daughter if his wife did not turn over drug proceeds. A case agent seated at the prosecution table pointed to the defense table, possibly indicating to the jury that the defendants had made the threat, although <i>no evidence</i> established that. <i>Id.</i> at 12. The gesture at issue here is of a completely different nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other distinctions. As <i>Gaston-Brito</i> noted, the government created the problem there when a case agent for the prosecution made an inappropriate gesture conveying substantive evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 13. Since the jury could well think that the agent had inside information, there was a risk the jurors would consider the information during deliberations. <i>Id.</i> The court in <i>Gaston-Brito</i> said it was applying a heightened standard when the prosecution was responsible for improper ex parte conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i> Here, the gesture did not come from the prosecution and was not an effort to put evidence in front of the jury. We add that there are different considerations at play when a defendant attempts to vacate a conviction, in the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt, on the basis that someone associated with the defense made an improper gesture to the jury. For example, we would not want to create an incentive for such gesturing by individuals associated with defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Merits Analysis</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our usual standard of review once the trial judge has made an appropriate inquiry, and the one that we utilize here, is an abuse of discretion standard, which recognizes that the district court \"has wide discretion in deciding how to handle and how to respond to allegations of juror bias and misconduct that arise during a trial.\" <i>United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Ortiz,</i> 455 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also United States v. Mikutowicz,</i> 365 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d at 286-87. We review the district court's factual findings for clear error. <i>Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d at 291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a colorable claim of jury taint surfaces before jury deliberations occur, our law describes the sequence of steps a trial judge should take. <i>See id.</i> at 289. The judge should investigate the allegation promptly, addressing whether the taint-producing event occurred, and if so, assessing the magnitude and extent of any prejudice caused. <i>Id.</i> The trial court has wide discretion in how it goes about this inquiry. <i>Id.</i> at 290. The district court, if faced with the issue initially post-verdict, may convene an evidentiary hearing, but it is not obligated to do so. <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 258.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court determines that there is a taint-producing event and a significant potential for prejudice, the trial court should then examine whether prophylactic measures will alleviate the prejudice (and if so, take them), or whether the threat can otherwise be dispelled or disproved. <i>Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d at 289. The court may determine that no curative measures will suffice and grant a timely motion for a mistrial. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the court followed every step in the procedure. There is no realistic objection to the process it used. Rather, Tejeda's attack is on the court's conclusion that any potential prejudice had been adequately addressed. The court did not apply an incorrect legal standard, so we review its conclusion for abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case involves (1) a risk of a perception by a juror of an implicit threat from someone who might, in the juror's view, be associated with the defendant; and (2) the risk that this \"threat\" might influence the juror's ability to impartially evaluate the evidence. These risks are weighed against the individual jurors' own statements that they were not so influenced and the trial judge's findings of fact that the jurors could fairly and impartially reach a verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The risks in this case are considerably weaker than those posed by the facts in <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Ortiz,</i> where we upheld a district court's denial of mistrial. 455 F.3d at 23-24. There, a juror reported he had received an explicit death threat related to the case. <i>Id.</i> at 24. On inquiry, the juror said he could remain impartial, and the court concluded he could do so. <i>Id.</i> Other circuits have likewise affirmed the denial of a mistrial when a juror was threatened but assured the court that he could remain impartial in deciding the case. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Simmons,</i> No. 99-50381, 2000 WL 429704, at *1-2 (9th Cir. Apr. 20, 2000) (unpublished table decision) (mem.) (affirming denial of mistrial when spectator made gestures during closing arguments that made some jurors feel threatened); <i>Leisher v. Conrad,</i> 41 F.3d 753, 754-55 (D.C.Cir.1994) (affirming denial of mistrial when two jurors misinterpreted as menacing a gesture made by defendant outside of courtroom); <i>United States v. Garner,</i> No. 90-5613, 1991 WL 150788, at *2, 3 (6th Cir. Aug.6, 1991) (unpublished table decision) (per curiam) (affirming denial of mistrial when juror was threatened by men presumed to be affiliated with defendant who made noise like a gunshot outside the courtroom); <i>United States v. Zelinka,</i> 862 F.2d 92, 93, 94-96 (6th Cir. 1988) (affirming denial of mistrial when spectator who appeared to be associated with defendant made statement that it would be too bad if the elevator the jurors were boarding should crash, causing fear on the part of some of the jurors).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda argues that more than a single juror is involved, which increases the risk of taint. This, he says, necessarily requires a different result from that reached in <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Ortiz.</i> It does not. The implicit threat, while serious, was of a different nature than the direct threat in <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Ortiz.</i> Further, it is unclear here to whom the gesture was intended, and here there was a possible, but not direct, association between the threat and the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, the district court did not ignore the risk that one or more of the jurors could perceive this gesture as a threat or that a threat might impair impartiality. First, the court took immediate remedial action. The court had the spectator who was the source of the \"threat\" removed from the courtroom and informed the jurors not to be concerned. The elderly spectator was no longer present when the evidence connecting the red van to the defendant became stronger at trial, and at least some of the jurors were informed that the spectator was not permitted to be in the vicinity of the courthouse. Second, the court queried each juror about whether the throat-slitting gesture would render him or her unable to impartially evaluate the evidence. The court observed the demeanor of each juror and concluded that each could be impartial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the court leave the incident for further conversation and musings among the jurors. The court instructed them not to discuss it, and, those who were later questioned said the jurors had complied with that instruction. Normally, if jurors say they have followed instructions, their statements are credited. <i>Cf. Penry v. Johnson,</i> 532 U.S. 782, 799, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001); <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 263.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, of course, extreme cases in which jurors' responses will not be credited. <i>See Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 135-36, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) (\"[T]here are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored. Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extra-judicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial.\" (citations omitted)). This is the argument that Tejeda makes&#8212; that the incident was so strongly and indelibly harmful that no instruction and no voir dire could cure it. Tejeda adds that the jurors' voir dire responses demonstrated that they would not be able to disregard the gesture in reaching a decision in the case. We disagree for the reasons stated above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in its handling of the throat-slitting gesture. Rather, it responded sensitively and correctly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Severance and Bifurcation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review of trial court decisions to sever trials of criminal co-defendants is for manifest abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. DeLeon,</i> 187 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 246. Ordinarily, criminal co-defendants are to be tried together. <i>United States v. Houle,</i> 237 F.3d 71, 75-76 (1st Cir.2001). This rule has particular resonance in drug conspiracy cases, where multiple defendants often share a single indictment. <i>See United States v. Soto-Ben&#237;quez,</i> 356 F.3d 1, 29 (1st Cir.2003). Tejeda bears the burden of making \"a strong showing of prejudice\" in order to gain a new trial. <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 246 (quoting <i>United States v. Porter,</i> 764 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda twice moved to sever his trial from that of his co-defendants. He did so as to all co-defendants by motion before trial. Later, on the first day of trial, he orally moved to sever his trial from that of co-defendant Figueroa, after he learned that Figueroa would testify and present a battered woman defense as to her relationship with Mendes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Her testimony would be that Mendes regularly beat her. Her proffer indicated that she would not implicate Tejeda in the abuse she suffered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the only issue has to do with the motions to sever the case against Figueroa. Tejeda's severance motion argued that it was likely that Figueroa would take the stand and admit her involvement in the conspiracy, but present a case of duress because she had been under the influence of Mendes, who had pled guilty. The court denied the motion for severance saying Tejeda could cross-examine Figueroa, and that no inconsistent defenses were involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 12, 2005, Tejeda proposed to the trial court that it bifurcate the trial, differentiating the evidence applicable to his case and to Figueroa's. Specifically, Tejeda proposed that he put on his case, the prosecution put on its rebuttal, then the jury decide on Tejeda's guilt or innocence alone. Thereafter, Figueroa would present her defense, the prosecution its rebuttal, and the jury would then render its verdict as to Figueroa. The court denied Tejeda's motion. The motion was renewed at the close of the prosecution's case-in-chief and again denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution questions whether the severance motion on the day of trial and the bifurcation motion<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> were timely. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(D) (severance motions must be made before trial). We bypass the question and rule on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Severance should be granted where \"defenses are so <i>irreconcilable</i> as to involve fundamental disagreement over <i>core and basic facts.</i>\" <i>United States v. Pe&#241;a-Lora,</i> 225 F.3d 17, 34 (1st Cir.2000) (quoting <i>United States v. Paradis,</i> 802 F.2d 553, 561 (1st Cir.1986) (emphases added)) (internal quotation marks omitted). But where there is merely some dissonance, where the defenses are just \"somewhat antagonistic,\" we will usually not reverse a trial court's denial of severance. <i>United States v. Serafino,</i> 281 F.3d 327, 329 (1st Cir.2002). Tejeda relies on <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 478 F.2d 1129 (5th Cir.1973), to argue that severance was necessary in this case. But in <i>Johnson,</i> the co-defendants' theories of defense were truly antagonistic. While Johnson defended on the basis that he was not present when the charged crime was committed, his co-defendant made a confession explicitly and necessarily incriminating Johnson and defended only on the basis that he lacked the necessary mens rea. <i>Id.</i> at 1131-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, by contrast, there was no true antagonism of defenses. Tejeda's defense explicitly acknowledged there was a drug conspiracy; he simply argued the prosecution could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the New York source of drugs for the conspiracy. Thus, Figueroa's defense that there was a drug conspiracy, but that she had acted under duress, was not an antagonistic defense at all. Her defense did not in any way hinge on Tejeda's participation in the conspiracy. Indeed, even if the jury accepted her duress defense it could either accept or reject Tejeda's defense. Severance is not required every time a duress defense is asserted by one defendant. <i>Pe&#241;a-Lora,</i> 225 F.3d at 34; <i>United States v. Arias-Villanueva,</i> 998 F.2d 1491, 1507 (9th Cir.1993), <i>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Jimenez-Ortega,</i> 472 F.3d 1102, 1102-04 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Tejeda had shown that severance from Figueroa was appropriate in this drug conspiracy case, it was his burden to show prejudice. <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 246; <i>Porter,</i> 764 F.2d at 12. \"[P]rejudice means more than just a better chance of acquittal at a separate trial.\" <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 246 (quoting <i>United States v. Martinez,</i> 479 F.2d 824, 828 (1st Cir.1973)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Garden variety\" prejudice, which always exists when more than one defendant or offense are tried together, does not warrant a new trial. <i>Id.</i> Tejeda has not met his burden here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda's real argument is not one of antagonism. It is that Figueroa's testimony about being regularly beaten by her boyfriend Mendes, the head of the conspiracy, would spill over to Tejeda, who was accused of conspiring with Mendes in drug distribution. This is a sort of argument that \"you are known by the friends you keep,\" and bad friends will taint you in the jury's eyes. It is almost inherent in drug conspiracy cases that a co-conspirator may have engaged in other types of blameworthy conduct. That is not enough to warrant severance of co-defendants' trials. While Mendes' treatment of Figueroa may have been more shocking than run-of-the-mill blameworthy conduct from drug co-conspirators, Tejeda's role in the conspiracy&#8212;as a geographically-removed supplier several states distant&#8212;lessened the risk that the jurors might ascribe Mendes' conduct to him. Moreover, the trial judge instructed the jury that evidence of Mendes' mistreatment of Figueroa was not to be considered in the case against Tejeda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa did identify Tejeda in court as the drug ring's New York source of supply. She also testified about numerous trips to New York to pick up drugs. But all of this testimony, including the identification, was cumulative of Eldridge's testimony. There was more than sufficient evidence against Tejeda without Figueroa's identification. In any event, Figueroa's testimony regarding Tejeda was admissible against Tejeda regardless of whether the trials were severed. Further, Tejeda was permitted to cross-examine Figueroa at trial, minimizing any thought of misconduct by association.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the severance motion. Nor was there any abuse of discretion in the denial of the bifurcation procedure. Such a procedure risked confusion of the jury and unwarranted singling out of the case against Tejeda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that we have found no error in the district court's handling of the throat-slitting gesture or the severance and bifurcation motions, Tejeda's cumulative error claim is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Sentencing Claims</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Application of Crack Cocaine Guidelines</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo sentencing issues involving questions of law. <i>United States v. McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d 522, 535 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Tejeda has forfeited his claim that the district court erred in applying the crack cocaine Sentencing Guidelines, and that review therefore should be only for plain error. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <i>see also Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770. The government notes that Tejeda failed to object to the district court's limiting of the verdict slip to refer only to \"cocaine base\" and not \"crack.\" Nor did he object to the district court's statement at the charge conference that it would decide the crack issue in a jury-waived proceeding, or the district court's instruction to the jury, which equated crack with cocaine base. The prosecution argues that Tejeda's presentencing motion to preclude application of the crack Guidelines was insufficient to preserve the claim because it was at that time too late to present the issue to the jury. <i>See United States v. Pacheco,</i> 434 F.3d 106, 115 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bypass the question of forfeiture because even if Tejeda preserved his claim, it fails on the merits. As Tejeda conceded before the district court, our decision in <i>United States v. Medina,</i> 427 F.3d 88 (1st Cir.2005), forecloses any argument that as a general matter the government must prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the cocaine base at issue is crack cocaine. In <i>Medina,</i> the defendant was convicted of, inter alia, possession with intent to distribute over fifty grams of cocaine base. <i>Id.</i> at 90. On appeal, Medina argued that the trial court had erred in not instructing the jury that the government was required to prove that the cocaine base he possessed was crack cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Id.</i> at 92. This court held that \"the government is not required to prove that the substance involved in a given case is crack in order to secure a conviction under\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841, the statute specifying the substantive offense that was the object of the conspiracy for which Tejeda was convicted. <i>Id.</i> The fact that the cocaine base was crack was \"only relevant to the court at sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 92 n. 3. Moreover, in <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> 435 F.3d 36 (1st Cir.2006), we held that, as long as the statutory maximum is not affected, a sentencing judge is permitted to determine by a preponderance of the evidence the factual basis for a sentencing enhancement. <i>Id.</i> at 41. Such was the case here. There was no error in the district court's determining that the cocaine base at issue in this case was crack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda argues that the sentencing court was not permitted to make the crack determination <i>in his case</i> because it was the law of the case that all sentencing enhancements be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. This argument is without merit. At times the court did state that it would require the government to prove sentencing enhancements to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt; but it also determined that whether the cocaine base at issue was crack cocaine would be decided in a jury-waived proceeding, and it further decided at sentencing that it was permitted to make the determination that the cocaine base was crack. The court was not prohibited from revising its position on proof of sentencing enhancements to the jury. <i>See Harlow v. Children's Hosp.,</i> 432 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[L]aw of the case permits a lower court to review prior interlocutory orders as long as that review is not an abuse of discretion.\"); <i>Fiori v. Truck Drivers, Local 170,</i> 354 F.3d 84, 90 (1st Cir.2004) (stating that law of the case doctrine does not bar the district court from revising a prior ruling, as long as prejudice does not result).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda argues that he was prejudiced by the district court's change of position because (1) the court never conducted a jury-waived proceeding to determine whether the cocaine base at issue was crack cocaine and (2) the court had promised this jury-waived proceeding, and as a result, the trial record, on which the district court relied in determining that the cocaine base was crack, was underdeveloped with respect to the crack issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda is correct that the district court repeatedly stated that the government would not be able to seek a sentencing enhancement for crack unless it had pled and proved the issue to the jury. It is possible that the court's about-face at the sentencing disposition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> might have constituted \"unfair surprise.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. Moody,</i> 903 F.2d 321, 331 (5th Cir.1990) (\"There is also an element of unfair surprise in the court's belated reversal concerning Bauman's testimony. . . . By reversing its earlier ruling, . . . the district court was obliged to provide Moody an opportunity for surrebuttal, assuming of course that the defense could proffer evidence to parry the expanded government case.\") It would have been better for the court here to have explicitly informed the parties of its ruling that it could determine the crack enhancement in the absence of a jury verdict and allowed the parties to submit factual evidence with regards to the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence that Tejeda states he would have offered, however, would not have precluded the court from finding that the crack Guidelines were applicable. Prior to sentencing, Tejeda submitted a brief to the district court in which he claimed&#8212; in a footnote&#8212;as he does now, that the DEA's test results showed that the drug sample linked to Tejeda had not tested positive for sodium bicarbonate, a \"signature ingredient\" of crack. Tejeda did not purport to have performed any independent tests of the drug sample connected to him, but rather relied solely on the DEA's analysis. Tejeda attached to his brief the DEA's work papers and test results. As a result, at the point it made its determination that the drugs at issue in the case were crack, the district court had before it the very results on which Tejeda's expert would have offered testimony. Moreover, even if Tejeda is correct that the particular sample tested by the DEA did not contain sodium bicarbonate, there nonetheless was ample evidence at trial for the district court to conclude that the drugs involved in the conspiracy were crack. Three law enforcement officers testified, based on visual observation, that the drugs seized from the car on March 16 were crack, and Eldridge and Figueroa both testified that the drugs regularly purchased from Tejeda were crack. <i>See United States v. Walters,</i> 904 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Proof based on scientific analysis or expert testimony is not required to prove the illicit nature of a substance, and identification of a substance as a drug may be based on the opinion of a knowledgeable lay person.\"). The identity of the drugs that Tejeda dealt does not hinge on this one sample.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Tejeda's second argument, it is unpersuasive for Tejeda to suggest that he would have presented an expert at trial had he known what would be the nature of the jury-waived proceeding. Tejeda did attempt to have his expert testify at trial. In his proffer Tejeda indicated that the expert would testify about the difference between cocaine base and crack cocaine and the difficulty of telling the two apart visually. The district court, however, refused to allow the expert to testify because the request was not timely,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and because, the court concluded, the testimony would confuse the jury. The court did say at the time it precluded the expert from testifying that it would hear the expert at the time of sentencing. But this was not the reason that the expert was precluded from testifying at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was not required to find that the cocaine base possessed by Tejeda was crack. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it revised its position on proof of sentencing enhancements. Tejeda was not prejudiced by the district court's revision of its prior ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Tejeda argues that the district court's deciding that the crack cocaine Guidelines applied violated his protection against double jeopardy and his due process rights. Tejeda essentially argues that the government failed to prove at trial that the drugs were crack, and that he should not have been forced at sentencing to once again mount a defense to such a charge. There was no error in the district court's application of the crack cocaine Guidelines, much less a due process violation. Likewise, double jeopardy principles are inapplicable here. Double jeopardy concerns arise only when a jury verdict or a trial court's ruling, \"whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\" <i>Pacheco,</i> 434 F.3d at 112 (quoting <i>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.,</i> 430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977)) (internal quotation marks omitted). There was no such trial court ruling here. Whether or not the cocaine base at issue was crack is not a factual element of the offense charged. <i>Medina,</i> 427 F.3d at 92 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Reasonableness of Tejeda's Sentence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda argues that his sentence is unreasonable as a matter of law. <i>See United States v. Jim&#233;nez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). He argues that the nature and circumstances of his offense, his personal history and characteristics, his potential for rehabilitation, sentences imposed by other federal courts, and the sentences imposed on his co-defendants all weigh in favor of his receiving the mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. Tejeda's counsel made all of these arguments to the district court at his sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court explained its reasons for imposing a twenty-year sentence. It discussed the fact that Tejeda was \"the supplier in a massive [crack] distribution ring\" and stated that \"crack cocaine is one of the most addictive, dangerous substances known to our society.\" The court stated that its sentence took rehabilitation into account, although the court did not think rehabilitation particularly likely,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and it referred to Tejeda's family circumstances, concluding that while they were tragic, they had been caused by Tejeda. The court further stated that comparison to the average sentence imposed by other courts for the offense in question was not necessarily instructive since that average did not account for factors such as drug quantity. Finally, we note that \"[a]lthough a district court may consider disparities among co-defendants in determining a sentence, [a defendant's] sentence [is not] unreasonable simply because his co-defendants agreed to help the government in exchange for reduced sentences.\" <i>United States v. V&#225;zquez-Rivera,</i> 470 F.3d 443, 449 (1st Cir.2006).

That presumption is overcome only by a showing that it is probable that (1) responsible jurors will be unable to disregard the evidence, and (2) the evidence likely will have a seriously prejudicial effect on the defendant. <i>Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d at 285.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Figueroa had informed the court and counsel of this defense when she moved on April 27, 2005 to continue the trial so she could prepare such a duress defense.

At that proceeding, Tejeda offered an expert to testify to the difference between crack and other forms of cocaine base. However, the parties all agreed that crack was merely one form of cocaine base, and there was no factual dispute as to whether crack and cocaine base were one and the same. Tejeda also offered his expert to cast doubt that the drugs seized on March 16, 2004 from the car in which Tejeda had been riding were crack. He proffered that his expert would testify that while the DEA had concluded that a different drug sample&#8212; seized from co-conspirator Custer's home&#8212; was crack, the DEA had not concluded that the drugs linked to Tejeda were crack. This was an inaccurate characterization of the DEA's conclusions, as the prosecution pointed out. The parties had stipulated that the DEA had concluded that both tested samples contained cocaine base. The DEA had made no finding as to whether either sample contained crack cocaine. As a result, Tejeda's expert's testimony would not have been informative on any factual dispute. The district court solicited additional briefs from the parties and stated that if necessary, it would convene an evidentiary hearing at some point in the future</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Tejeda conceded this in the district court</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Tejeda also refers to thwarted attempts to cross-examine the government's witnesses about the differences between crack and cocaine base.

He does argue that the trial court committed two errors that deprived him of a fair trial and require his conviction be set aside. The first claim of error is that the court should have granted a mistrial when an older man sitting in the gallery of the courtroom on the first day of trial (and later possibly connected to defendant by the evidence) made a throat-slitting gesture. That gesture was seen by two jurors and discussed by them with other jurors.

Tejeda was based in New York; his address, ironically, was 1234 Boston Road, in the Bronx. The Cape Cod ring was headed by Manuel Mendes, a co-defendant, who operated the ring while imprisoned at the Plymouth County House of Correction. That imprisonment limited Mendes in his mobility and in his command operations, but it did not stop him. Mendes operated the drug ring by giving instructions to co-defendant Figueroa, and sometimes to co-defendant Alves, both of whom he was permitted to telephone. Figueroa, in turn, contacted Tejeda and the other conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Mendes' instructions, testifying co-conspirator Amanda Eldridge drove to New York in January 2003, along with Carmen Figueroa and Desiree Alves, to pick up crack from Tejeda. Eldridge already knew Tejeda from prior drug transactions. She identified Tejeda in court and had done so in an earlier photo array. Eldridge testified that in New York she met with Tejeda alone in a red van, picked up the drugs, and returned to Cape Cod. Eldridge's testimony was corroborated by Alves, who testified that these drug trips to New York took place about every two weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eldridge testified that, under Mendes' direction, she made the trip to New York to pick up drugs from Tejeda every week or so for a four-month period. Eldridge then drove back to Cape Cod and gave the drugs to either Alves or Figueroa. Each time, Tejeda gave Eldridge disk-shaped packages containing crack cocaine. Eldridge also identified Tejeda's voice in a call recorded by the government. The recording captured Tejeda and Figueroa arranging a drug transaction for February 17, 2004 in New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The February 17, 2004 transaction went off as planned, as was established by the testimony of Alves and two drug enforcement officers who witnessed the event. Co-defendant Christopher Custer was the courier this time. Alves did not go on the trip, but she did give Custer the money to purchase the drugs the night before, and she received the drugs at her home in Yarmouth from Custer when he returned from his successful trip to New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DEA had established surveillance over Tejeda's home in the Bronx and observed Custer's arrival and actions on February 17. Tejeda left his home and entered the red van. A short while later, Custer arrived, parked behind the van, and entered the van. Photographs of Tejeda at the scene of the February 17 deal were admitted into evidence at trial. Within approximately five minutes, Custer got back into his car and left. He was tracked by police as he drove back to Cape Cod and was seen entering Alves' home with a black bag and emerging without it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police made arrests immediately after observing another drug deal, this one on March 16, 2004. Custer, after again obtaining money on Cape Cod to pay for the crack, went to New York. Agents saw Tejeda leave the Boston Road address in the Bronx. Tejeda then got in a car, and police tracked the car to Manhattan. In Manhattan, an agent observed Custer on the same street as the car carrying Tejeda. A short time later, after losing sight of Custer, the agent saw Tejeda get out of the front passenger seat of the car, and Custer get out of the back passenger seat and into the front passenger seat of the car. The police thereafter stopped the car; in it were two disk-like objects, which later tested positive for cocaine base. That evening Tejeda was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case rested primarily on this evidence, and not on the testimony of the non-pleading co-defendant, Figueroa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Trial Error Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Throat-Slitting Gesture and Fair Trial Rights</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Facts And Procedural History</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of the third day of trial, Friday, May 6, 2005, the government's witness was Lt. Balcom. During questioning, Lt. Balcom indicated that on one occasion he had observed some of the individuals in the courtroom in the red van. At the prosecutor's request, Lt. Balcom pointed out these people in the courtroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the morning break, a juror reported privately to the court that she and another juror had seen one of the individuals identified by Lt. Balcom make a throat-slitting gesture on the second day of trial, Wednesday, May 4. After the break and outside of the presence of the jury, the court inquired and was told by defense counsel that the man in question was Tejeda's grandfather. The jury was never informed of this fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court reported to counsel, outside the presence of the jury, that a juror had stated that she had observed Tejeda's grandfather making a throat-slitting gesture. The court then ordered the gesturer and his wife to leave the courthouse and barred them from the courthouse and the surrounding vicinity. At least some members of the jury were later informed of the court's order. On the record, the court described the man barred from the courtroom as an \"obviously frail appearing, old man.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda and Figueroa both moved for mistrial. When the court discussed holding voir dire of the two jurors who reportedly had seen the gesture, Tejeda's counsel expressed concern that the proposed voir dire would only heighten the issue for the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before starting the trial again that Friday, the court said to the jurors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A matter has been conveyed to . . . me and I have taken care of it completely. Put it out of your mind. It has nothing to do with this case. Have in mind, while the report is fully appropriate, indeed we want such a report, do not discuss the case among yourselves, the case now, in the jury room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda did not object to the instruction, and the trial continued for the day. Later, several of the jurors, on query, said that the jury had complied with this instruction. Assuming that to be true, any discussion amongst the jurors occurred before the court dealt with the report of the gesture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Sunday, May 8, Tejeda submitted a written mistrial motion. On Monday, May 9, the court denied the motion but told the parties it would grant their request to voir dire the juror who had reported the gesture, Juror 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then individually questioned Juror 11. She said that she was concerned about the gesture but did not report it on the day she saw it. It was only after she heard the testimony of Lt. Balcom identifying the spectator as having been at the red van that she started to feel uncomfortable about what she had seen the spectator do two days earlier. After hearing Lt. Balcom's testimony on Friday morning, she reported the gesture to several of the other jurors, some of whom told her she should disclose it to the court, and so she did. The court had earlier instructed the jurors not to discuss the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked whether she had linked the individual making the gesture to any particular party in the case, Juror 11 answered that she didn't know whether the older gentleman and the lady who had been sitting with him had anything to do with a particular person or side. The juror stated that all she knew was that Lt. Balcom had testified to seeing one of them in the red van. While she recognized the public nature of the courtroom setting, she was concerned that people in the courtroom could know the names of the jurors. The court asked whether she could put the incident out of her mind when evaluating the case and be fair to all parties. She answered affirmatively, and the court, observing her, found her to be forthcoming. Tejeda again moved for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then questioned Juror 6, who also had seen the gesture. Juror 6 described the gesture as odd and a strange thing to do in the middle of a court proceeding but did not think there was anything to it. She said that it was unclear to her toward whom the gesture was directed. Juror 6, like Juror 11, answered in the affirmative as to her ability to be fair and impartial. The court then denied the motion for mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of Tejeda's counsel, on the fifth day of trial, Tuesday, May 10, 2005, the court conducted a voir dire of the remaining jurors. None of the other jurors had seen the incident; all but one said that they had heard of it from Jurors 11 and/or 6. The jurors reported that they did not discuss the incident other than on the Friday morning before it was reported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each juror was asked whether he or she could be fair and impartial, and every one responded in the affirmative. While several of the jurors indicated that they thought the gesture was inappropriate, no juror expressed fear for his or her safety. Two jurors reported that the gesture had been unsettling or disconcerting for the jurors who had seen it. One juror stated that the reported gesture put pressure on the jury, but that the remedial action taken by the court had been appropriate. Another juror stated that there could be safety concerns, but after hearing of the court's order barring the gesturer from the courthouse, she stated that she was satisfied with her own safety. One juror reported that he knew nothing of the gesture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the voir dire of the entire jury, Tejeda renewed his motion for a mistrial and also requested that the jury foreperson, Juror 11, be deemed an alternate so she would not participate in the jury deliberation. These motions were ultimately denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict of conviction. Thereafter, Tejeda filed a motion for new trial based on, inter alia, the throat-slitting incident. At that time, Tejeda did not argue that the purported error was a structural one, or that the court was required to apply a presumption of prejudice to the gesture. The court denied the new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Appropriate Analytical Framework</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>Structural Error</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda argues that it is clear that the jury here was not impartial, despite the trial judge's finding to the contrary and the jurors' individual declarations that the incident did not render any of them unable to remain impartial in reaching a verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda leaps from this purported factual certainty to an argument, presented for the first time on appeal, that this issue must be analyzed as structural error. Tejeda would like this to be so because in structural error cases the defendant is entitled to automatic reversal. We reject Tejeda's argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Structural error analysis has been constricted in its use to a limited category of claimed errors, none of which fits this case. The Supreme Court has held that it is structural error for a criminal defendant to be tried before a <i>judge</i> who has a financial interest in convicting him. <i>Tumey v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101031\"><a href=\"/opinion/101031/tumey-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 523, 535, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></span> (1927). Tejeda infers from <i>Tumey</i> that his claim that a <i>juror</i> is biased must also be analyzed as a structural error. This is not a situation in which one or more jurors has a financial interest in convicting the defendant. We reject Tejeda's argument. The law is clear both that this is not the stuff of structural error and that Tejeda's jury bias claim is subject to a different standard of review. On review, the appellate court asks whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a mistrial. That standard gives deference to the trial judge, who is in the best position to evaluate the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mere error in the trial process itself is not structural error. <i>United States v.

This, he says, necessarily requires a different result from that reached in <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Ortiz.</i> It does not. The implicit threat, while serious, was of a different nature than the direct threat in <i>Rodr&#237;guez-Ortiz.</i> Further, it is unclear here to whom the gesture was intended, and here there was a possible, but not direct, association between the threat and the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Importantly, the district court did not ignore the risk that one or more of the jurors could perceive this gesture as a threat or that a threat might impair impartiality. First, the court took immediate remedial action. The court had the spectator who was the source of the \"threat\" removed from the courtroom and informed the jurors not to be concerned. The elderly spectator was no longer present when the evidence connecting the red van to the defendant became stronger at trial, and at least some of the jurors were informed that the spectator was not permitted to be in the vicinity of the courthouse. Second, the court queried each juror about whether the throat-slitting gesture would render him or her unable to impartially evaluate the evidence. The court observed the demeanor of each juror and concluded that each could be impartial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did the court leave the incident for further conversation and musings among the jurors. The court instructed them not to discuss it, and, those who were later questioned said the jurors had complied with that instruction. Normally, if jurors say they have followed instructions, their statements are credited. <i>Cf. Penry v.

This is the argument that Tejeda makes&#8212; that the incident was so strongly and indelibly harmful that no instruction and no voir dire could cure it. Tejeda adds that the jurors' voir dire responses demonstrated that they would not be able to disregard the gesture in reaching a decision in the case.

He did so as to all co-defendants by motion before trial. Later, on the first day of trial, he orally moved to sever his trial from that of co-defendant Figueroa, after he learned that Figueroa would testify and present a battered woman defense as to her relationship with Mendes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Her testimony would be that Mendes regularly beat her.

Specifically, Tejeda proposed that he put on his case, the prosecution put on its rebuttal, then the jury decide on Tejeda's guilt or innocence alone. Thereafter, Figueroa would present her defense, the prosecution its rebuttal, and the jury would then render its verdict as to Figueroa. The court denied Tejeda's motion.

Tejeda relies on <i>United States v.

But in <i>Johnson,</i> the co-defendants' theories of defense were truly antagonistic. While Johnson defended on the basis that he was not present when the charged crime was committed, his co-defendant made a confession explicitly and necessarily incriminating Johnson and defended only on the basis that he lacked the necessary mens rea. <i>Id.</i> at 1131-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, by contrast, there was no true antagonism of defenses. Tejeda's defense explicitly acknowledged there was a drug conspiracy; he simply argued the prosecution could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the New York source of drugs for the conspiracy. Thus, Figueroa's defense that there was a drug conspiracy, but that she had acted under duress, was not an antagonistic defense at all. Her defense did not in any way hinge on Tejeda's participation in the conspiracy. Indeed, even if the jury accepted her duress defense it could either accept or reject Tejeda's defense.

It is that Figueroa's testimony about being regularly beaten by her boyfriend Mendes, the head of the conspiracy, would spill over to Tejeda, who was accused of conspiring with Mendes in drug distribution. This is a sort of argument that \"you are known by the friends you keep,\" and bad friends will taint you in the jury's eyes. It is almost inherent in drug conspiracy cases that a co-conspirator may have engaged in other types of blameworthy conduct. That is not enough to warrant severance of co-defendants' trials. While Mendes' treatment of Figueroa may have been more shocking than run-of-the-mill blameworthy conduct from drug co-conspirators, Tejeda's role in the conspiracy&#8212;as a geographically-removed supplier several states distant&#8212;lessened the risk that the jurors might ascribe Mendes' conduct to him. Moreover, the trial judge instructed the jury that evidence of Mendes' mistreatment of Figueroa was not to be considered in the case against Tejeda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa did identify Tejeda in court as the drug ring's New York source of supply. She also testified about numerous trips to New York to pick up drugs. But all of this testimony, including the identification, was cumulative of Eldridge's testimony. There was more than sufficient evidence against Tejeda without Figueroa's identification. In any event, Figueroa's testimony regarding Tejeda was admissible against Tejeda regardless of whether the trials were severed.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span>. The government notes that Tejeda failed to object to the district court's limiting of the verdict slip to refer only to \"cocaine base\" and not \"crack.\" Nor did he object to the district court's statement at the charge conference that it would decide the crack issue in a jury-waived proceeding, or the district court's instruction to the jury, which equated crack with cocaine base. The prosecution argues that Tejeda's presentencing motion to preclude application of the crack Guidelines was insufficient to preserve the claim because it was at that time too late to present the issue to the jury. <i>See United States v. Pacheco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202026\"><a href=\"/opinion/202026/united-states-v-pacheco/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 115 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bypass the question of forfeiture because even if Tejeda preserved his claim, it fails on the merits. As Tejeda conceded before the district court, our decision in <i>United States v. Medina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201882\"><a href=\"/opinion/201882/united-states-v-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2005), forecloses any argument that as a general matter the government must prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the cocaine base at issue is crack cocaine. In <i>Medina,</i> the defendant was convicted of, inter alia, possession with intent to distribute over fifty grams of cocaine base. <i>Id.</i> at 90. On appeal, Medina argued that the trial court had erred in not instructing the jury that the government was required to prove that the cocaine base he possessed was crack cocaine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Id.</i> at 92. This court held that \"the government is not required to prove that the substance involved in a given case is crack in order to secure a conviction under\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841, the statute specifying the substantive offense that was the object of the conspiracy for which Tejeda was convicted. <i>Id.</i> The fact that the cocaine base was crack was \"only relevant to the court at sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 92 n. 3. Moreover, in <i>United States v. O'Brien,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202020\"><a href=\"/opinion/202020/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006), we held that, as long as the statutory maximum is not affected, a sentencing judge is permitted to determine by a preponderance of the evidence the factual basis for a sentencing enhancement. <i>Id.</i> at 41. Such was the case here. There was no error in the district court's determining that the cocaine base at issue in this case was crack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tejeda argues that the sentencing court was not permitted to make the crack determination <i>in his case</i> because it was the law of the case that all sentencing enhancements be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. This argument is without merit. At times the court did state that it would require the government to prove sentencing enhancements to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt; but it also determined that whether the cocaine base at issue was crack cocaine would be decided in a jury-waived proceeding, and it further decided at sentencing that it was permitted to make the determination that the cocaine base was crack. The court was not prohibited from revising its position on proof of sentencing enhancements to the jury. <i>See Harlow v. Children's Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[L]aw of the case permits a lower court to review prior interlocutory orders as long as that review is not an abuse of discretion.\"); <i>Fiori v.

It is possible that the court's about-face at the sentencing disposition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> might have constituted \"unfair surprise.\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. Moody,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541762\"><a href=\"/opinion/541762/united-states-v-shearn-moody-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 331 (5th Cir.1990) (\"There is also an element of unfair surprise in the court's belated reversal concerning Bauman's testimony. . . . By reversing its earlier ruling, . . . the district court was obliged to provide Moody an opportunity for surrebuttal, assuming of course that the defense could proffer evidence to parry the expanded government case.\") It would have been better for the court here to have explicitly informed the parties of its ruling that it could determine the crack enhancement in the absence of a jury verdict and allowed the parties to submit factual evidence with regards to the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence that Tejeda states he would have offered, however, would not have precluded the court from finding that the crack Guidelines were applicable. Prior to sentencing, Tejeda submitted a brief to the district court in which he claimed&#8212; in a footnote&#8212;as he does now, that the DEA's test results showed that the drug sample linked to Tejeda had not tested positive for sodium bicarbonate, a \"signature ingredient\" of crack. Tejeda did not purport to have performed any independent tests of the drug sample connected to him, but rather relied solely on the DEA's analysis. Tejeda attached to his brief the DEA's work papers and test results. As a result, at the point it made its determination that the drugs at issue in the case were crack, the district court had before it the very results on which Tejeda's expert would have offered testimony. Moreover, even if Tejeda is correct that the particular sample tested by the DEA did not contain sodium bicarbonate, there nonetheless was ample evidence at trial for the district court to conclude that the drugs involved in the conspiracy were crack. Three law enforcement officers testified, based on visual observation, that the drugs seized from the car on March 16 were crack, and Eldridge and Figueroa both testified that the drugs regularly purchased from Tejeda were crack. <i>See United States v. Walters,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542855\"><a href=\"/opinion/542855/united-states-v-ira-glen-anthony-walters-united-states-v-neville-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 770 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Proof based on scientific analysis or expert testimony is not required to prove the illicit nature of a substance, and identification of a substance as a drug may be based on the opinion of a knowledgeable lay person.\"). The identity of the drugs that Tejeda dealt does not hinge on this one sample.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Tejeda's second argument, it is unpersuasive for Tejeda to suggest that he would have presented an expert at trial had he known what would be the nature of the jury-waived proceeding. Tejeda did attempt to have his expert testify at trial. In his proffer Tejeda indicated that the expert would testify about the difference between cocaine base and crack cocaine and the difficulty of telling the two apart visually. The district court, however, refused to allow the expert to testify because the request was not timely,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and because, the court concluded, the testimony would confuse the jury. The court did say at the time it precluded the expert from testifying that it would hear the expert at the time of sentencing. But this was not the reason that the expert was precluded from testifying at trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was not required to find that the cocaine base possessed by Tejeda was crack. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it revised its position on proof of sentencing enhancements. Tejeda was not prejudiced by the district court's revision of its prior ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Tejeda argues that the district court's deciding that the crack cocaine Guidelines applied violated his protection against double jeopardy and his due process rights. Tejeda essentially argues that the government failed to prove at trial that the drugs were crack, and that he should not have been forced at sentencing to once again mount a defense to such a charge. There was no error in the district court's application of the crack cocaine Guidelines, much less a due process violation. Likewise, double jeopardy principles are inapplicable here. Double jeopardy concerns arise only when a jury verdict or a trial court's ruling, \"whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\" <i>Pacheco,</i> 434 F.3d at 112 (quoting <i>United States v.

He argues that the nature and circumstances of his offense, his personal history and characteristics, his potential for rehabilitation, sentences imposed by other federal courts, and the sentences imposed on his co-defendants all weigh in favor of his receiving the mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months.

The court further stated that comparison to the average sentence imposed by other courts for the offense in question was not necessarily instructive since that average did not account for factors such as drug quantity. Finally, we note that \"[a]lthough a district court may consider disparities among co-defendants in determining a sentence, [a defendant's] sentence [is not] unreasonable simply because his co-defendants agreed to help the government in exchange for reduced sentences.\" <i>United States v.

Tejeda also offered his expert to cast doubt that the drugs seized on March 16, 2004 from the car in which Tejeda had been riding were crack. He proffered that his expert would testify that while the DEA had concluded that a different drug sample&#8212; seized from co-conspirator Custer's home&#8212; was crack, the DEA had not concluded that the drugs linked to Tejeda were crack. This was an inaccurate characterization of the DEA's conclusions, as the prosecution pointed out. The parties had stipulated that the DEA had concluded that both tested samples contained cocaine base. The DEA had made no finding as to whether either sample contained crack cocaine.
