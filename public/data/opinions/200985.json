Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michael A. Brennan on brief pro se.\n     Aaron L. Weisman, Assistant Attorney General, Rhode Island\nDepartment of Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                 May 4, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam.   Pro se petitioner Michael Brennan (\"Brennan\"), a\n\nstate prisoner, appeals from the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. §§ 1651\n\nand 2241 petition.          The district court treated the filing as a §\n\n2254 petition and dismissed it as nonconforming, successive, and\n\nuntimely.          We already have held that Brennan may not bring a\n\n\"second or successive\" § 2254 petition because he cannot satisfy\n\nthe requirements of § 2244(b). Therefore, the only question before\n\nus is whether the district court properly denied relief under §\n\n2241 and § 1651.        Our review is de novo.                Saint Fort v. Ashcroft,\n\n329 F.3d 191, 202 (1st Cir. 2003).                We affirm.\n\n          A state habeas petitioner in custody pursuant to the judgment\n\nof    a    state    court   may    not    evade    the    \"second     or    successive\"\n\nrestrictions of § 2244 by bringing his petition under § 2241 rather\n\nthan § 2254.        See, e.g., Medberry v. Crosby, 351 F.3d 1049, 1060-61\n\n(11th Cir. 2003), petition for cert. filed, Feb. 23, 2004 (No. 03-\n\n9165); Cook v. New York State Division of Parole, 321 F.3d 274,\n\n278-79 & n.4 (2d Cir. 2003); Coady v. Vaughn, 251 F.3d 480, 484-85\n\n(3d Cir. 2001).         As the Third Circuit explained, \"both Sections\n\n2241 and 2254 authorize [petitioner's] challenge to the legality of\n\nhis   continued       state    custody,\"     but    allowing       him     to   file   his\n\n\"petition      in    federal      court   pursuant       to    Section     2241   without\n\nreliance on Section 2254 would . . . thwart Congressional intent.\"\n\nCoady, 251 F.3d at 484-85.                Thus, a state prisoner in custody\n\npursuant to the judgment of a state court may file a habeas corpus\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fpetition, as authorized by § 2241, but he is limited by § 2254.\n\nCf. United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 49-50 (1st Cir. 1999),\n\ncert. denied, 528 U.S. 1176 (2000)    (holding that federal prisoner\n\ncould not evade restrictions on successive § 2255 petitions by\n\nresort to § 2241).\n\n     Nor may the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, be used to evade\n\nthe strictures of § 2254.   \"The All Writs Act is a residual source\n\nof authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by\n\nstatute.    Where a statute specifically addresses the particular\n\nissue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act,\n\nthat is controlling.\" Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416, 429\n\n(1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).      As noted\n\nabove, because Brennan is in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n\nstate court, his request for relief is governed by § 2254.    Because\n\na § 2254 petition is available to him, a writ under § 1651 is not.\n\nSee, e.g., Godoski v. United States, 304 F.3d 761, 762 (7th Cir.\n\n2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1211 (2003); cf. Barrett, 178 F.3d at\n\n55 (holding that federal prisoner could not evade restrictions on\n\nsuccessive § 2255 petitions by resort to § 1651).\n\n     Accordingly, the district court properly treated Brennan's\n\npetition as having been brought under § 2254, despite Brennan's\n\nattempt to classify his petition as a § 2241 or § 1651 action.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.    See 1st Cir.\n\nR. 27(c).\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
