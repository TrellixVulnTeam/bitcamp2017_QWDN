José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                  Torruella, Lynch and Howard,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Alexander Zeno on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n                       September 27, 2007\n\f                  Per   Curiam.      Before    us   are   two    attorney-discipline\n\nmatters       involving      Attorney     Alexander       Zeno,    which   have    been\n\nconsolidated for consideration.                 The first involves an appeal by\n\nZeno       from    a    disciplinary   order     imposed    by    the   United    States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico.                          A five-judge\n\npanel, citing various incidents of alleged misconduct, imposed a\n\npair of penalties--suspending Zeno from the practice of law before\n\nthe district court for three months, and removing him from its\n\nCriminal Justice Act (CJA) panel for the fifteen months remaining\n\nin his present term.              The second involves a reciprocal-discipline\n\nproceeding initiated by this court, in which Zeno has responded to\n\nan order to show cause why we should not impose similar sanctions.\n\nHaving scrutinized Zeno's submissions and heard oral argument, we\n\naffirm the district court order and, in the reciprocal proceeding,\n\nimpose similar (although not identical) discipline.\n\n                                           I.\n\n                  Although the district court's show-cause order set forth\n\ntwo central charges against Zeno, its disciplinary decision ended\n\nup focusing on one: what were deemed \"disrespectful submissions\"\n\nmade to the court.1          The district court listed numerous examples of\n\nsuch conduct.            These consisted of pleadings from a pair of cases\n\n\n\n       1\n        We agree with the district court that the disposition of\nthis first charge obviates the need to address the second, which\nconcerned Zeno's objections to the manner in which his CJA vouchers\nhad been processed.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fthat gave rise to the charges here, as well as those from other\n\ncases that were included as background material.        We see no need to\n\nfully recount each of these incidents.         One such submission--an\n\n\"informative motion\" filed by Zeno in which he complained about\n\nactions occurring at a status conference--provides a representative\n\nexample.   Among other remarks, Zeno there asserted as follows:\n\n     [T]he Court, instead of seriously addressing the issues\n     presented to it, along with [the Assistant U.S. Attorney\n     (AUSA)], made a mockery of our request to safeguard the\n     constitutional rights of the Defendant ....\n\n     [T]he undersigned takes offense at [the AUSA's]\n     continuous unprofessional conduct. In particular, his\n     excessive and open[] laughing in court [at] our arguments\n     as if we were in the middle of a party making [j]okes.\n\n     We particularly resent that the Court sanctioned [the\n     AUSA's] disrespectful behavior by joining in the mockery\n     of the argument of the undersigned ....\n\n     This is not a laughing matter!...        [T]his Court's\n     apparent bias in favor of the government does nothing to\n     help sharpen the system to produce the best of ... our\n     judicial system.\n\n     The Court has mocked the legal             positions     of   the\n     undersigned now and in the past.\n\nUnited States v. Ruiz-Marty, D.P.R. No. 06-111, Dkt. # 96, at 2-4.\n\nOther filings included similarly intemperate and unsubstantiated\n\nallegations   that   various   judges   were   guilty   of,   inter      alia,\n\ndishonesty, partiality, stupidity, or possible criminality.                The\n\ndistrict court determined that these outbursts reflected a \"chronic\n\ntendency\" on Zeno's part to use \"belligerent and insulting prose in\n\naddressing members of this court,\" which amounted to a violation of\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fRule 3.5(d) of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.2                That\n\nprovision bars a lawyer from \"engag[ing] in conduct intended to\n\ndisrupt a tribunal\"; the accompanying commentary cautions that\n\n\"[r]efraining from abusive or obstreperous conduct is a corollary\n\nof the advocate's right to speak on behalf of litigants.\"                  Model\n\nRule       3.5(d),   cmt.   4.   What    the     record   of   Zeno's   behavior\n\ndemonstrated, the district court concluded, was a pattern of\n\n\"disrespectful conduct disruptive of the judicial process.\"\n\n               \"This court reviews a district court decision to impose\n\ndiscipline for abuse of discretion.\"            In re Franco, 410 F.3d 39, 40\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam).            In turn, \"[a]s a general rule,\n\ndiscipline similar to that imposed in the [district] court will be\n\nimposed in a reciprocal proceeding.\" In re Williams, 398 F.3d 116,\n\n119 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam).             An exception will arise only if\n\none of the four conditions set forth in Rule II.C of this court's\n\nRules of Attorney Disciplinary Enforcement--deprivation of due\n\nprocess; infirmity of proof; threat of grave injustice; or need for\n\ndifferent discipline--is present.              See, e.g., In re Kersey, 402\n\nF.3d 217, 217-18 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (citing Selling v.\n\nRadford, 243 U.S. 46, 51 (1917)); In re Williams, 398 F.3d at 119.\n\n\"[T]he respondent attorney must carry the devoir of persuasion, by\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        The Puerto Rico District Court has adopted these Model\nRules in its Local Rule 83.5(a).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fclear   and    convincing    evidence,     that   imposition   of   reciprocal\n\ndiscipline is unwarranted.\"       Id.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the\n\ndistrict court here--either in its decision to impose discipline or\n\nin its selection of sanctions.        Zeno protests that his challenged\n\nremarks, even if intemperate, were unworthy of censure.                In his\n\nview, the court overreacted by taking umbrage at appropriate\n\ncriticism concerning judicial administration and other matters of\n\npublic interest.      We are unpersuaded.         To be sure, judges are not\n\nimmune from \"the slings and arrows that they insist other public\n\nofficials face.\" In re Palmisano, 70 F.3d 483, 487 (7th Cir. 1995);\n\naccord, e.g., Craig v. Harney, 331 U.S. 367, 376 (1947) (\"Judges\n\nare supposed to be [persons] of fortitude, able to thrive in a\n\nhardy climate.\").      This is true even with respect to criticism\n\nvoiced by attorneys, who \"can play an important role in exposing\n\nproblems with the judicial system.\"           Standing Comm. on Discip. v.\n\nYagman, 55 F.3d 1430, 1437 (9th Cir. 1995); see also U.S. Dist. Ct.\n\nv. Sandlin, 12 F.3d 861, 866 (9th Cir. 1993) (a lawyer \"does not\n\nsurrender his freedom of expression\" once \"admitted to the bar\").\n\n              Nonetheless,    \"[i]t   is    unquestionable     that   in   the\n\ncourtroom itself, during a judicial proceeding, whatever right to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f'free       speech'   an   attorney   has     is   extremely    circumscribed.\"3\n\nGentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 1071 (1991).                  While\n\n\"the line between legitimate criticism and insult can be a blurry\n\none,\" Thomas v. Tenneco Packaging Co., 293 F.3d 1306, 1331 (11th\n\nCir. 2002), we cannot fault the district court for concluding that\n\nZeno crossed that line--particularly given the repeated nature of\n\nhis unfounded accusations and the tone in which they were voiced.\n\nSee,        e.g.,   In re Cordova-Gonzalez, 996 F.2d 1334, 1335-36 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (per curiam) (noting that \"[a]ttorneys have on a number\n\nof occasions been disbarred\" for \"vitriolic and ... unfounded\n\npersonal assaults\" on court and opposing counsel, and finding that\n\nrecord        supported    conclusion       that    counsel's     \"abusive    and\n\ndisrespectful language\" violated ABA Model Rules); United States v.\n\nCooper, 872 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"Nor may an attorney seek\n\nrefuge within his own First Amendment right of free speech to fill\n\na courtroom with a litany of speculative accusations and insults\n\nwhich raise doubts as to a judge's impartiality.\"); cf. Sacher v.\n\nUnited States, 343 U.S. 1, 9 (1952) (\"if the ruling is adverse, it\n\nis not counsel's right to resist it or to insult the judge--his\n\n\n        3\n         In what he deems an \"extremely important\" point, Zeno\nasserts that his remarks in the Ruiz-Marty case, which we quoted\nearlier, \"were not part of any pending litigation\" since he was \"no\nlonger part of the case\" when he filed the informative motion.\nBrief at 11. He is mistaken. Although he had moved to withdraw on\nthat same day, he was not relieved of his duties until later. See,\ne.g., Dkt. #s 111-13.      By district court rule, \"[a] defense\nattorney in any criminal case shall continue the representation\nuntil relieved by order of this court.\" D.P.R. Loc. R. 157.2(b).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fright is only respectfully to preserve his point for appeal\").\n\nZeno's reliance on In re Snyder, 472 U.S. 634 (1985), is misplaced,\n\nsince the conduct in question there involved at worst \"a single\n\nincident of rudeness.\"          Id. at 647.\n\n            Also     unavailing      is    Zeno's         contention      that    the\n\ndisciplinary proceeding was marred by several procedural flaws. He\n\nfirst objects to the denial of his request that five district court\n\njudges    recuse    themselves.      Yet     the    two    judges   who   made    the\n\ndisciplinary referrals against him had no further involvement in\n\nthe matter.    Zeno has not sought to rebut the reasons enumerated by\n\nthe other judges in their order denying such relief.                       That the\n\nauthor of the show-cause order also served on the disciplinary\n\npanel is unremarkable.           And Zeno has not otherwise provided a\n\ndeveloped argument on appeal as to why recusal was warranted.4                     As\n\nin Cordova-Gonzalez, \"we see no reason to deem the judges' decision\n\nto   take   part     in   the    disciplinary       proceedings     an    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.\"       996 F.2d at 1336.\n\n            Zeno's other procedural complaints concern a lack of\n\ndiscovery and a lack of \"publicity.\"            His requests were predicated\n\non another set of ABA model rules, which he has not shown to have\n\nbeen adopted by the district court.                In any event, the requested\n\ndiscovery, as here relevant, was confined to contact information\n\n\n      4\n        An example of his cursory analysis is his contention that\n\"there is no basis to believe\" that affidavits filed under 28\nU.S.C. § 144 were legally insufficient. Brief at 27.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fabout persons attending the status conference--information largely\n\navailable to Zeno already.              And not only has the disciplinary\n\ndecision now been made public, but Zeno has identified no prejudice\n\nstemming from the fact that the proceeding was initially conducted\n\nunder seal.5\n\n            In his final appellate challenge, Zeno insists that, even\n\nif some measure of discipline were warranted, the punishment\n\nimposed by the district court was unduly harsh.                   This complaint is\n\ndirected   at    his    removal    from     the   CJA     panel   rather    than    his\n\nsuspension.      Pointing out that his law practice has been almost\n\nentirely confined to CJA appointments, Zeno protests that such a\n\nsanction effectively amounts to disbarment.                   Yet \"[s]election of\n\nthe   sanction     is     a   subject       on    which    appellate       review    is\n\ndeferential.\"     In re Palmisano, 70 F.3d at 488.                Removal from the\n\nCJA panel is hardly unprecedented in this context, see, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Halliburton, 2000 WL 968021, at *2 (7th Cir. 2000)\n\n(\"it seems to us imprudent to continue appointing Noll under the\n\nCriminal Justice Act, a step that would imply satisfaction with his\n\nservices in that capacity\"); In re Suspension of Att'y Jo Ann\n\nFulton, 445 F. Supp. 2d 1325, 1326 (D. Wyo. 2006) (describing Tenth\n\nCircuit    order),      and   we   cannot    fault      the   district     court    for\n\nconsidering such a sanction appropriate here. Zeno remains free to\n\n\n      5\n        An additional procedural argument--that Zeno was entitled\nto an evidentiary hearing--was made informally below but has not\nbeen pursued on appeal.\n\n                                          -8-\n\frepresent private clients and to apply for reinstatement to the CJA\n\npanel in the future.6\n\n                                       III.\n\n            The foregoing discussion largely suffices to resolve the\n\nreciprocal proceeding in this court.             See, e.g., In re Cordova-\n\nGonzalez,   996    F.2d   at    1336   (noting      that   result   of   original\n\ndisciplinary      proceeding     is    of     \"substantial      relevance\"       in\n\ndetermining result of reciprocal proceeding) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).     We have little difficulty in concluding that Zeno\n\nhas failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that\n\n\"imposition of reciprocal discipline is unwarranted.\"                         In re\n\nWilliams, 398 F.3d at 119.              With respect to the appropriate\n\nsanction,   it    turns   out   that   one    key    issue   has    already    been\n\ndetermined: through a coincidence of timing, Zeno's application for\n\nreappointment to this court's CJA panel has recently been denied,\n\nfor reasons unconnected to the instant disciplinary matters.                     We\n\nadd that, even had that development not occurred, Zeno has failed\n\nto establish that his removal from the panel would have been\n\ninappropriate under the standards governing reciprocal discipline.\n\n            Beyond this, and despite his lack of remorse, we choose\n\nnot to suspend Zeno from the practice of law before this court.\n\n\n     6\n       Contrary to Zeno's suggestion, we see nothing irrational or\nmalicious in the decision to restrict his CJA appointments but to\nallow his continued representation of paying customers. Indigent\ndefendants, of course, have less freedom of choice with respect to\nselection and retention of counsel.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fThe disciplinary findings, of course, did not involve his conduct\n\non appeal.      Moreover, Zeno currently has (by our count) nine CJA\n\ncases pending before this court, in various stages of preparation.7\n\nWe think that what little purpose would be served by a further\n\nsuspension would be outweighed by the resulting inconvenience to\n\nhis   clients      and   this   court.      Zeno   may     thus   continue   his\n\nrepresentation in those pending appeals.           Accord Halliburton, 2000\n\nWL 968021, at * 2 (removing attorney from CJA panel but not from\n\nexisting     CJA    cases).      Should     he   receive    any   further    CJA\n\nappointments before his panel membership ends, he may appear in\n\nthose cases as well.          And he may at all times represent private\n\nclients on appeal.         But once his CJA term expires, he will be\n\nbarred from appearing in this court in new CJA cases unless and\n\nuntil he is reinstated to the panel.\n\n           The decision of the district court is affirmed.                   The\n\nreciprocal-discipline proceeding is resolved in accordance with the\n\nterms of this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        While we do not rely on this point, the district court's\ndisciplinary order was actually ambiguous as to whether Zeno could\nremain in pending CJA cases. We understand that the order has been\nconstrued to require his withdrawal therefrom.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f",

The first involves an appeal by Zeno from a disciplinary order imposed by the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. A five-judge panel, citing various incidents of alleged misconduct, imposed a pair of penalties  suspending Zeno from the practice of law before the district court for three months, and removing him from its Criminal Justice Act (CJA) panel for the fifteen months remaining in his present term. The second involves a reciprocal-discipline proceeding initiated by this court, in which Zeno has responded to an order to show cause why we should not impose similar sanctions. Having scrutinized Zeno's submissions and heard oral argument, we affirm the district court order and, in the reciprocal proceeding, impose similar (although not identical) discipline.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Although the district court's show-cause order set forth two central charges against Zeno, its disciplinary decision ended up focusing on one: what were deemed \"disrespectful submissions\" made to the court.<sup>[1]</sup> The district court listed numerous examples of such conduct. These consisted of pleadings from a pair of cases that gave rise to the charges here, as well as those from other cases that were included as background material. We see no need to fully recount each of these incidents. One such submission  an \"informative motion\" filed by Zeno in which he complained about actions occurring at a status conference  provides a representative example. Among other remarks, Zeno there asserted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he Court, instead of seriously addressing the issues presented to it, along with [the Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA)], made a mockery of our request to safeguard the constitutional rights of the Defendant. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[T]he undersigned takes offense at [the AUSA's] continuous unprofessional conduct.

Other filings included similarly intemperate and unsubstantiated allegations that various judges were guilty of, <i>inter alia,</i> dishonesty, partiality, stupidity, or possible criminality. The district court determined that these outbursts reflected a \"chronic tendency\" on Zeno's part to use \"belligerent and insulting prose in addressing members of this court,\" which amounted to a violation of Rule 3.5(d) of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.<sup>[2]</sup> That provision bars a lawyer from \"engag[ing] in conduct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> intended to disrupt a tribunal\"; the accompanying commentary cautions that \"[r]efraining from abusive or obstreperous conduct is a corollary of the advocate's right to speak on behalf of litigants.\" Model Rule 3.5(d), cmt. 4.

Zeno's reliance on <i>In re Snyder,</i> 472 U.S. 634, 105 S.Ct. 2874, 86 L.Ed.2d 504 (1985), is misplaced, since the conduct in question there involved at worst \"a single incident of rudeness.\" <i>Id.</i> at 647.</p>\n<p>Also unavailing is Zeno's contention that the disciplinary proceeding was marred by several procedural flaws.

Zeno has not sought to rebut the reasons enumerated by the other judges in their order denying such relief.

But once his CJA term expires, he will be barred from appearing in this court in new CJA cases unless and until he is reinstated to the panel.</p>\n<p><i>The decision of the district court is affirmed. The reciprocal-discipline proceeding is resolved in accordance with the terms of this opinion.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We agree with the district court that the disposition of this first charge obviates the need to address the second, which concerned Zeno's objections to the manner in which his CJA vouchers had been processed.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Puerto Rico District Court has adopted these Model Rules in its Local Rule 83.5(a).</p>\n<p>[3]  In what he deems an \"extremely important\" point, Zeno asserts that his remarks in the <i>Ruiz-Marty</i> case, which we quoted earlier, \"were not part of any pending litigation\" since he was \"no longer part of the case\" when he filed the informative motion. Brief at 11. He is mistaken. Although he had moved to withdraw on that same day, he was not relieved of his duties until later. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Dkt. # s 111-13. By district court rule, \"[a] defense attorney in any criminal case shall continue the representation until relieved by order of this court.\" D.P.R. Loc. R. 157.2(b).</p>\n<p>[4]  An example of his cursory analysis is his contention that \"there is no basis to believe\" that affidavits filed under 28 U.S.C. § 144 were legally insufficient. Brief at 27.</p>\n<p>[5]  An additional procedural argument  that Zeno was entitled to an evidentiary hearing  was made informally below but has not been pursued on appeal.</p>\n<p>[6]  Contrary to Zeno's suggestion, we see nothing irrational or malicious in the decision to restrict his CJA appointments but to allow his continued representation of paying customers. Indigent defendants, of course, have less freedom of choice with respect to selection and retention of counsel.</p>\n<p>[7]  While we do not rely on this point, the district court's disciplinary order was actually ambiguous as to whether Zeno could remain in pending CJA cases. We understand that the order has been construed to require his withdrawal therefrom.</p>\n\n</div>",

The first involves an appeal by Zeno from a disciplinary order imposed by the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. A five-judge panel, citing various incidents of alleged misconduct, imposed a pair of penalties  suspending Zeno from the practice of law before the district court for three months, and removing him from its Criminal Justice Act (CJA) panel for the fifteen months remaining in his present term. The second involves a reciprocal-discipline proceeding initiated by this court, in which Zeno has responded to an order to show cause why we should not impose similar sanctions. Having scrutinized Zeno's submissions and heard oral argument, we affirm the district court order and, in the reciprocal proceeding, impose similar (although not identical) discipline.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Although the district court's show-cause order set forth two central charges against Zeno, its disciplinary decision ended up focusing on one: what were deemed \"disrespectful submissions\" made to the court.<sup>[1]</sup> The district court listed numerous examples of such conduct. These consisted of pleadings from a pair of cases that gave rise to the charges here, as well as those from other cases that were included as background material. We see no need to fully recount each of these incidents. One such submission  an \"informative motion\" filed by Zeno in which he complained about actions occurring at a status conference  provides a representative example. Among other remarks, Zeno there asserted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he Court, instead of seriously addressing the issues presented to it, along with [the Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA)], made a mockery of our request to safeguard the constitutional rights of the Defendant. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[T]he undersigned takes offense at [the AUSA's] continuous unprofessional conduct. In particular, his excessive and open[ ] laughing in court [at] our arguments as if we were in the middle of a party making [j]okes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We particularly resent that the Court sanctioned [the AUSA's] disrespectful behavior by joining in the mockery of the argument of the undersigned. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>This is not a laughing matter! . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[T]his Court's apparent bias in favor of the government does nothing to help sharpen the system to produce the best of . . . our judicial system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The Court has mocked the legal positions of the undersigned now and in the past.</blockquote>\n<p><i>United States v. Ruiz-Marty,</i> D.P.R. No. 06-111, Dkt. # 96, at 2-4. Other filings included similarly intemperate and unsubstantiated allegations that various judges were guilty of, <i>inter alia,</i> dishonesty, partiality, stupidity, or possible criminality. The district court determined that these outbursts reflected a \"chronic tendency\" on Zeno's part to use \"belligerent and insulting prose in addressing members of this court,\" which amounted to a violation of Rule 3.5(d) of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.<sup>[2]</sup> That provision bars a lawyer from \"engag[ing] in conduct <span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> intended to disrupt a tribunal\"; the accompanying commentary cautions that \"[r]efraining from abusive or obstreperous conduct is a corollary of the advocate's right to speak on behalf of litigants.\" Model Rule 3.5(d), cmt. 4. What the record of Zeno's behavior demonstrated, the district court concluded, was a pattern of \"disrespectful conduct disruptive of the judicial process.\"</p>\n<p>\"This court reviews a district court decision to impose discipline for abuse of discretion.\" <i>In re Franco,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201607\"><a href=\"/opinion/201607/in-re-franco-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2005) (per curiam).

Zeno may thus continue his representation in those pending appeals. <i>Accord </i><i>Halliburton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">968021</span></span>, at * 2 (removing attorney from CJA panel but not from existing CJA cases). Should he receive any further CJA appointments before his panel membership ends, he may appear in those cases as well. And he may at all times represent private clients on appeal. But once his CJA term expires, he will be barred from appearing in this court in new CJA cases unless and until he is reinstated to the panel.</p>\n<p><i>The decision of the district court is affirmed. The reciprocal-discipline proceeding is resolved in accordance with the terms of this opinion.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We agree with the district court that the disposition of this first charge obviates the need to address the second, which concerned Zeno's objections to the manner in which his CJA vouchers had been processed.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Puerto Rico District Court has adopted these Model Rules in its Local Rule 83.5(a).</p>\n<p>[3]  In what he deems an \"extremely important\" point, Zeno asserts that his remarks in the <i>Ruiz-Marty</i> case, which we quoted earlier, \"were not part of any pending litigation\" since he was \"no longer part of the case\" when he filed the informative motion. Brief at 11. He is mistaken. Although he had moved to withdraw on that same day, he was not relieved of his duties until later. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Dkt. # s 111-13. By district court rule, \"[a] defense attorney in any criminal case shall continue the representation until relieved by order of this court.\" D.P.R. Loc. R. 157.2(b).</p>\n<p>[4]  An example of his cursory analysis is his contention that \"there is no basis to believe\" that affidavits filed under 28 U.S.C. § 144 were legally insufficient. Brief at 27.</p>\n<p>[5]  An additional procedural argument  that Zeno was entitled to an evidentiary hearing  was made informally below but has not been pursued on appeal.</p>\n<p>[6]  Contrary to Zeno's suggestion, we see nothing irrational or malicious in the decision to restrict his CJA appointments but to allow his continued representation of paying customers. Indigent defendants, of course, have less freedom of choice with respect to selection and retention of counsel.</p>\n<p>[7]  While we do not rely on this point, the district court's disciplinary order was actually ambiguous as to whether Zeno could remain in pending CJA cases. We understand that the order has been construed to require his withdrawal therefrom.</p>\n\n</div>",
