Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                      and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Joseph Deliz-Hernandez for appellant.\n     Isabel Muñoz-Acosta, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, and Miguel A. Fernández,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Chief, Civil Division, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              March 18, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam.   On April 27, 1995, the United States filed\n\na verified complaint for forfeiture of the defendant properties.\n\nVarious claims were filed asserting rights to a portion of the\n\nproperties, known as Property C, by heirs of either or both Manuel\n\nRivera-Martir and Pura Ruiz-Fred, but all were stricken except for\n\nthe claim of Daniel Rivera-Ruiz (Rivera).      Roughly seven years\n\nlater, the government moved for summary judgment.   Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56.\n\n          Rivera did not oppose the motion in a timeous fashion.\n\nWhen his counsel moved to withdraw, the district court granted the\n\nmotion but instructed Rivera to retain new counsel within fifteen\n\ndays and reminded him that the motion for summary judgment had been\n\npending unopposed since January 16, 2002.   That court order, dated\n\nApril 22, 2002, admonished Rivera that his failure to comply with\n\nthese directives would result in the dismissal of his claim.\n\nRivera did not comply.     Nor did he communicate with the court\n\nregarding any problem that he might have had either in attempting\n\nto retain new counsel or in mustering an opposition to the pending\n\nsummary judgment motion.\n\n          On May 17, 2002, the district court noted these facts and\n\nentered an order dismissing Rivera's claim.   Thirteen days later,\n\nthe court entered an order forfeiting Property C to the United\n\nStates.   The case lay essentially dormant until November 6, 2002,\n\nat which time Rivera moved pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3) and 60(b)(6)\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fto vacate the judgment.1     The district court denied the motion.\n\nThis appeal ensued.\n\n          We emphasize that this is not an appeal from the May 30,\n\n2002, decree forfeiting Property C to the United States.      Rather,\n\nthis is an appeal from the order denying Rivera's motion to vacate\n\nthat judgment.     Because Rivera's motion invoked Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n60(b)(3) and 60(b)(6), the appropriate standard of review is abuse\n\nof discretion.    See, e.g., Karak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 288 F.3d 15,\n\n19 (1st Cir. 2002); Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 891 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); Cotto v. United States, 993 F.2d 274, 277 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).   Review is de novo, however, to the extent that the appeal\n\ninvolves purely legal issues.     Simon v. Navon, 116 F.3d 1, 2 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).      In this instance, we discern neither an abuse of\n\ndiscretion nor an error of law.\n\n          To prevail under Rule 60(b)(3), a party must demonstrate\n\nthat some alleged fraud or misconduct prevented him from fully\n\npresenting his side of the case and, thus, led to the entry of an\n\nadverse judgment against him.       See Karak, 288 F.3d at 20-21.\n\nNothing of the sort occurred here:      Rivera litigated this case for\n\napproximately seven years, and he had ample opportunity to present\n\nhis side of the story.   He appears to have frittered away the years\n\n\n     1\n      Rivera also moved pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b). That\nreliance is misplaced.    In all events, Rivera has not made a\nshowing sufficient to satisfy the traditional four-part test for a\ntemporary restraining order. See, e.g., EEOC v. Astra USA, Inc.,\n94 F.3d 738, 742 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n                                  -3-\n\fin a seemingly endless series of negotiations. The district court,\n\nstruggling to bring the case to a conclusion, exhibited great\n\npatience with Rivera.\n\n            As the denouement approached, the court maintained this\n\nattitude.    It granted Rivera a reasonable period of time within\n\nwhich to retain new counsel and to file a long-overdue opposition\n\nto a pending motion for summary judgment.             The court explicitly\n\nwarned   Rivera   of   the   consequences   of   possible   noncompliance.\n\nRivera rewarded the court's patience with an unexplained failure to\n\nheed its warning.\n\n            The dismissal of Rivera's claim was due entirely to his\n\nown nonchalance.       The   record    reveals   no   plausible   basis   for\n\nascribing that adverse judgment to any fraud or misconduct on the\n\ngovernment's part.       Rivera's invocation of Rule 60(b)(3) is,\n\ntherefore, unavailing.\n\n            By the same token, Rule 60(b)(6) does not assist Rivera's\n\ncause.   That rule constitutes a catchall, which only may be relied\n\nupon in exceptional circumstances and when none of the other five\n\nsubsections of Rule 60(b) applies.          Ahmed, 118 F.3d at 891 n.9;\n\nCotto, 993 F.2d at 278.      In this case, Rivera's inaction was caused\n\nby his own neglect — a circumstance normally covered by Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 60(b)(1).2      So viewed, Rivera's \"attempt to garb [his]\n\n\n\n     2\n      Rivera does not invoke that rule, presumably because his\nneglect was plainly inexcusable.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fmotion in the raiment of clause (6) runs aground on the bedrock\n\nprinciple that clause (6) may not be used as a vehicle for\n\ncircumventing clauses (1) through (5).\"              Cotto, 993 F.2d at 278.\n\n             If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — relief\n\nunder    Rule   60(b)(6)    is   to    be    granted    only    in    exceptional\n\ncircumstances.     Here, however, Rivera has failed to show that any\n\nexceptional circumstances exist.              See, e.g., Dávila-Alvarez v.\n\nEscuela de Medicina Universidad Central del Caribe, 257 F.3d 58,\n\n62, 67 (1st Cir. 2001) (finding no exceptional circumstances when\n\nthe movant was not faultless in the delay and the non-movant had\n\nnot acted in bad faith); Cotto, 993 F.2d at 278-80 (similar;\n\nemphasizing that there was no indication of any impediment to\n\nmovants' \"ability to protect their interests in a timely manner\").\n\nRivera's invocation of Rule 60(b)(6) is, therefore, doomed to\n\nfailure.\n\n             We add an eschatocol of sorts. Rivera complains that the\n\ndistrict court \"punished\" him too severely by dismissing his claim.\n\nEven if that issue is properly before us — a matter on which we\n\ntake no view — Rivera's complaint is overblown.                 A party may not\n\nignore   a   district    court      order   with    impunity.        See   Goldman,\n\nAntonetti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer & Hertell v. Medfit Int'l, Inc.,\n\n982 F.2d 686, 692 (1st Cir. 1993).            Here, where the district court\n\nexplicitly      warned     Rivera     of     the    likely     consequences      of\n\nnoncompliance,     the   court      acted    well   within   its     authority   in\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ffollowing through on its promise.       See Young v. Gordon, 330 F.3d\n\n76, 83 (1st Cir. 2003).    After all, \"[i]n an era of burgeoning case\n\nloads and thronged dockets, effective case management has become an\n\nessential tool for handling civil litigation.\"        Tower Ventures,\n\nInc. v. City of Westfield, 296 F.3d 43, 45 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            We need go no further.3     For the foregoing reasons, we\n\nsummarily affirm the denial of Rivera's post-trial motion to vacate\n\nthe forfeiture judgment.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Rivera devotes much of his brief to an attempt to relitigate\nthe merits of the forfeiture decree. But Rivera did not file a\ntimely appeal from the entry of that decree; he appealed only the\nlater denial of his motion for relief from judgment. An appeal\nfrom an order denying a motion for relief from judgment neither\nbrings the original judgment before the court of appeals nor\nresuscitates the appellant's lapsed right to appeal the original\njudgment. See, e.g., Air Line Pilots Ass'n v. Precision Valley\nAviation, Inc., 26 F.3d 220, 223-24 (1st Cir. 1994); Rodriguez-\nAntuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., 871 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.\n1989).   Consequently, we decline Rivera's invitation to plunge\nourselves into the controversy concerning the chain of title.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",

But Rivera did not file a\ntimely appeal from the entry of that decree; he appealed only the\nlater denial of his motion for relief from judgment. An appeal\nfrom an order denying a motion for relief from judgment neither\nbrings the original judgment before the court of appeals nor\nresuscitates the appellant's lapsed right to appeal the original\njudgment.
