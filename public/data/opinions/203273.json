Mitchell, Assistant United States Attorney,\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, Paul G. Levenson,\nChief, Economic Crimes Unit, and Dina Michael Chaitowitz, Chief of\nAppeals, on supplemental brief for appellant.\n          Mark W. Pearlstein and McDermott Will & Emery LLP on\nsupplemental brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             April 30, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f             LYNCH,     Circuit   Judge.       The   government     appealed    as\n\nunreasonably lenient a sentence of thirty-six months of probation\n\n(including six months of community confinement) imposed on Michael\n\nTom, who pled guilty to five counts of insider trading in violation\n\nof   15   U.S.C.   §§    78j(b)   and    78ff(a).        We   agreed    with   the\n\nprosecution, vacated the sentence, and remanded the case to the\n\ndistrict court for resentencing in accordance with our opinion.\n\nThe Supreme Court vacated this court's judgment and remanded the\n\ncase for reconsideration under Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct.\n\n586 (2007).    See United States v. Tom, 504 F.3d 89 (1st Cir. 2007),\n\nvacated, 128 S. Ct. 1132 (2008).\n\n             We have asked for and received briefs from both sides on\n\nthe effect of Gall.       Defendant takes the position that we must now\n\naffirm the district court's sentence; the prosecution takes the\n\nposition that Gall does not affect our prior analysis and that the\n\ndistrict court's sentence is plainly an abuse of discretion on its\n\nown analysis.      We choose a middle course and, after consideration\n\nof   Gall,    remand     the   sentence       to   the   district      court   for\n\nreconsideration.        This is consistent with the approach this court\n\noutlined in United States v. Martin, 520 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             In Martin, this court interpreted Gall as incorporating\n\ncertain principles for sentencing at the district court level.\n\nFirst,\n\n             a sentencing court should not consider itself\n             constrained by the guidelines to the extent\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            that there are sound, case-specific reasons\n            for deviating from them.        Nor should a\n            sentencing court operate in the belief that\n            substantial variances from the guidelines are\n            always beyond the pale. Rather, the court\n            should \"consider every convicted person as an\n            individual and every case as a unique study in\n            the human failings that sometimes mitigate,\n            sometimes   magnify,   the   crime   and   the\n            punishment to ensue.\" Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 598.\n\nId. at 91.\n\n            In addition,\n\n            the fact that a sentencing court possesses the\n            raw power to deviate from the guidelines does\n            not mean that it can (or should) do so\n            casually. The court's reasons for deviation\n            should typically be rooted either in the\n            nature and circumstances of the offense or the\n            characteristics of the offender; must add up\n            to a plausible rationale; and must justify a\n            variance of the magnitude in question.\n\nId. (citing United States v. Scherrer, 444 F.3d 91, 93 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (en banc); United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (en banc)).\n\n            Further, \"notwithstanding this need for an increased\n\ndegree of justification commensurate with an increased degree of\n\nvariance, there is no stringent mathematical formula that cabins\n\nthe exercise of the sentencing court's discretion. Indeed, after\n\nGall the sentencing inquiry - once the court has duly calculated\n\nthe   GSR   -   ideally    is   broad,   open-ended,   and   significantly\n\ndiscretionary.\"       Id.       at   91-92   (citing   United   States   v.\n\nVega-Santiago, 519 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 2008) (en banc)).\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f               Martin also construed Gall on the principles that inform\n\nappellate review.          After considering whether the district court\n\ncommitted procedural errors, the appellate court must, giving\n\ndeference to the discretion of the district court, still consider\n\nwhether the district court sentence is substantively reasonable.\n\nId. at 92.\n\n               In our earlier opinion, we explained why we considered\n\nthe ultimate sentence in this case substantively unreasonable in\n\nlight    of     the   explanations     given    by    the   district     court   in\n\nsentencing.        See Tom, 504 F.3d at 94.         We did not then, nor do we\n\nnow, use any type of mechanistic formula or proportionality.\n\n               Our opinion identified three categories of concern with\n\nthe district court's sentence: the court's desire to avoid a\n\ndisparity of sentences between Tom and a cooperating co-defendant\n\nsentenced by another judge; the court's recognition that Tom was\n\nsubject       to   civil   sanctions    by    the    Securities    and    Exchange\n\nCommission; and the court's reliance on Tom's \"family problem,\"\n\nnamely his need to care for his daughter.             Id. at 93.    In our view,\n\nthe justifications given by the court for its lenient sentence did\n\nnot     adequately     consider   the    national      interests    in     federal\n\nsentencing, exemplified in part by the Sentencing Guidelines.                    See\n\nGall, 128 S. Ct. at 594 (\"For even though the Guidelines are\n\nadvisory rather than mandatory, they are . . . the product of\n\ncareful study based on extensive empirical evidence derived from\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fthe review of thousands of individual sentencing decisions.\"); see\n\nalso id. at 597 (\"If [the court] decides that an outside-Guidelines\n\nsentence    is   warranted,    [it]    must    consider   the    extent   of    the\n\ndeviation    and   ensure     that    the    justification      is   sufficiently\n\ncompelling to support the degree of the variance. We find it\n\nuncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a\n\nmore significant justification than a minor one.\").                  Nor did the\n\nexplanations given, in our view, justify the sentence on the basis\n\nof the defendant's individual characteristics.\n\n            The prosecution's proposal that we simply reinstate our\n\nprior reasoning and result does not strike us as sound.                    It is\n\nfairer, we think, to remand the sentence for reconsideration in\n\nlight of the concerns we expressed in our prior decision, the\n\nSupreme Court's elucidation of district court sentencing procedure\n\nin Gall, and the issues the parties have raised in their briefs to\n\nus.   Any    sentence     imposed     by    the   district   court     should   be\n\naccompanied by a new statement of reasons.\n\n            We intimate no views on what would be outside the range\n\nof sentences which are within the discretion of the district court.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f",
