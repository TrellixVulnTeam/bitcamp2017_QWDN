R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\nNo. 03-1514\n\n                          GEORGE E. KERSEY,\n\n                              Appellant.\n                        _____________________\n\n                      FERRARIS MEDICAL, INC.,\n\n                             Plaintiff.\n                       ______________________\n\n                              RUSCH, INC.,\n\n                        Plaintiff, Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                        AZIMUTH CORPORATION,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n         [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n    George Kersey on brief pro se.\n    Anne S. Mason on brief for appellee Azimuth Corporation.\n\n\n\n                            January 9, 2004\n\f     Per Curiam.   Plaintiff Ferraris Medical, Inc., the original\n\nplaintiff below, brought this action against defendant Azimuth\n\nCorporation alleging trade-dress infringement and related claims.\n\nThe district court ruled in Azimuth's favor on all counts and later\n\ngranted Azimuth's motion for attorney's fees, in an amount to be\n\ndetermined following further proceedings.       With Ferraris having\n\nbeen replaced as plaintiff by its successor-in-interest Rusch,\n\nInc., the parties then agreed to the amount of attorney's fees to\n\nbe paid by Rusch to Azimuth.     As part of that settlement, Rusch\n\nagreed to forgo its right to appeal from the fees award and from\n\nthe decision on the merits.   The instant appeal is instead brought\n\nby Attorney George Kersey, who represented Ferraris below before\n\nbeing suspended from the practice of law.    Describing himself as a\n\nreal party in interest, Kersey seeks to appeal from the district\n\ncourt's rulings on his own behalf.     We find that he lacks standing\n\nto do so and accordingly dismiss for want of jurisdiction.\n\n     The general rule is that \"[c]ounsel have standing to appeal\n\nfrom orders issued directly against them, but not from orders\n\napplicable only to their clients.\"     Uselton v. Commercial Lovelace\n\nMotor Freight, Inc., 9 F.3d 849, 854 (10th Cir. 1993) (internal\n\ncitations omitted).   For example, we have held that \"an attorney\n\nlacks separate standing to appeal from a judgment awarding or\n\ndenying fees to a party, since such concessions are granted to\n\nparties, not their attorneys.\"   Pontarelli v. Stone, 978 F.2d 773,\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f775 (1st Cir. 1992); accord, e.g., Benitez v. Collazo-Collazo, 888\n\nF.2d 930, 933 (1st Cir. 1989).          By contrast, when a monetary\n\nsanction is assessed against an attorney personally, only the\n\nattorney \"possess[es] standing to appeal from the order,\" DCPB,\n\nInc. v. City of Lebanon, 957 F.2d 913, 919 (1st Cir. 1992); the\n\nclient ordinarily has \"no pecuniary or . . . other sufficient\n\ninterest in the award to confer standing to appeal,\" Marshak v.\n\nTonetti, 813 F.2d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 1987).     This framework fails to\n\nendow Kersey with the requisite standing, since neither the order\n\nawarding attorney's fees nor the parties' settlement made any\n\nmention of Kersey being personally responsible for the payment\n\nthereof.\n\n     At the same time, we have recognized the possibility that\n\n\"special circumstances\" or \"an idiosyncratic set of facts\" might\n\nserve to \"deflect the rule's accustomed sweep.\"      DCPB, Inc., 957\n\nF.2d at 919 (internal quotation marks omitted).      Kersey seeks to\n\ninvoke such an exception by contending, for the first time in his\n\nreply brief, that Rusch has sought reimbursement of the fees award\n\nfrom him.    We find the eleventh-hour nature of this assertion to be\n\ntroubling.     Kersey's explanation for omitting any discussion of\n\nstanding from his opening brief--that he was \"not aware\" that such\n\nan issue would arise--strikes us as unpersuasive, given that\n\nAzimuth sought to dismiss an earlier appeal by Kersey on that very\n\nground and, in jettisoning that appeal, we expressly left the\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fstanding question unresolved.        As a result of this omission and\n\nrelated inaction on Kersey's part,1 Azimuth has been deprived of\n\nthe opportunity for rebuttal.\n\n      Even apart from the question of timing, however, Kersey's\n\nreimbursement   rationale   proves    unavailing.   For   purposes   of\n\nstanding, \"injury-in-fact must involve an invasion of a legally-\n\nprotected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized; and\n\n(b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"            Sea\n\nShore Corp. v. Sullivan, 158 F.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    Kersey's contention cannot pass muster\n\nunder this test.   He has provided no particulars concerning the\n\nnature of Rusch's alleged demand for reimbursement.        He has not\n\nsuggested that he has made any such payment, nor has he identified\n\nany perceived obligation (much less announced any intention) to do\n\nso.   And because he has not described the legal basis if any for\n\nRusch's demand, we have no way of gauging the likelihood that such\n\nreimbursement will be forthcoming or at least actively pursued.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Kersey's allegation is too conclusory,\n\nand the anticipated injury-in-fact too conjectural, to endow him\n\nwith standing to appeal.\n\n\n      1\n        His assertion that he \"never received a copy\" of Azimuth's\nmotion to dismiss the instant appeal for lack of standing is also\nproblematic.   Kersey was listed in the motion's certificate of\nservice with the correct address. Moreover, even after supposedly\nlearning about the motion from Azimuth's brief, Kersey still filed\nno response thereto. We note that in Kersey's earlier appeal, a\nmotion to dismiss filed by Azimuth likewise went unanswered.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fDismissed.\n\n\n\n\n             -5-\n\f",
