The  issue  in this  case, on\n                                \n\nappeal  from the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMaine, 806 F. Supp. 1030 (D. Me. 1992), is whether the  \n\nFederal Insecticide,  Fungicide and  Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)  , 7\n\nU.S.C.    136-136y (1988), preempts  state tort law claims  based\n\nupon the  alleged failure of  the manufacturers of  herbicides to\n\nprovide adequate warning language  on the products' labels, which\n\nthe Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) approved in accordance\n\nwith FIFRA's  requirements.  The  district court held  that FIFRA\n\npreempts those state law claims.  We affirm. \n\n                                I\n\n             The  plaintiffs, King  and Higgins  (and their wives)\n\nfiled this diversity tort  damage suit against four manufacturers\n\nof chemical  herbicides.  Their second  amended complaint alleged\n\nthat, as part of their duties as employees of the State of Maine,\n\nKing  and  Higgins  were engaged  in  the  \"seasonal spraying  of\n\nchemical  herbicides\";  that  \"[d]uring  the   chemical  spraying\n\noperations [they]  performed,\" King and Higgins  \"were exposed to\n\nsignificant   amounts\"   of    specified   \"chemical    products\"\n\nmanufactured by the  defendants; and that, \"as  the direct result\n\nof  their exposure  to  the herbicides,\"  King  and Higgins  have\n\nsuffered various ailments.  \n\n             The complaint contained two counts.  Count I  charged\n\nthe defendants with negligence  because they \"failed to warn  the\n\nPlaintiffs .  . .  of  the harm  and danger  of  exposure to  the\n\nchemical  products listed  above, failed  to  advise them  how to\n\n                               -2-\n                                2\n\nsafely use the products and failed to warn them of the long term,\n\npermanent physical  injuries which  would follow  said exposure.\"\n\nCount  II alleged strict liability and  tort theories, based upon\n\nthe  defendants  having  \"placed  into  the  stream  of  commerce\n\nunreasonably dangerous and defective chemical  products, rendered\n\nunreasonably dangerous by the  absence of an adequate warning  to\n\nthe  ultimate consumers and users  thereof of the  short term and\n\nlong  term permanent  physical injuries  resulting from  exposure\n\nthereto.\"   At oral  argument, the  plaintiffs admitted  that the\n\nsole basis  of their  complaint  was the  defendants' failure  to\n\nprovide adequate warnings.\n\n             The parties  stipulated that  the labels  on all  the\n\nherbicides involved  had been  submitted to  and approved by  the\n\nEPA, as FIFRA required.  \n\n             The  district court  granted the  defendants'  motion\n\nfor   summary  judgment,   holding  that   FIFRA  preempted   the\n\nplaintiffs' claims.  806 F. Supp. at 1037.   The court, following\n\nthe preemption  standards the Supreme Court  applied in Cipollone\n                                                                 \n\nv. Liggett Group, Inc., 112 S. Ct. 2608, 2617 (1992), held:\n                      \n\n                  Because the  language of FIFRA\n                  mandates the preemption of the\n                  establishment  or  enforcement\n                  or  any  common law  duty that\n                  would   impose   a    labeling\n                  requirement  inconsistent with\n                  those established  by the Act,\n                  or   the   EPA's  regulations,\n                  Plaintiffs' common law failure\n                  to  warn claims  are preempted\n                  as a matter of law.  \n806 F. Supp. at 1037.\n\n                                II\n\n                               -3-\n                                3\n\n             A.   FIFRA provides a detailed  scheme for regulating\n\nthe content of an  herbicide's label.  All herbicides sold in the\n\nUnited States must be registered for use by the EPA.   7 U.S.C.  \n\n136a(a).     The  EPA   has  promulgated  comprehensive  labeling\n\nrequirements governing the scope,  content, wording and format of\n\nherbicide  labeling.  40 C.F.R.    156 (1992).   The manufacturer\n\nitself  designs and formulates the content of the label, and must\n\nfile with  the EPA a  statement which  includes \"the name  of the\n\npesticide,\"  \"a complete copy of the labeling of the pesticide, a\n\nstatement of all claims to be made for it and  any directions for\n\nits  use,\"  and \"a  full description  of the  tests made  and the\n\nresults  thereof upon which  the claims are  based.\"  7  U.S.C.  \n\n136a(c)(1)(B)-(D).\n\n             Section 136v provides in pertinent part:\n\n                  (a) In  general.  A  State may\n                  regulate  the  sale or  use of\n                  any    federally    registered\n                  pesticide  or  device  in  the\n                  State, but only if and  to the\n                  extent the regulation does not\n                  permit   any   sale   or   use\n                  prohibited by this subchapter.\n\n                  (b)  Uniformity.   Such  State\n                  shall  not impose  or continue\n                  in effect any requirements for\n                  labeling   or   packaging   in\n                  addition to  or different from\n                  those   required   under  this\n                  subchapter.\n\nId.   136v.\n  \n\n             B.   Cipollone  recently  summarized  the   standards\n                           \n\ngoverning preemption analysis:\n\n                               -4-\n                                4\n\n                  The purpose of Congress is the\n                  ultimate  touchstone  of  pre-\n                  emption analysis.\n\n                       Congress'  intent may  be\n                  explicitly   stated   in   the\n                  statute's      language     or\n                  implicitly  contained  in  its\n                  structure and purpose.  In the\n                  absence    of    an    express\n                  congressional  command,  state\n                  law is pre-empted if  that law\n                  actually     conflicts    with\n                  federal law, or if federal law\n                  so   thoroughly   occupies   a\n                  legislative  field as  to make\n                  reasonable the  inference that\n                  Congress left no room  for the\n                  States to supplement it.\n\nCipollone, 112 S. Ct. at  2617 (citations and internal quotations\n         \n\nomitted).\n\n             Cipollone  involved similar  preemption provisions of\n                      \n\nthe   federal   statutes   governing   cigarette   labelling  and\n\nadvertising.   The suit concerned a woman who died of lung cancer\n\nafter smoking for many years.  It was a state  tort law diversity\n\nsuit  against  the cigarette  manufacturers,  charging  them with\n\nresponsibility for  her death because, among  other things, \"they\n\nfailed to warn  consumers about the hazards of smoking.\"   Id. at\n                                                             \n\n2613.    The  defendants  contended that  the  Federal  Cigarette\n\nLabelling and Advertising Act  (1965 Act), Pub. L. No.  89-92, 79\n\nStat. 282 (1965) (codified  as amended at 15 U.S.C.     1331-1340\n\n(1988)), and  its successor, the Public  Health Cigarette Smoking\n\nAct of  1969 (1969 Act), Pub.  L. No. 91-222, 84  Stat. 87 (1969)\n\n(codified as amended  at 15 U.S.C.     1331-1340), preempted  the\n\nclaims.    Those  Acts  required  health  warnings  on  cigarette\n\n                               -5-\n                                5\n\npackaging,  but  barred  the  requirement  of  such  warnings  in\n\ncigarette advertising. \n\n             Section  5 of  the 1965 Act,  captioned \"Preemption,\"\n\nprovided in relevant part:\n\n                  (b)  No statement  relating to\n                  smoking  and  health shall  be\n                  required in the advertising of\n                  any cigarettes the packages of\n                  which    are    labeled     in\n                  conformity with the provisions\n                  of this Act.\n\nFederal  Cigarette  Labelling  and  Advertising  Act,  quoted  in\n                                                                 \n\nCipollone, 112 S. Ct. at 2616.\n         \n\n             The Court  held that this  provision \"only pre-empted\n\nstate  and federal  rulemaking  bodies from  mandating particular\n\ncautionary  statements and  did  not pre-empt  state law  damages\n\nactions.\"  Cipollone, 112 S. Ct. at 2619 (footnote omitted).\n                    \n\n             This provision was changed by the 1969 Act to read:\n\n                  (b)      No   requirement   or\n                  prohibition  based on  smoking\n                  and  health  shall be  imposed\n                  under  State law  with respect\n                  to    the    advertising    or\n                  promotion  of  any  cigarettes\n                  the  packages   of  which  are\n                  labeled in conformity with the\n                  provisions of this Act.\n\nPublic Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, quoted in Cipollone,\n                                                                \n\n112 S. Ct. at 2616.  See also 15 U.S.C.   1334(b) (1988).\n                             \n\n             The  Court held  that  this provision  preempted  the\n\nplaintiff's  state  law  tort  claims based  on  the  defendants'\n\nfailure to warn of the  hazards of cigarette smoking.  The  Court\n\nstated  that  \"[t]he  phrase  '[n]o  requirement  or prohibition'\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nsweeps  broadly  and  suggests no  distinction  between  positive\n\nenactments and  common law; to  the contrary, those  words easily\n\nencompass obligations  that take the  form of common  law rules.\"\n\nCipollone, 112  S.  Ct.  at 2620.    It,  therefore,  \"reject[ed]\n         \n\npetitioner's   argument   that   the   phrase   'requirement   or\n\nprohibition' limits the 1969  Act's pre-emptive scope to positive\n\nenactments  by legislatures and agencies.\"   Id.   The Court held\n                                               \n\nthat \"insofar  as  claims under  either  failure to  warn  theory\n\nrequire  a showing  that  respondents'  post-1969 advertising  or\n\npromotions  should  have  included  additional, or  more  clearly\n\nstated, warnings, those claims are pre-empted.  The Act does not,\n\nhowever,  pre-empt  petitioner's  claims  that  rely  solely   on\n\nrespondents' testing  or  research  practices  or  other  actions\n\nunrelated to advertising or promotion.\"  Id. at 2621-22.\n                                           \n\n             Only  four Justices  joined  in the  portion  of  the\n\nopinion that held that the 1969 Act preempted the failure to warn\n\ntort  claims.  In his opinion  concurring in the judgment in part\n\nand dissenting in part (in which Justice Thomas joined), however,\n\nJustice  Scalia  stated that  he  \"agree[d]\"  with the  following\n\nstatements  in the plurality opinion:  \"that 'the language of the\n\n[1969] Act plainly reaches  beyond [positive] enactments,';  that\n\nthe  general  tort-law  duties  petitioner  invokes  against  the\n\ncigarette   companies   can,   as  a   general   matter,   impose\n\n'requirement[s] or  prohibition[s]' within the meaning  of   5(b)\n\nof the 1969 Act; and that the phrase 'State law'  as used in that\n\nprovision embraces  state common  law.\"  Id.  at 2634  (citations\n                                           \n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nomitted).    Justice  Scalia   also  referred  to  the  plurality\n\nopinion's \"correct disposition of petitioner's  post-1969 failure\n\nto  warn claims.\"    Id.  at  2637.    Justice  Scalia's  partial\n                       \n\ndisagreement  with the plurality was that he would have held that\n\nthe failure  to warn claims  under the  1965 Act and  all of  the\n\nclaims under the 1969 Act were preempted.  Id. at 2632.\n                                             \n\n             In these circumstances, the holding  in the plurality\n\nopinion that  the 1969 Act preempted  the plaintiff's failure-to-\n\nwarn claim fairly can be said to constitute the view of the Court\n\nbecause six members  of the Court  concurred in that  conclusion.\n\nSee Shaw  v. Dow Brands, Inc., No. 92-2323, 1993 WL 166324, at *6\n                            \n\nn.4 (7th Cir. May 18, 1993).\n\n             The   Supreme  Court   itself   has   indicated  that\n\nCipollone  applies to  FIFRA preemption  determinations.   In the\n         \n\nPapas v.  Upjohn Co.  and Arkansas-Platte cases  discussed below,\n                                         \n\nthe  Court  vacated two  courts of  appeals judgments  that FIFRA\n\nimpliedly preempted state law failure-to-warn claims and remanded\n\nfor  those  courts to  reconsider  their  decisions in  light  of\n\nCipollone.\n         \n\n             B.   We  hold  that,  in  light  of  Cipollone, FIFRA\n                                                           \n\npreempts  the plaintiffs'  state  law tort  claims  based on  the\n\ndefendants' alleged  failure to  provide adequate  warnings about\n\nthe health hazards of the herbicides they manufactured and sold.\n\n             The warnings  on the  labels of  the herbicides  King\n\nand Higgins used in spraying  were approved by the EPA, as  FIFRA\n\nrequired.  If  the plaintiffs  could recover on  their state  law\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nclaims that, despite this labeling, the defendants had failed  to\n\nprovide  adequate warning, those  additional warnings necessarily\n\nwould be \"in addition  to or different from those  required under\n\nthis  subchapter.\"  7 U.S.C.   136v(b).  The question, therefore,\n\nis whether state law liability based upon  such defective warning\n\nwould  constitute  the  \"impos[ition]\"   by  the  state  of  \"any\n\nrequirements for  labeling or  packaging\" under section  136v(b).\n\nId.\n  \n\n             Cipollone held that  the words in the 1969  cigarette\n                      \n\nstatute  \"'[n]o   requirement  or  prohibition'  .   .  .  easily\n\nencompass[ed]  obligations  that  take  the form  of  common  law\n\nrules.\"   Cipollone,  112 S.  Ct.  at 2620.   The  FIFRA language\n                   \n\nprohibiting the states from \"impos[ing] or continu[ing] in effect\n\nany   requirements,\"   7   U.S.C.       136v(b),   is   virtually\n\nindistinguishable from the  state-imposed \"requirement\"  language\n\nthat Cipollone held  preempted the state  common law tort  claims\n              \n\nbased on inadequate warning.  FIFRA's language, too, preempts the\n\nstate law lack-of-warning claims involved in this case.\n\n             The plaintiffs contend  that the reference in section\n\n136v(b) to \"Such  State\" means the state  described in subsection\n\n(a), namely, a state that has \"regulate[d] the sale or use of any\n\nfederally registered  pesticide.\"  From this,  they conclude that\n\nthe prescription  provision of  subsection (b) covers  only state\n\nregulation,  but not  state common  law claims.   Subsection (a),\n\nhowever,  is a grant  of authority to the  states to regulate the\n\n\"sale or use\" of pesticides, not a limitation upon the preemptive\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\neffect of subsection (b).  The word \"Such\" in subsection (b) does\n\nnot  limit  to  state  regulation  the  state  \"requirements  for\n\nlabeling or packaging\" which that section preempts.\n\n             The legislative  history  of the  1972 amendments  to\n\nFIFRA, which  added  section 136v  to the  statute, supports  our\n\nconclusion.   The Senate Committee Report on the provision stated\n\nthat  section 136v(b)  \"preempts  any State  or local  government\n\nlabeling   or   packaging   requirements   differing   from  such\n\nrequirements under  the Act.\"  S.

The House Committee Report stated:\n\n\"[i]n  dividing the  responsibility  between the  States and  the\n\nFederal Government  for the management of  an effective pesticide\n\nprogram,  the Committee has adopted language which is intended to\n\ncompletely  preempt State  authority  in regard  to labeling  and\n\npackaging.\"   H.R.

Papas,  112 S.  Ct. 3020 (1992).   On  remand the\n                     \n\ncourt of  appeals concluded that \"FIFRA  expressly preempts state\n\ncommon  law  actions  against  manufacturers   of  EPA-registered\n\npesticides to  the extent  that such  actions  are predicated  on\n\nclaims of inadequate  labeling or  packaging.\"   Papas, 985  F.2d\n                                                      \n\n516, 520 (11th Cir. 1993).

To the extent\n                  that state tort claims in this\n                  case  require  a showing  that\n                  defendants'    labeling    and\n                  packaging should have included\n                  additional,    different,   or\n                  alternatively  stated warnings\n                  from   those  required   under\n                  FIFRA, they would be expressly\n                  preempted.\n\nId.\n  \n\n             In Shaw,  1993 WL  166324, the  Seventh Circuit  held\n                    \n\nthat FIFRA preempted  a state law claim  based on failure-to-warn\n\nof the dangers of a chemical stain remover.  The court stated:\n\n                  In  order  to  succeed in  the\n                  wake of  Cipollone, then, Shaw\n                                    \n                  would   have   to  show   that\n                  FIFRA's  pre-emption  language\n                  is  less   sweeping  than  the\n\n                               -12-\n                                12\n\n                  language of the 1969 Cigarette\n                  Act.   Yet  we can  discern no\n                  significant   distinction   at\n                  all--FIFRA  says  that \"[s]uch\n                  State shall not  impose *  * *\n                  any requirements  for labeling\n                  or packaging in addition to or\n                  different from  those required\n                  *  * *,\"  while the  cigarette\n                  law says \"[n]o  requirement[s]\n                  or     prohibition[s]    * * *\n                  imposed under State law\" shall\n                  be   permitted.     Both  seem\n                  equally   emphatic:      \"[n]o\n                  requirements  or prohibitions\"\n                  is just another way  of saying\n                  a  \"[s]tate  shall not  impose\n                  * * * any  requirements.\"  Not\n                  even the  most dedicated hair-\n                  splitter   could   distinguish\n                  these  statements.   If common\n                  law  actions  cannot   survive\n                  under the  1969 cigarette law,\n                  then  common  law actions  for\n                  labeling and packaging defects\n                  cannot survive under FIFRA.\n\nId. at *6.  \n  \n\n             C.

The  court\n\nreasoned that \"Chevron can comply with both federal and state law\n\nby continuing to use the EPA-approved label and by simultaneously\n\npaying  damages  to  successful   tort  plaintiffs  such  as  Mr.\n\nFerebee.\"  Id. at 1541.\n             \n\n                               -13-\n                                13\n\n             In  deciding  Ferebee,  the   District  of   Columbia\n                                  \n\nCircuit  did  not  have  the   benefit  of  the  Supreme  Court's\n\nsubsequent analysis and ruling in Cipollone.

All herbicides sold in the\n\nUnited States must be registered for use by the EPA.   7 U.S.C.  \n\n136a(a).     The  EPA   has  promulgated  comprehensive  labeling\n\nrequirements governing the scope,  content, wording and format of\n\nherbicide  labeling.  40 C.F.R.    156 (1992).   The manufacturer\n\nitself  designs and formulates the content of the label, and must\n\nfile with  the EPA a  statement which  includes \"the name  of the\n\npesticide,\"  \"a complete copy of the labeling of the pesticide, a\n\nstatement of all claims to be made for it and  any directions for\n\nits  use,\"  and \"a  full description  of the  tests made  and the\n\nresults  thereof upon which  the claims are  based.\"  7  U.S.C.  \n\n136a(c)(1)(B)-(D).\n\n             Section 136v provides in pertinent part:\n\n                  (a) In  general.

The suit concerned a woman who died of lung cancer\n\nafter smoking for many years.  It was a state  tort law diversity\n\nsuit  against  the cigarette  manufacturers,  charging  them with\n\nresponsibility for  her death because, among  other things, \"they\n\nfailed to warn  consumers about the hazards of smoking.\"   Id. at\n                                                             \n\n2613.    The  defendants  contended that  the  Federal  Cigarette\n\nLabelling and Advertising Act  (1965 Act), Pub. L.

No. 91-222, 84  Stat. 87 (1969)\n\n(codified as amended  at 15 U.S.C.     1331-1340), preempted  the\n\nclaims.

Ct. at 2619 (footnote omitted).\n                    \n\n             This provision was changed by the 1969 Act to read:\n\n                  (b)      No   requirement   or\n                  prohibition  based on  smoking\n                  and  health  shall be  imposed\n                  under  State law  with respect\n                  to    the    advertising    or\n                  promotion  of  any  cigarettes\n                  the  packages   of  which  are\n                  labeled in conformity with the\n                  provisions of this Act.\n\nPublic Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, quoted in Cipollone,\n                                                                \n\n112 S.

The  Court\n\nstated  that  \"[t]he  phrase  '[n]o  requirement  or prohibition'\n\n                               -6-\n                                6\n\nsweeps  broadly  and  suggests no  distinction  between  positive\n\nenactments and  common law; to  the contrary, those  words easily\n\nencompass obligations  that take the  form of common  law rules.\"\n\nCipollone, 112  S.  Ct.  at 2620.    It,  therefore,  \"reject[ed]\n         \n\npetitioner's   argument   that   the   phrase   'requirement   or\n\nprohibition' limits the 1969  Act's pre-emptive scope to positive\n\nenactments  by legislatures and agencies.\"   Id.   The Court held\n                                               \n\nthat \"insofar  as  claims under  either  failure to  warn  theory\n\nrequire  a showing  that  respondents'  post-1969 advertising  or\n\npromotions  should  have  included  additional, or  more  clearly\n\nstated, warnings, those claims are pre-empted.  The Act does not,\n\nhowever,  pre-empt  petitioner's  claims  that  rely  solely   on\n\nrespondents' testing  or  research  practices  or  other  actions\n\nunrelated to advertising or promotion.\"  Id. at 2621-22.\n                                           \n\n             Only  four Justices  joined  in the  portion  of  the\n\nopinion that held that the 1969 Act preempted the failure to warn\n\ntort  claims.  In his opinion  concurring in the judgment in part\n\nand dissenting in part (in which Justice Thomas joined), however,\n\nJustice  Scalia  stated that  he  \"agree[d]\"  with the  following\n\nstatements  in the plurality opinion:  \"that 'the language of the\n\n[1969] Act plainly reaches  beyond [positive] enactments,';  that\n\nthe  general  tort-law  duties  petitioner  invokes  against  the\n\ncigarette   companies   can,   as  a   general   matter,   impose\n\n'requirement[s] or  prohibition[s]' within the meaning  of   5(b)\n\nof the 1969 Act; and that the phrase 'State law'  as used in that\n\nprovision embraces  state common  law.\"  Id.  at 2634  (citations\n                                           \n\n                               -7-\n                                7\n\nomitted).    Justice  Scalia   also  referred  to  the  plurality\n\nopinion's \"correct disposition of petitioner's  post-1969 failure\n\nto  warn claims.\"    Id.  at  2637.    Justice  Scalia's  partial\n                       \n\ndisagreement  with the plurality was that he would have held that\n\nthe failure  to warn claims  under the  1965 Act and  all of  the\n\nclaims under the 1969 Act were preempted.  Id. at 2632.\n                                             \n\n             In these circumstances, the holding  in the plurality\n\nopinion that  the 1969 Act preempted  the plaintiff's failure-to-\n\nwarn claim fairly can be said to constitute the view of the Court\n\nbecause six members  of the Court  concurred in that  conclusion.\n\nSee Shaw  v.

May 18, 1993).\n\n             The   Supreme  Court   itself   has   indicated  that\n\nCipollone  applies to  FIFRA preemption  determinations.   In the\n         \n\nPapas v.  Upjohn Co.  and Arkansas-Platte cases  discussed below,\n                                         \n\nthe  Court  vacated two  courts of  appeals judgments  that FIFRA\n\nimpliedly preempted state law failure-to-warn claims and remanded\n\nfor  those  courts to  reconsider  their  decisions in  light  of\n\nCipollone.\n         \n\n             B.   We  hold  that,  in  light  of  Cipollone, FIFRA\n                                                           \n\npreempts  the plaintiffs'  state  law tort  claims  based on  the\n\ndefendants' alleged  failure to  provide adequate  warnings about\n\nthe health hazards of the herbicides they manufactured and sold.\n\n             The warnings  on the  labels of  the herbicides  King\n\nand Higgins used in spraying  were approved by the EPA, as  FIFRA\n\nrequired.  If  the plaintiffs  could recover on  their state  law\n\n                               -8-\n                                8\n\nclaims that, despite this labeling, the defendants had failed  to\n\nprovide  adequate warning, those  additional warnings necessarily\n\nwould be \"in addition  to or different from those  required under\n\nthis  subchapter.\"  7 U.S.C.   136v(b).  The question, therefore,\n\nis whether state law liability based upon  such defective warning\n\nwould  constitute  the  \"impos[ition]\"   by  the  state  of  \"any\n\nrequirements for  labeling or  packaging\" under section  136v(b).\n\nId.\n  \n\n             Cipollone held that  the words in the 1969  cigarette\n                      \n\nstatute  \"'[n]o   requirement  or  prohibition'  .   .  .  easily\n\nencompass[ed]  obligations  that  take  the form  of  common  law\n\nrules.\"   Cipollone,  112 S.  Ct.  at 2620.   The  FIFRA language\n                   \n\nprohibiting the states from \"impos[ing] or continu[ing] in effect\n\nany   requirements,\"   7   U.S.C.       136v(b),   is   virtually\n\nindistinguishable from the  state-imposed \"requirement\"  language\n\nthat Cipollone held  preempted the state  common law tort  claims\n              \n\nbased on inadequate warning.  FIFRA's language, too, preempts the\n\nstate law lack-of-warning claims involved in this case.\n\n             The plaintiffs contend  that the reference in section\n\n136v(b) to \"Such  State\" means the state  described in subsection\n\n(a), namely, a state that has \"regulate[d] the sale or use of any\n\nfederally registered  pesticide.\"  From this,  they conclude that\n\nthe prescription  provision of  subsection (b) covers  only state\n\nregulation,  but not  state common  law claims.   Subsection (a),\n\nhowever,  is a grant  of authority to the  states to regulate the\n\n\"sale or use\" of pesticides, not a limitation upon the preemptive\n\n                               -9-\n                                9\n\neffect of subsection (b).  The word \"Such\" in subsection (b) does\n\nnot  limit  to  state  regulation  the  state  \"requirements  for\n\nlabeling or packaging\" which that section preempts.\n\n             The legislative  history  of the  1972 amendments  to\n\nFIFRA, which  added  section 136v  to the  statute, supports  our\n\nconclusion.   The Senate Committee Report on the provision stated\n\nthat  section 136v(b)  \"preempts  any State  or local  government\n\nlabeling   or   packaging   requirements   differing   from  such\n\nrequirements under  the Act.\"  S.

Yet  we can  discern no\n                  significant   distinction   at\n                  all--FIFRA  says  that \"[s]uch\n                  State shall not  impose *  * *\n                  any requirements  for labeling\n                  or packaging in addition to or\n                  different from  those required\n                  *  * *,\"  while the  cigarette\n                  law says \"[n]o  requirement[s]\n                  or     prohibition[s]    * * *\n                  imposed under State law\" shall\n                  be   permitted.
