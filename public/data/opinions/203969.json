The   Commissioner   of    the\n\nMassachusetts Department of Correction (the \"DOC\") appeals an\n\ninjunction entered in favor of the plaintiffs-appellees Mac S.\n\nHudson and Derrick Tyler (together, the \"Plaintiffs\").            After\n\ncareful consideration, we affirm.\n\n            The Plaintiffs are Muslim inmates in the custody of the\n\nDOC.   In 2001, they filed a non-class action complaint, later\n\namended, asserting that the Commissioner violated their right to\n\nfreely exercise their religion.\n\n            At issue in this appeal is the ability to participate in\n\nJum'ah, which is \"a Friday group prayer that is obligatory for\n\nMuslims.\"    Hudson v. Dennehy, 538 F. Supp. 2d 400, 404 n.4 (D.\n\nMass. 2008).   At the time of the filing of their Amended Complaint,\n\nthe Plaintiffs were housed in an special management unit (\"SMU\") at\n\nMCI-Cedar Junction known as \"Ten Block.\"      SMUs are housing units\n\nseparate from the general population of the prison \"in which\n\ninmates may be confined for reasons of administrative segregation,\n\nprotective custody, or disciplinary detention.\"        103 Mass. Code\n\nRegs. 423.06. Plaintiffs alleged that, \"[w]hile segregated, [they]\n\nare denied the right to attend mandatory Jumah services.\"             They\n\nfurther alleged that \"[p]risoners with televisions may participate\n\nin the prison's Jumah services, which are broadcast via closed-\n\ncircuit televisions,\" but that \"[t]he DOC presently denies [the\n\nPlaintiffs] access to a television and, therefore, access to Jumah\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fservices.\"     In their prayer for relief, the Plaintiffs sought \"a\n\npermanent injunction ordering Defendant . . . to allow Plaintiff to\n\nattend all Jumah services either in person or via closed-circuit\n\ntelevision.\"\n\n           The   district   court   conducted     a    six-day   bench   trial\n\nconcerning Plaintiffs' claims.1         After trial, the district court\n\napplied the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n\n(\"RLUIPA\"), which provides that:\n\n           No government shall impose a substantial\n           burden on the religious exercise of a person\n           residing in or confined to an institution, as\n           defined in [42 U.S.C. ยง 1997], even if the\n           burden results from a rule of general\n           applicability,    unless    the    government\n           demonstrates that imposition of the burden on\n           that person-\n\n           (1) is in furtherance of               a    compelling\n           governmental interest; and\n\n           (2) is the least restrictive means of\n           furthering that compelling  governmental\n           interest.\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-1(a).        The district court ruled that \"[t]he\n\nDOC's ban on personal participation in Jum'ah services by inmates\n\nconfined in Ten Block serves the compelling State interest of\n\nrehabilitating prisoners and promoting good order.\" Hudson, 538 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 412.     However, the court further ruled that \"[t]he ban\n\non   participation   by   Ten   Block   inmates   in    Jum'ah   services   by\n\n\n1\n   The trial encompassed other religious freedom claims as well,\nbut the district court's resolution of those claims is not\nchallenged on appeal.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fclosed-circuit television is not the least restrictive means of\n\nvindicating\" the compelling state interests of the DOC, noting that\n\n\"the DOC does not contend that there is any technical reason that\n\nprevents     the   broadcast      of    Jum'ah     services       by    closed-circuit\n\ntelevision to Muslim inmates in Ten Block.\"                  Id. at 412 & n.24.\n\n             The district court later entered an injunction requiring\n\nclosed-circuit broadcasting of Jum'ah \"[w]henever Plaintiffs are\n\nhoused     in    the    Special     Management     Unit,\"2        not   limiting    its\n\ninjunction to the SMU at MCI-Cedar Junction. When the Commissioner\n\nsought    clarification,       the     district     court    confirmed       that   the\n\ninjunction required closed circuit television broadcasts of Jum'ah\n\nservices in any SMU in which Plaintiffs may be housed in the\n\nfuture.\n\n             The       Commissioner     then     moved      for     reconsideration,\n\nattaching the affidavit of Jeffrey Quick, the DOC's Director of\n\nResource Management (the \"Quick Affidavit\").                  The Quick Affidavit\n\noutlined the significant technical, operational, physical plant,\n\nand   cost      impediments    to      providing    closed-circuit         television\n\nbroadcasts to certain SMUs located at prisons other than MCI-Cedar\n\n\n\n2\n    The injunction states in relevant part:\n\n      Whenever Plaintiffs are housed in the Special Management\n      Unit, Defendant shall provide access to a closed circuit\n      television set that displays, through sound and images,\n      a live broadcast of such communal Jum'ah services as are\n      regularly held on each and every Friday for the duration\n      of their incarceration . . . .\n\n                                          -4-\n\fJunction.      The   Quick    Affidavit      further   noted   that   Tyler   was\n\n\"presently incarcerated in the general population of MCI-Cedar\n\nJunction,\" and that Hudson was \"presently incarcerated at [Old\n\nColony   Correctional        Center]   and     is   housed     in   the   general\n\npopulation.\"\n\n            That same day, the district court denied the motion for\n\nreconsideration, stating:\n\n            After hearing, the motion is denied without\n            prejudice.    Plaintiff Hudson is currently\n            confined in general population at the Old\n            Colony Correctional Facility.     Accordingly,\n            there is no actual controversy appropriate for\n            judicial resolution.\n\nThe Commissioner subsequently filed a notice of appeal that listed\n\nonly the denial of the motion for reconsideration.\n\n            As an initial matter, the Plaintiffs contend that the\n\nonly decision on appeal is the district court's denial of the\n\nCommissioner's motion for reconsideration.               They point out that\n\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 provides that \"[t]he notice\n\nof appeal must . . . designate the judgment, order, or part thereof\n\nbeing appealed,\" Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(B), and the notice of\n\nappeal   here    only    lists     the       denial    of    the    motion    for\n\nreconsideration.3     Indeed, \"an appeal from an order denying such a\n\n\n3\n    The notice states in full:\n\n      Notice is hereby given that Harold W. Clarke,\n      Commissioner  of   the  Massachusetts  Department  of\n      Correction, defendant in the above named case, hereby\n      appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the\n\n                                       -5-\n\fmotion is generally not considered to be an appeal from the\n\nunderlying judgment.\"            Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars, Inc., 304\n\nF.3d    1,     3   (1st     Cir.      2002)     (discussing       a    motion      for\n\nreconsideration).\n\n              However, \"our precedents encourage us to construe notices\n\nof appeal liberally and examine them in the context of the record\n\nas a whole.\"       Id.    Although the notice of appeal only lists the\n\ndenial of the motion for reconsideration, it references the \"Final\n\nJudgment with Regard to Broadcast of Jum'ah Services in Special\n\nManagement Units Other Than Ten Block.\"               \"Read in context, this\n\nreference is consistent with a desire to have this court review the\n\npropriety of the\" injunction with respect to Jum'ah services.                      Id.\n\nat 4 (noting that notice of appeal only listing denial of motion\n\nfor    reconsideration         also   referenced    dismissal         for   want   of\n\nprosecution, which reflected an intent to reach the dismissal).\n\nMoreover,      \"both     sides    have    fully    briefed    the      merits,     and\n\nundertaking appellate review of the original order . . . would not\n\nunfairly prejudice\" the Plaintiffs. See id. Although we recognize\n\nthat \"rescue missions are not automatic, and litigants will do well\n\nto    draft    notices    of     appeal   with    care,\"     we   will      give   the\n\n\n\n\n       First Circuit from the Order denying Defendant's Motion\n       for Reconsideration of Final Judgment with Regard to\n       Broadcast of Jum'ah Services in Special Management Units\n       Other Than Ten Block, entered in this action on June 19,\n       2008.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fCommissioner the benefit of the doubt and treat the injunction\n\nitself as properly before us.             Id. at 3.\n\n            \"[T]he scope of [an] injunction is reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\" Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Lรณpez-Freytes, 522 F.3d 136,\n\n142-43    (1st   Cir.       2008).      The   Commissioner    contends   that     the\n\ndistrict court erred by entering a prospective injunction that\n\napplies to all SMUs without making findings as to whether SMUs\n\nother than Ten Block are suitable for closed circuit television\n\nbroadcasts       of    Ju'mah        services.      Thus,    according       to   the\n\nCommissioner,         the   prospective       injunction    violates   the    Prison\n\nLitigation Reform Act (the \"PLRA\"), which requires \"prospective\n\nrelief\" to be \"narrowly drawn, extend[] no further than necessary\n\nto correct the violation of the Federal right, and [be] the least\n\nintrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal\n\nright.\"    18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(1)(A).             The Commissioner also relies\n\non RLUIPA, contending that the DOC can demonstrate that it has a\n\n\"compelling governmental interest\" in not providing closed circuit\n\nbroadcasting of Ju'mah services to SMUs other than Ten Block given\n\nthe high cost of providing such services, see Baranowski v. Hart,\n\n486 F.3d 112, 125 (5th Cir. 2007) (compelling interest standard met\n\nunder RLUIPA when prison budget not adequate to cover Kosher\n\nmeals), and the resultant imposition such a requirement would put\n\non the Commissioner's discretion to assign the Plaintiffs to\n\ndifferent facilities.\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f           We conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion.     Although the Plaintiffs' allegations in their Amended\n\nComplaint focused on the lack of closed-circuit broadcasting in Ten\n\nBlock, their prayer for relief was not limited to Ten Block.\n\nPlaintiffs plainly sought system-wide relief.               Despite being on\n\nnotice of this claim for relief, the Commissioner did not present\n\nduring the bench trial any of the evidence contained in the Quick\n\nAffidavit, despite having the \"onus\" to show that the burden it\n\nplaced on the Plaintiffs' religious exercise \"furthers a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest and . . . that the burden is the least\n\nrestrictive means of achieving that compelling interest.\"                 Spratt\n\nv. R.I. Dep't of Corrs., 482 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding\n\nthat, under RLUIPA, once a plaintiff establishes a substantial\n\nburden on the exercise of his or her religion, the \"onus shifts to\n\nthe government\"). Instead, the Commissioner provided evidence that\n\nthe DOC's system-wide policy banning televisions in SMUs was due to\n\n(1) the temporary nature of SMU detention; (2) the security risks\n\nassociated with having a television in an inmate's cell; and\n\n(3) the DOC's desire to avoid any incentive for inmates to seek SMU\n\ndetention.      A witness, MCI-Cedar Junction Deputy Superintendent\n\nLisa Mitchell, testified that there was no technical reason that\n\nprevents   the    broadcast   of   Jum'ah   services    by    closed-circuit\n\ntelevision to Muslim inmates in Ten Block, but the Commissioner did\n\nnot   provide    evidence   that   this   was   not   the    case   for    other\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\ffacilities.     In fact, the Commissioner provided testimony, through\n\nits Acting Deputy Commissioner, John Marshall, that the DOC sought\n\nto create a universal SMU policy to alleviate any differences in\n\nSMU policies among various facilities.\n\n           Given the record before it, the district court tailored\n\nan injunction that was consistent with the PLRA's directive that\n\nall \"prospective relief\" be \"narrowly drawn,\" \"extend[] no further\n\nthan necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right,\" and\n\nbe the \"least intrusive means necessary to remedy the violation of\n\na Federal right.\"       18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(1)(A).                     The Plaintiffs\n\nestablished a substantial burden on the exercise of their religion,\n\nand, in evaluating whether to enable Plaintiffs to participate in\n\nJum'ah services in person or provide closed-circuit broadcasting of\n\nsuch services, the district court found that providing closed-\n\ncircuit broadcasting was the least intrusive means to alleviate\n\nthat burden on the Plaintiffs.           See Hudson, 538 F. Supp. 2d at 412.\n\nThe   Commissioner    put    nothing     in     the    record     to    differentiate\n\nfacilities    other   than   Ten    Block       on    the   issues     of   compelling\n\ngovernmental interest or least restrictive means.                    Moreover, under\n\nRLUIPA,   the   Commissioner       had    the    burden      to   put    forward   his\n\nadditional evidence at trial and failed to do so.                    See Spratt, 482\n\nF.3d at 38.     The district court is not a mind reader, and, given\n\nthe Commissioner's failure to provide the additional evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fcontained in the Quick Affidavit at trial, we conclude that no\n\nabuse of discretion occurred in framing the injunction.\n\n             For substantially the same reasons, the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying the Commissioner's motion\n\nfor reconsideration.     \"We review a trial court's decision denying\n\na Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment for manifest abuse\n\nof discretion.\"      Vasapolli v. Rostoff, 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).      We have emphasized that Rule 59(e) \"does not provide a\n\nvehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures, and it\n\ncertainly does not allow a party to introduce new evidence or\n\nadvance arguments that could and should have been presented to the\n\ndistrict court prior to the judgment.\" Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118\n\nF.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1997).               As the Commissioner sought to\n\nintroduce evidence that he could have advanced at trial but chose\n\nnot   to,     the   district     court's      denial    of   the   motion    for\n\nreconsideration did not amount to an abuse of discretion.\n\n             We conclude by emphasizing that, under Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 60(b)(5), the Commissioner is free to move for\n\nrelief from the injunction when \"applying it prospectively is no\n\nlonger equitable.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5); see also Esso, 522\n\nF.3d at 149-50 (rejecting claim that \"the scope of [the] injunction\n\nwas   overly   broad   because    it    lacks   an     express   provision   for\n\ntermination of the injunction,\" noting the availability of Rule\n\n60(b)(5)).      Moreover, under the final judgment entered in this\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fcase, the district court retained jurisdiction \"for the purpose of\n\nenabling any party to this Judgment to apply to the Court for . . .\n\nthe modification of the injunctive provisions of this Judgment.\"\n\nIn fact, the district court, in its denial of the Commissioner's\n\nmotion for reconsideration, demonstrated a willingness to address\n\nthe injunction should circumstances require it, that is, if the\n\nPlaintiffs (or either of them) are about to be housed in an SMU\n\nother than Ten Block.    Thus, if and when the time comes, the\n\nCommissioner will have an avenue to press its concerns.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the entry of the injunction in\n\nthis case is affirmed.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Dennehy,</i> 538 F.Supp.2d 400, 404 n. 4 (D.Mass.2008). At the time of the filing of their Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs were housed in an special management unit (\"SMU\") at MCI-Cedar Junction known as \"Ten Block.\" SMUs are housing units separate from the general population of the prison \"in which inmates may be confined for reasons of administrative segregation, protective custody, or disciplinary detention.\" 103 Mass.Code Regs. 423.06. Plaintiffs alleged that, \"[w]hile segregated, [they] are denied the right to attend mandatory Jumah services.\" They further alleged that \"[p]risoners with televisions may participate in the prison's Jumah services, which are broadcast via closed-circuit televisions,\" but that \"[t]he DOC presently denies [the Plaintiffs] access to a television and, therefore, access to Jumah services.\" In their prayer for relief, the Plaintiffs sought \"a permanent injunction ordering Defendant ... to allow Plaintiff to attend all Jumah services either in person or via closed-circuit television.\"</p>\n<p>The district court conducted a six-day bench trial concerning Plaintiffs' claims.<sup>[1]</sup> After trial, the district court applied the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, as defined in [42 U.S.C. ยง 1997], even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that personย</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.</blockquote>\n<p>42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-1(a).

However, the court further ruled that \"[t]he ban on participation by Ten Block inmates in Jum'ah services by closed-circuit television is not the least restrictive means of vindicating\" the compelling state interests of the DOC, noting that \"the DOC does not contend that there is any technical reason that prevents the broadcast of Jum'ah services by closed-circuit television to Muslim inmates in Ten Block.\" <i>Id.</i> at 412 &amp; n. 24.</p>\n<p>The district court later entered an injunction requiring closed-circuit broadcasting of Jum'ah \"[w]henever Plaintiffs are housed in the Special Management Unit,\"<sup>[2]</sup> not limiting its injunction to the SMU at MCI-Cedar Junction. When the Commissioner sought clarification, the district court confirmed that the injunction required closed circuit television broadcasts of Jum'ah services in <i>any</i> SMU in which Plaintiffs may be housed in the future.</p>\n<p>The Commissioner then moved for reconsideration, attaching the affidavit of Jeffrey Quick, the DOC's Director of Resource Management (the \"Quick Affidavit\"). The Quick Affidavit outlined the significant technical, operational, physical plant, and cost impediments to providing closed-circuit television broadcasts to certain SMUs located at prisons other than MCI-Cedar Junction. The Quick Affidavit further noted that Tyler was \"presently incarcerated in the general population of MCI-Cedar Junction,\" and that Hudson was \"presently incarcerated at [Old Colony Correctional Center] and is housed in the general population.\"</p>\n<p>That same day, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration, stating:</p>\n<blockquote>After hearing, the motion is denied without prejudice. Plaintiff Hudson is currently confined in general population at the Old Colony Correctional Facility. Accordingly, there is no actual controversy appropriate for judicial resolution.</blockquote>\n<p>The Commissioner subsequently filed a notice of appeal that listed only the denial of the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, the Plaintiffs contend that the only decision on appeal is the district court's denial of the Commissioner's motion for reconsideration. They point out that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 provides that \"[t]he notice of appeal must ... designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed,\" Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B), and the notice of appeal here only lists the denial of the motion for reconsideration.<sup>[3]</sup> Indeed, \"an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> appeal from an order denying such a motion is generally not considered to be an appeal from the underlying judgment.\" <i>Chamorro v. Puerto Rican Cars, Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2002) (discussing a motion for reconsideration).</p>\n<p>However, \"our precedents encourage us to construe notices of appeal liberally and examine them in the context of the record as a whole.\" <i>Id.</i> Although the notice of appeal only lists the denial of the motion for reconsideration, it references the \"Final Judgment with Regard to Broadcast of Jum'ah Services in Special Management Units Other Than Ten Block.\" \"Read in context, this reference is consistent with a desire to have this court review the propriety of the\" injunction with respect to Jum'ah services. <i>Id.</i> at 4 (noting that notice of appeal only listing denial of motion for reconsideration also referenced dismissal for want of prosecution, which reflected an intent to reach the dismissal). Moreover, \"both sides have fully briefed the merits, and undertaking appellate review of the original order ... would not unfairly prejudice\" the Plaintiffs. <i>See id.</i> Although we recognize that \"rescue missions are not automatic, and litigants will do well to draft notices of appeal with care,\" we will give the Commissioner the benefit of the doubt and treat the injunction itself as properly before us. <i>Id.</i> at 3.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he scope of [an] injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\" <i>Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Lรณpez-Freytes,</i> 522 F.3d 136, 142-43 (1st Cir.2008). The Commissioner contends that the district court erred by entering a prospective injunction that applies to all SMUs without making findings as to whether SMUs other than Ten Block are suitable for closed circuit television broadcasts of Ju'mah services. Thus, according to the Commissioner, the prospective injunction violates the Prison Litigation Reform Act (the \"PLRA\"), which requires \"prospective relief\" to be \"narrowly drawn, extend[] no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and [be] the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(1)(A). The Commissioner also relies on RLUIPA, contending that the DOC can demonstrate that it has a \"compelling governmental interest\" in not providing closed circuit broadcasting of Ju'mah services to SMUs other than Ten Block given the high cost of providing such services, <i>see </i><i>Baranowski v. Hart,</i> 486 F.3d 112, 125 (5th Cir.2007) (compelling interest standard met under RLUIPA when prison budget not adequate to cover Kosher meals), and the resultant imposition such a requirement would put on the Commissioner's discretion to assign the Plaintiffs to different facilities.</p>\n<p>We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. Although the Plaintiffs' allegations in their Amended Complaint focused on the lack of closed-circuit broadcasting in Ten Block, their prayer for relief was not limited to Ten Block. Plaintiffs plainly sought system-wide relief. Despite being on notice of this claim for relief, the Commissioner did not present during the bench trial any of the evidence contained in the Quick Affidavit, despite having the \"onus\" to show that the burden it placed on the Plaintiffs' religious exercise \"furthers a compelling governmental interest and ... that the burden is the least restrictive means of achieving that compelling interest.\" <i>Spratt v. R.I. Dep't of Corrs.,</i> 482 F.3d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding that, under RLUIPA, once a plaintiff establishes a substantial burden on the exercise of his or her religion, the \"onus shifts to the government\"). Instead, the Commissioner provided evidence that the DOC's system-wide policy banning televisions in SMUs was due to (1) the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> temporary nature of SMU detention; (2) the security risks associated with having a television in an inmate's cell; and (3) the DOC's desire to avoid any incentive for inmates to seek SMU detention. A witness, MCI-Cedar Junction Deputy Superintendent Lisa Mitchell, testified that there was no technical reason that prevents the broadcast of Jum'ah services by closed-circuit television to Muslim inmates in Ten Block, but the Commissioner did not provide evidence that this was not the case for other facilities. In fact, the Commissioner provided testimony, through its Acting Deputy Commissioner, John Marshall, that the DOC sought to create a universal SMU policy to alleviate any differences in SMU policies among various facilities.</p>\n<p>Given the record before it, the district court tailored an injunction that was consistent with the PLRA's directive that all \"prospective relief\" be \"narrowly drawn,\" \"extend[ ] no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right,\" and be the \"least intrusive means necessary to remedy the violation of a Federal right.\" 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(1)(A). The Plaintiffs established a substantial burden on the exercise of their religion, and, in evaluating whether to enable Plaintiffs to participate in Jum'ah services in person or provide closed-circuit broadcasting of such services, the district court found that providing closed-circuit broadcasting was the least intrusive means to alleviate that burden on the Plaintiffs. <i>See </i><i>Hudson,</i> 538 F.Supp.2d at 412. The Commissioner put nothing in the record to differentiate facilities other than Ten Block on the issues of compelling governmental interest or least restrictive means. Moreover, under RLUIPA, the Commissioner had the burden to put forward his additional evidence at trial and failed to do so. <i>See </i><i>Spratt,</i> 482 F.3d at 38. The district court is not a mind reader, and, given the Commissioner's failure to provide the additional evidence contained in the Quick Affidavit at trial, we conclude that no abuse of discretion occurred in framing the injunction.</p>\n<p>For substantially the same reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Commissioner's motion for reconsideration. \"We review a trial court's decision denying a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment for manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>Vasapolli v. Rostoff,</i> 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir.1994). We have emphasized that Rule 59(e) \"does not provide a vehicle for a party to undo its own procedural failures, and it certainly does not allow a party to introduce new evidence or advance arguments that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to the judgment.\" <i>Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes,</i> 118 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1997). As the Commissioner sought to introduce evidence that he could have advanced at trial but chose not to, the district court's denial of the motion for reconsideration did not amount to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>We conclude by emphasizing that, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5), the Commissioner is free to move for relief from the injunction when \"applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5); <i>see also </i><i>Esso,</i> 522 F.3d at 149-50 (rejecting claim that \"the scope of [the] injunction was overly broad because it lacks an express provision for termination of the injunction,\" noting the availability of Rule 60(b)(5)). Moreover, under the final judgment entered in this case, the district court retained jurisdiction \"for the purpose of enabling any party to this Judgment to apply to the Court for... the modification of the injunctive provisions of this Judgment.\" In fact, the district court, in its denial of the Commissioner's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> motion for reconsideration, demonstrated a willingness to address the injunction should circumstances require it, that is, if the Plaintiffs (or either of them) are about to be housed in an SMU other than Ten Block. Thus, if and when the time comes, the Commissioner will have an avenue to press its concerns.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the entry of the injunction in this case is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The trial encompassed other religious freedom claims as well, but the district court's resolution of those claims is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p>[2]  The injunction states in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>Whenever Plaintiffs are housed in the Special Management Unit, Defendant shall provide access to a closed circuit television set that displays, through sound and images, a live broadcast of such communal Jum'ah services as are regularly held on each and every Friday for the duration of their incarceration....</p>\n<p>[3]  The notice states in full:\n</p>\n<p>Notice is hereby given that Harold W.

In 2001, they filed a non-class action complaint, later amended, asserting that the Commissioner violated their right to freely exercise their religion.</p>\n<p>At issue in this appeal is the ability to participate in Jum'ah, which is \"a Friday group prayer that is obligatory for Muslims.\" <i>Hudson v. Dennehy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2296695\"><a href=\"/opinion/2296695/hudson-v-dennehy/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 404 n. 4 (D.Mass.2008). At the time of the filing of their Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs were housed in an special management unit (\"SMU\") at MCI-Cedar Junction known as \"Ten Block.\" SMUs are housing units separate from the general population of the prison \"in which inmates may be confined for reasons of administrative segregation, protective custody, or disciplinary detention.\" 103 Mass.Code Regs. 423.06. Plaintiffs alleged that, \"[w]hile segregated, [they] are denied the right to attend mandatory Jumah services.\" They further alleged that \"[p]risoners with televisions may participate in the prison's Jumah services, which are broadcast via closed-circuit televisions,\" but that \"[t]he DOC presently denies [the Plaintiffs] access to a television and, therefore, access to Jumah services.\" In their prayer for relief, the Plaintiffs sought \"a permanent injunction ordering Defendant ... to allow Plaintiff to attend all Jumah services either in person or via closed-circuit television.\"</p>\n<p>The district court conducted a six-day bench trial concerning Plaintiffs' claims.<sup>[1]</sup> After trial, the district court applied the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUIPA\"), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, as defined in [42 U.S.C. ยง 1997], even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that personย</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.</blockquote>\n<p>42 U.S.C. ยง 2000cc-1(a).
