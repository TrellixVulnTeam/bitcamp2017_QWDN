William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n               Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Danny M. Kelly on brief pro se.\n     Andrew D. Kang, John D. Hanify and Hanify & King, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           February 11, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam. Upon de novo review, we affirm the dismissal\n\nof this suit for failure to state a claim.   During an IFP screening\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(d), the district court observed that the\n\ncomplaint showed on its face that appellant previously had filed a\n\nsuit for \"breach of contract\" against the same defendant.        The\n\ncourt afforded appellant notice and an opportunity to show why his\n\ncurrent suit, for \"unjust enrichment,\" should not be dismissed for\n\nimproper \"claim splitting.\" Appellant's response, that the current\n\nsuit was based upon a different legal theory, was insufficient to\n\navert dismissal.\n\n          The public record in the prior suit shows that a final\n\njudgment on the merits was entered against appellant before he\n\nfiled this suit.   See Kelly v. Nortel, 18 Fed. Appx. 19 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 830 (2002).     The two suits involve\n\nthe same cause of action, i.e., the same transaction or series of\n\ntransactions.   The prior judgment thus is conclusive as to all\n\nissues which were actually litigated as well as all matters which\n\ncould have been litigated in the first suit.       Gonzalez v. Banco\n\nCent. Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755-56 (1st Cir. 1994).        Appellant's\n\ncurrent legal theory could have been litigated in the first suit,\n\nso it is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.    Id.; see also In\n\nre Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(holding that a court may dismiss sua sponte for failure to state\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fa claim where the facts gleaned from the complaint and public\n\nrecord conclusively establish the defense).\n\n          Appellant's argument that the dismissal violates his\n\nSeventh Amendment right to a jury trial is patently frivolous since\n\nthere was no issue of fact to be resolved, only an issue of law.\n\nCf. Aetna Casualty & Sur. Co. v. P & B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546,\n\n1567-68 (1st Cir. 1994) (citing cases).\n\n          Appellee has asked us to enjoin appellant from bringing\n\nany future actions arising out of the same transactions.       The\n\nconclusive bar of res judicata, ipso facto, provides a disincentive\n\nto the bringing of future suits.\n\n          Appellant is warned that any filing of repetitive suits\n\ndespite the conclusive bar of res judicata places an unreasonable\n\nburden on the defendant, as well as on the court.     Accordingly,\n\nshould he persist, the court may exercise its inherent authority to\n\nimpose sanctions on its own motion, or to take other action to\n\nprevent frivolous, vexatious litigation or appeals.\n\n          The judgment is summarily affirmed.   Appellant's motion\n\nfor a \"change of venue\" is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
