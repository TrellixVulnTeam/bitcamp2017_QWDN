Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Derege B. Demissie and Demissie & Church on brief for\nappellant.\n     Jennifer Hay Zacks, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Carmen M.\nOrtiz, United States Attorney on Motion for Summary Disposition for\nappellee.\n\n                           February 15, 2011\n\f           Per Curiam.       This is a direct criminal appeal in which\n\nthe government has moved for summary disposition.                  We grant its\n\nmotion.\n\n           I.     Background\n\n           Jose Portorreal pled guilty to a cocaine conspiracy\n\noffense under 21 U.S.C. § 846.           At his plea hearing, he admitted\n\nparticipating      only    in   a     single    three-kilogram      transaction,\n\nconceding as well that he was personally responsible for that\n\namount. The government claimed that Portorreal was responsible for\n\nat least five kilograms of cocaine.             After accepting Portorreal's\n\nguilty    plea,    the     district    court     held     evidentiary     hearings\n\naddressing   the    disputed    drug     quantity       issue.    Crediting      the\n\ngovernment's evidence, it found Portorreal responsible for well\n\nover five kilograms of cocaine.               After calculating his advisory\n\nguideline sentencing range, the district court imposed a below-\n\nguideline sentence of 272 months, less than 23 years.                   Portorreal\n\nthen filed this appeal.\n\n           II.     Discussion\n\n           On appeal, Portorreal seeks vacatur of his guilty plea,\n\nor at least a remand for resentencing based on the three-kilogram\n\namount of cocaine he admitted to.              His central contention is that\n\nthe   district     court    erroneously        treated    drug   quantity   as    a\n\nsentencing factor and not as an element of his conspiracy offense\n\nduring the change-of-plea and sentencing proceedings.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            We review Portorreal's claims, which are raised in this\n\ncourt for the first time, for plain error.              United States v.\n\nJiminez, 498 F.3d 82, 85 (1st Cir. 2007) (involving defaulted\n\nobjections to the plea hearing); United States v. Salas-Fernández,\n\n620 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2010) (involving defaulted sentencing\n\nobjections).     Portorreal    has    not   satisfied   the   plain   error\n\nstandard.    He misconstrues the import of Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n\n530 U.S. 466 (2000), relies on inapposite case law, and overlooks\n\nthe binding precedent in this circuit.\n\n            As Apprendi requires, Portorreal received a sentence that\n\nwas within the statutory maximum for the drug quantity he admitted\n\nto at his plea hearing.         530 U.S. at 490; see 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(B) (a 40-year maximum applies to offenses involving at\n\nleast 500 grams of cocaine but less than five kilograms).\n\n            \"The quantity of drugs is not an element of conspiracy\n\nunder § 846, nor is it an element of the underlying controlled\n\nsubstances offense[.]\"    United States v. González-Vélez, 466 F.3d\n\n27, 35 (1st Cir. 2006).       It is a sentencing factor that may be\n\nfound by district courts based on a preponderance of the evidence,\n\neven if their factfinding elevates the applicable § 841(b)(1)\n\nmandatory minimum sentence. United States v. Goodine, 326 F.3d 26,\n\n31-34 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding § 841(b)(1)'s \"incremental\" changes\n\nin the mandatory minimums based on drug quantity to be permitted by\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fHarris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 554 (2002), which considered\n\na sentencing provision in a firearm statute, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)).\n\n           The Supreme Court's recent opinion in United States v.\n\nO'Brien, 130 S. Ct. 2169 (2010), is distinguishable.               See id. at\n\n2177 (construing the sentencing provision in § 924(c)(1)(B)(ii),\n\nwhich involved a \"drastic, sixfold\" increase in the mandatory\n\nminimum   for   certain     firearm   offenses,    and     distinguishing   the\n\n\"incremental\" increase in Harris).             Portorreal's reliance on the\n\nO'Brien concurring opinions is also unavailing.              See United States\n\nv. Colon, 391 Fed. Appx. 890, 2010 WL 3432816 *1 (1st Cir. 2010)\n\n(unpublished per curiam) (rejecting arguments based on the O'Brien\n\nconcurring opinions and stating that Harris, supra, and another\n\nsimilar Supreme Court case remain \"good law\" until overruled by the\n\nCourt itself).\n\n           Finally, United States v. Santo, 225 F.3d 92 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)   (majority    opinion),      is    also   distinguishable.       Unlike\n\nPortorreal, the defendant in that case pled guilty after being\n\ngiven inaccurate advice about his § 841(b)(1) mandatory minimum\n\nsentence, which prevented him from being able to \"realistically\n\ndecide whether to plead guilty.\"           Id. at 98-99.\n\n           Under Goodine, supra, the claim that defense counsel\n\nrendered ineffective assistance by not objecting to the district\n\ncourt's   treatment    of    drug     quantity    as   a   sentencing   factor\n\nnecessarily fails.    Consistent with our usual practice, we decline\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fto consider Portorreal's remaining ineffective assistance claims,\n\nwithout prejudice to his raising those claims in a timely post-\n\nconviction motion filed under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.   See United States\n\nv. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 155 (1st Cir. 2005) (declining to address\n\nan ineffective assistance claim on a record that was not fully\n\ndeveloped).\n\n          The district court's judgment is affirmed.   See 1st Cir.\n\nLoc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
