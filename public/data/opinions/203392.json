App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey has been substituted for his predecessor, former\nAttorney General Alberto R. Gonzales.\n\n     **\n          Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          TASHIMA, Senior Circuit Judge. Deby Ledy Malonda, a.k.a.\n\nVirginia Sandra Malonda, and her husband Erick Rawung, both natives\n\nof Indonesia, petition for review of a decision by the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (“BIA”) denying their applications for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (“CAT”).    Malonda1 contends that the BIA’s denial of her\n\nclaims was not supported by substantial evidence, and that the\n\nImmigration Judge’s (“IJ”) finding of removability violated her\n\nright to due process.   We disagree, and deny the petition.\n\n                          I.     Background\n\n          Malonda first came to the United States in 1996.          While\n\nhere, she met Rawung, who had entered the country separately on\n\nOctober 4, 1995, and the two married in 1999.        After last entering\n\nthe United States on July 4, 2001, Malonda filed an application for\n\nasylum on May 20, 2002, on behalf of herself, as well as Rawung as\n\na derivative applicant.\n\n          Malonda   identified    herself     as   “Deby   Ledy”   on   the\n\napplication form and reported her date of birth as April 14, 1965.\n\nShe claimed to have a valid visa at the time of her entry, also in\n\nthe name of Deby Ledy Malonda, and attached a copy of that visa,\n\nwhich was valid from September 20, 2000, to September 19, 2005, to\n\nher application.    On the other hand, she signed the application\n\n\n     1\n          Because Rawung is a derivative applicant for asylum, we\nwill refer to both petitioners collectively as “Malonda.”\n\n                                  -2-\n\f“Virginia Malonda” and printed that name below her signature.    In\n\nPart C of the form, requesting “Information About Your Claim to\n\nAsylum,” Malonda also identified herself as “Virginia.”   Further,\n\nMalonda appended to her application an Affidavit, dated April 28,\n\n2002, which began, “My name is Virginia Malonda.”   Several of the\n\nother documents she attached to her application also identified her\n\nas “Virginia,” including a United States visa issued on August 8,\n\n1996, and expiring on November 8, 1996; a certificate of church\n\nmembership; her marriage certificate; her own birth and baptismal\n\ncertificates; and the birth certificates of her two American-born,\n\nand two Indonesian-born, children.   Malonda was interviewed by an\n\nAsylum Officer on February 4, 2004, and approved of corrections\n\nmade to her application identifying her as “Virginia Sandra” and\n\nreporting her date of birth as February 27, 1967.   She also signed\n\nher name as “Virginia Malonda” in the presence of the Asylum\n\nOfficer.\n\n           In her application for asylum, Malonda stated that she\n\ndid not feel safe in Indonesia due to her Christian faith.      She\n\nreferred to one incident in particular, occurring on June 6, 2001,\n\nwhere she was aroused from sleep by a person wearing “Jilbab the\n\nMuslim robes that wanted to kill” her.   He pointed a steel object,\n\nlike a screwdriver, at her, but she was not fearful.   Instead, she\n\nyelled, “Lord Jesus Help Me,” and received the strength to push him\n\naway.   She referred to attached news articles chronicling the\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fpersecution of Christians at the hands of Indonesian Muslims to\n\nsupport   her   claim   that   Christians   were   being   persecuted   in\n\nIndonesia.    She also stated that the government was not willing to\n\nprotect Christians, leaving people like her to fend for themselves.\n\n           On February 12, 2004, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\n(“ICE”) initiated removal proceedings against Malonda and Rawung by\n\nfiling Notices to Appear (“NTA”).        Malonda’s NTA charged her with\n\nremovability based on entering the country without possessing a\n\nvalid visa.     Rawung was charged with remaining in the country\n\nbeyond the expiration of his B-2 visa on April 3, 1996.         Although\n\nRawung conceded the factual allegations in his NTA, Malonda denied\n\nthat she entered the United States without a valid visa.\n\n           In Malonda’s first appearance before the IJ on March 21,\n\n2004, the IJ questioned Malonda’s counsel about Malonda’s denial of\n\nthe allegation that she did not possess a valid visa.         When asked\n\nabout the denial, her attorney stated that he denied the allegation\n\nbecause he was not sure whether it was true.        He also stated that\n\nhe would concede removability if the government had proof of it and\n\ndenied that Malonda had asserted that she was legally present in\n\nher application for asylum.      When the IJ stated that he was “going\n\nto find that [Malonda] is removable, because it says so right in\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fher   application     for   asylum[,]”     Malonda’s   attorney   responded,\n\n“That’s fine, Your Honor.”2\n\n           On November 14, 2005, the IJ conducted Malonda’s merits\n\nhearing.   When asked whether she had ever experienced any problems\n\nin Indonesia due to her religion, Malonda testified about the\n\nincident occurring early in the morning on June 6, 2001.                   This\n\ntime, in her direct testimony, she described having been abruptly\n\nawakened when a man wearing nothing but a bandana around his head\n\nsat on her.      After pushing him off her, he started shouting or\n\nchanting “Allah akbar,” a phrase “only a Muslim would say.”                 She\n\nalso testified that some people “tried to do evil things” to her\n\nwhen she wore her “Cross necklace,” and that she was advised to\n\nstop wearing it because people knew that Muslims were hunting for\n\nChristians.   On cross-examination, however, she testified that her\n\nassailant was naked from the waist up, but was wearing pants, which\n\nhe unzipped during the course of the attack.\n\n           The   IJ   denied    Malonda’s    application   for    asylum    and\n\nwithholding of removal.        While noting that some confusion existed\n\n\n      2\n          During this discussion between the IJ and Malonda’s\ncounsel about her removability, the government asserted that\nMalonda used her sister’s passport in conjunction with her\napplication for asylum. The IJ asked the government, “Wouldn’t\nthat be considered evidence that she is here illegally, or no?”\nBefore the government had the opportunity to answer the question,\nthe IJ proceeded with his questioning of Malonda’s counsel without\nexplicitly resolving the issue of whether Deby Ledy is Malonda’s\nsister.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fas to Malonda’s charge of removability, the IJ determined that\n\nMalonda, through counsel, conceded removability.              Turning first to\n\nevidence of past persecution, the IJ deemed not credible Malonda’s\n\ntestimony concerning the central event in her asylum application,\n\nthe attempted rape or assault on June 6, 2001.               In particular, he\n\npointed to the discrepancy between Malonda’s statement in her\n\nasylum application that the assailant wore a Muslim robe and her\n\ntestimony at the hearing that he was fully or partially naked.                 The\n\nIJ reasoned that, as the only incident specifically referred to by\n\nMalonda, her testimony on the subject should have been consistent\n\nthroughout.         Even assuming the truth of Malonda’s account, the IJ\n\ndisbelieved that the attack was religiously motivated, because\n\nMalonda was residing in her brother-in-law’s Muslim household at\n\nthe time, giving the assailant no reason to believe that she was a\n\nChristian.\n\n              In finding that Malonda had failed to establish a well-\n\nfounded      fear    of   future   persecution,   the   IJ    noted    that    the\n\nDepartment of State country and religious freedom reports generally\n\nreported an improvement in conditions in Indonesia.               The IJ also\n\nfound   it    significant      that   Malonda’s   two   Indonesian     children\n\ncontinued to live in the country without experiencing harm; that\n\nMalonda had traveled to Indonesia three times since entering the\n\nUnited States, once with her six-year-old, American-born daughter;\n\nand   that    several     of   Malonda’s   siblings   continued   to    live    in\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fIndonesia in relative safety. After denying Malonda’s application,\n\nthe IJ granted her voluntary departure.\n\n             The BIA upheld the IJ’s denial of relief on April 24,\n\n2007, in a per curiam opinion.           It found that the IJ’s adverse\n\ncredibility finding was supported by specific, cogent reasons, and\n\nthat the IJ provided a reasonable basis for rejecting Malonda’s\n\nexplanation of the discrepancies in her account.            It also upheld\n\nthe IJ’s finding of removability based on his reading of Malonda’s\n\nasylum application, as well as the concession made by her counsel.\n\nFinally, the BIA affirmed the IJ’s ruling on Malonda’s CAT claim\n\nbecause of her failure to raise the issue on appeal.\n\n                             II.     Discussion\n\n             Where, as is the case here, “the BIA adopts the IJ’s\n\nopinion and discusses some of the bases for the IJ’s decision, we\n\nhave authority to review both the IJ’s and the BIA’s opinions.”\n\nOuk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 110 (1st Cir. 2006).          We review the\n\nBIA’s decision under the deferential substantial evidence standard.\n\nSee id. Under this standard, we will uphold factual determinations\n\n“unless the record is such as to compel a reasonable factfinder to\n\nreach a contrary determination.” Pulisir v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 302,\n\n307   (1st   Cir.   2008).    When    reviewing   an   adverse   credibility\n\ndetermination under this standard, “we narrowly inquire whether:\n\n(i) the discrepancies articulated by the IJ and/or the BIA are\n\nactually     present   in    the     administrative    record;    (ii)   the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fdiscrepancies generate specific and cogent reasons from which to\n\ninfer that petitioner . . . provided non-creditworthy testimony;\n\nand (iii) petitioner failed to provide a persuasive explanation for\n\nthese discrepancies.”         Cuko v. Mukasey, 522 F.3d 32, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n                         A.    Merits of the Claims\n\n            Malonda   contends      that   the   BIA’s   adverse   credibility\n\ndetermination, as well as its determination that she failed to\n\nestablish her asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims, were\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence.             We begin by considering\n\nMalonda’s asylum claim, because “a failure to qualify for asylum\n\nnecessarily   forecloses       a   petitioner’s    ability   to    qualify   for\n\nwithholding of removal or protection under CAT.”                    Santosa v.\n\nMukasey, No. 07-2016, 2008 WL 2358004, at *2 (1st Cir. June 11,\n\n2008); see also Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (noting that a withholding claim “demands that the alien\n\ncarry a more stringent burden of proof than does an asylum claim”).\n\n            An applicant for asylum bears the burden of proving that\n\nshe is a refugee based upon either past persecution or a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution on the basis of one of five\n\nstatutory grounds.     See Wang v. Mukasey, 508 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.\n\n2007) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)). “[P]ast persecution requires\n\nthat the totality of a petitioner’s experiences add up to more than\n\nmere     discomfiture,        unpleasantness,     harassment,      or   unfair\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\ftreatment.”       Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).     Moreover, the claimed persecution must be “the direct\n\nresult    of    government    action,    government-supported     action,   or\n\ngovernment’s       unwillingness    or     inability    to   control   private\n\nconduct.” Id. at 121. Finally, testimony deemed incredible by the\n\nIJ may be disregarded or discounted.           See Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d\n\n80, 86 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n               Here, the evidence supports the IJ’s determination that\n\nMalonda did not testify credibly concerning the attack on June 6,\n\n2001.     The record indicates that she told three versions of the\n\nsame story: in one, her assailant wore a Muslim robe; in the\n\nsecond, he was naked; and in the third, he wore pants.                  Other\n\ndetails    differ    as    well:   in    her   asylum   application,   Malonda\n\ndescribed being approached by a man wielding a screwdriver, but at\n\nher hearing, she claimed that she was roused from sleep when he sat\n\non her.    The IJ concluded that, as the single event supporting her\n\nclaim of religious persecution, it “should have been the focus of\n\nher testimony and should have . . . been consistent throughout.”\n\nMalonda did not indicate any reason preventing her from correcting\n\nthe discrepancy.          Therefore, we uphold the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.\n\n               An adverse credibility determination can be fatal if an\n\napplicant cannot meet her burden of proof without the incredible\n\ntestimony.      See Melhem v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f(citing Pan, 489 F.3d at 86).            That is the case here.           Without\n\nMalonda’s    testimony,     which   was    the      sole    evidence     of     past\n\npersecution, the evidence amply supports the BIA’s finding that\n\nMalonda     lacked   an    objectively      reasonable       fear   of        future\n\npersecution.     Malonda “had to provide ‘credible, direct, and\n\nspecific    evidence’     that   would    support    a     reasonable    fear     of\n\nindividualized persecution.”         Santosa, 2008 WL 2358004, at *4\n\n(quoting Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2003)).                 The BIA\n\nfound that the documentary evidence provided by Malonda did not\n\nsatisfy this requirement and, to the contrary, Malonda’s family who\n\nremained in Indonesia lived in relative safety. See, e.g., Sela v.\n\nMukasey, 520 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 2008) (treating evidence of\n\nfamily safety in the petitioner’s country of origin as evidence\n\nundermining a future persecution claim).             Thus, the evidence does\n\nnot compel reversal of the BIA’s determination.\n\n            Having failed to establish her eligibility for asylum,\n\nMalonda’s application for withholding of removal necessarily fails\n\nas well.    See Makhoul, 387 F.3d at 82.         Because Malonda “makes no\n\nargument with respect to the CAT claim beyond the introductory\n\nassertion that the record establishes the merits of her claim[] for\n\n. . . protection pursuant to the CAT[,]” we deem her CAT claim\n\nwaived.    Sok v. Mukasey, 526 F.3d 48, 52 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal\n\nquotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f                               B.   Due Process\n\n            Although   Malonda’s     brief     advances     theories     that    her\n\nhearing    before   the   IJ   violated      her    due    process   rights      and\n\neffectively compelled her to be a witness against herself, her\n\nprincipal argument is that the government’s failure to amend her\n\nNTA to allege the correct ground of removability prejudiced her in\n\nsome way.     That is, in any event, the only claim of error she\n\npreserved    below;    consequently,      it   is    the    only   one   we     have\n\njurisdiction to review.        See Makhoul, 387 F.3d at 80 (relying on 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(d)(1)’s exhaustion requirement to hold that “theories\n\nnot advanced before the BIA may not be surfaced for the first time\n\nin a petition for judicial review of the BIA’s final order”).\n\n            The BIA rejected Malonda’s due process claim for three\n\nreasons.    First, it found that rather than contesting the IJ’s\n\nfinding of removability, Malonda’s counsel conceded it.                   Second,\n\nthe BIA found that Malonda failed to assert or demonstrate that she\n\nwas prejudiced by the alleged error.           Third, relying on Matter of\n\nSalazar, 17 I. & N. Dec. 167 (BIA 1979), it held that an IJ may\n\nproperly rule on a ground of removability that is first revealed at\n\na hearing, as long as the petitioner has the opportunity to meet\n\nit.   We review due process claims de novo.               See Pulisir, 524 F.3d\n\nat 311.\n\n            We have previously recognized that aliens subject to\n\nremoval proceedings are entitled to due process, including “the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fright to notice of the nature of the charges and a meaningful\n\nopportunity to be heard.”         Kaweesa v. Gonzales, 450 F.3d 62, 69\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (citing Choeum v. INS, 129 F.3d 29, 38 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                In order to advance a\n\ndue   process    claim,     however,    a    petitioner        “must    allege    some\n\ncognizable      prejudice    fairly     attributable       to     the    challenged\n\nprocess.”    Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 20 (1st Cir. 2004); see\n\nalso Grigous v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 156, 163 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(applying the prejudice requirement to a claimed violation of a due\n\nprocess right to adequate notice).\n\n            We need not decide whether, and under what circumstances,\n\nthe   government’s     failure     to       amend   a    NTA    might    violate    a\n\npetitioner’s      right     to   adequate       notice     of     the    charge    of\n\nremovability, because Malonda has made no showing that she was\n\nprejudiced by any failure to amend the NTA.                Accordingly, we must\n\naffirm the BIA’s decision and deny the petition.\n\n            The petition for review is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f",

Deby Ledy Malonda, a.k.a.\n\nVirginia Sandra Malonda, and her husband Erick Rawung, both natives\n\nof Indonesia, petition for review of a decision by the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (“BIA”) denying their applications for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (“CAT”).    Malonda1 contends that the BIA’s denial of her\n\nclaims was not supported by substantial evidence, and that the\n\nImmigration Judge’s (“IJ”) finding of removability violated her\n\nright to due process.   We disagree, and deny the petition.\n\n                          I.     Background\n\n          Malonda first came to the United States in 1996.          While\n\nhere, she met Rawung, who had entered the country separately on\n\nOctober 4, 1995, and the two married in 1999.        After last entering\n\nthe United States on July 4, 2001, Malonda filed an application for\n\nasylum on May 20, 2002, on behalf of herself, as well as Rawung as\n\na derivative applicant.\n\n          Malonda   identified    herself     as   “Deby   Ledy”   on   the\n\napplication form and reported her date of birth as April 14, 1965.\n\nShe claimed to have a valid visa at the time of her entry, also in\n\nthe name of Deby Ledy Malonda, and attached a copy of that visa,\n\nwhich was valid from September 20, 2000, to September 19, 2005, to\n\nher application.    On the other hand, she signed the application\n\n\n     1\n          Because Rawung is a derivative applicant for asylum, we\nwill refer to both petitioners collectively as “Malonda.”\n\n                                  -2-\n\f“Virginia Malonda” and printed that name below her signature.    In\n\nPart C of the form, requesting “Information About Your Claim to\n\nAsylum,” Malonda also identified herself as “Virginia.”   Further,\n\nMalonda appended to her application an Affidavit, dated April 28,\n\n2002, which began, “My name is Virginia Malonda.”   Several of the\n\nother documents she attached to her application also identified her\n\nas “Virginia,” including a United States visa issued on August 8,\n\n1996, and expiring on November 8, 1996; a certificate of church\n\nmembership; her marriage certificate; her own birth and baptismal\n\ncertificates; and the birth certificates of her two American-born,\n\nand two Indonesian-born, children.   Malonda was interviewed by an\n\nAsylum Officer on February 4, 2004, and approved of corrections\n\nmade to her application identifying her as “Virginia Sandra” and\n\nreporting her date of birth as February 27, 1967.   She also signed\n\nher name as “Virginia Malonda” in the presence of the Asylum\n\nOfficer.\n\n           In her application for asylum, Malonda stated that she\n\ndid not feel safe in Indonesia due to her Christian faith.      She\n\nreferred to one incident in particular, occurring on June 6, 2001,\n\nwhere she was aroused from sleep by a person wearing “Jilbab the\n\nMuslim robes that wanted to kill” her.   He pointed a steel object,\n\nlike a screwdriver, at her, but she was not fearful.   Instead, she\n\nyelled, “Lord Jesus Help Me,” and received the strength to push him\n\naway.   She referred to attached news articles chronicling the\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fpersecution of Christians at the hands of Indonesian Muslims to\n\nsupport   her   claim   that   Christians   were   being   persecuted   in\n\nIndonesia.    She also stated that the government was not willing to\n\nprotect Christians, leaving people like her to fend for themselves.\n\n           On February 12, 2004, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\n(“ICE”) initiated removal proceedings against Malonda and Rawung by\n\nfiling Notices to Appear (“NTA”).        Malonda’s NTA charged her with\n\nremovability based on entering the country without possessing a\n\nvalid visa.     Rawung was charged with remaining in the country\n\nbeyond the expiration of his B-2 visa on April 3, 1996.         Although\n\nRawung conceded the factual allegations in his NTA, Malonda denied\n\nthat she entered the United States without a valid visa.\n\n           In Malonda’s first appearance before the IJ on March 21,\n\n2004, the IJ questioned Malonda’s counsel about Malonda’s denial of\n\nthe allegation that she did not possess a valid visa.         When asked\n\nabout the denial, her attorney stated that he denied the allegation\n\nbecause he was not sure whether it was true.        He also stated that\n\nhe would concede removability if the government had proof of it and\n\ndenied that Malonda had asserted that she was legally present in\n\nher application for asylum.      When the IJ stated that he was “going\n\nto find that [Malonda] is removable, because it says so right in\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fher   application     for   asylum[,]”     Malonda’s   attorney   responded,\n\n“That’s fine, Your Honor.”2\n\n           On November 14, 2005, the IJ conducted Malonda’s merits\n\nhearing.   When asked whether she had ever experienced any problems\n\nin Indonesia due to her religion, Malonda testified about the\n\nincident occurring early in the morning on June 6, 2001.                   This\n\ntime, in her direct testimony, she described having been abruptly\n\nawakened when a man wearing nothing but a bandana around his head\n\nsat on her.      After pushing him off her, he started shouting or\n\nchanting “Allah akbar,” a phrase “only a Muslim would say.”                 She\n\nalso testified that some people “tried to do evil things” to her\n\nwhen she wore her “Cross necklace,” and that she was advised to\n\nstop wearing it because people knew that Muslims were hunting for\n\nChristians.   On cross-examination, however, she testified that her\n\nassailant was naked from the waist up, but was wearing pants, which\n\nhe unzipped during the course of the attack.\n\n           The   IJ   denied    Malonda’s    application   for    asylum    and\n\nwithholding of removal.        While noting that some confusion existed\n\n\n      2\n          During this discussion between the IJ and Malonda’s\ncounsel about her removability, the government asserted that\nMalonda used her sister’s passport in conjunction with her\napplication for asylum. The IJ asked the government, “Wouldn’t\nthat be considered evidence that she is here illegally, or no?”\nBefore the government had the opportunity to answer the question,\nthe IJ proceeded with his questioning of Malonda’s counsel without\nexplicitly resolving the issue of whether Deby Ledy is Malonda’s\nsister.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fas to Malonda’s charge of removability, the IJ determined that\n\nMalonda, through counsel, conceded removability.              Turning first to\n\nevidence of past persecution, the IJ deemed not credible Malonda’s\n\ntestimony concerning the central event in her asylum application,\n\nthe attempted rape or assault on June 6, 2001.               In particular, he\n\npointed to the discrepancy between Malonda’s statement in her\n\nasylum application that the assailant wore a Muslim robe and her\n\ntestimony at the hearing that he was fully or partially naked.                 The\n\nIJ reasoned that, as the only incident specifically referred to by\n\nMalonda, her testimony on the subject should have been consistent\n\nthroughout.         Even assuming the truth of Malonda’s account, the IJ\n\ndisbelieved that the attack was religiously motivated, because\n\nMalonda was residing in her brother-in-law’s Muslim household at\n\nthe time, giving the assailant no reason to believe that she was a\n\nChristian.\n\n              In finding that Malonda had failed to establish a well-\n\nfounded      fear    of   future   persecution,   the   IJ    noted    that    the\n\nDepartment of State country and religious freedom reports generally\n\nreported an improvement in conditions in Indonesia.               The IJ also\n\nfound   it    significant      that   Malonda’s   two   Indonesian     children\n\ncontinued to live in the country without experiencing harm; that\n\nMalonda had traveled to Indonesia three times since entering the\n\nUnited States, once with her six-year-old, American-born daughter;\n\nand   that    several     of   Malonda’s   siblings   continued   to    live    in\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fIndonesia in relative safety. After denying Malonda’s application,\n\nthe IJ granted her voluntary departure.\n\n             The BIA upheld the IJ’s denial of relief on April 24,\n\n2007, in a per curiam opinion.           It found that the IJ’s adverse\n\ncredibility finding was supported by specific, cogent reasons, and\n\nthat the IJ provided a reasonable basis for rejecting Malonda’s\n\nexplanation of the discrepancies in her account.            It also upheld\n\nthe IJ’s finding of removability based on his reading of Malonda’s\n\nasylum application, as well as the concession made by her counsel.\n\nFinally, the BIA affirmed the IJ’s ruling on Malonda’s CAT claim\n\nbecause of her failure to raise the issue on appeal.\n\n                             II.     Discussion\n\n             Where, as is the case here, “the BIA adopts the IJ’s\n\nopinion and discusses some of the bases for the IJ’s decision, we\n\nhave authority to review both the IJ’s and the BIA’s opinions.”\n\nOuk v.

We review the\n\nBIA’s decision under the deferential substantial evidence standard.\n\nSee id.

Merits of the Claims\n\n            Malonda   contends      that   the   BIA’s   adverse   credibility\n\ndetermination, as well as its determination that she failed to\n\nestablish her asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims, were\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence.             We begin by considering\n\nMalonda’s asylum claim, because “a failure to qualify for asylum\n\nnecessarily   forecloses       a   petitioner’s    ability   to    qualify   for\n\nwithholding of removal or protection under CAT.”                    Santosa v.\n\nMukasey, No. 07-2016, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2358004</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (1st Cir.

Moreover, the claimed persecution must be “the direct\n\nresult    of    government    action,    government-supported     action,   or\n\ngovernment’s       unwillingness    or     inability    to   control   private\n\nconduct.” Id. at 121. Finally, testimony deemed incredible by the\n\nIJ may be disregarded or discounted.           See Pan v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n               Here, the evidence supports the IJ’s determination that\n\nMalonda did not testify credibly concerning the attack on June 6,\n\n2001.     The record indicates that she told three versions of the\n\nsame story: in one, her assailant wore a Muslim robe; in the\n\nsecond, he was naked; and in the third, he wore pants.                  Other\n\ndetails    differ    as    well:   in    her   asylum   application,   Malonda\n\ndescribed being approached by a man wielding a screwdriver, but at\n\nher hearing, she claimed that she was roused from sleep when he sat\n\non her.    The IJ concluded that, as the single event supporting her\n\nclaim of religious persecution, it “should have been the focus of\n\nher testimony and should have . . . been consistent throughout.”\n\nMalonda did not indicate any reason preventing her from correcting\n\nthe discrepancy.          Therefore, we uphold the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination.\n\n               An adverse credibility determination can be fatal if an\n\napplicant cannot meet her burden of proof without the incredible\n\ntestimony.      See Melhem v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202909\"><a href=\"/opinion/202909/melhem-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f(citing Pan, 489 F.3d at 86).            That is the case here.           Without\n\nMalonda’s    testimony,     which   was    the      sole    evidence     of     past\n\npersecution, the evidence amply supports the BIA’s finding that\n\nMalonda     lacked   an    objectively      reasonable       fear   of        future\n\npersecution.     Malonda “had to provide ‘credible, direct, and\n\nspecific    evidence’     that   would    support    a     reasonable    fear     of\n\nindividualized persecution.”         Santosa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2358004</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4\n\n(quoting Guzman v.

The BIA\n\nfound that the documentary evidence provided by Malonda did not\n\nsatisfy this requirement and, to the contrary, Malonda’s family who\n\nremained in Indonesia lived in relative safety. See, e.g., Sela v.\n\nMukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203184\"><a href=\"/opinion/203184/sela-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st Cir. 2008) (treating evidence of\n\nfamily safety in the petitioner’s country of origin as evidence\n\nundermining a future persecution claim).             Thus, the evidence does\n\nnot compel reversal of the BIA’s determination.\n\n            Having failed to establish her eligibility for asylum,\n\nMalonda’s application for withholding of removal necessarily fails\n\nas well.    See Makhoul, 387 F.3d at 82.         Because Malonda “makes no\n\nargument with respect to the CAT claim beyond the introductory\n\nassertion that the record establishes the merits of her claim[] for\n\n. . . protection pursuant to the CAT[,]” we deem her CAT claim\n\nwaived.

That is, in any event, the only claim of error she\n\npreserved    below;    consequently,      it   is    the    only   one   we     have\n\njurisdiction to review.

First, it found that rather than contesting the IJ’s\n\nfinding of removability, Malonda’s counsel conceded it.
