Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                         Stahl, Circuit Judge,\n                    and DiClerico,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f     Jerrold N. Arnowitz, with whom Arnowitz, Goldberg, and Mann,\nLLC, was on brief for appellees.\n     Daniel G. Cromack, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nMartha Coakley, Attorney General, and Ronald F. Kehoe, Assistant\nAttorney General, were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        December 17, 2009\n\f           DICLERICO, District Judge.         Following the death of their\n\nson at Bridgewater State Hospital (\"BSH\"), William and Carolyn\n\nMosher (\"the Moshers\") brought a civil rights action, with related\n\nstate law claims, against Kenneth Nelson, Superintendent of BSH;\n\nKathleen Dennehy, Commissioner of the Department of Corrections;\n\nand Elizabeth Childs, Commissioner of the Department of Mental\n\nHealth.1   The district court granted summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants.   The Moshers appeal.          For the reasons that follow, we\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           BSH   is   a   facility,    operated      by   the    Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Corrections, that serves as both a prison and a\n\nmental hospital.      Most of the patients at BSH have histories of\n\nviolence in addition to mental illness.          Kenneth Nelson served as\n\nSuperintendent   of    BSH   from   1994     until   April      of   2007.   As\n\nCommissioner of the Department of Corrections, Kathleen Dennehy was\n\nthe chief executive officer of the department, but she did not have\n\nany direct supervisory role at BSH.          Nelson, instead, reported to\n\nan assistant deputy commissioner in the Department of Corrections.\n\nElizabeth Childs, who was Commissioner of the Department of Mental\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Other claims and parties were dismissed from the case, and\nthese dismissals have not been appealed.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fHealth, had no role at BSH except to approve the appointment of a\n\nmedical director at that facility.2\n\n                The Moshers’ son, William Mosher, Jr., was a pretrial\n\ndetainee at the Middlesex County jail in July of 2004, when he was\n\nsent       to   BSH   for   a   thirty-day    observation   period.   After   he\n\nassaulted a nurse, Mosher was held in the Intensive Treatment Unit\n\nat BSH until he was moved to Max 2, one of the maximum security\n\nunits. His observation period was extended from thirty days to six\n\nmonths.\n\n                In 2004, Max 2 was located in a secure stand-alone\n\nbuilding that included individual patient rooms and common areas.\n\nPatients in Max 2 were not allowed to stay in their rooms during\n\nthe day, except during patient count, because the rooms could\n\nshield patients from the observation of the staff, leading to a\n\nconcern about suicide.              An exception to that rule was a long-\n\nstanding practice that allowed patients to remain in their rooms\n\nand visit in other patients’ rooms for a short period from the end\n\nof the morning count, at approximately 11:15 a.m., until lunch. On\n\nAugust 28, 2004, during the period between the end of the morning\n\ncount and lunch, William Mosher, Jr. went into the room of his\n\nneighbor, Bradley Burns.            While Mosher was there, Burns strangled\n\nhim to death with a tee shirt.               No one previously had been killed\n\n\n\n       2\n      The Moshers do not appeal summary judgment that was granted\non their claims against Childs.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fat BSH, and no prior violent incidents had been reported to have\n\noccurred during the visiting period between the end of morning\n\ncount and lunch.         After Mosher’s death, BSH ended the visiting\n\npractice.   At the time Burns killed Mosher, Nelson did not know who\n\nBurns was, although he was aware of Mosher because of his prior\n\nattack on a nurse.\n\n            William and Carolyn Mosher brought claims under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 against the defendants in their individual capacities,\n\nalleging that the defendants’ conduct constituted cruel and unusual\n\npunishment of their son, resulting in his death, and that the\n\ndefendants conspired to perpetuate the challenged conditions of\n\nconfinement.      The Moshers also alleged conspiracies to deprive\n\ntheir son of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1985 and 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1986.     They further alleged state law claims for damages\n\nagainst the defendants in their official capacities.             The district\n\ncourt   granted    the    defendants’      motion   for   summary   judgment,\n\nconcluding that the evidence was insufficient to prove the Moshers’\n\nconstitutional     claims,    that   the    defendants    were   entitled   to\n\nqualified immunity on the constitutional claims, and that the state\n\nlaw claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment.                The Moshers\n\nappeal the summary judgment decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                                       II.\n\n           On    appeal,    the    court     reviews    the    district     court’s\n\ndecision granting summary judgment under the de novo standard.\n\nSullivan v. City of Springfield, 561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, the\n\ndiscovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show\n\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"                 Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP.   56(c).      The   party      seeking     summary   judgment     must        first\n\ndemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact in the\n\nrecord.   See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).\n\nA party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment\n\nmust present competent evidence of record that shows a genuine\n\nissue for trial.       See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n\n242, 256 (1986).       All reasonable inferences and all credibility\n\nissues are resolved in favor of the nonmoving party.                     See id. at\n\n255.\n\n                                       III.\n\n           The    Moshers      argue   that     summary       judgment     was     not\n\nappropriate because a factual dispute exists as to whether Nelson\n\nknew of and disregarded the substantial danger to patients in Max\n\n2 during the morning visiting period and whether Dennehy ignored\n\ncomplaints about insufficient staffing and security at BSH.                        The\n\nMoshers also argue that Nelson and Dennehy were not entitled to\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fqualified immunity and that Eleventh Amendment immunity does not\n\napply because their state law claims could be construed to arise\n\nunder Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.                     The\n\ndefendants argue in support of the district court’s decision on the\n\ncivil rights claims and the application of the Eleventh Amendment\n\nto the Moshers’ state law claims.         We begin with a consideration of\n\nqualified   immunity,    which   resolves      the   Moshers’   civil   rights\n\nclaims.\n\nA.   Qualified Immunity\n\n            \"Qualified    immunity   is    a   judge-made   construct     that\n\nbroadly protects public officials from the threat of litigation\n\narising out of their performance of discretionary functions.\"\n\nBergeron v. Cabral, 560 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2009).              The qualified\n\nimmunity analysis generally follows a two-step process of deciding\n\n\"(1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out\n\na violation of a constitutional right; and (2) if so, whether the\n\nright was 'clearly established' at the time of the defendant’s\n\nalleged violation.\"      Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 269 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).   Recently, the Supreme Court gave courts discretion to\n\naddress the \"clearly established\" step without first determining\n\nwhether a constitutional right had been violated.                 Pearson v.\n\nCallahan, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S. Ct. 808, 818-19 (2009).                  In the\n\nexercise of our discretion, we will use that procedure in this\n\ncase.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f           The \"clearly established\" step is itself composed of two\n\nparts, which require the court to decide (1) whether \"the contours\n\nof the right [were] sufficiently clear that a reasonable official\n\nwould understand that what he is doing violates that right,\" and\n\n(2) whether in the specific context of the case, \"a reasonable\n\ndefendant would have understood that his conduct violated the\n\nplaintiffs’ constitutional rights.\"            Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 269\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).         The first part addresses the\n\nstatus of the law at the time of the event in question, focusing on\n\nthe   clarity   of   the   standard     with   respect    to   the   asserted\n\nconstitutional right.      Id.    The second part addresses the specific\n\nfactual context of the case to determine whether a reasonable\n\nofficial in the defendant’s place would have understood that his\n\nconduct violated the asserted constitutional right.              Id.    To be\n\nliable, an official must be on notice that his conduct violates\n\nestablished law.     Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002).\n\n           1.   Status of the Law\n\n           Clearly established law does not depend on identical\n\ncircumstances    repeating       themselves.   Instead,    notable     factual\n\ndifferences may exist between prior cases and the circumstances at\n\nhand as long as the state of the law at the time gave the defendant\n\n\"fair warning\" that his action or inaction was unconstitutional.\n\nId.; accord Safford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, ___ U.S.\n\n___, 129 S. Ct. 2633, 2643 (2009).          In an area of the law that is\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fcontinuing to evolve, there will be a range extending from an\n\nestablished core to outer boundaries where there is not clearly\n\nestablished law.          See DeMayo v. Nugent, 517 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n2008). \"The law is considered clearly established either if courts\n\nhave        previously       ruled   that    materially      similar   conduct   was\n\nunconstitutional, or if a general constitutional rule already\n\nidentified in the decisional law applies with obvious clarity to\n\nthe specific conduct at issue.\"               Guillemard-Ginorio v. Contreras-\n\nGomez, 585 F.3d 508, 527 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n                  The   Supreme      Court        has   established     a    general\n\nconstitutional standard that \"[a] prison official’s 'deliberate\n\nindifference' to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate\n\nviolates the Eighth Amendment.\"3               Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n\n828 (1994); accord Calderón-Ortiz v. LaBoy-Alvarado, 300 F.3d 60,\n\n63-64 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"An inmate may sue a correctional facility\n\nunder       the     Eighth    Amendment     for    failure    to   afford   adequate\n\nprotection to inmates from attack by other inmates.\").                        Prison\n\nofficials have a constitutional duty \"not to be deliberately\n\nindifferent to the risk to prisoners of violence at the hands of\n\nother prisoners.\"            Burrell v. Hampshire County, 307 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\n\n\n        3\n      \"Pretrial detainees are protected under the Fourteenth\nAmendment Due Process Clause rather than the Eighth Amendment;\nhowever, the standard to be applied is the same as that used in\nEighth Amendment cases.\" Burrell, 307 F.3d at 7.\n\n                                             -9-\n\fCir. 2002).       Therefore, in August of 2004, when the events giving\n\nrise to this case occurred, the law was clearly established that a\n\ndetainee had a constitutional right not to be punished until\n\nconvicted    of    the   charges   against    him   and    that     a   corrections\n\nofficial    would    violate    the   Fourteenth        Amendment       if    he   were\n\ndeliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm to\n\na detainee, including violence inflicted by one detainee upon\n\nanother detainee.\n\n            In 2004, deliberate indifference, in the constitutional\n\ncontext, meant that a \"prison official subjectively 'must both be\n\naware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the\n\ninference.'\"       Id. at 8 (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837).                     That\n\nstandard, which has remained in effect up to the present time,\n\nrequires \"something less than acts or omissions for the very\n\npurpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result\"\n\nbut \"something more than mere negligence.\"                 Farmer, 511 U.S. at\n\n835.   After the standard was announced in Farmer and before August\n\nof 2004, we addressed the level of culpability required to meet the\n\ndeliberate    indifference      standard     in   the    context    of       prisoners\n\ninflicting violence on other prisoners.\n\n            We     considered      First   Circuit       precedent       addressing\n\ndeliberate indifference to inmate violence in Burrell. 307 F.3d at\n\n9.     There, we noted that we vacated summary judgment in the\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fdefendants’ favor in Giroux v. Somerset County, 178 F.3d 28 (1st\n\nCir. 1999), where \"jail officials inexplicably introduced a person\n\nposing a known danger, another inmate who had repeatedly threatened\n\nGiroux,   into   the   holding   cell   where   Giroux   was   being   kept.\"\n\nBurrell, 307 F.3d at 9.          The jail officials took that action\n\nalthough they appeared to know that their own actions \"would tar\n\nGiroux as an informant and thereby increase the risk to him.\"            Id.\n\nIn Calderón-Ortiz, we concluded that the plaintiff sufficiently\n\nalleged deliberate indifference to avoid dismissal where inmates\n\nwere not classified, leaving more dangerous inmates with vulnerable\n\ninmates and where \"prison officials failed to make their regular\n\npatrols of the housing areas, allowing a violent attack to go on\n\nfor between half an hour and an hour.\"          Burrell, 307 F.3d at 9.\n\n           In contrast, we concluded that the record in Burrell did\n\nnot sufficiently show deliberate indifference to avoid summary\n\njudgment because the officials responded reasonably to the risk\n\nthat was known to them at the time.        Id. at 8.     There, Burrell and\n\nhis wife complained to prison officials about problems with an\n\ninmate who later attacked Burrell. We concluded that the officials\n\nwere not indifferent and instead acted reasonably in not providing\n\nadditional protection for Burrell because they knew he was highly\n\ntrained in self defense and martial arts, neither Burrell nor his\n\nwife requested protective custody, no history existed of violence\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fbetween Burrell and the inmate who attacked him, and the officials\n\nbelieved Burrell could and would protect himself.\n\n          With the standard in mind, we next consider whether a\n\nreasonable official in Nelson’s position would have been on notice,\n\ngiven the state of the law in 2004, that his conduct violated the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n          2.   Standard in Factual Context\n\n                  a.    Nelson\n\n          In this case, Nelson was aware of the dangers associated\n\nwith the BSH patients generally and the patients housed in Max 2.\n\nHe was aware of the security rule that the patients in Max 2 were\n\nnot allowed to stay in their rooms except during the count because\n\nof the risk of harm, in particular the risk of suicide, when\n\npatients were out of view of the staff.4     Nelson was also aware\n\nthat, despite the security rule, a long-standing practice existed\n\nwhich allowed patients to stay in their rooms and to visit in each\n\n\n\n     4\n      The Moshers raise a new argument on appeal, contending that\nNelson violated the Phase Treatment Program at BSH by allowing the\npatients to stay in their rooms and visit in other rooms during the\nperiod between the morning count and lunch.      They contend that\nNelson’s disregard of the Phase Treatment Program is further\nevidence of his deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of\nserious harm related to that practice. Because the Moshers failed\nto raise that theory below, it is waived here. See, e.g., In re\nPharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., 582 F.3d 156, 183\n(1st Cir. 2009). The exceptions to waiver do not apply in the\ncircumstances of this case. Cf. Guillemard-Ginorio, 585 F.3d at\n517 (reaching abstention issue despite possible waiver). Even if\nthe Moshers’ Phase Treatment Program theory were considered,\nhowever, it would not change the outcome.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fothers’ rooms during the short period between the end of morning\n\ncount and lunch.          When patients were in their rooms or in other\n\npatients’ rooms they were subject to reduced supervision because\n\nthey could be out of the view and earshot of the staff.                    Although\n\nthe visiting practice had been long-standing, no problems or\n\nincidents related to the practice had been reported to Nelson.                   In\n\naddition, Nelson had no specific information about Burns, nor any\n\nreason to suspect that Burns might attack Mosher, nor any reason to\n\nbelieve that Mosher was particularly vulnerable to attack.5\n\n                  For purposes of qualified immunity, we must decide, given\n\nthe state of the law in 2004, whether a reasonable official in\n\nNelson’s position, with his knowledge of the circumstances that\n\nexisted in Max 2 when Burns killed Mosher, would have understood\n\nthat the practice of allowing patients to visit in other patients’\n\nrooms following morning count presented a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm to the patients.            The district court concluded that,\n\ngiven       the    circumstances   in   Burrell,   the   law   was   not    clearly\n\nestablished that failure to change the visiting practice would\n\nconstitute a violation of Mosher’s constitutional rights.                       The\n\ndistrict court held that Nelson was entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n        5\n      Specific information and warnings about inmates are\ncomponents of the overall circumstances that contribute to a\ndetermination of deliberate indifference. See, e.g., Giroux, 178\nF.3d at 34.\n\n                                        -13-\n\f              We agree.    No case had held that the same circumstances\n\nthat   occurred      at    BSH   or   materially   similar   circumstances\n\nconstituted a Fourteenth Amendment violation.            In addition, the\n\ncases addressing a detainee’s right to be free of punishment before\n\nconviction did not clearly apply to the circumstances that existed\n\nin Max 2 in August of 2004.\n\n              It was not clearly established law that in the absence of\n\na   history     of   violence    or   individualized   threats,   a   prison\n\nofficial’s failure to discontinue a long practice of a brief period\n\nof unsupervised visits was deliberate indifference to a substantial\n\nrisk of harm to a patient.            A reasonable official in Nelson’s\n\nplace, given the circumstances and the legal standard, could have\n\nbelieved that allowing the practice to continue would not lead to\n\nevents that would violate a patient’s rights. Therefore, Nelson is\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                      b.   Dennehy\n\n              The Moshers contend that Commissioner Dennehy violated\n\ntheir son’s Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by supervisory\n\nacquiescence and gross negligence in understaffing the Max 2 unit\n\nat BSH.   The Moshers contend BSH was understaffed in 2004, when\n\ntheir son was murdered, that the Max 2 unit should have had five or\n\nsix officers, and that understaffing was a system-wide problem for\n\nthe Department of Corrections. At the time of the murder, however,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fthe BSH staffing analysis required three officers in Max 2, and\n\nfour officers were on duty.\n\n            Without accepting the proposition that understaffing\n\nalone can establish deliberate indifference, on the facts here, a\n\nreasonable official in Dennehy’s position could have reasonably\n\nbelieved    that   staffing    that   met    the   BSH   recommendations    was\n\nsufficient to avoid constitutional violations.            Therefore, Dennehy\n\nis entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nB.   Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n\n            The district court granted summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants on the Moshers’ state law claims, holding that the\n\nclaims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.                 On appeal, the\n\nMoshers contend that Eleventh Amendment immunity is not available\n\nto   the   state   because    their   claims   assert     violations   of   the\n\nconstitutional rights of a person protected by the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (\"ADA\").6       The Moshers acknowledge that they did\n\nnot bring a claim under the ADA in the district court but contend\n\nthat their new theory is sufficiently important to be considered\n\ndespite their omission.        The defendants object that the Moshers\n\nwaived their new ADA claim by failing to allege it in their\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      The Moshers’ citation to 42 U.S.C. § 1213 is incorrect. 42\nU.S.C. § 12131 provides certain definitions used in the ADA while\n§ 12132 prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals\nbased on a disability. It is unclear what statute the Moshers\nintended as the basis for their claim.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fcomplaint or in the proceedings below and argue that the Eleventh\n\nAmendment bars the Moshers’ state law claims.\n\n           As the defendants point out, the Moshers waived the ADA\n\nclaim and their new theory based on the ADA by failing to raise\n\neither theory in the district court.           In addition, even if the\n\nclaims were not waived, the Moshers’ state law claims, brought\n\nagainst the defendants in their official capacities, were for\n\nwrongful   death,     negligence,    gross   negligence,    infliction    of\n\nemotional distress, loss of consortium, and strict liability.\n\nContrary   to   the    Moshers’     new   theory,   they   did   not   allege\n\nconstitutional violations as part of their state law claims nor did\n\nthey allege violations of the ADA.\n\n           The district court properly dismissed the Moshers’ state\n\nlaw claims as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

Following the death of their\n\nson at Bridgewater State Hospital (\"BSH\"), William and Carolyn\n\nMosher (\"the Moshers\") brought a civil rights action, with related\n\nstate law claims, against Kenneth Nelson, Superintendent of BSH;\n\nKathleen Dennehy, Commissioner of the Department of Corrections;\n\nand Elizabeth Childs, Commissioner of the Department of Mental\n\nHealth.1   The district court granted summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants.   The Moshers appeal.          For the reasons that follow, we\n\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           BSH   is   a   facility,    operated      by   the    Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Corrections, that serves as both a prison and a\n\nmental hospital.      Most of the patients at BSH have histories of\n\nviolence in addition to mental illness.          Kenneth Nelson served as\n\nSuperintendent   of    BSH   from   1994     until   April      of   2007.   As\n\nCommissioner of the Department of Corrections, Kathleen Dennehy was\n\nthe chief executive officer of the department, but she did not have\n\nany direct supervisory role at BSH.          Nelson, instead, reported to\n\nan assistant deputy commissioner in the Department of Corrections.\n\nElizabeth Childs, who was Commissioner of the Department of Mental\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Other claims and parties were dismissed from the case, and\nthese dismissals have not been appealed.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fHealth, had no role at BSH except to approve the appointment of a\n\nmedical director at that facility.2\n\n                The Moshers’ son, William Mosher, Jr., was a pretrial\n\ndetainee at the Middlesex County jail in July of 2004, when he was\n\nsent       to   BSH   for   a   thirty-day    observation   period.   After   he\n\nassaulted a nurse, Mosher was held in the Intensive Treatment Unit\n\nat BSH until he was moved to Max 2, one of the maximum security\n\nunits. His observation period was extended from thirty days to six\n\nmonths.\n\n                In 2004, Max 2 was located in a secure stand-alone\n\nbuilding that included individual patient rooms and common areas.\n\nPatients in Max 2 were not allowed to stay in their rooms during\n\nthe day, except during patient count, because the rooms could\n\nshield patients from the observation of the staff, leading to a\n\nconcern about suicide.              An exception to that rule was a long-\n\nstanding practice that allowed patients to remain in their rooms\n\nand visit in other patients’ rooms for a short period from the end\n\nof the morning count, at approximately 11:15 a.m., until lunch. On\n\nAugust 28, 2004, during the period between the end of the morning\n\ncount and lunch, William Mosher, Jr. went into the room of his\n\nneighbor, Bradley Burns.            While Mosher was there, Burns strangled\n\nhim to death with a tee shirt.               No one previously had been killed\n\n\n\n       2\n      The Moshers do not appeal summary judgment that was granted\non their claims against Childs.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fat BSH, and no prior violent incidents had been reported to have\n\noccurred during the visiting period between the end of morning\n\ncount and lunch.         After Mosher’s death, BSH ended the visiting\n\npractice.   At the time Burns killed Mosher, Nelson did not know who\n\nBurns was, although he was aware of Mosher because of his prior\n\nattack on a nurse.\n\n            William and Carolyn Mosher brought claims under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 against the defendants in their individual capacities,\n\nalleging that the defendants’ conduct constituted cruel and unusual\n\npunishment of their son, resulting in his death, and that the\n\ndefendants conspired to perpetuate the challenged conditions of\n\nconfinement.      The Moshers also alleged conspiracies to deprive\n\ntheir son of constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1985 and 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1986.     They further alleged state law claims for damages\n\nagainst the defendants in their official capacities.             The district\n\ncourt   granted    the    defendants’      motion   for   summary   judgment,\n\nconcluding that the evidence was insufficient to prove the Moshers’\n\nconstitutional     claims,    that   the    defendants    were   entitled   to\n\nqualified immunity on the constitutional claims, and that the state\n\nlaw claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment.                The Moshers\n\nappeal the summary judgment decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f                                       II.\n\n           On    appeal,    the    court     reviews    the    district     court’s\n\ndecision granting summary judgment under the de novo standard.\n\nSullivan v.

The\n\nMoshers also argue that Nelson and Dennehy were not entitled to\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fqualified immunity and that Eleventh Amendment immunity does not\n\napply because their state law claims could be construed to arise\n\nunder Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.                     The\n\ndefendants argue in support of the district court’s decision on the\n\ncivil rights claims and the application of the Eleventh Amendment\n\nto the Moshers’ state law claims.         We begin with a consideration of\n\nqualified   immunity,    which   resolves      the   Moshers’   civil   rights\n\nclaims.\n\nA.   Qualified Immunity\n\n            \"Qualified    immunity   is    a   judge-made   construct     that\n\nbroadly protects public officials from the threat of litigation\n\narising out of their performance of discretionary functions.\"\n\nBergeron v.

Somerset County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764362\"><a href=\"/opinion/764362/no-98-1770/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\n\nCir. 1999), where \"jail officials inexplicably introduced a person\n\nposing a known danger, another inmate who had repeatedly threatened\n\nGiroux,   into   the   holding   cell   where   Giroux   was   being   kept.\"\n\nBurrell, 307 F.3d at 9.          The jail officials took that action\n\nalthough they appeared to know that their own actions \"would tar\n\nGiroux as an informant and thereby increase the risk to him.\"            Id.\n\nIn Calderón-Ortiz, we concluded that the plaintiff sufficiently\n\nalleged deliberate indifference to avoid dismissal where inmates\n\nwere not classified, leaving more dangerous inmates with vulnerable\n\ninmates and where \"prison officials failed to make their regular\n\npatrols of the housing areas, allowing a violent attack to go on\n\nfor between half an hour and an hour.\"          Burrell, 307 F.3d at 9.\n\n           In contrast, we concluded that the record in Burrell did\n\nnot sufficiently show deliberate indifference to avoid summary\n\njudgment because the officials responded reasonably to the risk\n\nthat was known to them at the time.        Id. at 8.     There, Burrell and\n\nhis wife complained to prison officials about problems with an\n\ninmate who later attacked Burrell. We concluded that the officials\n\nwere not indifferent and instead acted reasonably in not providing\n\nadditional protection for Burrell because they knew he was highly\n\ntrained in self defense and martial arts, neither Burrell nor his\n\nwife requested protective custody, no history existed of violence\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fbetween Burrell and the inmate who attacked him, and the officials\n\nbelieved Burrell could and would protect himself.\n\n          With the standard in mind, we next consider whether a\n\nreasonable official in Nelson’s position would have been on notice,\n\ngiven the state of the law in 2004, that his conduct violated the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.\n\n          2.   Standard in Factual Context\n\n                  a.    Nelson\n\n          In this case, Nelson was aware of the dangers associated\n\nwith the BSH patients generally and the patients housed in Max 2.\n\nHe was aware of the security rule that the patients in Max 2 were\n\nnot allowed to stay in their rooms except during the count because\n\nof the risk of harm, in particular the risk of suicide, when\n\npatients were out of view of the staff.4     Nelson was also aware\n\nthat, despite the security rule, a long-standing practice existed\n\nwhich allowed patients to stay in their rooms and to visit in each\n\n\n\n     4\n      The Moshers raise a new argument on appeal, contending that\nNelson violated the Phase Treatment Program at BSH by allowing the\npatients to stay in their rooms and visit in other rooms during the\nperiod between the morning count and lunch.      They contend that\nNelson’s disregard of the Phase Treatment Program is further\nevidence of his deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of\nserious harm related to that practice. Because the Moshers failed\nto raise that theory below, it is waived here. See, e.g., In re\nPharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204019\"><a href=\"/opinion/204019/in-re-pharm-industry-average-wholesale-price-lit/\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 183\n(1st Cir. 2009). The exceptions to waiver do not apply in the\ncircumstances of this case. Cf. Guillemard-Ginorio, 585 F.3d at\n517 (reaching abstention issue despite possible waiver). Even if\nthe Moshers’ Phase Treatment Program theory were considered,\nhowever, it would not change the outcome.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fothers’ rooms during the short period between the end of morning\n\ncount and lunch.          When patients were in their rooms or in other\n\npatients’ rooms they were subject to reduced supervision because\n\nthey could be out of the view and earshot of the staff.                    Although\n\nthe visiting practice had been long-standing, no problems or\n\nincidents related to the practice had been reported to Nelson.                   In\n\naddition, Nelson had no specific information about Burns, nor any\n\nreason to suspect that Burns might attack Mosher, nor any reason to\n\nbelieve that Mosher was particularly vulnerable to attack.5\n\n                  For purposes of qualified immunity, we must decide, given\n\nthe state of the law in 2004, whether a reasonable official in\n\nNelson’s position, with his knowledge of the circumstances that\n\nexisted in Max 2 when Burns killed Mosher, would have understood\n\nthat the practice of allowing patients to visit in other patients’\n\nrooms following morning count presented a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm to the patients.            The district court concluded that,\n\ngiven       the    circumstances   in   Burrell,   the   law   was   not    clearly\n\nestablished that failure to change the visiting practice would\n\nconstitute a violation of Mosher’s constitutional rights.                       The\n\ndistrict court held that Nelson was entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n\n\n\n        5\n      Specific information and warnings about inmates are\ncomponents of the overall circumstances that contribute to a\ndetermination of deliberate indifference. See, e.g., Giroux, 178\nF.3d at 34.\n\n                                        -13-\n\f              We agree.    No case had held that the same circumstances\n\nthat   occurred      at    BSH   or   materially   similar   circumstances\n\nconstituted a Fourteenth Amendment violation.            In addition, the\n\ncases addressing a detainee’s right to be free of punishment before\n\nconviction did not clearly apply to the circumstances that existed\n\nin Max 2 in August of 2004.\n\n              It was not clearly established law that in the absence of\n\na   history     of   violence    or   individualized   threats,   a   prison\n\nofficial’s failure to discontinue a long practice of a brief period\n\nof unsupervised visits was deliberate indifference to a substantial\n\nrisk of harm to a patient.            A reasonable official in Nelson’s\n\nplace, given the circumstances and the legal standard, could have\n\nbelieved that allowing the practice to continue would not lead to\n\nevents that would violate a patient’s rights. Therefore, Nelson is\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                      b.   Dennehy\n\n              The Moshers contend that Commissioner Dennehy violated\n\ntheir son’s Fourteenth Amendment due process rights by supervisory\n\nacquiescence and gross negligence in understaffing the Max 2 unit\n\nat BSH.   The Moshers contend BSH was understaffed in 2004, when\n\ntheir son was murdered, that the Max 2 unit should have had five or\n\nsix officers, and that understaffing was a system-wide problem for\n\nthe Department of Corrections. At the time of the murder, however,\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fthe BSH staffing analysis required three officers in Max 2, and\n\nfour officers were on duty.\n\n            Without accepting the proposition that understaffing\n\nalone can establish deliberate indifference, on the facts here, a\n\nreasonable official in Dennehy’s position could have reasonably\n\nbelieved    that   staffing    that   met    the   BSH   recommendations    was\n\nsufficient to avoid constitutional violations.            Therefore, Dennehy\n\nis entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nB.   Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n\n            The district court granted summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants on the Moshers’ state law claims, holding that the\n\nclaims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.                 On appeal, the\n\nMoshers contend that Eleventh Amendment immunity is not available\n\nto   the   state   because    their   claims   assert     violations   of   the\n\nconstitutional rights of a person protected by the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (\"ADA\").6       The Moshers acknowledge that they did\n\nnot bring a claim under the ADA in the district court but contend\n\nthat their new theory is sufficiently important to be considered\n\ndespite their omission.        The defendants object that the Moshers\n\nwaived their new ADA claim by failing to allege it in their\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      The Moshers’ citation to 42 U.S.C. § 1213 is incorrect. 42\nU.S.C. § 12131 provides certain definitions used in the ADA while\n§ 12132 prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals\nbased on a disability. It is unclear what statute the Moshers\nintended as the basis for their claim.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fcomplaint or in the proceedings below and argue that the Eleventh\n\nAmendment bars the Moshers’ state law claims.\n\n           As the defendants point out, the Moshers waived the ADA\n\nclaim and their new theory based on the ADA by failing to raise\n\neither theory in the district court.           In addition, even if the\n\nclaims were not waived, the Moshers’ state law claims, brought\n\nagainst the defendants in their official capacities, were for\n\nwrongful   death,     negligence,    gross   negligence,    infliction    of\n\nemotional distress, loss of consortium, and strict liability.\n\nContrary   to   the    Moshers’     new   theory,   they   did   not   allege\n\nconstitutional violations as part of their state law claims nor did\n\nthey allege violations of the ADA.\n\n           The district court properly dismissed the Moshers’ state\n\nlaw claims as barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n                                      IV.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, summary judgment for the\n\ndefendants is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f</pre>",
