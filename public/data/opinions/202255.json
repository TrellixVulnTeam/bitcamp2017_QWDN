Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on brief for\nappellant.\n     Mark S. Zuckerman, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Thomas P.\nColantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              June 9, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam. Defendant-appellant Nicholas Alvarez-Enciso\n\nappeals from his sentence imposed following his guilty plea to\n\nillegal re-entry to the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. §§\n\n1326(a) and 1326(b)(2).1 Appellant does not challenge the district\n\ncourt's calculation of the advisory guideline sentencing range\n\n(GSR), but argues that the sentencing court's failure to reduce his\n\nsentence below the GSR of 24 to 30 months based on certain\n\nmitigating factors was unreasonable and resulted in a sentence that\n\nwas greater than necessary to effectuate the statutory purposes\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n            Neither party disputes the calculation of that GSR.\n\nAlvarez    filed   a   sentencing    memorandum   requesting     an   18-month\n\nsentence,    pressing    certain    mitigating    factors   as   grounds    for\n\nsentencing below the GSR.          The government filed an opposition to\n\nthat request and, at sentencing, recommended 24 months, at the\n\nbottom of the applicable GSR.          The court noted that in view of\n\nAlvarez's prior deportations and repeated illegal re-entries, a\n\nsentence in excess of 24 months would be warranted.              However, it\n\nfollowed the government's recommendation and imposed a 24-month\n\nsentence.      The     court   specifically   mentioned     several    of   the\n\nmitigating factors relied upon by Alvarez, as well as the factors\n\nmentioned by the government as reasons not to sentence him below\n\nthe GSR.      Finally, the court referred to specific sentencing\n\n\n     1\n       8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2) establishes a maximum sentence of 20\nyears where the removal was subsequent to a conviction for\ncommission of an \"aggravated felony.\"\n\fpurposes set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), in explaining its reason\n\nfor imposing a 24-month sentence.\n\n           None of the mitigating factors relied upon by Alvarez\n\nrenders his sentence unreasonable. The first factor Alvarez relies\n\nupon is the disparity created by the absence of a \"fast-track\"\n\nprogram.   As Alvarez concedes in a Rule 28(j) letter, Jimenez-\n\nBeltre \"largely resolve[s] the parties' arguments about the absence\n\nof a 'fast-track program' in the District of New Hampshire.\"     In\n\nJimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), we held\n\nthat at least where a defendant had failed to \"furnish[] a factual\n\nbasis for assessing the extent of the disparities or provided a\n\nreason why to take them into account,\" the sentencing court did not\n\nact unreasonably in declining to alter the sentence on that basis.\n\nSee also United States v. Martinez-Flores, 428 F.3d 22, 30 n. 3 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (stating, in dicta, that \"[i]t is arguable that even\n\npost-Booker, it would never be reasonable to depart downward based\n\non disparities between fast-track and non-fast-track jurisdictions\n\ngiven Congress' clear (if implied) statement in the PROTECT Act\n\nprovision that such disparities are acceptable\"), cert. denied, __\n\nU.S. __, 126 S. Ct. 1449 (2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f            The second factor on which Alvarez relies in support of\n\nhis request for a reduced sentence is the nature of the \"aggravated\n\nfelony\" on which his eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. §\n\n2L1.2(b)(1)(C) was based.      The underlying convictions were for\n\n\"Criminal Threatening\" and \"Simple Assault,\" arising from a single\n\nincident involving Alvarez's assault upon a bartender who had\n\nevicted him for creating a disturbance. Those convictions resulted\n\nin two one-year sentences, which were suspended except for 183 days\n\nof time served.\n\n            Appellant   acknowledges      that   under   United   States   v.\n\nCordoza-Estrada, 385 F.3d 56, 57-58 (1st Cir. 2004), the convictions\n\nconstitute an aggravated felony regardless of the fact that much of\n\nthe prison term was suspended.      The mere fact that if the suspended\n\nsentence imposed had been for less than one year, the eight-level\n\nenhancement would not have been triggered does not render the\n\ninstant sentence unreasonable.       Alvarez's argument that the light\n\nsentences imposed demonstrate that the description of the offense\n\nconduct contained in the presentence investigation report (PSR)\n\nmust be exaggerated is also unavailing.          Alvarez did not object at\n\nsentencing to the factual description of his conduct contained in\n\nthe PSR.\n\n            The final mitigating factor on which Alvarez relies is\n\n\"cultural assimilation,\" based on his family ties and work history\n\nin   this   country.    Assuming,   without      deciding,   that   cultural\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fassimilation might provide a proper basis for granting a sentence\n\nbelow the GSR in certain illegal re-entry cases, it was not\n\nunreasonable to decline to reduce Alvarez's sentence on this basis.\n\nAlvarez was twenty years old when he came to this country.            He is\n\nunmarried, has one daughter living in Mexico, and is estranged from\n\nhis other daughter (who lives in the United States).            While in the\n\nUnited States, he lived and worked in at least three different\n\nstates.\n\n            The district court specifically stated that it had taken\n\nfamily ties into account, finding that Alvarez \"has substantial\n\nfamily ties to the United States and fewer ties to his native\n\nMexico.\"    However, the court also took into account that Alvarez\n\nhad repeatedly re-entered the country following deportation.             It\n\nwas not unreasonable for the district court to find that Alvarez's\n\nfamily    ties   were   counterbalanced   by   his   repeated   immigration\n\noffenses. See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 441 F.3d 767,\n\n770 (9th Cir. 2006)(holding that district court's determination that\n\ncultural assimilation factors were counterbalanced by defendant's\n\nextensive criminal history was not unreasonable); cf. United States\n\nv. Zapete-Garcia, __ F.3d __, 2006 WL 1216670, at * 2 (1st Cir., May\n\n8, 2006)(noting that it is not necessarily unreasonable for a judge\n\nto increase the sentence (above the GSR) of a defendant who had\n\npreviously been deported more than once).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f            In imposing the 24-month sentence, the court expressly\n\nidentified the § 3553(a) purposes that would be effectuated by the\n\nsentence imposed: to \"reflect the seriousness of the offense . . .\n\nand . . . provide just punishment for the offense,\" and \"afford\n\nadequate deterrence to others who may consider reentering the\n\ncountry after deportation and will protect the public from further\n\ncrimes of this defendant.\"          The court did not expressly address\n\neach of the mitigating factors raised by Alvarez, however its\n\n\"reasoning can be inferred by comparing what was argued by the\n\nparties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge\n\ndid.\" Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519.         While the court did not\n\nspecifically mention the \"parsimony provision,\" under § 3553(a), it\n\nstated that Alvarez's repeated illegal re-entries alone would\n\nwarrant imposing a sentence in excess of 24 months and identified\n\nthe purposes served by the sentence imposed. On this record, those\n\nstatements \"suffice[] as a conclusion that the sentence was not\n\nlonger than necessary.\" United States v. Alli, 444 F.3d 34, 41 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n            The district court's calculation of the guideline range\n\nis uncontested.     The court provided a reasoned explanation for the\n\nsentence it imposed, identifying the statutory purposes that would\n\nbe served.       And the outcome - a sentence at the bottom of that\n\nrange   -   is   plausible.   See   Jimenez-Beltre,   440   F.3d   at   519.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fAccordingly, we summarily affirm the sentence. See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",
