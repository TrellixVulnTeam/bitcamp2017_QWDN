Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                   Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Stephen Gordon with whom Stephen Gordon & Associates was on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Peter J.

This appeal concerns efforts by the\n\nTown of Berlin to bring certain attractions owned by appellant\n\nSpookyworld,       Inc.    (\"Spookyworld\"),          into    compliance       with   the\n\nMassachusetts Building Code.            780 C.M.R (passim) (6th ed. 1997).\n\nSpookyworld was created in 1991 by sole shareholders David and\n\nLinda Bertolino.          The corporation built a horror theme park in\n\nBerlin, Massachusetts, on land leased from a trust controlled by\n\nthe Bertolinos.      The park celebrated Halloween, opening every year\n\nonly for the month of October.\n\n            From    modest     beginnings,      Spookyworld's          business      grew\n\nquickly: in 1997, it grossed $1,880,000, and by 1998, it was\n\nemploying approximately 500 people during its annual month of\n\noperation.     In 1998 the park contained three buildings housing a\n\ntotal of five attractions: a barn, which included a haunted house\n\nand a \"celebrity area\" on the main floor and a haunted \"mine shaft\"\n\nin   the   basement;      a   \"museum    display\";          and   a   metal    building\n\ncontaining a 3-D wax museum.\n\n             On September 30, 1998, the building inspector for the\n\nTown of Berlin, Lawrence Brandt, issued three certificates of\n\ninspection    to    Spookyworld,        one    for    each    building.         Shortly\n\nthereafter, on October 7, Brandt sent a letter to David Bertolino\n\nrescinding the certificate covering the haunted house and the\n\nhaunted mine shaft.        According to Brandt, recent amendments to the\n\nMassachusetts Building Code required that these two attractions\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fhave sprinkler systems installed.         780 C.M.R. § 413.4 (6th ed.\n\n1997).1\n\n          Because   of   Brandt's    actions,   Spookyworld   faced   the\n\nprospect of having to close two of its principal draws for the\n\nduration of the critical month of October.       Spookyworld therefore\n\nimmediately appealed Brandt's decision to the building code appeals\n\nboard under Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 143, § 100 (West 2002).          Under\n\nthat provision, Spookyworld's appeal had the effect of staying all\n\nenforcement proceedings against it, unless state or local officials\n\ncould present evidence that the stay would \"involve imminent peril\n\nof life or property.\"    Id.; see also 780 C.M.R. § 122.3.3 (6th ed.\n\n1997).\n\n          Spookyworld then began negotiations with town officials,\n\nattempting to work out an interim solution whereby the haunted\n\nhouse and the haunted mine shaft could continue to operate through\n\nOctober without shutting down for sprinkler installation.        Duncan\n\nBaum, the town's assistant fire chief, and Gene Novak, a regional\n\nbuilding inspector, participated in the negotiations.         Among the\n\noptions discussed was a \"fire watch,\" which would have involved\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Defendants say in their brief that there were multiple\nproblems with all three buildings and that Brandt withdrew the\ncertificates for all of them. Nevertheless, the principal dispute\nbetween the parties relates to the haunted house and haunted mine\nshaft and to the question whether these two attractions required\nsprinkler systems.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fSpookyworld's paying the town to station fire personnel at the park\n\nduring its hours of operation.\n\n            The negotiations ultimately broke down, and on October\n\n16, 1998,    the   town    filed   a   complaint     against     Spookyworld    in\n\nWorcester    Superior     Court.       The    complaint   sought   a   temporary\n\nrestraining order, shutting down the haunted house and the haunted\n\nmine shaft until such time as sprinkler systems could be installed\n\nin each; the complaint also sought a fine for each day of non-\n\ncompliance. The court issued the temporary restraining order later\n\nthat day.\n\n            One hour after the order issued, Spookyworld filed a\n\nchapter 11    petition     under   the       Bankruptcy   Code   and   sought   to\n\ncontinue operating both attractions by virtue of the automatic stay\n\nprovided by the statute.      11 U.S.C. § 362(a) (2000).           The very next\n\nday, however, Spookyworld was forced to shut down the attractions\n\nwhen town officials came to the park and threatened to arrest\n\nSpookyworld employees for non-compliance with the court order.\n\n            In response, Spookyworld filed an adversary complaint in\n\nbankruptcy court, seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the\n\nstate court proceedings and prevent any action on the part of the\n\ntown to close park facilities. At an emergency hearing held before\n\nthe bankruptcy court on October 20, 1998, counsel for the town\n\nclaimed that continued operation of the two facilities in question\n\nposed an immediate danger to the safety of the park's customers.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fThe town's counsel also represented that the town's actions enjoyed\n\nthe support of the highest public safety officials of the state.\n\nThe bankruptcy court refused to grant Spookyworld's requested\n\ninjunction, citing the police power exception to the automatic\n\nstay.    11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(4) (2000).\n\n            Shortly thereafter the Worcester Superior Court held a\n\nhearing on the continuation of the town's temporary restraining\n\norder.    Counsel for the town made representations at this hearing\n\nsimilar to the ones he had made before the bankruptcy court.          After\n\nthe hearing, the court converted the temporary restraining order\n\ninto a preliminary injunction.       The haunted house and the haunted\n\nmine shaft remained closed for the rest of October 1998.\n\n            On   February   9,   1999,    Spookyworld   filed   an   amended\n\nadversary complaint in bankruptcy court.           The amended complaint\n\nalleged that the Town of Berlin and various of its officials had\n\nwillfully violated the automatic stay.        The amended complaint also\n\ncontained a section 1983 claim, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000), a section\n\n1985 claim, id. § 1985, and several state law claims including\n\nlibel, slander, interference with contractual relationships, and\n\nviolations of Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 12, § 11H-I (West 2002).           In due\n\ncourse, defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.\n\n           On August 2, 2001, the bankruptcy court ruled that\n\nSpookyworld's automatic stay claim was a core bankruptcy claim and\n\nthat all of Spookyworld's other claims were non-core claims. In re\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fSpookyworld,   266   B.R.   1,    6-11    (Bankr.   D.   Mass.   2001).      The\n\nbankruptcy court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment\n\nwith respect to the automatic stay claim, 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1)\n\n(2000); and,   as    to   the    rest    of   Spookyworld's   claims,     framed\n\nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending the\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.                28 U.S.C. §\n\n157(c)(1) (2000); Spookyworld, 266 B.R. at 11-20.\n\n          Spookyworld filed a timely appeal to the district court\n\nchallenging the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment on the\n\ncore automatic stay claim.        Possibly the notice could be read also\n\nto embrace a challenge to the bankruptcy court's proposed findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law with regard to the non-core claims.\n\nIf the latter was intended, use of an appeal was a procedural\n\nmisstep; the proposed findings and conclusions were not a judgment\n\nsubject to \"appeal\" but recommendations to the district court. The\n\ncorrect, and required, course was to file \"specific objections\" to\n\nthose recommendations that were disputed by Spookyworld. 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 157(c)(1) (2000); Fed. R. Bank. P. 9033.\n\n          On December 19, 2001, no specific objections to the\n\nrecommendations having been filed within the time provided, the\n\ndistrict court adopted the bankruptcy court's proposed findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law; accordingly, the district court, by\n\norder dated the same day, granted judgment to the defendants on the\n\nnon-core claims.     Whether Spookyworld was immediately aware of the\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fDecember 19 actions is unclear, but at no point did it seek to\n\nreopen this judgment based on lack of notice.\n\n           The appeal as to the core claims was more protracted.\n\nOver a year later and after briefing by both sides the district\n\ncourt on January 23, 2003, issued a memorandum and order affirming\n\n(on grounds described below) the bankruptcy court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment to defendants on Spookyworld's core automatic stay\n\nclaim.   The district court then dismissed Spookyworld's appeal on\n\nJanuary 24, 2003. Spookyworld's district court brief also attacked\n\nthe recommendations on the non-core claims but the district court\n\nnoted that those had already been disposed of by the December 19,\n\n2001, judgment. Spookyworld filed a notice of appeal to this court\n\non February 21, 2003.\n\n           In this court, Spookyworld contests both the district\n\ncourt order   of   December   19,   2001,   entering   judgment   for   the\n\ndefendants on the non-core claims (the \"non-core order\") and the\n\nmemorandum and order of January 23, 2003, affirming the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's disposition of the core automatic stay claim (the \"core\n\norder\").    At the threshold, defendants say that Spookyworld's\n\nnotice of appeal does not encompass the non-core order, and that\n\ntherefore we lack power to consider it on the merits.       Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 3(c); Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 248 (1992) (\"Rule 3's\n\ndictates are jurisdictional in nature . . . .\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f              Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) states: \"The notice of appeal\n\nmust       designate    the   judgment,   order,   or   part   thereof   being\n\nappealed.\"       The requirements of Rule 3 are liberally construed,\n\nBarry, 502 U.S. at 248, and \"[a] mistake in designating a judgment\n\n. . . in the notice of appeal ordinarily will not result in loss of\n\nthe appeal as long as the intent to appeal a specific judgment can\n\nbe fairly inferred from the notice and appellee is not misled by\n\nthe mistake.\"          Kelly v. United States, 789 F.2d 94, 96 n.3 (1st\n\nCir. 1986). But Rule 3 must still be satisfied, and \"noncompliance\n\nis fatal to an appeal.\"         Barry, 502 U.S. at 248; Torres v. Oakland\n\nScavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 317 n.3 (1988).\n\n              Spookyworld's notice of appeal to this court says in its\n\nentirety:\n\n               [Now comes] the Appellant Spookyworld, Inc.\n               and appeals the Order of Dismissal of the\n               District Court dated 1/23/03 affirming the\n               decision of the Bankruptcy Court which\n               allowed the Motion of Defendants, Town of\n               Berlin, et al for Summary Judgment.\n\nThis language refers only to the order resolving the core claim,2\n\nand this is not sufficient to inform either defendants or the court\n\nof Spookyworld's intent to appeal the non-core order.              Barry, 502\n\nU.S. at 248.       Accordingly, we do not reach the questions whether\n\n\n       2\n      The district court's own core order does mention the non-core\norder but only to say it previously resolved the non-core claims;\na \"passing allusion\" to a previous order in the order designated by\nthe notice of appeal is not enough to incorporate the previous\norder into the notice. See Kotler v. Am. Tobacco Co., 981 F.2d 7,\n12 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdefendants were prejudiced or whether an appeal from the non-core\n\norder issued over a year before the notice of appeal was filed\n\nwould have been timely.    Fed. R. App. P. 6(a); Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(1)(A).\n\n           Occasionally, an opening brief has been treated as a\n\nnotice of appeal, and Spookyworld's brief in this court does\n\ncontest the disposition of the non-core order.    But Spookyworld's\n\nopening brief was not filed until May 20, 2003, which is well after\n\nthe 30 days for filing a notice of appeal, Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(1)(A), from the core order (issued on January 23, 2003), and\n\nover a year after the non-core order (issued on December 19, 2001).\n\nBarry, 502 U.S. at 249 (appellate court may treat a filing \"styled\n\nas a brief as a notice of appeal,\" but only \"if the filing is\n\ntimely under Rule 4 and conveys the information required by Rule\n\n3(c)\").\n\n           This brings us to the bankruptcy court's grant of summary\n\njudgment to defendants on Spookyworld's core automatic stay claim\n\nwhich we review de novo,   In re Varrasso, 37 F.3d 760, 762-63 (1st\n\nCir. 1994), construing the record in the light most favorable to\n\nSpookyworld as the non-moving party.      Triangle Trading Co. v.\n\nRobroy Indus., 200 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1999); Varrasso, 37 F.3d at\n\n763.   We must affirm if \"no genuine issue of material fact exists,\n\nand [defendants have] successfully demonstrated an entitlement to\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fjudgment as a matter of law.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Fed. R.\n\nBankr. P. 7056; Varrasso, 37 F.3d at 763.\n\n           Spookyworld argues that defendants' actions, including\n\nthe continued prosecution of the state court case after Spookyworld\n\nfiled its chapter 11 proceeding, constitute a willful violation of\n\nthe automatic stay, entitling it to damages under section 362(h).\n\nThe bankruptcy court ruled that these actions rested on the town's\n\npolice or regulatory power and so were exempt from the automatic\n\nstay under section 362(b)(4). Spookyworld, 266 B.R. at 17-20. The\n\ndistrict court affirmed but on a different ground:    it held that\n\ncorporations cannot take advantage of section 362(h)'s right of\n\naction because the provision only authorizes suits brought by\n\n\"individual[s].\"\n\n           In our view both courts were right.    We conclude that\n\nSpookyworld, because it is a corporation, cannot bring suit under\n\nsection 362(h), and that even if it could, defendants' actions are\n\nwithin the police power exception to the automatic stay.   We also\n\nreject Spookyworld's alternative argument that the bankruptcy court\n\nshould have sanctioned defendants according to its contempt powers\n\nunder 11 U.S.C. § 105(a) (2000). These three issues are considered\n\nin turn.\n\n           Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, imposing the\n\nautomatic stay, applies generally to proceedings against \"the\n\ndebtor.\" By contrast, section 362(h) says: \"An individual injured\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fby any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall\n\nrecover actual damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, and,\n\nin   appropriate   circumstances,   may   recover   punitive   damages.\"\n\nDefendants argue that the term \"individual\" means that corporations\n\nare not authorized to collect damages under section 362.\n\n           There is currently a circuit split.       Two circuits hold\n\nthat the term \"individual\" includes corporations, and four circuits\n\nhold that it does not.3    Every district court in this circuit to\n\nconsider the issue has endorsed the majority view, as has the\n\ncircuit's Bankruptcy Appellate Panel.4     Analysis starts, as usual,\n\nwith the statutory language, United States v. Ron Pair Enters., 489\n\nU.S. 235, 241-42 (1989), although bare words would not license a\n\nresult \"demonstrably at odds\" with legislative intent.         Id. at 242\n\n(quoting Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 571\n\n(1982)).\n\n           The Bankruptcy Code does not define \"individual,\" but\n\nseveral provisions indicate that the term was not meant to include\n\n\n      3\n      Compare In re Atlantic Bus. and Cmty.

See In re\n\nCrysen/Montenay Energy Co., 902 F.2d 1098, 1104 (2d Cir. 1990); In\n\nre A & J Auto Sales, Inc., 223 B.R. 839, 844-45 (D.N.H. 1998).\n\n          After enactment of section 362(h), corporations (and\n\nother non-\"individual[s]\")     remain   free   to   petition   bankruptcy\n\ncourts to award damages for automatic stay violations pursuant to\n\ntheir section 105(a) power.     See, e.g., Chateaugay, 920 F.2d at\n\n186-87.   A discretionary remedy is not as good as one that is\n\nassured, see Goodman v. Knight, 991 F.2d 613, 620-21 (9th Cir.\n\n1993), but Congress could easily have thought that corporations\n\nneeded less protection.   As the Second Circuit explains:\n\n          After Congress in 1978 passed the automatic\n          stay provisions of § 362 along with the rest\n          of the code, including § 105(a) . . ., it is\n          entirely possible that Congress then chose to\n          expand the remedies for violations one step at\n          a time. Congress may well have thought that\n          individual    debtors     were    particularly\n          vulnerable to violations of the stay by debt-\n          collection agencies and others who may be\n          tempted to believe that individuals are less\n          likely than corporations to be aware of their\n          rights under the automatic stay.\n\nChateaugay, 920 F.2d at 186.\n\n          In sum, we agree with the Second, Eighth, Ninth, and\n\nEleventh Circuits, and with the district courts and the BAP in this\n\ncircuit, and hold that corporations cannot sue under section 362(h)\n\nto obtain damages for violation of the automatic stay.          Statutory\n\nlanguage so suggests and neither legislative history nor policy\n\n                                 -13-\n\fconcerns point the other way.         It is well to have this issue\n\nsettled in this circuit at least until the Supreme Court addresses\n\nthe matter--which might take some time if other circuits follow the\n\nplurality view.\n\n          Spookyworld argues that, so construed, section 362(h)\n\ndenies equal protection under the Fifth Amendment to closely held\n\ncorporations, like itself, that have only a few shareholders. But\n\nwhen drawing distinctions that do not involve fundamental rights or\n\nsuspect classes, Congress need only have a rational basis for its\n\ndecisions, United States R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 175-\n\n76 (1980).      There is nothing irrational in drawing economic-\n\nregulation lines between individuals and corporations, closely held\n\nor otherwise; indeed, the Internal Revenue Code is rife with such\n\ndistinctions.\n\n          Even if corporations could sue, we would still affirm the\n\nbankruptcy   court's   grant   of   summary   judgment   on   the   merits.\n\nOrdinarily, bankruptcy automatically stays lawsuits in other courts\n\nagainst the debtor, see, e.g., ICC v. Holmes Transp., Inc., 931\n\nF.2d 984, 987-88 (1st Cir. 1991), but this is subject to the so-\n\ncalled police power exception.       Section 362(b)(4) says:\n\n          The filing of a [chapter 11] petition . . .\n          does not operate as a stay . . . of the\n          commencement or continuation of an action or\n          proceeding by a governmental unit . . . to\n          enforce such governmental unit's . . . police\n          or regulatory power.\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(4) (2000).     The town is a \"governmental unit\"\n\nwithin the meaning of 362(b)(4). Cournoyer v. Town of Lincoln, 790\n\nF.2d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n          Spookyworld says that this section does not apply because\n\nthe defendants' actions were undertaken in bad faith. According to\n\nSpookyworld, the defendants in securing the temporary restraining\n\norder from the Worcester Superior Court deliberately exaggerated\n\nthe dangers of operating the haunted house and the haunted mine\n\nshaft without sprinklers, the severity of any alleged building code\n\nviolations, and the degree to which state public safety officials\n\nsupported their decision to take legal action.\n\n          Spookyworld also says that when it sought protection\n\nunder chapter 11, the town similarly misled the bankruptcy court\n\nin convincing it not to enjoin the state court action.    It claims\n\nthat the defendants again misrepresented the situation when they\n\nconvinced the Worcester Superior Court, post-petition, to convert\n\nits temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction.   It\n\nsays that the record demonstrates these false statements or, at the\n\nvery least, that their falsity involves factual issues barring the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment.\n\n          For clarity's sake, Spookyworld's argument should be\n\ndistinguished from a related, but here inapplicable, limitation on\n\nthe use of the police power exception to the automatic stay.   Under\n\nthe case law, the exception does not apply if the government takes\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\flegal action to advance its own \"pecuniary\" interest (or perhaps\n\nthe pecuniary interest of others); but it does apply if the\n\ngovernment acts in the interest of \"public safety and welfare.\"\n\nE.g., In re Universal Life Church, 128 F.3d 1294, 1297-98 (9th Cir.\n\n1997); see also Chao v. Hosp. Staffing Servs., Inc., 270 F.3d 374,\n\n385-89 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\n            The Massachusetts Building Code is plainly aimed at\n\nprotecting the public, and Spookyworld does not say otherwise.           In\n\nadopting the police power exception to the automatic stay, Congress\n\nexplained that \"where a governmental unit is suing a debtor to\n\nprevent or stop violation of fraud, environmental protection,\n\nconsumer protection, safety, or similar police or regulatory laws\n\n. . . the action or proceeding is not stayed under the automatic\n\nstay.\"     S. Rep. No. 95-989, at 52 (1978).        Accord, Cournoyer, 790\n\nF.2d at 975-77 (enforcement of zoning regulation within police\n\npower exception).\n\n            Admittedly, there is some authority for the proposition\n\nthat government actions undertaken in bad faith are not exempt from\n\nthe automatic stay.       See In re Nat'l Hosp. and Institutional\n\nBuilders Co., 658 F.2d 39, 43-44 (2d Cir. 1981) (under the old\n\nBankruptcy Act which had no built-in police power exception); In re\n\nBeker Indus. Corp., 57 B.R. 611, 627 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1986).\n\nHowever,    National   Hospital   was    arguably    undermined,   if   not\n\noverruled, by Board of Governors v. MCorp Financial, Inc., 502 U.S.\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f32, 40 (1991), which held that bankruptcy courts should not inquire\n\ninto       the     \"legitimacy\"   of   ongoing   administrative     enforcement\n\nproceedings in determining whether the police power exception\n\napplies to them.5\n\n                  We are doubtful whether a bad faith exception should be\n\nread       into    section   362(b)(4)   where   the   state    directive   being\n\nenforced is directed at ordinary public purposes.                 There is much\n\nforce to the dissent of Judge Mansfield in National Hospital:\n\n                  [A bad faith] exception would result in\n                  Bankruptcy Court mini-trials of purely state\n                  regulatory issues whenever, as might be\n                  expected to happen frequently, the debtor\n                  sought by claiming 'bad faith' to have those\n                  issues tried in a Bankruptcy Court, which\n                  would be sympathetic toward any resolution\n                  that would improve the estate, rather than\n                  before state tribunals. The proper remedy is\n                  to seek redress in the state courts which may\n                  be expected not to tolerate bad faith conduct\n                  . . . .\n\nNational Hospital, 658 F.2d at 46.               By contrast, the pecuniary\n\npurpose exception need present no such dangers.                Cf. Safety-Kleen,\n\nInc. v. Wyche, 274 F.3d 846, 865 (4th Cir. 2001) (pecuniary purpose\n\ntest looks only to the objective purpose of the underlying law\n\nsought to be enforced).\n\n\n\n       5\n      See In re Javens, 107 F.3d 359, 365-67 & n. 6 (6th Cir. 1997)\n(finding that National Hospital's analysis did not survive MCorp).\nAfter MCorp, the Sixth Circuit concluded that bankruptcy courts\nretain the power to enjoin bad faith exercises of police or\nregulatory power (presumably under section 105(a)), but this was\nnot a claim that the automatic stay operated in such a case. Id.\nat 366-67 & n. 7.\n\n                                         -17-\n\f          Of course, one can imagine some fairly appealing cases\n\nfor a bad faith exception; suppose that incontrovertible proof was\n\navailable that the town's lawyer had brought a wholly baseless\n\ninjunction action against Spookyworld motivated by personal malice.\n\nYet such an injunction could easily be overturned by offering the\n\nsame evidence to the state court; and state remedies exist for\n\nmalicious prosecution.    Thus, the case for a bad faith exception\n\nseems thin; but, even if such an exception existed--which we need\n\nnot definitively decide--it would not extend to this case.\n\n          On   summary   judgment   we   are   bound   to   assume   that\n\nSpookyworld could prove that defendants exaggerated the seriousness\n\nof the building code violations, but this is a far cry from showing\n\nthat the defendants brought the state action for ulterior motives\n\nor that they did not believe in the basic genuineness of their\n\ncase.   Lawyers constantly overstate their claims.          In a robust\n\nadversary system, courts offer lawyers a measure of latitude.\n\n          If misstatements and exaggeration in the state court were\n\nenough to defeat the automatic stay, the bankruptcy courts would be\n\nrelitigating state enforcement actions every day.       The game is not\n\nworth the candle.   It is well to remember that section 362(b)(4)\n\nembodies a fundamental judgment of Congress:       that protecting the\n\npublic welfare and safety trumps the concerns that underlie the\n\nautomatic stay, a provision whose main purpose is to prevent some\n\nprivate creditors from gaining priority on other creditors.          See,\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fe.g., Mann v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp., 316 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n          There are penalties enough, formal as well as informal,\n\nfor lawyers and other officials who make false factual statements\n\nto courts.    Indeed, Spookyworld itself argues in the alternative\n\nthat the bankruptcy court should have awarded it damages under\n\nsection 105(a). As noted earlier, bankruptcy courts do possess the\n\ndiscretionary   authority   to   award   damages   for   automatic   stay\n\nviolations as part of their power to \"issue any order . . . that is\n\nnecessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this\n\ntitle.\" 11 U.S.C. § 105(a) (2000); Chateaugay, 920 F.2d at 186-87.\n\n\n\n          This alternative claim for damages is waived because\n\nSpookyworld did not make it before the district court.       See Daigle\n\nv. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).        In any\n\nevent, the decision whether to award such damages is discretionary.\n\nGoodman, 991 F.2d at 620.    On this record, there is nothing that\n\nwould make it an abuse of discretion to refuse to award damages\n\nunder the contempt power.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f",

(\"Spookyworld\"), into compliance with the Massachusetts Building Code. 780 C.M.R (passim) (6th ed.1997). Spookyworld was created in 1991 by sole shareholders David and Linda Bertolino. The corporation built a horror theme park in Berlin, Massachusetts, on land leased from a trust controlled by the Bertolinos. The park celebrated Halloween, opening every year only for the month of October.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From modest beginnings, Spookyworld's business grew quickly: in 1997, it grossed $1,880,000, and by 1998, it was employing approximately 500 people during its annual month of operation. In 1998 the park contained three buildings housing a total of five attractions: a barn, which included a haunted house and a \"celebrity area\" on the main floor and a haunted \"mine shaft\" in the basement; a \"museum display\"; and a metal building containing a 3-D wax museum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 1998, the building inspector for the Town of Berlin, Lawrence Brandt, issued three certificates of inspection to Spookyworld, one for each building. Shortly thereafter, on October 7, Brandt sent a letter to David Bertolino rescinding the certificate covering the haunted house and the haunted mine shaft. According to Brandt, recent amendments to the Massachusetts Building Code required that these two attractions have sprinkler systems installed. 780 C.M.R. &#167; 413.4 (6th ed.1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of Brandt's actions, Spookyworld faced the prospect of having to close two of its principal draws for the duration of the critical month of October. Spookyworld therefore immediately appealed Brandt's decision to the building code appeals board under Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 143, &#167; 100 (West 2002). Under that provision, Spookyworld's appeal had the effect of staying all enforcement proceedings against it, unless state or local officials could present evidence that the stay would \"involve imminent peril of life or property.\" <i>Id.; see also</i> 780 C.M.R. &#167; 122.3.3 (6th ed.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spookyworld then began negotiations with town officials, attempting to work out an interim solution whereby the haunted house and the haunted mine shaft could continue to operate through October without shutting down for sprinkler installation. Duncan Baum, the town's assistant fire chief, and Gene Novak, a regional building inspector, participated in the negotiations. Among the options discussed was a \"fire watch,\" which would have involved Spookyworld's paying the town to station fire personnel at the park during its hours of operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The negotiations ultimately broke down, and on October 16, 1998, the town filed a complaint against Spookyworld in Worcester Superior Court. The complaint sought a temporary restraining order, shutting down the haunted house and the haunted mine shaft until such time as sprinkler systems could be installed in each; the complaint also sought a fine for each day of non-compliance. The court issued the temporary restraining order later that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One hour after the order issued, Spookyworld filed a chapter 11 petition under the Bankruptcy Code and sought to continue operating both attractions by virtue of the automatic stay provided by the statute. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a) (2000). The very next day, however, Spookyworld was forced to shut down the attractions when town officials came to the park and threatened to arrest Spookyworld employees for non-compliance with the court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Spookyworld filed an adversary complaint in bankruptcy court, seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the state court proceedings and prevent any action on the part of the town to close park facilities. At an emergency hearing held before the bankruptcy court on October 20, 1998, counsel for the town claimed that continued operation of the two facilities in question posed an immediate danger to the safety of the park's customers. The town's counsel also represented that the town's actions enjoyed the support of the highest public safety officials of the state. The bankruptcy court refused to grant Spookyworld's requested injunction, citing the police power exception to the automatic stay. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(b)(4) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter the Worcester Superior Court held a hearing on the continuation of the town's temporary restraining order. Counsel for the town made representations at this hearing similar to the ones he had made before the bankruptcy court. After the hearing, the court converted the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction. The haunted house and the haunted mine shaft remained closed for the rest of October 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9, 1999, Spookyworld filed an amended adversary complaint in bankruptcy court. The amended complaint alleged that the Town of Berlin and various of its officials had willfully violated the automatic stay. The amended complaint also contained a section 1983 claim, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), a section 1985 claim, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1985, and several state law claims including libel, slander, interference with contractual relationships, and violations of Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 12, &#167; 11H-I (West 2002). In due course, defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 2, 2001, the bankruptcy court ruled that Spookyworld's automatic stay claim was a <i>core</i> bankruptcy claim and that all of Spookyworld's other claims were <i>non-core</i> claims. <i>In re Spookyworld,</i> 266 B.R. 1, 6-11 (Bankr.D.Mass.2001). The bankruptcy court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the automatic stay claim, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(b)(1) (2000); and, as to the rest of Spookyworld's claims, framed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(c)(1) (2000); <i>Spookyworld,</i> 266 B.R. at 11-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spookyworld filed a timely appeal to the district court challenging the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment on the core automatic stay claim. Possibly the notice could be read also to embrace a challenge to the bankruptcy court's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with regard to the non-core claims. If the latter was intended, use of an appeal was a procedural misstep; the proposed findings and conclusions were not a judgment subject to \"appeal\" but recommendations to the district court. The correct, and required, course was to file \"specific objections\" to those recommendations that were disputed by Spookyworld. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(c)(1) (2000); Fed. R. Bank. P. 9033.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 19, 2001, no specific objections to the recommendations having been filed within the time provided, the district court adopted the bankruptcy court's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; accordingly, the district court, by order dated the same day, granted judgment to the defendants on the non-core claims. Whether Spookyworld was immediately aware of the December 19 actions is unclear, but at no point did it seek to reopen this judgment based on lack of notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal as to the core claims was more protracted. Over a year later and after briefing by both sides the district court on January 23, 2003, issued a memorandum and order affirming (on grounds described below) the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment to defendants on Spookyworld's core automatic stay claim. The district court then dismissed Spookyworld's appeal on January 24, 2003. Spookyworld's district court brief also attacked the recommendations on the non-core claims but the district court noted that those had already been disposed of by the December 19, 2001, judgment. Spookyworld filed a notice of appeal to this court on February 21, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, Spookyworld contests both the district court order of December 19, 2001, entering judgment for the defendants on the non-core claims (the \"non-core order\") and the memorandum and order of January 23, 2003, affirming the bankruptcy court's disposition of the core automatic stay claim (the \"core order\"). At the threshold, defendants say that Spookyworld's notice of appeal does not encompass the non-core order, and that therefore we lack power to consider it on the merits. Fed. R.App. P. 3(c); <i>Smith v.

Robroy Indus.,</i> 200 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1999); <i>Varrasso,</i> 37 F.3d at 763. We must affirm if \"no genuine issue of material fact exists, and [defendants have] successfully demonstrated an entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7056; <i>Varrasso,</i> 37 F.3d at 763.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spookyworld argues that defendants' actions, including the continued prosecution of the state court case after Spookyworld filed its chapter 11 proceeding, constitute a willful violation of the automatic stay, entitling it to damages under section 362(h). The bankruptcy court ruled that these actions rested on the town's police or regulatory power and so were exempt from the automatic stay under section 362(b)(4). <i>Spookyworld,</i> 266 B.R. at 17-20. The district court affirmed but on a different ground: it held that corporations cannot take advantage of section 362(h)'s right of action because the provision only authorizes suits brought by \"individual[s].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view both courts were right. We conclude that Spookyworld, because it is a corporation, cannot bring suit under section 362(h), and that even if it could, defendants' actions are within the police power exception to the automatic stay. We also reject Spookyworld's alternative argument that the bankruptcy court should have sanctioned defendants according to its contempt powers under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 105(a) (2000). These three issues are considered in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, imposing the automatic stay, applies generally to proceedings against \"the debtor.\" By contrast, section 362(h) says: \"An individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, and, in appropriate circumstances, may recover punitive damages.\" Defendants argue that the term \"individual\" means that corporations are not authorized to collect damages under section 362.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is currently a circuit split. Two circuits hold that the term \"individual\" includes corporations, and four circuits hold that it does not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Every district court in this circuit to consider the issue has endorsed the majority view, as has the circuit's Bankruptcy Appellate Panel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Analysis starts, as usual, with the statutory language, <i>United States v. Ron Pair Enters.,</i> 489 U.S. 235, 241-42, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989), although bare words would not license a result \"demonstrably at odds\" with legislative intent. <i>Id.</i> at 242, 109 S.Ct. 1026 (quoting <i>Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc.,</i> 458 U.S. 564, 571, 102 S.Ct. 3245, 73 L.Ed.2d 973 (1982)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Code does not define \"individual,\" but several provisions indicate that the term was not meant to include corporations. For example, the code defines \"person\" to include \"<i>individual[s],</i> partnership[s], and <i>corporation[s].</i>\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(41) (2000) (emphasis added). In addition, \"corporation\" is defined to include an \"association having a power or privilege that a private corporation, but <i>not an individual</i> or a partnership possesses.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 101(9)(A)(i) (emphasis added). <i>See also In re Jove Eng'g, Inc. v. Internal Revenue Service,</i> 92 F.3d 1539, 1551 &amp; n. 11 (11th Cir.1996) (citing additional examples); <i>In re Chateaugay Corp.,</i> 920 F.2d 183, 185-86 (2d Cir.1990) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may at first be surprising that Congress would want to withhold the benefits of 362(h) from corporations, but this decision is not \"demonstrably at odds\" with legislative intent. Section 362(h) was enacted as part of the \"`Consumer Credit Amendments,' which contain[ed] numerous additions to the code relating only to `individuals.'\" <i>Chateaugay,</i> 920 F.2d at 186 (citing Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-353, Title III &#8212; Amendments to Title 11 of the United States Code, Subtitle A &#8212; Consumer Credit Amendments, &#167; 304, 98 Stat. 333, 352 (1984)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Corporations are not wholly without remedy for violations of the automatic stay: under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 105(a) (2000), \"[t]he court may issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.\" Prior to the enactment of section 362(h) in 1984, contempt orders issued under section 105(a), including awards of damages, were routinely used to punish violations of the automatic stay. <i>See In re Crysen/Montenay Energy Co.,</i> 902 F.2d 1098, 1104 (2d Cir.1990); <i>In re A &amp; J Auto Sales, Inc.,</i> 223 B.R. 839, 844-45 (D.N.H. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After enactment of section 362(h), corporations (and other non-\"individual[s]\") remain free to petition bankruptcy courts to award damages for automatic stay violations pursuant to their section 105(a) power. <i>See, e.g., Chateaugay,</i> 920 F.2d at 186-87. A discretionary remedy is not as good as one that is assured, <i>see Goodman v. Knight,</i> 991 F.2d 613, 620-21 (9th Cir.1993), but Congress could easily have thought that corporations needed less protection. As the Second Circuit explains:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Congress in 1978 passed the automatic stay provisions of &#167; 362 along with the rest of the code, including &#167; 105(a) ..., it is entirely possible that Congress then chose to expand the remedies for violations one step at a time. Congress may well have thought that individual debtors were particularly vulnerable to violations of the stay by debt-collection agencies and others who may be tempted to believe that individuals are less likely than corporations to be aware of their rights under the automatic stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Chateaugay,</i> 920 F.2d at 186.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we agree with the Second, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, and with the district courts and the BAP in this circuit, and hold that corporations cannot sue under section 362(h) to obtain damages for violation of the automatic stay. Statutory language so suggests and neither legislative history nor policy concerns point the other way. It is well to have this issue settled in this circuit at least until the Supreme Court addresses the matter &#8212; which might take some time if other circuits follow the plurality view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spookyworld argues that, so construed, section 362(h) denies equal protection under the Fifth Amendment to closely held corporations, like itself, that have only a few shareholders. But when drawing distinctions that do not involve fundamental rights or suspect classes, Congress need only have a rational basis for its decisions, <i>United States R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Fritz,</i> 449 U.S. 166, 175-76, 101 S.Ct. 453, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980). There is nothing irrational in drawing economic-regulation lines between individuals and corporations, closely held or otherwise; indeed, the Internal Revenue Code is rife with such distinctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if corporations could sue, we would still affirm the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment on the merits. Ordinarily, bankruptcy automatically stays lawsuits in other courts against the debtor, <i>see, e.g., ICC v. Holmes Transp., Inc.,</i> 931 F.2d 984, 987-88 (1st Cir.1991), but this is subject to the so-called police power exception. Section 362(b)(4) says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The filing of a [chapter 11] petition ... does not operate as a stay ... of the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit ... to enforce such governmental unit's ... police or regulatory power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(b)(4) (2000). The town is a \"governmental unit\" within the meaning of 362(b)(4). <i>Cournoyer v. Town of Lincoln,</i> 790 F.2d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spookyworld says that this section does not apply because the defendants' actions were undertaken in bad faith. According to Spookyworld, the defendants in securing the temporary restraining order from the Worcester Superior Court deliberately exaggerated the dangers of operating the haunted house and the haunted mine shaft without sprinklers, the severity of any alleged building code violations, and the degree to which state public safety officials supported their decision to take legal action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spookyworld also says that when it sought protection under chapter 11, the town similarly misled the bankruptcy court in convincing it not to enjoin the state court action. It claims that the defendants again misrepresented the situation when they convinced the Worcester Superior Court, post-petition, to convert its temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction. It says that the record demonstrates these false statements or, at the very least, that their falsity involves factual issues barring the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For clarity's sake, Spookyworld's argument should be distinguished from a related, but here inapplicable, limitation on the use of the police power exception to the automatic stay. Under the case law, the exception does not apply if the government takes legal action to advance its own \"pecuniary\" interest (or perhaps the pecuniary interest of others); but it does apply if the government acts in the interest of \"public safety and welfare.\" <i>E.g., In re Universal Life Church,</i> 128 F.3d 1294, 1297-98 (9th Cir.1997); <i>see also Chao v. Hosp. Staffing Servs., Inc.,</i> 270 F.3d 374, 385-89 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts Building Code is plainly aimed at protecting the public, and Spookyworld does not say otherwise. In adopting the police power exception to the automatic stay, Congress explained that \"where a governmental unit is suing a debtor to prevent or stop violation of fraud, environmental protection, consumer protection, safety, or similar police or regulatory laws ... the action or proceeding is not stayed under the automatic stay.\" S.Rep. No. 95-989, at 52 (1978). <i>Accord, Cournoyer,</i> 790 F.2d at 975-77 (enforcement of zoning regulation within police power exception).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, there is some authority for the proposition that government actions undertaken in bad faith are not exempt from the automatic stay. <i>See In re Nat'l Hosp. and Institutional Builders Co.,</i> 658 F.2d 39, 43-44 (2d Cir.1981) (under the old Bankruptcy Act which had no built-in police power exception); <i>In re Beker Indus. Corp.,</i> 57 B.R. 611, 627 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y. 1986). However, <i>National Hospital</i> was arguably undermined, if not overruled, by <i>Board of Governors v. MCorp Financial, Inc.,</i> 502 U.S. 32, 40, 112 S.Ct. 459, 116 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991), which held that bankruptcy courts should not inquire into the \"legitimacy\" of ongoing administrative enforcement proceedings in determining whether the police power exception applies to them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are doubtful whether a bad faith exception should be read into section 362(b)(4) where the state directive being enforced is directed at ordinary public purposes. There is much force to the dissent of Judge Mansfield in <i>National Hospital:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A bad faith] exception would result in Bankruptcy Court mini-trials of purely state regulatory issues whenever, as might be expected to happen frequently, the debtor sought by claiming `bad faith' to have those issues tried in a Bankruptcy Court, which would be sympathetic toward any resolution that would improve the estate, rather than before state tribunals. The proper remedy is to seek redress in the state courts which may be expected not to tolerate bad faith conduct....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>National Hospital,</i> 658 F.2d at 46. By contrast, the pecuniary purpose exception need present no such dangers. <i>Cf. Safety-Kleen, Inc. v. Wyche,</i> 274 F.3d 846, 865 (4th Cir.2001) (pecuniary purpose test looks only to the objective purpose of the underlying law sought to be enforced).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one can imagine some fairly appealing cases for a bad faith exception; suppose that incontrovertible proof was available that the town's lawyer had brought a wholly baseless injunction action against Spookyworld motivated by personal malice. Yet such an injunction could easily be overturned by offering the same evidence to the state court; and state remedies exist for malicious prosecution. Thus, the case for a bad faith exception seems thin; but, even if such an exception existed &#8212; which we need not definitively decide &#8212; it would not extend to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On summary judgment we are bound to assume that Spookyworld could prove that defendants exaggerated the seriousness of the building code violations, but this is a far cry from showing that the defendants brought the state action for ulterior motives or that they did not believe in the basic genuineness of their case. Lawyers constantly overstate their claims. In a robust adversary system, courts offer lawyers a measure of latitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If misstatements and exaggeration in the state court were enough to defeat the automatic stay, the bankruptcy courts would be relitigating state enforcement actions every day. The game is not worth the candle. It is well to remember that section 362(b)(4) embodies a fundamental judgment of Congress: that protecting the public welfare and safety trumps the concerns that underlie the automatic stay, a provision whose main purpose is to prevent some private creditors from gaining priority on other creditors. <i>See, e.g., Mann v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp.,</i> 316 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are penalties enough, formal as well as informal, for lawyers and other officials who make false factual statements to courts. Indeed, Spookyworld itself argues in the alternative that the bankruptcy court should have awarded it damages under section 105(a). As noted earlier, bankruptcy courts do possess the discretionary authority to award damages for automatic stay violations as part of their power to \"issue any order ... that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 105(a) (2000); <i>Chateaugay,</i> 920 F.2d at 186-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This alternative claim for damages is waived because Spookyworld did not make it before the district court. <i>See Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc.,</i> 14 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir.1994). In any event, the decision whether to award such damages is discretionary. <i>Goodman,</i> 991 F.2d at 620. On this record, there is nothing that would make it an abuse of discretion to refuse to award damages under the contempt power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Defendants say in their brief that there were multiple problems with all three buildings and that Brandt withdrew the certificates for all of them.

(\"Spookyworld\"), into compliance with the Massachusetts Building Code. 780 C.M.R (passim) (6th ed.1997). Spookyworld was created in 1991 by sole shareholders David and Linda Bertolino. The corporation built a horror theme park in Berlin, Massachusetts, on land leased from a trust controlled by the Bertolinos. The park celebrated Halloween, opening every year only for the month of October.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From modest beginnings, Spookyworld's business grew quickly: in 1997, it grossed $1,880,000, and by 1998, it was employing approximately 500 people during its annual month of operation. In 1998 the park contained three buildings housing a total of five attractions: a barn, which included a haunted house and a \"celebrity area\" on the main floor and a haunted \"mine shaft\" in the basement; a \"museum display\"; and a metal building containing a 3-D wax museum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 30, 1998, the building inspector for the Town of Berlin, Lawrence Brandt, issued three certificates of inspection to Spookyworld, one for each building. Shortly thereafter, on October 7, Brandt sent a letter to David Bertolino rescinding the certificate covering the haunted house and the haunted mine shaft. According to Brandt, recent amendments to the Massachusetts Building Code required that these two attractions have sprinkler systems installed. 780 C.M.R. &#167; 413.4 (6th ed.1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of Brandt's actions, Spookyworld faced the prospect of having to close two of its principal draws for the duration of the critical month of October. Spookyworld therefore immediately appealed Brandt's decision to the building code appeals board under Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 143, &#167; 100 (West 2002). Under that provision, Spookyworld's appeal had the effect of staying all enforcement proceedings against it, unless state or local officials could present evidence that the stay would \"involve imminent peril of life or property.\" <i>Id.; see also</i> 780 C.M.R. &#167; 122.3.3 (6th ed.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spookyworld then began negotiations with town officials, attempting to work out an interim solution whereby the haunted house and the haunted mine shaft could continue to operate through October without shutting down for sprinkler installation. Duncan Baum, the town's assistant fire chief, and Gene Novak, a regional building inspector, participated in the negotiations. Among the options discussed was a \"fire watch,\" which would have involved Spookyworld's paying the town to station fire personnel at the park during its hours of operation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The negotiations ultimately broke down, and on October 16, 1998, the town filed a complaint against Spookyworld in Worcester Superior Court. The complaint sought a temporary restraining order, shutting down the haunted house and the haunted mine shaft until such time as sprinkler systems could be installed in each; the complaint also sought a fine for each day of non-compliance. The court issued the temporary restraining order later that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One hour after the order issued, Spookyworld filed a chapter 11 petition under the Bankruptcy Code and sought to continue operating both attractions by virtue of the automatic stay provided by the statute. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a) (2000). The very next day, however, Spookyworld was forced to shut down the attractions when town officials came to the park and threatened to arrest Spookyworld employees for non-compliance with the court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Spookyworld filed an adversary complaint in bankruptcy court, seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the state court proceedings and prevent any action on the part of the town to close park facilities. At an emergency hearing held before the bankruptcy court on October 20, 1998, counsel for the town claimed that continued operation of the two facilities in question posed an immediate danger to the safety of the park's customers. The town's counsel also represented that the town's actions enjoyed the support of the highest public safety officials of the state. The bankruptcy court refused to grant Spookyworld's requested injunction, citing the police power exception to the automatic stay. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(b)(4) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter the Worcester Superior Court held a hearing on the continuation of the town's temporary restraining order. Counsel for the town made representations at this hearing similar to the ones he had made before the bankruptcy court. After the hearing, the court converted the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction. The haunted house and the haunted mine shaft remained closed for the rest of October 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9, 1999, Spookyworld filed an amended adversary complaint in bankruptcy court. The amended complaint alleged that the Town of Berlin and various of its officials had willfully violated the automatic stay. The amended complaint also contained a section 1983 claim, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), a section 1985 claim, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1985, and several state law claims including libel, slander, interference with contractual relationships, and violations of Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 12, &#167; 11H-I (West 2002). In due course, defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 2, 2001, the bankruptcy court ruled that Spookyworld's automatic stay claim was a <i>core</i> bankruptcy claim and that all of Spookyworld's other claims were <i>non-core</i> claims. <i>In re Spookyworld,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1930386\"><a href=\"/opinion/1930386/in-re-spookyworld-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6-11 (Bankr.D.Mass.2001). The bankruptcy court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the automatic stay claim, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(b)(1) (2000); and, as to the rest of Spookyworld's claims, framed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(c)(1) (2000); <i>Spookyworld,</i> 266 B.R. at 11-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spookyworld filed a timely appeal to the district court challenging the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment on the core automatic stay claim. Possibly the notice could be read also to embrace a challenge to the bankruptcy court's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with regard to the non-core claims. If the latter was intended, use of an appeal was a procedural misstep; the proposed findings and conclusions were not a judgment subject to \"appeal\" but recommendations to the district court. The correct, and required, course was to file \"specific objections\" to those recommendations that were disputed by Spookyworld. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 157(c)(1) (2000); Fed. R. Bank. P. 9033.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 19, 2001, no specific objections to the recommendations having been filed within the time provided, the district court adopted the bankruptcy court's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; accordingly, the district court, by order dated the same day, granted judgment to the defendants on the non-core claims. Whether Spookyworld was immediately aware of the December 19 actions is unclear, but at no point did it seek to reopen this judgment based on lack of notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal as to the core claims was more protracted. Over a year later and after briefing by both sides the district court on January 23, 2003, issued a memorandum and order affirming (on grounds described below) the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment to defendants on Spookyworld's core automatic stay claim. The district court then dismissed Spookyworld's appeal on January 24, 2003. Spookyworld's district court brief also attacked the recommendations on the non-core claims but the district court noted that those had already been disposed of by the December 19, 2001, judgment. Spookyworld filed a notice of appeal to this court on February 21, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, Spookyworld contests both the district court order of December 19, 2001, entering judgment for the defendants on the non-core claims (the \"non-core order\") and the memorandum and order of January 23, 2003, affirming the bankruptcy court's disposition of the core automatic stay claim (the \"core order\"). At the threshold, defendants say that Spookyworld's notice of appeal does not encompass the non-core order, and that therefore we lack power to consider it on the merits. Fed.

The bankruptcy court ruled that these actions rested on the town's police or regulatory power and so were exempt from the automatic stay under section 362(b)(4). <i>Spookyworld,</i> 266 B.R. at 17-20. The district court affirmed but on a different ground: it held that corporations cannot take advantage of section 362(h)'s right of action because the provision only authorizes suits brought by \"individual[s].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view both courts were right. We conclude that Spookyworld, because it is a corporation, cannot bring suit under section 362(h), and that even if it could, defendants' actions are within the police power exception to the automatic stay. We also reject Spookyworld's alternative argument that the bankruptcy court should have sanctioned defendants according to its contempt powers under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 105(a) (2000).

Congress may well have thought that individual debtors were particularly vulnerable to violations of the stay by debt-collection agencies and others who may be tempted to believe that individuals are less likely than corporations to be aware of their rights under the automatic stay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Chateaugay,</i> 920 F.2d at 186.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we agree with the Second, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, and with the district courts and the BAP in this circuit, and hold that corporations cannot sue under section 362(h) to obtain damages for violation of the automatic stay. Statutory language so suggests and neither legislative history nor policy concerns point the other way.

But when drawing distinctions that do not involve fundamental rights or suspect classes, Congress need only have a rational basis for its decisions, <i>United States R.R. Ret. Bd. v.

Ordinarily, bankruptcy automatically stays lawsuits in other courts against the debtor, <i>see, e.g., ICC v.

According to Spookyworld, the defendants in securing the temporary restraining order from the Worcester Superior Court deliberately exaggerated the dangers of operating the haunted house and the haunted mine shaft without sprinklers, the severity of any alleged building code violations, and the degree to which state public safety officials supported their decision to take legal action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Spookyworld also says that when it sought protection under chapter 11, the town similarly misled the bankruptcy court in convincing it not to enjoin the state court action. It claims that the defendants again misrepresented the situation when they convinced the Worcester Superior Court, post-petition, to convert its temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction. It says that the record demonstrates these false statements or, at the very least, that their falsity involves factual issues barring the district court's grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For clarity's sake, Spookyworld's argument should be distinguished from a related, but here inapplicable, limitation on the use of the police power exception to the automatic stay. Under the case law, the exception does not apply if the government takes legal action to advance its own \"pecuniary\" interest (or perhaps the pecuniary interest of others); but it does apply if the government acts in the interest of \"public safety and welfare.\" <i>E.g., In re Universal Life Church,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747811\"><a href=\"/opinion/747811/in-re-universal-life-church-inc-a-california-non-profit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span>, 1297-98 (9th Cir.1997); <i>see also Chao v.

In adopting the police power exception to the automatic stay, Congress explained that \"where a governmental unit is suing a debtor to prevent or stop violation of fraud, environmental protection, consumer protection, safety, or similar police or regulatory laws ... the action or proceeding is not stayed under the automatic stay.\" S.Rep.

There is much force to the dissent of Judge Mansfield in <i>National Hospital:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A bad faith] exception would result in Bankruptcy Court mini-trials of purely state regulatory issues whenever, as might be expected to happen frequently, the debtor sought by claiming `bad faith' to have those issues tried in a Bankruptcy Court, which would be sympathetic toward any resolution that would improve the estate, rather than before state tribunals. The proper remedy is to seek redress in the state courts which may be expected not to tolerate bad faith conduct....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>National Hospital,</i> 658 F.2d at 46.

Yet such an injunction could easily be overturned by offering the same evidence to the state court; and state remedies exist for malicious prosecution. Thus, the case for a bad faith exception seems thin; but, even if such an exception existed &#8212; which we need not definitively decide &#8212; it would not extend to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On summary judgment we are bound to assume that Spookyworld could prove that defendants exaggerated the seriousness of the building code violations, but this is a far cry from showing that the defendants brought the state action for ulterior motives or that they did not believe in the basic genuineness of their case. Lawyers constantly overstate their claims. In a robust adversary system, courts offer lawyers a measure of latitude.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If misstatements and exaggeration in the state court were enough to defeat the automatic stay, the bankruptcy courts would be relitigating state enforcement actions every day. The game is not worth the candle. It is well to remember that section 362(b)(4) embodies a fundamental judgment of Congress: that protecting the public welfare and safety trumps the concerns that underlie the automatic stay, a provision whose main purpose is to prevent some private creditors from gaining priority on other creditors. <i>See, e.g., Mann v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200294\"><a href=\"/opinion/200294/mann-v-chase-manhattan/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are penalties enough, formal as well as informal, for lawyers and other officials who make false factual statements to courts. Indeed, Spookyworld itself argues in the alternative that the bankruptcy court should have awarded it damages under section 105(a). As noted earlier, bankruptcy courts do possess the discretionary authority to award damages for automatic stay violations as part of their power to \"issue any order ... that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 105(a) (2000); <i>Chateaugay,</i> 920 F.2d at 186-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This alternative claim for damages is waived because Spookyworld did not make it before the district court. <i>See Daigle v.
