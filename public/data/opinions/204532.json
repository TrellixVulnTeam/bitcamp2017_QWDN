These are the latest in a series\n\nof civil cases arising out of the unholy alliance between the\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and a notorious mobster,\n\nJames J. \"Whitey\" Bulger.       In this chapter of the sordid saga, the\n\nestates and heirs of two men killed on Bulger's orders sued the\n\nUnited States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for leaking\n\nconfidential information to Bulger and enabling his reign of\n\nterror.   The proceedings below culminated in multi-million-dollar\n\njudgments for the plaintiffs.        The principal issue on appeal is\n\nwhether the suits were timely filed.\n\n           Two different district judges answered this question in\n\nthe affirmative.     Since then, this court has passed upon the\n\ntimeliness issue in a number of similar cases and refined the legal\n\ndoctrines that inform the decisional calculus. In fidelity to this\n\nintervening authority, we conclude that the suits were not timely\n\nfiled   and,   therefore,    reverse.      We   do   so,   however,   without\n\nendorsing the FBI's conduct, which we regard as reprehensible.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The tawdry tale of the FBI's corrupt collaboration with\n\nBulger and his sidekick, Stephen \"the Rifleman\" Flemmi, has been\n\nrecounted many times.       See, e.g., Rakes v. United States, 442 F.3d\n\n7, 11-17 (1st Cir. 2006); Callahan v. United States, 426 F.3d 444,\n\n446-50 (1st Cir. 2005); McIntyre v. United States, 367 F.3d 38, 40-\n\n51 (1st Cir. 2004); see generally United States v. Salemme, 91 F.\n\n\n                                   - 3 -\n\fSupp. 2d 141 (D. Mass. 1999), rev'd, United States v. Flemmi, 225\n\nF.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2000).        We assume the reader's familiarity with\n\nthis   compendium    of   cases    and   rehearse   here   only   those   facts\n\nnecessary to bring these appeals into focus.\n\n                           A.     The Axis of Evil.\n\n           For decades Whitey Bulger, a key figure in organized\n\ncrime circles in Boston, and the leader of a criminal syndicate\n\nknown as the Winter Hill Gang, led a double life.             Unbeknownst to\n\nhis counterparts in crime, he served as a confidential informant\n\nfor the FBI.        Bulger's underworld position made him privy to\n\nvarious and sundry activities of rival gangs, including the Mafia\n\n(sometimes known as La Cosa Nostra).           The FBI's ardent desire to\n\nbring the Mafia to heel led it to make a Faustian bargain: in\n\nexchange for information about Mafia activities, the FBI would\n\nprotect Bulger and Flemmi and \"look the other way\" as the duo\n\npursued their own felonious misadventures.            This alliance spanned\n\nthree decades, lasting from the late 1970s well into the 1990s.\n\n           John Connolly, a member of the FBI's organized crime\n\nunit, was tasked to \"handle\" Bulger and Flemmi.                   Connolly and\n\nBulger had grown up in the same South Boston neighborhood.                 John\n\nMorris, who for most of the relevant period headed the organized\n\ncrime unit in the FBI's Boston office, oversaw Connolly.\n\n           Over time, Bulger and Flemmi plied their FBI handlers\n\nwith assorted gratuities.          See, e.g., United States v. Connolly,\n\n\n                                      - 4 -\n\f504 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir. 2007); Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 210.\n\nMore   importantly,      they    provided       a   cornucopia      of   high-quality\n\ninformation that led to the convictions of several Mafia hierarchs.\n\nThese convictions were a gift that kept on giving: they enhanced\n\nthe informants' value to the FBI, decimated a powerful rival of the\n\nWinter Hill Gang, and created a vacuum that Bulger and Flemmi\n\nsystematically exploited.\n\n            Not surprisingly, the FBI coveted Bulger and Flemmi and\n\nconsidered them \"Top Echelon\" informants.                   See Flemmi, 225 F.3d at\n\n81 (describing the FBI's \"Top Echelon\" informant program). Because\n\nthis   characterization         elevated      the    status    of   their      handlers,\n\nConnolly and Morris did everything in their power, whether legal or\n\nillegal, to protect their prized informants and keep them happy.\n\nIn the bargain, the agents blithely ignored FBI guidelines and\n\npermitted    Bulger     and   Flemmi     to    carry    out    a    constellation     of\n\ncriminal activities, ranging from loan-sharking to extortion to\n\nmurder.\n\n                                 B.    The Murders.\n\n            The      FBI's    protective       efforts       extended     as    far    as\n\ndiscouraging other law enforcement agencies from investigating\n\ncrimes committed by Bulger and Flemmi; notifying the pair of\n\nplanned   law     enforcement     activities;         and     leaking    to    them   the\n\nidentities      of    persons    who     came       forward     with     incriminating\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 5 -\n\finformation related to their malefactions.          We focus here on one\n\nsuch informant: Edward \"Brian\" Halloran.\n\n             Halloran   was   a   low-level    hoodlum,    who    functioned\n\nprimarily as a cocaine dealer.      At times, he worked with the Winter\n\nHill Gang.     A life of crime typically has twists and turns and, in\n\nJanuary of 1982, Halloran was facing a state murder charge.\n\n             This development brings front and center a different\n\nmurder â€” the murder of Roger Wheeler.          Wheeler's killing stemmed\n\nfrom a disagreement over a string of Connecticut-based Jai Alai\n\nparlors owned by him and managed by John Callahan (who had ties to\n\nthe Winter Hill Gang).        Wheeler suspected Callahan of skimming\n\nmoney, cashiered him, and commissioned an audit.                 Wheeler was\n\ngunned down shortly thereafter.\n\n             Seeking immunity from prosecution, Halloran offered to\n\nshare   with   the   FBI   information   about   Wheeler's    murder.     He\n\nindicated that Bulger, Flemmi, and Callahan had conspired to kill\n\nWheeler and had offered Halloran the contract.            When he declined,\n\nBulger had Wheeler killed by someone else.\n\n             In evaluating Halloran's proposal, his FBI handlers had\n\nasked Morris about Halloran's reliability.           Because it was the\n\nFBI's policy to \"close\" informants who were themselves under\n\ninvestigation, Morris and Connolly (with whom he consulted) feared\n\nthat Halloran's allegations would lead the FBI to terminate its\n\npartnership with Bulger and Flemmi.           Rather than run that risk,\n\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\fMorris responded (without any foundation in fact) that Halloran was\n\nuntrustworthy.    On the basis of this mendacity, the FBI rejected\n\nHalloran's offer to turn traitor and denied his request to be put\n\ninto its witness protection program.1\n\n           Even though Halloran's charges had been defused, word of\n\nhis perfidy made its way from Morris to Connolly to Bulger.          Morris\n\nand Connolly, who were both experienced agents steeped in the mores\n\nof   organized   crime,   must    have   realized     that   disclosure   of\n\nHalloran's   identity     and    allegations    not   only   violated     FBI\n\nguidelines but also jeopardized Halloran's safety.           That jeopardy\n\nmaterialized: shortly after Connolly leaked Halloran's identity to\n\nBulger, Bulger and Flemmi hatched the plot to eliminate Halloran.\n\n           On May 11, 1982, Halloran asked his neighbor, Michael\n\nDonahue, for a ride home.       Donahue, in what later would prove to be\n\na costly gesture of good will, agreed.         As they drove, Bulger's car\n\npulled alongside and a fusillade of shots followed.           Donahue died\n\nimmediately; Halloran tried to flee, sustained a myriad of gunshot\n\nwounds, survived for a short period of time, identified James\n\n\"Jimmy\" Flynn (a Winter Hill associate) as his assailant during the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       As matters turned out, Halloran's charges later proved to\nhave a basis in fact. A Winter Hill associate, John Martorano,\nsubsequently pleaded guilty to Wheeler's murder. See McIntyre, 367\nF.3d at 50. Several months after Wheeler's execution, Martorano,\nacting on Bulger's orders, also murdered Callahan. See Callahan,\n426 F.3d at 449.\n\n\n                                    - 7 -\n\fambulance ride, and was pronounced dead upon arrival at a local\n\nhospital.\n\n            The murders of Halloran and Donahue, along with Bulger's\n\npossible role in the Wheeler and Callahan slayings, presented the\n\nFBI with a dilemma.     FBI offices outside of Boston, as well as\n\nstate law enforcement agencies, were investigating Bulger's and\n\nFlemmi's potential involvement in the murders of Wheeler, Halloran,\n\nDonahue, and Callahan (which had long been thought to be related).\n\nIf given credence, Halloran's allegations would have shed light on\n\nBulger's participation and, quite possibly, would have led the FBI\n\nto \"close\" him as an informant.\n\n            FBI agents from the Boston office's organized crime unit,\n\nincluding Connolly and Morris, met to discuss the situation.    They\n\ndecided to retain Bulger and Flemmi as informants unless and until\n\nthey received \"substantial information\" implicating the men in the\n\nmurders.2   Then, in a cynical twist, the agents took an active role\n\nin preventing any such \"substantial information\" from surfacing.\n\nTheir actions included hindering attempts by other FBI offices to\n\nsolve the Wheeler and Callahan murders; furnishing information\n\nabout pending investigations to Bulger and Flemmi; failing to index\n\ndocuments    summarizing   Halloran's   charges;   and   prohibiting\n\n\n     2\n       Although Flemmi was briefly \"closed\" as an informant, he\ncontinued to furnish information to Connolly and Connolly continued\nto leak confidential information to him, including the name of John\nMcIntyre, another confidential informant whom Bulger and his\nhenchmen subsequently murdered. See McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 46-47.\n\n                                - 8 -\n\finterviews of Bulger and Flemmi.         They also made certain that no\n\ninformation about Bulger's role in Halloran's murder was revealed\n\nto the Massachusetts authorities.\n\n             In 1985, the Suffolk County (Mass.) District Attorney\n\nprosecuted Flynn for the Halloran and Donahue murders.               Flynn\n\nproclaimed his innocence and went to trial â€” a trial that members\n\nof the Donahue family attended.         The jury acquitted Flynn and the\n\nmurders remained unsolved for the next decade.\n\n                          C.    The Revelations.\n\n             Bulger's cozy arrangement with the FBI began to unravel\n\nin   1992.      The   United   States   Attorney   for   the   District    of\n\nMassachusetts empaneled a grand jury that eventually handed up\n\nindictments against numerous gangland crime figures, including\n\nBulger, Flemmi, and Francis P. \"Cadillac Frank\" Salemme (the\n\nreputed \"boss\" of the Patriarca crime family).           Although Connolly\n\nwas no longer working for the FBI at that point, he found out about\n\nthe indictments before they were unsealed and forewarned Bulger and\n\nFlemmi.      Bulger fled and remains a fugitive; Flemmi was not as\n\nquick on his feet; the authorities arrested him in January of 1995.\n\n             In the judicial proceedings that ensued, Flemmi made a\n\nclaim of immunity from prosecution based on his role as an FBI\n\ninformant.     Along this line, he contended that the FBI authorized\n\nhim to engage in various crimes charged in the indictment.                The\n\ndistrict court decided to take evidence on Flemmi's motion.          These\n\n\n                                   - 9 -\n\fproceedings (which we shall call \"the Salemme hearings\") started in\n\nJanuary of 1998, lasted almost a year, and produced over 17,000\n\npages of transcripts.\n\n            As part of the Salemme hearings, Morris testified under\n\na grant of immunity on April 22, 1998.            His testimony brought the\n\nFBI's clandestine relationship with Bulger and Flemmi into the\n\npublic domain.    He confirmed that both men were regarded by the FBI\n\nas Top Echelon informants.           In connection with the Halloran and\n\nDonahue murders, he admitted that he falsely told other FBI agents\n\nthat   Halloran   was      an   unreliable    witness,    thus    ensuring   that\n\nHalloran's allegations would be discounted and that Halloran would\n\nbe denied entry into the witness protection program.                He also told\n\nConnolly    about       Halloran's      offer    to      incriminate      Bulger,\n\nnotwithstanding      his    knowledge    that   this     leak    would   endanger\n\nHalloran.\n\n            Morris    further      testified    that     Connolly   had    leaked\n\nHalloran's identity to Bulger and that he (Morris) suspected that\n\nBulger and Flemmi were responsible for Halloran's demise.                 In what\n\ncan best be described as locking the barn door once the horse has\n\ngalloped away, Morris stated that, after the double murder of\n\nHalloran and Donahue, he told Connolly that he \"did not want\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\fanother Halloran\" the next time that the FBI tipped off Bulger and\n\nFlemmi about an informant's identity.3\n\n            Three additional pieces of information that came to light\n\nduring the Salemme hearings are of particular pertinence for\n\npresent    purposes.      First,     on   May   27,    1998,   former   federal\n\nprosecutor William Weld recounted a conversation that he had with\n\nRobert Fitzpatrick a few days prior to Halloran's assassination.\n\nAt the time of this exchange, Fitzpatrick (second in command of the\n\nFBI's Boston office) told Weld that Halloran was in grave danger.\n\nFitzpatrick recounted that he \"would not want to be standing next\n\nto this guy [Halloran].\"\n\n            Second, in August of 1998, testimony in the Salemme\n\nhearings revealed that, in 1988, an incarcerated drug dealer named\n\nJoseph Murray told FBI agents that Bulger was responsible for\n\nHalloran's murder and that someone in the FBI's Boston office was\n\nleaking confidential information to Bulger.              Murray's account was\n\nneither shared with the agents who were investigating Halloran's\n\nmurder    nor   indexed   in   the   FBI's    data    bank   (thus   making   its\n\nretrieval difficult, if not impossible).              Third â€” and perhaps most\n\ntelling â€” Flemmi himself made statements to the district court\n\n\n     3\n       Although Connolly publicly decried Morris's allegations, he\nnever testified at the hearings, choosing instead to invoke his\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.     Connolly was\nlater convicted on a gallimaufry of charges stemming from his\ncorrupt relationship with Bulger and Flemmi, including charges\narising out of Halloran's murder. See United States v. Connolly,\n341 F.3d 16, 20-21, 25 n.4 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                     - 11 -\n\findicating that he had been tipped off by the FBI about Halloran's\n\novertures, his identity, and his role as a potential accuser.\n\nThese statements were made in a chambers conference that occurred\n\nsometime before September 1, 1998 (the date on which the district\n\ncourt revealed them in the course of a ruling).\n\n            Word of the corrupt relationship between the FBI and the\n\ntwo notorious mobsters made news.        The appendix to this opinion\n\npresents a chronological sampling of the most relevant newspaper\n\narticles.\n\n            As early as 1997, journalists were speculating about\n\nHalloran's involvement with the Wheeler murder and Bulger's status\n\nas a snitch.    See, e.g., Shelley Murphy, In '80s FBI Saw Bulger as\n\nBoth Informant and Murder Suspect, Bos. Globe, Oct. 3, 1997, at A1.\n\nFor example, a front-page article in the Boston Herald suggested\n\nthat the FBI continued to use Bulger and Flemmi as informants even\n\nthough they were suspects in Halloran's execution.         See Ralph\n\nRanalli, FBI Used Whitey, Despite His Ties to 3 Murders, Bos.\n\nHerald, July 1, 1997, at 1.\n\n            Morris's sensational testimony led to an avalanche of\n\nnews stories.     His admissions that he had told Connolly about\n\nHalloran, that Connolly had leaked Halloran's identity to Bulger,\n\nand that he suspected Bulger of killing Halloran were widely\n\nreported in both the local and national press.       See, e.g., Peter\n\nGelzinis, 'Good' Guys Weren't Good to Halloran, Bos. Herald, Apr.\n\n\n                                - 12 -\n\f23, 1998, at 6; Shelley Murphy, Worst Fears Came True as Informant\n\nLost Race for His Life, Bos. Globe, Apr. 23, 1998, at B10.   The two\n\nmost widely circulated Boston-area newspapers â€” the Boston Globe\n\nand the Boston Herald â€” covered these disclosures in laborious\n\ndetail, often with gripping headlines and prominent placement.\n\nSee, e.g., Ralph Ranalli, Ex-FBI Honcho: Agent Tipped Mobsters on\n\nStoolie, Bos. Herald, Apr. 23, 1998, at 1; Patricia Nealon, Ex-\n\nAgent Says He Told of Informer[:] Fringe Gangster Turned Up Dead,\n\nBos. Globe, Apr. 23, 1998, at B1.   The intense publicity continued\n\nfor several months, frequently reiterating Morris's testimony.\n\nSome articles included Halloran's photograph.   See, e.g., Shelley\n\nMurphy, Cases Disappear as FBI Looks Away, Bos. Globe, July 22,\n\n1998, at A1; Ralph Ranalli, Whitey Taunted Fed About Slain Stoolie,\n\nBos. Herald, May 16, 1998, at 15.\n\n          Subsequent developments in the Salemme hearings were\n\nthoroughly reported by the Boston media.    Weld's suggestion that\n\nthe FBI knew about the leak of Halloran's identity before the\n\nmurder generated front-page coverage.    See, e.g., Ralph Ranalli,\n\nFBI's Mafia Bugs in Peril â€” Key Wiretap Requests May Have Contained\n\nFalse Info, Weld Testifies, Bos. Herald, May 28, 1998, at 1.\n\nSimilarly, Murray's un-investigated allegations were reported.\n\nSee, e.g., Patricia Nealon, Witness: FBI Let Languish a Tip Tying\n\nBulger to Murder, Bos. Globe, June 4, 1998, at F8; Ralph Ranalli,\n\nFBI Was Allegedly Told of Bulger Role in Murder, Bos. Herald, June\n\n\n                              - 13 -\n\f4, 1998, at 4.       Flemmi's acknowledgment that he had been tipped\n\nabout Halloran's perfidy was likewise grist for the journalistic\n\nmills.   See, e.g., Patricia Nealon, Mob Trial Judge Orders Flemmi\n\nto Answer Some Questions, Bos. Globe, Sept. 2, 1998, at B2; Ralph\n\nRanalli,   Flemmi    Admits    Tip-Off   to   Informant's   Identity,   Bos.\n\nHerald, Sept. 2, 1998, at 6.        Along the way, these press dispatches\n\nreiterated time and again the corrupt Bulger-FBI linkage and its\n\ntragic consequences for Halloran and Donahue.         See, e.g., Patricia\n\nNealon, Ground Rules for Flemmi Grilling Eyed, Bos. Globe, June 25,\n\n1998, at B4; Ralph Ranalli, Questions Arise Over FBI Agent's\n\nKnowledge of Slaying, Bos. Herald, Aug. 5, 1998, at 1.\n\n           Given the astonishing nature of Morris's allegations, it\n\nis unsurprising that media outlets other than the Boston newspapers\n\ncovered this matter.      For example, CNN's broadcast \"CNN Impact\"\n\nreported on March 15, 1998, \"that Bulger and Flemmi were FBI\n\ninformants and that possible connections existed between Bulger and\n\nFlemmi   and   the   murders   of    Wheeler,   Halloran,   and   Callahan.\"\n\nCallahan, 426 F.3d at 448.          An episode of the news program \"60\n\nMinutes,\" which CBS aired on May 10, 1998, described the FBI's\n\ncomplicity in the murders.          Additionally, the telecast displayed\n\nphotographs of the Halloran crime scene and stated that detectives\n\ninvestigating the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders \"believe\n\nall three murders remain unsolved because Bulger and Flemmi were\n\nprotected by the FBI.\"          And although the government has not\n\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\fsupplied    a     reliable    inventory       of    local   television     and     radio\n\nbroadcasts, it would strain credulity to think that local stations\n\nwould not have feasted upon such tasty fare.\n\n            The Salemme hearings concluded in October of 1998.                      The\n\npiÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was a comprehensive opinion, released by Judge\n\nWolf on September 15, 1999.            See Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d 141.              The\n\nopinion itself was covered in depth by the local press, which\n\nrehashed the underlying facts in detail.                    The plaintiffs concede\n\nthat they learned about this opinion at or near the time when it\n\nwas issued.\n\n                             D.    Travel of the Cases.\n\n            Halloran's estate filed an administrative claim against,\n\ninter alia, the FBI on September 25, 2000.                        Patricia Donahue,\n\nacting     both     individually        as    the     decedent's       wife   and    as\n\nadministratrix of his estate, along with her three sons, submitted\n\ntheir administrative claim on March 29, 2001.                          The government\n\nfailed to satisfy any of the claims and, after the passage of each\n\nrespective      six-month         period,    see    28   U.S.C.    Â§    2675(a),    the\n\nplaintiffs sued separately.\n\n            The United States was substituted as the party defendant\n\nin each action.       See id. Â§ 2679.         The government moved to dismiss\n\nthe Donahue case, asserting that the plaintiffs' claims were barred\n\nby the FTCA's two-year limitations period.                  The government averred\n\nthat the causes of action accrued in April of 1998, when Morris\n\n\n                                        - 15 -\n\ftestified at the Salemme hearings.      The district court, operating\n\nwithout the benefit of a series of opinions subsequently handed\n\ndown by this court, see, e.g., Patterson v. United States, 451 F.3d\n\n268, 269 (1st Cir. 2006); Rakes, 442 F.3d at 11; Callahan, 426 F.3d\n\nat 445; Cascone v. United States, 370 F.3d 95, 96 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nMcIntyre, 367 F.3d at 40; Skwira v. United States, 344 F.3d 64, 67\n\n(1st Cir. 2003), denied the motion.      The court relied heavily on\n\ntwo factors: the \"considerable span of time\" that passed between\n\nthe murders and the Salemme hearings, and the fact that Flynn was\n\nindicted and tried for the homicides.    Donahue v. FBI, 204 F. Supp.\n\n2d 169, 177-78 (D. Mass. 2002) (Lindsay, J.).\n\n          The government's motion to dismiss in Halloran suffered\n\na similar fate.     Relying on Donahue, a different district judge\n\ndenied the motion.    Estate of Halloran v. United States, No. 01-\n\n11346 (D. Mass. June 25, 2002) (Gertner, J.) (unpublished order).\n\n          In due course, the actions were consolidated before Judge\n\nLindsay, who granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiffs\n\nwith respect to liability.   Judge Lindsay held a bench trial on the\n\nissue of damages, but passed away before resolving the matter. The\n\ncases were reassigned to Judge Young, who awarded the Halloran\n\nestate $2,061,000 and the Donahue family $6,335,100.     These timely\n\nappeals followed.    In them, the government takes aim at the denial\n\nof its motions to dismiss.   The Halloran estate cross-appeals from\n\nthe award of damages, deeming it too low.\n\n\n                               - 16 -\n\fII. ANALYSIS\n\n            For ease in exposition, we divide our analysis into six\n\nsegments.     We start with an overview of the FTCA's claim-filing\n\nprovisions.\n\n                                A.    The FTCA.\n\n            Writ large, the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the\n\nmaintenance of any tort claim against the federal government. FDIC\n\nv. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994); RomÃ¡n-Cancel v. United States,\n\n613 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir. 2010).          Congress created a limited waiver\n\nof this immunity when it enacted the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1346(b),\n\n2671-2680,    which    allows   suits      against   the   United   States   for\n\npersonal    injuries,    death,      or   property   damage   \"caused   by   the\n\nnegligent or wrongful act . . . of any employee of the Government\n\nwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment.\"                  Id.\n\nÂ§ 1346(b)(1).         As part and parcel of this waiver, the FTCA\n\nestablishes firm filing requirements for both administrative claims\n\nand lawsuits.    Courts must faithfully enforce these requirements,\n\nneither \"extend[ing] the waiver beyond that which Congress intended\n\n[nor assuming] authority to narrow the waiver.\"               United States v.\n\nKubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 118 (1979).\n\n            An FTCA claim must first be presented to the affected\n\nagency.    28 U.S.C. Â§ 2675(a).       This must be done promptly: the FTCA\n\nbuilds in a statute of limitations forever barring any \"tort claim\n\nagainst the United States . . . unless it is presented in writing\n\n\n                                      - 17 -\n\fto the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim\n\naccrues.\"       Id. Â§ 2401(b).        These appeals hinge on the temporal\n\nparameters of this claim-filing requirement.\n\n            As said, the Halloran estate filed its administrative\n\nclaim on September 25, 2000.           The Donahues followed suit on March\n\n29, 2001. Thus, if the Hallorans' claim accrued prior to September\n\n25, 1998 (that is, more than two years prior to the claim-filing\n\ndate),    the   action    founded     upon   it   is   time-barred.    For   the\n\nDonahues, the critical accrual date is March 29, 1999.                We frame\n\nthe dispositive question as whether the plaintiffs' claims accrued\n\nearlier than September 25, 1998. After all, the relevant facts for\n\ncalculating the accrual date are nearly identical for both sets of\n\nclaimants, so if the first-filed (Halloran) claim is time-barred,\n\nthe later-filed (Donahue) claim is time-barred as well.\n\n                          B.    Standard of Review.\n\n            Before we attempt to determine the precise moment at\n\nwhich the plaintiffs' claims accrued, we acknowledge the applicable\n\nstandard of review.         The government moved for dismissal under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).                  The district court\n\nexamined    a   variety    of   raw    facts   (mostly    uncontroverted)    and\n\nconcluded that, as a matter of law, \"it was not unreasonable for\n\nthe plaintiffs to have failed to discover the factual basis for\n\ntheir claims until after March 30, 1999.\"              Donahue, 204 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 177.     Although appellate review of Rule 12(b)(1) dismissals\n\n\n                                      - 18 -\n\fsometimes    requires   deference        to   the   trial    court,    see,   e.g.,\n\nValentÃ­n v. Hosp. Bella Vista, 254 F.3d 358, 365 (1st Cir. 2001),\n\nthese appeals involve only the objective reasonableness of the\n\nplaintiffs' failure to discern at an earlier time both their injury\n\nand its likely cause.      That is a question of law.           See Skwira, 344\n\nF.3d at 72 (explaining that the ultimate conclusion regarding\n\ntimeliness    of   FTCA        claims    presents     a     question    of    law).\n\nConsequently, we review the orders of dismissal de novo.                       See\n\nRakes, 442 F.3d at 20; Callahan, 426 F.3d at 451.\n\n                          C.    The Discovery Rule.\n\n            An FTCA claim generally accrues at the time of the\n\ninjury.   McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 51; GonzÃ¡lez v. United States, 284\n\nF.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir. 2002).                In certain settings, however,\n\neither the injury itself or its cause is not readily apparent.                  In\n\nKubrick, the Supreme Court fashioned a narrow exception to address\n\nsuch circumstances.       The Court held, in the medical malpractice\n\ncontext, that under this \"discovery rule\" a claim accrues when a\n\nplaintiff knows (or is chargeable with knowledge) of both the\n\nexistence and the cause of her injury.              444 U.S. at 122.     The rule\n\nprotects \"plaintiffs who are blamelessly unaware of their claim\n\nbecause the injury has not yet manifested itself or because the\n\nfacts establishing a causal link between the injury and [the\n\ntortious act] are in the control of the tortfeasor or otherwise not\n\nevident.\"    DÃ­az v. United States, 165 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.\n\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\f1999); see GonzÃ¡lez, 284 F.3d at 289 (\"Once a plaintiff knows of\n\nthe injury and its probable cause, [she] bears the responsibility\n\nof inquiring . . . about whether [she] was wronged and should take\n\nlegal action.\").\n\n           We have applied the discovery rule in other circumstances\n\nin which the injury, its cause, or both are latent.             See, e.g.,\n\nAttallah v. United States, 955 F.2d 776, 780 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nOther courts of appeals have done the same.               See, e.g., Plaza\n\nSpeedway Inc. v. United States, 311 F.3d 1262, 1270-71 (10th Cir.\n\n2002); Garza v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 284 F.3d 930, 934-35 (8th\n\nCir. 2002); DÃ­az, 165 F.3d at 1339; Kronisch v. United States, 150\n\nF.3d 112, 121 (2d Cir. 1998).\n\n           Although   the   discovery     rule   delays   accrual   when   it\n\napplies, that delay is not indefinite.            Accrual starts when a\n\nplaintiff knows or reasonably should have known the factual basis\n\nfor his claim; that is, the existence of his injury and its cause.\n\nPatterson, 451 F.3d at 270.     This is a two-step progression.         Mere\n\nknowledge of the injury is not enough.            A plaintiff also must\n\nunderstand the \"causal connection between the government and her\n\ninjury.\"    Callahan,   426   F.3d   at    451   (citation   and    internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); accord Attallah, 955 F.2d at 780.            Once\n\na plaintiff possesses these critical facts, he \"is no longer at the\n\nmercy of the [putative defendant].\"        Kubrick, 444 U.S. at 122.       At\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 20 -\n\fthat juncture, he must act expeditiously or risk abdicating any\n\nlegal remedy.   See id. at 123.\n\n            Actual knowledge of the injury and its cause is not\n\nnecessary for a claim to accrue.           Callahan, 426 F.3d at 451;\n\nSkwira, 344 F.3d at 78.    A plaintiff who is unaware of the factual\n\nbasis for his claim may be charged with such knowledge based on\n\ninformation that he reasonably should have known or discovered in\n\nthe exercise of due diligence.         McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 52.      The\n\nframe of reference for evaluating what a reasonable plaintiff\n\nshould have known or discovered is an objective one.         Cascone, 370\n\nF.3d at 104; McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 42.\n\n            This approach holds the balance steady and true between\n\nan   FTCA   plaintiff's   right   to   redress   and   the   government's\n\nlegitimate interest in defeating stale claims.           John R. Sand &\n\nGravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 133 (2008); Kubrick, 444\n\nU.S. at 117.    It also preserves the timetable created by section\n\n2401, which Congress designed to \"ensur[e] that the government is\n\npromptly presented with a claim while the evidence is still fresh.\"\n\nPatterson, 451 F.3d at 270.       This allows the sovereign to \"rest\n\neasy after a period of time, knowing that suits for long-past\n\nwrongs are barred.\"   Rakes, 442 F.3d at 20; see Skwira, 344 F.3d at\n\n84 (Boudin, C.J., concurring) (noting that statutes of limitation\n\n\"are framed to work mechanically[, banishing any] arguments about\n\nwhether there was prejudice from delay\").\n\n\n                                  - 21 -\n\f            It follows that the government is entitled to expect that\n\ncertain facts and data will become known to a reasonable person\n\nthrough \"the channels of communication that run among people\n\nconnected through ties of neighborhood, community, friendship, and\n\nfamily.\"    Rakes, 442 F.3d at 23.       When such information achieves a\n\nlevel of local notoriety through, say, its headline-grabbing nature\n\nor its wide circulation, knowledge of it can fairly be ascribed to\n\nprospective plaintiffs.      Id. at 20.\n\n            FTCA plaintiffs can be charged with knowing two discrete\n\nsets   of   data:   (i)   generally     available    information        about   the\n\nrelevant facts and (ii) the likely results of any further inquiry\n\nthat a reasonable plaintiff, knowing these facts, would undertake.\n\nId.;   Callahan,    426   F.3d   at    451.      These   two    components      are\n\ninterrelated: if generally available information touching upon a\n\nplaintiff's claim is sufficient to cause a reasonable person in the\n\nplaintiff's position to inquire further, the results that probably\n\nwould have come to light through such an investigation must be\n\nfactored into the accrual calculus.            See McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 52.\n\nPut another way, the knowledge of facts comprising the first\n\ncomponent is imputed to the plaintiffs along with whatever other\n\nresiduum of knowledge would be dredged up through an exercise of\n\nthe duty to undertake further inquiry.            See Skwira, 344 F.3d at 84\n\n(Boudin, C.J., concurring).            Thus, when either the generally\n\navailable    information    or   the    likely    outcome      of   a   reasonably\n\n\n                                      - 22 -\n\fdiligent investigation that follows inquiry notice is sufficient to\n\nground a reasonable belief that the plaintiff has been injured and\n\nthat   there    is   a   causal   nexus   between   the   injury   and   some\n\ngovernmental conduct, accrual begins.         McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 52.\n\n                         D.   The Cause of Action.\n\n            We next examine what effect, if any, the plaintiffs'\n\ntheory of liability may have on the accrual date.\n\n            We begin with bedrock: cases cannot be analyzed in the\n\nabstract.      A distinct theory of liability helps to explain the\n\nrelationship between the government and the injury and to screen\n\nout facts that are impertinent to the accrual analysis. See, e.g.,\n\nMcIntyre, 367 F.3d at 57 (treating differently two Bulger-related\n\ncivil cases because they were based on \"fundamentally different\n\nlegal theor[ies]\").\n\n            Two theories have sprouted in FTCA cases growing out of\n\nBulger's and Flemmi's corrupt relationship with the FBI.                  The\n\n\"emboldening\" theory posits that the FBI placed a protective shield\n\naround the two mobsters, in effect giving them carte blanche to\n\ncommit crimes at will.         See, e.g., Rakes, 442 F.3d at 20.           In\n\ncontrast, the \"leak\" theory focuses on the wrongful disclosure of\n\nconfidences, such as informants' identities, to the mobsters. See,\n\ne.g., McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 54.\n\n            Although a plaintiff may advance multiple theories of\n\ncausation in a single case, the only relevant theory for accrual\n\n\n                                    - 23 -\n\fpurposes (at least where the two theories grow out of a common\n\nnucleus of operative fact) is the one that generates the earlier\n\naccrual date.       See Callahan, 426 F.3d at 452.                The government\n\nexhorts us to view the date of accrual through the prism of the\n\nemboldening theory, which generates an earlier accrual date.                   See,\n\ne.g., id.    In contrast, the plaintiffs argue for viewing accrual\n\nthrough the prism of the leak theory.\n\n            In Rakes, we clarified the appropriate mode of analysis\n\nfor choosing among multiple theories of causation in this kind of\n\ncase.   We cautioned that none of our earlier decisions \"should be\n\nviewed as setting forth a flat rule.\"              442 F.3d at 21.       Rather, the\n\naccrual analysis is case-specific and turns on the circumstances of\n\nthe particular case.         Id.\n\n            We need not decide which of the two theories is the\n\nproper touchstone for measuring the accrual date.                 For purposes of\n\nthis case, we assume, favorably to the plaintiffs, that the later-\n\naccruing    leak    theory     controls.        Even      on   that   questionable\n\nassumption, the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred because those\n\nclaims accrued no later than September 2, 1998 â€” more than two\n\nyears prior to the filing of the earliest claim with the FBI.\n\n            We add that, for purposes of accrual, we treat the\n\nHalloran    and    Donahue    claims    as   one    and    the   same.      This   is\n\nconsistent with the manner in which the plaintiffs have presented\n\ntheir arguments on appeal.         It is also consistent with the facts:\n\n\n                                       - 24 -\n\fHalloran    and   Donahue    were   together   during     Bulger's    murderous\n\nattack; and ever since that fateful day their deaths have become\n\ninextricably intertwined.\n\n                            E.   The Accrual Date.\n\n            We hold that the plaintiffs' claims accrued no later than\n\nSeptember 2, 1998. We premise this holding on information that was\n\ngenerally available at the time of the Salemme hearings.               Because\n\nin this case the generally available information was sufficient to\n\ntrigger the accrual of the claim on that date, we need not examine\n\nthe alternate component of the accrual calculus â€” the information\n\nthat further inquiry would have revealed.\n\n            As said, a claim accrues when the plaintiff knew or\n\nreasonably should have known of both his injury and its cause.\n\nHere, the murders were open and obvious, so the plaintiffs knew of\n\ntheir injury at that time. Consequently, we must train the lens of\n\nour inquiry on when the plaintiffs acquired information about the\n\ngovernment's role in causing the injury.                Although Boston-area\n\nnewspapers speculated as early as 1996 that Bulger and Flemmi had\n\nkilled Halloran and that the FBI was complicit, the missing piece\n\nof the puzzle was not brought squarely to the forefront of public\n\nconsciousness until April 22, 1998.            Morris's testimony that day\n\nwas widely circulated in the avalanche of publicity that followed.\n\nAs   we   suggested   in    an   earlier   case,   that   testimony    and   the\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 25 -\n\fattendant publicity spelled out in exquisite detail the facts\n\nneeded for accrual.        See Callahan, 426 F.3d at 453.\n\n            Morris unequivocally stated that he told Connolly of\n\nHalloran's cooperation with the FBI.                He also confirmed that\n\nConnolly    \"had   informed    Bulger      and   Flemmi   that       Halloran   was\n\nimplicating   them    in    Wheeler's   murder.\"      Id.        Morris     further\n\nacknowledged that, as a result of this leak, \"he believed that\n\nBulger and Flemmi may have killed Halloran.\"              Id.\n\n            That conclusion was sufficiently apparent that Morris\n\nexpressed   concern    that    \"he   had   sent   Halloran      to    his   death.\"\n\nMcIntyre, 367 F.3d at 58 (noting Morris's testimony).\n\n            This explosive testimony was extensively reported by both\n\nlocal and national media.        It was prominently featured in both of\n\nthe major Boston newspapers.         These articles repeatedly mentioned\n\nHalloran by name, usually within their lead paragraphs.                 One story\n\neven included his name in its headlines.           They tied Halloran's and\n\nDonahue's deaths directly to the FBI's misconduct.                      By way of\n\nillustration, we quote the first two paragraphs of one such exposÃ©:\n\n            In his most explosive testimony, the former\n            head of the organized crime squad of the\n            Boston FBI office said yesterday that he told\n            the agent who handled gangster/informants\n            [Bulger and Flemmi] that another informant had\n            implicated them in the [Wheeler] murder . . .\n            â€” fully expecting the agent would pass the\n            information along to his two prized snitches.\n\n            The informant, fringe gangster Edward \"Brian\"\n            Halloran, soon turned up dead. . . . Morris\n\n\n                                     - 26 -\n\f              said he suspected that Bulger and Flemmi were\n              involved in Halloran's murder.\n\nNealon, Ex-Agent Says He Told of Informer[:] Fringe Gangster Turned\n\nUp Dead, supra, at B1.\n\n              News   coverage       about    the       Halloran-Bulger-FBI        murder\n\ntriangle persisted after Morris testified. Newspapers continued to\n\nreport additional tidbits that surfaced during the balance of the\n\nSalemme hearings.        These revelations included Weld's testimony,\n\nMurray's allegations, and Flemmi's confession (which was made\n\npublic by Judge Wolf on September 1, 1998, and widely publicized\n\nthe next day).\n\n              The import of these disclosures is unmistakable.                     Under\n\nthe discovery rule as it operates in FTCA cases, irrefutable proof\n\nof a combination of wrongful conduct and government responsibility\n\nfor that conduct is not essential.               Skwira, 344 F.3d at 85 (Boudin,\n\nC.J., concurring).           It suffices if a prospective plaintiff has\n\nenough information to lead a reasonable person in his position to\n\nseek   advice    about       a    possible      claim    against       the   government.\n\nKubrick, 444 U.S. at 123; Callahan, 426 F.3d at 451.                            Morris's\n\ntestimony     was    given       under   oath    and    was     based    upon   personal\n\nknowledge.      Key aspects of it were corroborated by independent\n\naccounts, most notably by one of the alleged murderers.                              The\n\npicture painted during the Salemme hearings was widely-reported.\n\nWith   this    information        available      to     them,    the    plaintiffs   had\n\nconsiderably more than a mere hunch, hint, suspicion, or rumor\n\n                                         - 27 -\n\fabout what had transpired.      The information called into question\n\nthe   government's   responsibility    for    the   Halloran     and    Donahue\n\nmurders.\n\n           To be sure, there is no direct proof that the plaintiffs\n\nhad assimilated this information.            But whether the plaintiffs\n\nactually knew the information is not the issue.            What counts is\n\nthat the body of work was generally available to them no later than\n\nSeptember 2, 1998. Accordingly, they are charged with knowing this\n\ninformation on or before that date.          On that basis, we find that\n\nthe   combination    of   Morris's    detailed      testimony,    the     other\n\nrevelations that popped up during the Salemme hearings, and the\n\nwidespread publicity that accompanied these developments form a\n\nsolid foundation for charging the plaintiffs with knowledge of the\n\ncause of their injury no later than September 2, 1998.                 At that\n\ntime, the plaintiffs reasonably should have known of the FBI's\n\npossible connection to the murders.           They thus had sufficient\n\nfactual information to start the running of the accrual period.\n\n           The plaintiffs resist this conclusion in various ways.\n\nFirst, they suggest that the length of time between the murders and\n\nthe avalanche of generally available information about the cause of\n\nthe murders â€” approximately 16 years â€” justifies a more lenient\n\napplication of the discovery rule.        We do not agree.\n\n           In McIntyre, we dealt with a similar confluence of\n\nevents, playing out over a comparably protracted interval. That\n\n\n                                 - 28 -\n\fcase involved, inter alia, claims stemming from Wheeler's murder.\n\nWe concluded that news articles about Morris's testimony \"should\n\nhave caught the Wheelers' attention, because they specifically\n\nreferenced Roger Wheeler's murder.\"        367 F.3d at 58.      We deemed\n\nthis extensive reportage sufficient to trigger accrual for the\n\nWheeler family's claims.     Id. at 61.      Our holding today mirrors\n\nthat holding.4\n\n          That ends this aspect of the matter.            The widespread\n\npublicity given to the Halloran and Donahue murders was enough to\n\ntrigger accrual, notwithstanding the 16-year gap.         See Patterson,\n\n451 F.3d at 271 (finding \"widespread publicity\" sufficient to\n\novercome 35-year gap).\n\n          Second,   the   plaintiffs    insist   that   the   government's\n\nrepeated attempts to cover up (or at least minimize) its role in\n\nBulger's escapades should militate against accrual in this case.\n\nBut the government's uncooperative attitude hardly could have shut\n\nthe spigot on the flow of information; the facts were emerging\n\ndespite the FBI's recalcitrance.       In all events, one need not have\n\nirrefutable proof of the government's accountability in order to\n\n\n\n     4\n       The same discussion also dealt with claims arising out of\nthe murder of John McIntyre, an FBI informant.       The McIntyre\nplaintiffs' claim was different from that of the Wheeler\nplaintiffs.    Morris's statements never mentioned any leak of\nMcIntyre's identity nor did they offer any clue that McIntyre's\ndeath stemmed from Bulger's and Flemmi's corrupt relationship with\nthe FBI. See McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 56. The instant case fits the\nWheeler model, not the McIntyre model.\n\n                                - 29 -\n\ffile an administrative claim; it is enough to have \"possession of\n\nsufficient information for the agency to investigate the claim[].\"\n\nSkwira, 344 F.3d at 81 (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).      Filing such a claim puts at most a modest burden on\n\nplaintiffs,     who   can    continue   seeking   additional     corroborative\n\nevidence afterward. Id. at 81-82 & n.17 (observing that plaintiffs\n\ncould \"ask[] the agency to hold the claim in abeyance pending the\n\noutcome\" of ongoing investigations).\n\n            The Donahue plaintiffs next advance an argument unique to\n\nthem.   They asseverate that their relocation from Dorchester (a\n\nneighborhood in Boston) to Randolph (a Boston suburb) interfered\n\nwith their exposure to the relevant facts. But the two communities\n\nare situated in close proximity to one another, and both are served\n\nby the main-line print and electronic Boston media.               Under those\n\ncircumstances, a distance of roughly ten miles is not enough to\n\nobstruct the channels of communication that are likely to inform\n\npeople connected through ties of locale, friendship, and family.\n\nSee   Rakes,   442    F.3d   at   23;   cf.   Patterson,   451   F.3d   at   271\n\n(concluding that plaintiff's residence in Georgia was \"insufficient\n\nto vitiate a finding that she should have learned of the news\" of\n\nthe FBI's involvement in decedent's Boston-based murder).                    The\n\nmurder of a husband or father is a traumatic event of immense\n\nproportions, likely to raise a person's antennae when news touching\n\nupon that murder surfaces.\n\n\n                                    - 30 -\n\f           At any rate, even infrequent communication with family,\n\nfriends, and former neighbors may give a plaintiff enough knowledge\n\nto trigger accrual.    See McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 60-61.      The Donahue\n\nplaintiffs far outstripped that minimum level of communication.\n\nDespite    their   move,   they   remained     comfortably   within     the\n\ncircumference of widespread news coverage.       Thus, their relocation\n\nto a nearby town cannot mitigate the accrual of their claim.\n\n           The Halloran plaintiffs also make a separate argument.\n\nThey suggest that Bulger and Flemmi tried to kill Halloran before\n\nhe began cooperating with the FBI and that this timing should\n\nmilitate   against   accrual.     But   this   argument   boomerangs:    if\n\nHalloran was killed for a reason other than his informant status,\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim morphs into the emboldening theory â€” and,\n\nthus, would have an earlier accrual date.        See McIntyre, 367 F.3d\n\nat 58.\n\n           All the plaintiffs also place weight on Halloran's dying\n\ndeclaration that Flynn was the murderer.            They buttress that\n\ndeclaration by reference to Flynn's subsequent prosecution.           They\n\nmaintain that their reasonable belief that Flynn was the culprit\n\njustified their failure to conduct a diligent investigation after\n\nlearning of Morris's testimony.5\n\n\n     5\n       The dissent trains the lens of its inquiry on when the\nplaintiffs had reason to know the identity of the person\nresponsible for the murders. Dissent Op. at 42-45. But this focus\nmisses the mark â€” the relevant inquiry is when the plaintiffs had\nreason to know of the FBI's leak of Halloran's identity to Bulger\n\n                                  - 31 -\n\f             This   argument      does     not     withstand      scrutiny.         The\n\nplaintiffs' professed belief may have been reasonable initially,\n\nbut that rationale was severely undercut, if not wholly extirpated,\n\nby Flynn's acquittal, Morris's testimony, Flemmi's admission, and\n\nthe other new information that emerged in 1998. See Patterson, 451\n\nF.3d at 269, 271.         At this juncture, Flynn's acquittal took on\n\nadded significance.\n\n             Patterson    bears    an    eerie     resemblance     to   this   case.\n\nThere, FBI agents knew beforehand of an informants' plans to\n\nslaughter another person.          Id. at 269.           Yet, they took no steps\n\neither to forestall the murder or to head off an accusation against\n\ntwo innocent men.        Id.     Despite a wrongful conviction, we found\n\nthat an FTCA claim proffered on behalf of the murder victim began\n\nto accrue based on the \"breaking news\" about FBI corruption.                        Id.\n\nat 271.      The instant plaintiffs lack even the evanescent firmness\n\nof a wrongful conviction and, thus, cannot rely on the specter of\n\nFlynn   to    justify    their    delay.     Cf.     Skwira,      344   F.3d   at   80\n\n(concluding      that    claim    accrued        when,    among    other   factors,\n\ngovernment asked family's permission to exhume body and family was\n\ntold that the listed cause of death was incorrect).\n\n             Finally, all the plaintiffs assert that they were not\n\nchargeable with knowledge of the cause of the injury until the\n\n\n\nand Flemmi.   After all, this is a suit which alleges wrongful\ndisclosure, not wrongful death.\n\n                                        - 32 -\n\fpublication of Judge Wolf's opinion in Salemme.            Although this\n\nopinion wrapped all the pieces of the puzzle in a neat package, the\n\npieces themselves were readily available at an earlier date.             The\n\nplaintiffs fail to explain why there should be any distinction\n\nbetween the well-publicized information that surfaced during the\n\nSalemme hearings and its recapitulation in the district court's\n\nopinion.     While the latter was a more orderly and comprehensive\n\npresentation, the facts relevant to the government's responsibility\n\nfor the Halloran and Donahue murders were identical in both.\n\n                        F.    Equitable Tolling.\n\n           In a last-ditch effort to salvage a favorable judgment,\n\nHalloran's    estate   argues   that   the   accrual   period   should    be\n\nequitably tolled because of the government's fraudulent concealment\n\nof information about the corrupt relationship and the leak.         There\n\nis some authority for such an approach: in Rakes, we noted, albeit\n\nin dictum, that equitable tolling based on fraudulent concealment\n\nis feasible in an FTCA case.       442 F.3d at 26.     Nevertheless, that\n\nchannel is not navigable here.\n\n           Due diligence is a prerequisite for equitable tolling.\n\nSee Beltre-Veloz v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"It\n\ncannot be gainsaid that due diligence is a sine qua non for\n\nequitable tolling.\"); see also Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,\n\n498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990).      Here, the plaintiffs' argument for a later\n\naccrual date under the discovery rule has been rejected because,\n\n\n                                  - 33 -\n\famong other things, having become aware of the FBI's role in the\n\ndeaths of their loved ones, they nevertheless failed to exercise\n\ndue diligence in investigating the possibility of a claim.                   See\n\nsupra, Part II(E).    In such circumstances, the plaintiffs              cannot\n\nsuccessfully argue that the statute of limitations should be\n\nequitably tolled on the ground of fraudulent concealment.                Rakes,\n\n442 F.3d at 26-27.    Put another way, \"a plaintiff [who] could have\n\nturned up needed information through investigation, but has failed\n\nto exercise the requisite diligence, . . . will not be able to\n\navail herself of [the] doctrine, and will lose her claim.\"               Id. at\n\n27.\n\n           This principle is controlling here.                 While we do not\n\ncondone the government's history of stonewalling â€” for a long time\n\nit staunchly denied any relationship between Bulger, Flemmi, and\n\nthe FBI, and concealed evidence concerning Halloran's and Donahue's\n\nmurders â€” the plaintiffs' failure to conduct a reasonably diligent\n\ninvestigation after learning, actually or constructively, of the\n\ninformation disclosed in the Salemme hearings defenestrates the\n\nclaim of equitable tolling.            As we said in connection with a\n\nsimilar claim in McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 61, \"the government's\n\ndenials were superseded when Morris testified in April 1998 in the\n\nSalemme   hearings   that   he   and    Connolly   .   .   .    may   have   been\n\nresponsible for Halloran's death.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 34 -\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We are not without sympathy for the plaintiffs' plight.\n\nThe murders robbed both the Donahue and Halloran families of loved\n\nones, and their losses were exacerbated by years of government\n\nevasion.     But statutes of limitation are designed to operate\n\nmechanically.    They aspire to bring a sense of finality to events\n\nthat occurred in the distant past and to afford defendants the\n\ncomfort of knowing that stale claims cannot be pursued. See Rakes,\n\n442 F.3d at 20.      Their mechanical operation may at times have\n\nseemingly    harsh   consequences,   but   the   amelioration   of   such\n\nconsequences is a matter for Congress rather than for the courts.\n\nSee Skwira, 344 F.3d at 86 (Boudin, C.J., concurring); cf. Tasker\n\nv. DHL Ret. Sav. Plan, 621 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 2010) (observing\n\nthat courts are not free to decide cases on generalized notions of\n\nfairness but, where statutes are in play, must follow the path\n\ndemarcated by the legislature).\n\n            We add, moreover, that courts must apply legal rules\n\neven-handedly.   The fiasco brought about by Bulger's and Flemmi's\n\nseduction of the FBI has produced an endless stream of civil\n\nlitigation, and this court, in a series of opinions, has carefully\n\ncrafted a paradigm for dealing with the legal problems caused by\n\nthe prolonged delay in the disclosure of that corrupt relationship.\n\nSee, e.g., Patterson, 451 F.3d at 270-73; Rakes, 442 F.3d at 22-27;\n\nCallahan, 426 F.3d at 451-55; McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 51-61.       We must\n\n\n                                - 35 -\n\fapply the same paradigm here â€” and doing so requires us to draw a\n\ntemporal line that bars the maintenance of these actions.\n\n           We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude that the plaintiffs' claims against the United States\n\naccrued   no   later   than   September    2,   1998.   The   claims    are,\n\ntherefore, time-barred.        Accordingly, we reverse the district\n\ncourt's denial of the government's motions to dismiss, and remand\n\nwith instructions to vacate the judgments previously entered and to\n\nenter judgment in favor of the United States in each case.             Given\n\nthis disposition, we dismiss the cross-appeal (No. 09-1952) as\n\nmoot.   All parties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 36 -\n\f                             Appendix\n\n          The following is a non-exhaustive chronological listing\nof newspaper articles which detailed the FBI/Bulger relationship in\nconnection with Halloran's and Donahue's murders.

The key difference\n\nbetween myself and the majority concerns the legal salience of the\n\n1985   indictment,      trial,    and       acquittal   of     Jimmy   Flynn   to   the\n\nplaintiffs' FTCA claims. In my view, the majority turns a blind eye\n\nto the fact that, because a criminal conviction can only be secured\n\nby an exceedingly high standard of proof, many of the acquitted are\n\nin fact guilty of the crimes with which they are charged, and that\n\nit was therefore entirely reasonable for the Donahue and Halloran\n\nfamilies to continue to view Flynn as the responsible party despite\n\nhis    acquittal   at    trial.         I    believe    that    this    fact   carries\n\nsignificant weight in our FTCA accrual analysis.                       Our cases have\n\nmade clear that what it takes to trigger accrual in the FTCA context\n\ndepends, in part, on whether the injured party already has a\n\nplausible explanation for his injury in hand. See Cascone v. United\n\nStates, 370 F.3d 95, 105 (1st Cir. 2004).                    Because Judge Lindsay\n\ncorrectly appreciated the significance of both the prosecution of\n\nFlynn and the large span of years between the murders and the\n\ndiscovery of the government's complicity, Donahue v. FBI, 204 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 169, 177-78 (D. Mass. 2002), I would leave undisturbed the\n\ndistrict court's judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\n                                             I.\n\n            The Halloran estate filed an administrative claim with the\n\nUnited States on September 25, 2000, and the Donahue estate followed\n\nsuit on March 29, 2001.          Therefore, their claims are barred by the\n\n\n                                            -41-\n\fFTCA's two-year limitations period only if they accrued prior to\n\nSeptember 25, 1998 for the Halloran estate, and prior to March 29,\n\n1999 for the Donahues.       28 U.S.C. Â§ 2401(b).   The majority holds\n\nthat the plaintiffs' FTCA claims accrued \"no later than\" September\n\n2, 1998.   Maj. Op. at 25.    This was the day after a ruling by Judge\n\nWolf publicizing statements by Stephen Flemmi acknowledging that he\n\nhad been informed by the FBI of Edward Halloran's attempt to provide\n\nevidence linking Flemmi and James \"Whitey\" Bulger to the 1981 murder\n\nof Roger Wheeler.   Id. at 11.\n\n           For reasons laid out below, I believe that the plaintiffs'\n\nclaims did not accrue before March 30, 1999, which was several\n\nmonths before the district court issued its findings in United\n\nStates v. Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d 141 (D. Mass. 1999), substantiated\n\nin relevant respect by Kevin Weeks in his plea agreement of July\n\n2000.\n\n                                    A.\n\n           In the months leading up to his murder, a number of\n\ninterested parties wanted Halloran dead, and for reasons unrelated\n\nto the information he provided against Bulger.      This list included\n\nJimmy Flynn and Jimmy Mantville, who in fact later went on to claim\n\ncredit for the hit.6   As we noted in McIntyre, \"members of Winter\n\n\n\n     6\n      According to information later obtained from Weeks, Mantville\nclaimed responsibility for Halloran's murder \"even though he had\nnothing to do with it.\" Weeks reported that Mantville told him\nafter the murder, \"We finally got him,\" meaning Halloran.\n\n                                   -42-\n\fHill had made several attempts on [Halloran's] life\" before January\n\n1982, when Halloran first approached the FBI with information about\n\nBulger. McIntyre v. United States, 447 F. Supp. 2d 54, 82 (D. Mass.\n\n2006) (emphasis added).   The sources of the anti-Halloran sentiment\n\nwere not all related to his cooperation in the Wheeler probe. Flynn\n\napparently had his own reasons for pique: during Flynn's trial, the\n\nprosecution theorized that Flynn killed Halloran because Halloran\n\nhad facilitated Flynn's arrest on gun charges.        Moreover, in a\n\ndramatic twist, Halloran himself unequivocally identified Flynn as\n\nhis killer in a dying declaration.      This provided strong evidence\n\nof Flynn's role as the gunman.    Cf. Giles v. California, 554 U.S.\n\n353, 397 (2008) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (explaining that a dying\n\ndeclaration is one made \"when every motive to falsehood is silenced,\n\nand the mind is induced by the most powerful considerations to speak\n\nthe truth\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).     The\n\nstate bolstered the credibility of this identification when it\n\nprosecuted Flynn for the murders.       So did the FBI, when it took\n\nsteps to ensure that other information potentially linking Bulger\n\nto the murders was ignored or suppressed.\n\n                                  B.\n\n          This background is crucial to this case because it shows\n\nthat the Donahue and Halloran estates were not similarly situated\n\nto the families of other Bulger victims who have raised claims\n\nbefore this court.   See McIntyre v. United States, 367 F.3d 38 (1st\n\n\n                                 -43-\n\fCir. 2004) (discussing claims by estates of John McIntyre and Roger\n\nWheeler); Callahan v. United States, 426 F.3d 444 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(discussing claims by the estate of John Callahan).    In particular,\n\nin those cases, no one had been charged and prosecuted for any of\n\nthe murders, and Bulger was the prime suspect.    Here, the Halloran\n\nand Donahue families held the sincere and reasonable belief that the\n\nmurderer had been identified in May of 1982, when Halloran declared\n\nthat Flynn was responsible, and the state subsequently prosecuted\n\nhim, and they held this belief for sixteen years before learning the\n\nstill more sordid truth. As Donahue's widow later explained,\"[e]ven\n\nafter we watched the jury find Mr. Flynn not guilty, I assumed that\n\nhe must have been the murderer but that somehow his lawyer had\n\ngotten him off.\" Although Halloran's widow \"did not follow\" Flynn's\n\ntrial, as it \"was not going to bring Brian back,\"     she stated that\n\nshe \"always assumed that they charged the person responsible.\"7\n\nPrior to the initiation of these lawsuits, the victims' families\n\nwere told by those investigating the murders, to the extent they\n\nwere told anything at all, that Flynn was responsible.     Because the\n\nplaintiffs had a significantly more plausible explanation for their\n\ninjury in hand, it would have been reasonable for a person in these\n\nplaintiffs'   position   to   dismiss   the   apparently   outlandish\n\n\n     7\n      Indeed, until the publication of Salemme in the fall of 1999,\nDonahue's widow testified that she had never \" . . . considered or\nhad reason to consider that my own government, the same people who\narrested and prosecuted Mr. Flynn, could have somehow been involved\nin my husband's murder.\"\n\n                                -44-\n\fpossibility    of   a    causal   link   between   the    FBI   and   the\n\nDonahue/Halloran murders as ungrounded speculation, at least until\n\nmore substantiated evidence of the connection emerged in the fall\n\nof 1999.8\n\n            While it is true that our FTCA cases require that we\n\nimpute to the plaintiffs knowledge of events widely reported in the\n\nmedia, see Rakes v. United States, 442 F.3d 7, 20 (1st Cir. 2006),\n\nit does not require us to insist that every plaintiff, however\n\ndifferently situated, draw the same conclusions from that knowledge.\n\nIndeed, our cases counsel precisely the opposite.        See Cascone, 370\n\nF.3d at 104.   The majority appears to acknowledge as much, when it\n\nstates that an FTCA claim accrues when \"a prospective plaintiff has\n\nenough information to lead a reasonable person in his position to\n\nseek advice about a possible claim against the government.\"           Id.\n\n(emphasis added).       Indeed, our cases require us to distinguish\n\nbetween plaintiffs who have good, even if not overwhelming, reason\n\nto suspect government malfeasance lying behind their injury, and\n\nplaintiffs who have no such reasons.      Compare Skwira, 344 F.3d 64\n\n(1st Cir. 2003), with Cascone, 370 F.3d 95 (arising out of same\n\n\n\n     8\n      The majority avers that in focusing here on who committed the\nmurders, we have lost sight of the fact that \"this is a suit which\nalleges wrongful disclosure, not wrongful death.\" Maj. Op. at 32\nn.5. Let me therefore be clear: the claim is that the reasonable\nbelief in Flynn's guilt means that the plaintiffs were not, in the\nexercise of due diligence, required to give credence to prima facie\noutlandish speculations in the papers that an internal leak at the\nFBI caused the murders.\n\n                                  -45-\n\fpattern of criminal activity as Skwira).          In Skwira, the defendants\n\nwere aware that the government had exhumed the body of the deceased,\n\nhad informed them that the cause of death listed on his death\n\ncertificate was incorrect, and had initiated an investigation into\n\nthe deaths occurring in the ward of the VA hospital where Skwira\n\ndied -- meaning, given the context, that it was overwhelmingly\n\nlikely that the malefactor was a government employee.                Skwira, 344\n\nF.3d at 80.     They had, moreover, expressed their \"surprise\" and\n\n\"shock[]\" that Skwira had died of a heart attack given that he was\n\nadmitted to the hospital \"only for treatment of his alcoholism.\" Id.\n\nBy   comparison,   in    Cascone,    we   insisted    that    \"the   particular\n\ncircumstances of individual plaintiffs can be relevant to\" the\n\naccrual of their FTCA claim, and that \"[t]he issue is whether a\n\nreasonable person similarly situated to the plaintiff would have\n\nknown the necessary facts.\"         Cascone, 370 F.3d at 104 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).    The deceased in Cascone was a seventy-four-year-old man\n\nwith a history of serious heart disease, including a condition that\n\nwas listed as a cause of death, making it \"perfectly reasonable\" for\n\nthe plaintiffs to believe \"that the pneumonia [for which he was\n\nadmitted   to   the     hospital]   exacerbated      his    preexisting   heart\n\nconditions or that his heart problems simply happened to flare up\n\nat that point . . . .\" Id. at 104 n.12.                    Thus, despite press\n\ncoverage of the crimes, we found that\n\n           [n]one of the Cascones had a reasonable basis\n           to suspect that Cascone had died of anything\n\n                                     -46-\n\f            but his preexisting heart condition, even if\n            they   should   have   known  there   was   an\n            investigation.       \"Where    the   plausible\n            explanation [for death] is one of purely\n            natural causes . . . , there is initially no\n            reasonable basis for supposing [misconduct].\n            It is not the purpose of the discovery rule to\n            encourage or reward simple paranoia.\"\n\nId. at 105 (citing Thompson v. United States, 642 F. Supp. 762, 768\n\n(N.D. Ill. 1986)).\n\n            Just as the Cascones had no reason to suspect that the\n\nexplanation for Michele Cascone's death was false, and that in fact\n\nhe had been murdered by a government nurse, the Donahue and Halloran\n\nfamilies had no reason to suspect that the government's insistence\n\nthat Flynn was the gunman was a sham, and that in fact the\n\ngovernment itself bore a great deal of the responsibility for the\n\nmurders.    It must be borne in mind in this context that the high\n\nstandard of proof required to secure a criminal conviction means\n\nthat factually guilty individuals will regularly be acquitted of\n\ntheir crimes.     This suggests, in turn, that it would not have been\n\nreasonable to infer from Flynn's acquittal that Flynn was actually\n\ninnocent,   and   that   someone   else   had   committed   the   murders,\n\nparticularly in light of the significant evidence implicating Flynn\n\nin the murders.    The view that Flynn had simply beaten the charges\n\nwas a rather more likely scenario than the far more outlandish and\n\ndisturbing truth that emerged years later.\n\n            For these reasons, I do not believe the plaintiffs' FTCA\n\nclaims accrued until well past the March 29, 1999 cut-off date, as\n\n                                   -47-\n\fit was not until many months later -- on September 15, 1999 -- that\n\nJudge Wolf's Salemme decision came down, and that Winter Hill\n\nassociates    John    Martorano      and    Kevin     Weeks   subsequently     began\n\ntestifying as to Bulger and Flemmi's role in the murders.\n\n                                           C.\n\n            The majority raises a host of arguments to rebut this\n\nconclusion.        First, the majority points to Patterson v. United\n\nStates, 451 F.3d 268 (1st Cir. 2006), and claims that the Donahue\n\nand Halloran families \"lack even the evanescent firmness of a\n\nwrongful conviction.\" Maj. Op. at 31.                   Respectfully, this is a\n\nmisreading of Patterson.        In Patterson, we rejected a plaintiff's\n\nargument that her FTCA claim only accrued when she was informed by\n\nher sister, in the summer of 2002, that the FBI was aware of plans\n\nto murder her father, failed to take any actions to prevent it, and\n\neven allowed two innocent men to be convicted for the crime.\n\nPatterson, 451 F.3d at 269-70.             But, pace the majority, Patterson\n\ndoes not stand for the proposition that a settled and justified\n\nbelief in someone else's guilt can have no relevance to the accrual\n\nof an FTCA claim.          Patterson did not address that issue at all.\n\nGiven the newly discovered evidence that emerged in that case, the\n\nplaintiffs    were    on    notice    that      the   original    defendants    were\n\nfactually innocent, and that someone else had committed the murder\n\n(as   it   turns    out,   Flemmi's    brother        Vincent).     See   generally\n\nCommonwealth v. Peter J. Limone, 2001 Mass. Super. LEXIS 7 (Mass.\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\fSuper. Ct. Jan. 8, 2001).   In contrast, the Donahues and Hallorans\n\nknew only that a jury had not been confident in Flynn's guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.    This is a far cry from being told that Flynn\n\nwas innocent, and that someone else, perhaps with the tacit approval\n\nof the FBI, had committed the murders.\n\n            Moreover, the effect of the wrongful convictions on the\n\naccrual of the plaintiffs' FTCA        claim played no role in the\n\nPatterson court's reasoning, for good reason.     The Massachusetts\n\nSuperior Court vacated the wrongful convictions on January 8 and 18,\n\n2001.     However, the plaintiffs did not file their claims until\n\nJanuary 27, 2003, more than two years later, and so no claim of\n\nreasonable reliance on the Limone and Salvati convictions was in the\n\noffing.    See Patterson, 451 F.3d at 269.   Instead, the plaintiffs\n\nraised arguments of lack of notice and medical disability.      And,\n\nalthough the court rejected those arguments, pointing inter alia to\n\nthe December 2000 publicity surrounding the news of the FBI's\n\ncorrupt role in the murder and wrongful convictions, it made clear\n\nthat what was \"most important[]\" to its analysis was the fact that\n\none of the plaintiffs had himself been interviewed about these\n\ndevelopments in December 2000, and therefore clearly knew of and,\n\napparently, was \"troubled by,\" the allegations.   Id. at 273.   This,\n\nof course, was enough to start the FTCA clock ticking.    Cf. Merck\n\n& Co., Inc. v. Reynolds, 130 S. Ct. 1784, 1789-90 (2010) (holding\n\nthat a cause of action accrues \"when the plaintiff did in fact\n\n\n                                -49-\n\fdiscover,\" or \"when a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\n\ndiscovered, 'the facts constituting the violation' -- whichever\n\ncomes first.\" (emphasis added)).\n\n           Second, the majority also seeks to discredit the district\n\ncourt's emphasis on the lengthy period of time between the murders\n\nand the revelations of FBI corruption.         The majority does so by\n\nrelying on McIntyre, Maj. Op. at 29, for the proposition that the\n\nextensive interval between the murders and the Salemme revelations\n\nhas no bearing on the reasonableness of attributing knowledge of the\n\nlatter to the plaintiffs.       McIntyre involved, in pertinent part,\n\nclaims arising out of the murder of Roger Wheeler in 1981.            The\n\ncourt rejected the Wheeler estate's claims as untimely, reasoning\n\nthat the widespread publicity from the Salemme hearings put the\n\nWheelers   on   notice   of   their   claims   against   the   government.\n\nMcIntyre, 367 F.3d at 58-59.     But, again, the majority ignores the\n\nfact that the Donahue and Halloran families are differently situated\n\nfrom the Wheelers in one absolutely central respect.           Unlike the\n\nWheelers, the Donahue and Halloran families had been told that the\n\nmurderer had been identified, and by bringing Flynn to trial, the\n\ngovernment represented that they were confident -- indeed, confident\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt -- in his guilt.           At no point after\n\nFlynn's acquittal did the government give the plaintiffs cause to\n\nthink otherwise.    According to Donahue's widow, \"every time [she]\n\nasked the FBI for information regarding [her] husband's murder,\n\n\n                                  -50-\n\f[she] was told that the FBI had none.\" (Emphasis added).            (Not\n\ncontent with mere stonewalling, at one point FBI agents accused her\n\nof having an affair, which the agents suggested was the cause of the\n\nmurder).   The Wheelers had no officially sanctioned culprit on whom\n\nto pin responsibility for their injury.       The Halloran and Donahues\n\ndid.   This fact changes the significance of the many intervening\n\nyears -- from years spent seeking unforthcoming answers to an\n\nunsolved riddle, to years in which an officially sanctioned belief\n\nhardens into taken-for-granted fact.\n\n           Third,    under   the   rubric    of   \"generally   available\n\ninformation,\" the majority points to John Morris' testimony during\n\nthe Salemme hearings, as well as the ensuing media publicity.       See\n\nMaj. Op. at 25-28.    However, Morris's revelation on April 22, 1998\n\nthat Connolly had leaked news of Halloran's cooperation to Bulger\n\ndid not call into question the reasonableness of the families'\n\nbelief that Flynn was the killer.         Morris's testimony provided a\n\npreviously undisclosed motive for Bulger to kill Halloran, but\n\nothers, including Flynn, shared a similar motive. Cf. McIntyre, 367\n\nF.3d at 56 (\"One could not reasonably infer, for purposes of FTCA\n\naccrual, from Morris's testimony about Halloran that the FBI told\n\nBulger and Flemmi about every informant in their organization or\n\nthat Bulger and Flemmi killed every person that they knew to be\n\ninforming against them, regardless of the circumstances.\").       Where\n\nBulger was but one of a number of individuals with a motive to kill\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\fHalloran,    where       Halloran       identified      one       of    those   non-Bulger\n\nindividuals    in    a    dying       declaration,      and       where   the   government\n\ninsisted on the same at trial, the bruiting about in the papers of\n\na possible Bulger-FBI-Halloran connection, some sixteen years after\n\nthe fact, cannot be deemed sufficient to set the limitations clock\n\nticking.\n\n            The majority notes that \"one need not have irrefutable\n\nproof\" that an injury was caused by the government in order to file\n\nan administrative claim under the FTCA.                       Maj. Op. at 29 (citing\n\nSkwira).     That much is true.            But that is not yet to say quite\n\nenough. The Donahues and Hallorans had every reason to believe, and\n\nhad in fact believed for sixteen years, that someone other than\n\nBulger had committed the murder.                The government insisted as much\n\nby bringing Flynn to trial and subsequently took no steps to\n\ndisabuse the plaintiffs of this belief, even though the facts\n\nshowing its falsity were locked away in the brains of recalcitrant\n\ngovernment agents.        So although the level of proof necessary for an\n\ninjured    party    to    file    a    claim    under       the    FTCA   is    surely     not\n\n\"irrefutable,\"      given    the       situation       in   which       the   Donahues     and\n\nHallorans found themselves, it was nevertheless substantial, and it\n\nwas certainly more substantial than in cases where \"overwhelmingly,\n\nthe most likely malefactor was one of a very limited group of\n\ngovernment    employees,\"         and    involved       \"the      same    small     cast   of\n\ncharacters,\"       McIntyre,      367    F.3d     at   53.         It   makes   a   crucial\n\n\n                                           -52-\n\fdifference to our FTCA analysis, in other words, that the plaintiffs\n\nhad a \"plausible explanation for death\" that does not provide a\n\nbasis \"for supposing [government] misconduct.\" Cascone, 370 F.3d at\n\n105 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n                                     II.\n\n             The majority rejects the plaintiffs' claim of fraudulent\n\nconcealment as well, on grounds that the plaintiffs \"failed to\n\nexercise due diligence in investigating the possibility of a claim.\"\n\nMaj. Op. at 34.      The gist of the majority's argument here is that,\n\neven though the Halloran and Donahue estates did not actually know\n\nabout the media reports about the FBI-Bulger link, they should have,\n\nand they should therefore also have conducted further inquiry into\n\nthe matter, a duty imposed purely by the fictional knowledge of\n\nnewspaper articles that the court attributes to them -- and even\n\nthough had they actually conducted such an inquiry, the only\n\ndirection it would have led them is down the garden path.\n\n             I first note that the majority's reasoning under this\n\nheading   depends    crucially   upon    its   central    holding,    that   the\n\nHalloran and Donahue estates may be attributed with knowledge of the\n\nmedia reports of an FBI-Bulger link to the murders. This is because\n\nit is only if the presumption of such knowledge is reasonable that\n\nit   makes   sense   to   describe   a     failure   to   institute    further\n\ninvestigations as some kind of shirking of an epistemic duty.                If,\n\nas I have argued, the Halloran and Donahue estates have a perfectly\n\n\n                                     -53-\n\freasonable explanation for their ignorance -- clothed in the figure\n\nof one Jimmy Flynn -- then there is no duty of further investigation\n\nthere to be shirked.9\n\n              Secondly, it is clear that any efforts by the Halloran and\n\nDonahue estates to further corroborate the media reports of a FBI-\n\nBulger    link   to    the   murders   would     have    been    pointless.    The\n\ngovernment was at this point pursuing a strategy of dissimulation,\n\ndenial and stonewalling.           Judge Wolf noted in his Salemme opinion\n\nthat government intransigence during the hearings meant that it\n\nremained unclear whether Flemmi and Bulger played any role in\n\nHalloran's murder.           Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 212-13.                The\n\ngovernment withheld key documents from the defense relating to\n\nHalloran's murder, in violation of discovery obligations, until\n\nafter Morris had testified, thus preventing cross-examination of\n\nMorris as to their content.            See United States v. Flemmi, 195 F.\n\nSupp.    2d   243,    249-50   &   n.39    (D.   Mass.   2001)    (detailing   FBI\n\n\n     9\n      I note that even if our cases require attributing knowledge\nof widely disseminated media reports, this is because this is \"the\nonly practicable course,\" given the function of a statute of\nlimitations as a \"rule of repose.\" Rakes, 442 F.3d at 20. It is\nnot because it is somehow objectively unreasonable for people in\nthe plaintiffs' position -- whose husbands and fathers had been\nbrutally murdered, and who were left to raise small children on\ntheir own -- to refuse to re-open an inquiry long thought closed.\nRe-opening such an inquiry would carry significant psychic costs,\nand we need not go so far as to imply that refusing to bear those\ncosts is somehow per se unreasonable, even if we must, for other\nreasons, nevertheless attribute the corresponding knowledge. The\nsuggestion that this case may be decided under the rubric of the\nplaintiffs' unreasonable shirking of epistemic duties is simply to\nadd insult to injury.\n\n                                          -54-\n\fmisconduct during the Salemme hearings).      Indeed, not only did the\n\ngovernment fail to produce the FBI reports containing Halloran's\n\nallegations against Bulger and Flemmi during the Salemme hearings,\n\nthey insisted during the discovery phase of this case that it was\n\n\"not known how Bulger and Flemmi obtained information that Halloran\n\nwas providing information to the FBI,\" and noted that there were\n\nother reasons why members of Winter Hill, and its hangers-on, might\n\nhave   wanted   Halloran   dead.    This   disingenuous   profession   of\n\nignorance was made in 2005 -- years after the publication of Salemme\n\nand Martorano and Weeks' confirmations of the FBI's complicity in\n\nthe murders. See United States v. Connolly, 341 F.3d 16, 23-24 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (describing Weeks and Martorano's testimony at FBI agent\n\nJohn Connolly's trial).      Taking the government at its word here\n\nmeans that the plaintiffs -- who, of course, had far less access to\n\nthe relevant information -- cannot be charged with uncovering\n\ncorroborating evidence in the exercise of \"due diligence.\"             See\n\nAttallah v. United States, 955 F.2d 776, 780 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                                   III.\n\n           Unsurprisingly, the lurid story of the FBI's decades-long\n\nentanglement with Bulger and Flemmi has given this court plenty of\n\nopportunity to consider these issues.         Our cases on this topic\n\nexhibit an arguably gratuitous hostility to FTCA claimants.            See\n\nSkwira, 344 F.3d at 69 (holding that a plaintiff's wrongful death\n\nclaim was untimely, even though at the date we held their claim to\n\n\n                                   -55-\n\fhave accrued, the plaintiffs could not possibly have discovered that\n\nthe decedent had been poisoned as there were no known scientific\n\nmethods for testing for the drug used, and, moreover, the plaintiffs\n\nwere regularly told by a government employee that autopsy results\n\nwere consistent with death by natural causes).           This hostility is\n\nparticularly indefensible given that the heightened pleading burden\n\nplaintiffs bear under Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949-50\n\n(2009), means that plaintiffs who are unable to corroborate their\n\nclaims are likely to find themselves on the receiving end of a\n\nmotion to dismiss.    The majority suggests that FTCA plaintiffs may\n\nfile a claim with insufficient corroborative evidence and then\n\nrequest the agency to hold the claim           in    abeyance as further\n\ninvestigation proceeds.      Maj. Op. at 30, citing Skwira, 344 F.3d at\n\n81-82 n.17.   The statutory text neither imposes such a duty on FTCA\n\nplaintiffs, nor requires agencies to agree to such requests.              See\n\n28 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2671-80.    It is unclear that this paragon of lawyerly\n\nprocedure -- sue now, ask questions later -- would occur to any but\n\nthe most litigiously-minded or chronically risk-averse layman.\n\nMoreover,   by   requiring   premature    filing    of   FTCA   claims,   the\n\nmajority's position may well require lawyers to act in contravention\n\nof both the pleading standards established by the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure and their ethical obligations.10\n\n\n     10\n      Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 11(b) provides that \"[b]y presenting to\nthe court a pleading, written motion, or other paper . . . an\nattorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the\n\n                                   -56-\n\f          Despite our warning in Cascone that our FTCA jurisprudence\n\nshould not \"reward or encourage simple paranoia\" among plaintiffs,\n\nour cases may give the impression of counseling precisely this --\n\nnamely, that injured parties should bring their claims as soon as\n\nthey learn of uncorroborated speculation in the papers or even the\n\nmere \"rumor of a claim,\" for fear of later discovering their claims\n\nto be forever barred.     Because it in effect lowers the bar for\n\naccrual to a \"mere hunch, hint, suspicion, or rumor of a claim,\"\n\nMcIntyre, 367 F.3d at 52, today's decision is another step down this\n\nparanoia-inducing road.   Our cases, stingy as they already are, do\n\nnot require this result, nor should rex non potest peccare,11 when\n\napplied in the twenty-first century, allow for such an unjust\n\noutcome which rewards official uncontrolled wickedness.   I dissent.\n\n\n\n\nperson's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an\ninquiry reasonable under the circumstances: . . . (3) the factual\ncontentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so\nidentified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable\nopportunity for further investigation and discovery.\" ABA Model\nRules of Professional Conduct Rule 3.1 provides that \"[a] lawyer\nshall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an\nissue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so\nthat is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an\nextension, modification or reversal of existing law.\"\n     11\n      \"The King can do no wrong.\"      See William Blackstone, I\nCommentaries *237.\n\n                               -57-\n\f",

In this chapter of the sordid saga, the\n\nestates and heirs of two men killed on Bulger's orders sued the\n\nUnited States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for leaking\n\nconfidential information to Bulger and enabling his reign of\n\nterror.

We assume the reader's familiarity with\n\nthis   compendium    of   cases    and   rehearse   here   only   those   facts\n\nnecessary to bring these appeals into focus.\n\n                           A.     The Axis of Evil.\n\n           For decades Whitey Bulger, a key figure in organized\n\ncrime circles in Boston, and the leader of a criminal syndicate\n\nknown as the Winter Hill Gang, led a double life.             Unbeknownst to\n\nhis counterparts in crime, he served as a confidential informant\n\nfor the FBI.        Bulger's underworld position made him privy to\n\nvarious and sundry activities of rival gangs, including the Mafia\n\n(sometimes known as La Cosa Nostra).           The FBI's ardent desire to\n\nbring the Mafia to heel led it to make a Faustian bargain: in\n\nexchange for information about Mafia activities, the FBI would\n\nprotect Bulger and Flemmi and \"look the other way\" as the duo\n\npursued their own felonious misadventures.            This alliance spanned\n\nthree decades, lasting from the late 1970s well into the 1990s.\n\n           John Connolly, a member of the FBI's organized crime\n\nunit, was tasked to \"handle\" Bulger and Flemmi.                   Connolly and\n\nBulger had grown up in the same South Boston neighborhood.                 John\n\nMorris, who for most of the relevant period headed the organized\n\ncrime unit in the FBI's Boston office, oversaw Connolly.\n\n           Over time, Bulger and Flemmi plied their FBI handlers\n\nwith assorted gratuities.          See, e.g., United States v. Connolly,\n\n\n                                      - 4 -\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202977\"><a href=\"/opinion/202977/united-states-v-connolly/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210 (1st Cir. 2007); Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 210.\n\nMore   importantly,      they    provided       a   cornucopia      of   high-quality\n\ninformation that led to the convictions of several Mafia hierarchs.\n\nThese convictions were a gift that kept on giving: they enhanced\n\nthe informants' value to the FBI, decimated a powerful rival of the\n\nWinter Hill Gang, and created a vacuum that Bulger and Flemmi\n\nsystematically exploited.\n\n            Not surprisingly, the FBI coveted Bulger and Flemmi and\n\nconsidered them \"Top Echelon\" informants.                   See Flemmi, 225 F.3d at\n\n81 (describing the FBI's \"Top Echelon\" informant program). Because\n\nthis   characterization         elevated      the    status    of   their      handlers,\n\nConnolly and Morris did everything in their power, whether legal or\n\nillegal, to protect their prized informants and keep them happy.\n\nIn the bargain, the agents blithely ignored FBI guidelines and\n\npermitted    Bulger     and   Flemmi     to    carry    out    a    constellation     of\n\ncriminal activities, ranging from loan-sharking to extortion to\n\nmurder.\n\n                                 B.    The Murders.\n\n            The      FBI's    protective       efforts       extended     as    far    as\n\ndiscouraging other law enforcement agencies from investigating\n\ncrimes committed by Bulger and Flemmi; notifying the pair of\n\nplanned   law     enforcement     activities;         and     leaking    to    them   the\n\nidentities      of    persons    who     came       forward     with     incriminating\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 5 -\n\finformation related to their malefactions.          We focus here on one\n\nsuch informant: Edward \"Brian\" Halloran.\n\n             Halloran   was   a   low-level    hoodlum,    who    functioned\n\nprimarily as a cocaine dealer.      At times, he worked with the Winter\n\nHill Gang.     A life of crime typically has twists and turns and, in\n\nJanuary of 1982, Halloran was facing a state murder charge.\n\n             This development brings front and center a different\n\nmurder â€” the murder of Roger Wheeler.          Wheeler's killing stemmed\n\nfrom a disagreement over a string of Connecticut-based Jai Alai\n\nparlors owned by him and managed by John Callahan (who had ties to\n\nthe Winter Hill Gang).        Wheeler suspected Callahan of skimming\n\nmoney, cashiered him, and commissioned an audit.                 Wheeler was\n\ngunned down shortly thereafter.\n\n             Seeking immunity from prosecution, Halloran offered to\n\nshare   with   the   FBI   information   about   Wheeler's    murder.     He\n\nindicated that Bulger, Flemmi, and Callahan had conspired to kill\n\nWheeler and had offered Halloran the contract.            When he declined,\n\nBulger had Wheeler killed by someone else.\n\n             In evaluating Halloran's proposal, his FBI handlers had\n\nasked Morris about Halloran's reliability.           Because it was the\n\nFBI's policy to \"close\" informants who were themselves under\n\ninvestigation, Morris and Connolly (with whom he consulted) feared\n\nthat Halloran's allegations would lead the FBI to terminate its\n\npartnership with Bulger and Flemmi.           Rather than run that risk,\n\n\n                                   - 6 -\n\fMorris responded (without any foundation in fact) that Halloran was\n\nuntrustworthy.    On the basis of this mendacity, the FBI rejected\n\nHalloran's offer to turn traitor and denied his request to be put\n\ninto its witness protection program.1\n\n           Even though Halloran's charges had been defused, word of\n\nhis perfidy made its way from Morris to Connolly to Bulger.          Morris\n\nand Connolly, who were both experienced agents steeped in the mores\n\nof   organized   crime,   must    have   realized     that   disclosure   of\n\nHalloran's   identity     and    allegations    not   only   violated     FBI\n\nguidelines but also jeopardized Halloran's safety.           That jeopardy\n\nmaterialized: shortly after Connolly leaked Halloran's identity to\n\nBulger, Bulger and Flemmi hatched the plot to eliminate Halloran.\n\n           On May 11, 1982, Halloran asked his neighbor, Michael\n\nDonahue, for a ride home.       Donahue, in what later would prove to be\n\na costly gesture of good will, agreed.         As they drove, Bulger's car\n\npulled alongside and a fusillade of shots followed.           Donahue died\n\nimmediately; Halloran tried to flee, sustained a myriad of gunshot\n\nwounds, survived for a short period of time, identified James\n\n\"Jimmy\" Flynn (a Winter Hill associate) as his assailant during the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       As matters turned out, Halloran's charges later proved to\nhave a basis in fact. A Winter Hill associate, John Martorano,\nsubsequently pleaded guilty to Wheeler's murder. See McIntyre, 367\nF.3d at 50. Several months after Wheeler's execution, Martorano,\nacting on Bulger's orders, also murdered Callahan. See Callahan,\n426 F.3d at 449.\n\n\n                                    - 7 -\n\fambulance ride, and was pronounced dead upon arrival at a local\n\nhospital.\n\n            The murders of Halloran and Donahue, along with Bulger's\n\npossible role in the Wheeler and Callahan slayings, presented the\n\nFBI with a dilemma.     FBI offices outside of Boston, as well as\n\nstate law enforcement agencies, were investigating Bulger's and\n\nFlemmi's potential involvement in the murders of Wheeler, Halloran,\n\nDonahue, and Callahan (which had long been thought to be related).\n\nIf given credence, Halloran's allegations would have shed light on\n\nBulger's participation and, quite possibly, would have led the FBI\n\nto \"close\" him as an informant.\n\n            FBI agents from the Boston office's organized crime unit,\n\nincluding Connolly and Morris, met to discuss the situation.    They\n\ndecided to retain Bulger and Flemmi as informants unless and until\n\nthey received \"substantial information\" implicating the men in the\n\nmurders.2   Then, in a cynical twist, the agents took an active role\n\nin preventing any such \"substantial information\" from surfacing.\n\nTheir actions included hindering attempts by other FBI offices to\n\nsolve the Wheeler and Callahan murders; furnishing information\n\nabout pending investigations to Bulger and Flemmi; failing to index\n\ndocuments    summarizing   Halloran's   charges;   and   prohibiting\n\n\n     2\n       Although Flemmi was briefly \"closed\" as an informant, he\ncontinued to furnish information to Connolly and Connolly continued\nto leak confidential information to him, including the name of John\nMcIntyre, another confidential informant whom Bulger and his\nhenchmen subsequently murdered. See McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 46-47.\n\n                                - 8 -\n\finterviews of Bulger and Flemmi.         They also made certain that no\n\ninformation about Bulger's role in Halloran's murder was revealed\n\nto the Massachusetts authorities.\n\n             In 1985, the Suffolk County (Mass.) District Attorney\n\nprosecuted Flynn for the Halloran and Donahue murders.               Flynn\n\nproclaimed his innocence and went to trial â€” a trial that members\n\nof the Donahue family attended.         The jury acquitted Flynn and the\n\nmurders remained unsolved for the next decade.\n\n                          C.    The Revelations.\n\n             Bulger's cozy arrangement with the FBI began to unravel\n\nin   1992.      The   United   States   Attorney   for   the   District    of\n\nMassachusetts empaneled a grand jury that eventually handed up\n\nindictments against numerous gangland crime figures, including\n\nBulger, Flemmi, and Francis P. \"Cadillac Frank\" Salemme (the\n\nreputed \"boss\" of the Patriarca crime family).           Although Connolly\n\nwas no longer working for the FBI at that point, he found out about\n\nthe indictments before they were unsealed and forewarned Bulger and\n\nFlemmi.      Bulger fled and remains a fugitive; Flemmi was not as\n\nquick on his feet; the authorities arrested him in January of 1995.\n\n             In the judicial proceedings that ensued, Flemmi made a\n\nclaim of immunity from prosecution based on his role as an FBI\n\ninformant.     Along this line, he contended that the FBI authorized\n\nhim to engage in various crimes charged in the indictment.                The\n\ndistrict court decided to take evidence on Flemmi's motion.          These\n\n\n                                   - 9 -\n\fproceedings (which we shall call \"the Salemme hearings\") started in\n\nJanuary of 1998, lasted almost a year, and produced over 17,000\n\npages of transcripts.\n\n            As part of the Salemme hearings, Morris testified under\n\na grant of immunity on April 22, 1998.            His testimony brought the\n\nFBI's clandestine relationship with Bulger and Flemmi into the\n\npublic domain.    He confirmed that both men were regarded by the FBI\n\nas Top Echelon informants.           In connection with the Halloran and\n\nDonahue murders, he admitted that he falsely told other FBI agents\n\nthat   Halloran   was      an   unreliable    witness,    thus    ensuring   that\n\nHalloran's allegations would be discounted and that Halloran would\n\nbe denied entry into the witness protection program.                He also told\n\nConnolly    about       Halloran's      offer    to      incriminate      Bulger,\n\nnotwithstanding      his    knowledge    that   this     leak    would   endanger\n\nHalloran.\n\n            Morris    further      testified    that     Connolly   had    leaked\n\nHalloran's identity to Bulger and that he (Morris) suspected that\n\nBulger and Flemmi were responsible for Halloran's demise.                 In what\n\ncan best be described as locking the barn door once the horse has\n\ngalloped away, Morris stated that, after the double murder of\n\nHalloran and Donahue, he told Connolly that he \"did not want\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 10 -\n\fanother Halloran\" the next time that the FBI tipped off Bulger and\n\nFlemmi about an informant's identity.3\n\n            Three additional pieces of information that came to light\n\nduring the Salemme hearings are of particular pertinence for\n\npresent    purposes.      First,     on   May   27,    1998,   former   federal\n\nprosecutor William Weld recounted a conversation that he had with\n\nRobert Fitzpatrick a few days prior to Halloran's assassination.\n\nAt the time of this exchange, Fitzpatrick (second in command of the\n\nFBI's Boston office) told Weld that Halloran was in grave danger.\n\nFitzpatrick recounted that he \"would not want to be standing next\n\nto this guy [Halloran].\"\n\n            Second, in August of 1998, testimony in the Salemme\n\nhearings revealed that, in 1988, an incarcerated drug dealer named\n\nJoseph Murray told FBI agents that Bulger was responsible for\n\nHalloran's murder and that someone in the FBI's Boston office was\n\nleaking confidential information to Bulger.              Murray's account was\n\nneither shared with the agents who were investigating Halloran's\n\nmurder    nor   indexed   in   the   FBI's    data    bank   (thus   making   its\n\nretrieval difficult, if not impossible).              Third â€” and perhaps most\n\ntelling â€” Flemmi himself made statements to the district court\n\n\n     3\n       Although Connolly publicly decried Morris's allegations, he\nnever testified at the hearings, choosing instead to invoke his\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.     Connolly was\nlater convicted on a gallimaufry of charges stemming from his\ncorrupt relationship with Bulger and Flemmi, including charges\narising out of Halloran's murder. See United States v.

The appendix to this opinion\n\npresents a chronological sampling of the most relevant newspaper\n\narticles.\n\n            As early as 1997, journalists were speculating about\n\nHalloran's involvement with the Wheeler murder and Bulger's status\n\nas a snitch.    See, e.g., Shelley Murphy, In '80s FBI Saw Bulger as\n\nBoth Informant and Murder Suspect, Bos. Globe, Oct. 3, 1997, at A1.\n\nFor example, a front-page article in the Boston Herald suggested\n\nthat the FBI continued to use Bulger and Flemmi as informants even\n\nthough they were suspects in Halloran's execution.         See Ralph\n\nRanalli, FBI Used Whitey, Despite His Ties to 3 Murders, Bos.\n\nHerald, July 1, 1997, at 1.\n\n            Morris's sensational testimony led to an avalanche of\n\nnews stories.     His admissions that he had told Connolly about\n\nHalloran, that Connolly had leaked Halloran's identity to Bulger,\n\nand that he suspected Bulger of killing Halloran were widely\n\nreported in both the local and national press.       See, e.g., Peter\n\nGelzinis, 'Good' Guys Weren't Good to Halloran, Bos.

The two\n\nmost widely circulated Boston-area newspapers â€” the Boston Globe\n\nand the Boston Herald â€” covered these disclosures in laborious\n\ndetail, often with gripping headlines and prominent placement.\n\nSee, e.g., Ralph Ranalli, Ex-FBI Honcho: Agent Tipped Mobsters on\n\nStoolie, Bos.

The intense publicity continued\n\nfor several months, frequently reiterating Morris's testimony.\n\nSome articles included Halloran's photograph.   See, e.g., Shelley\n\nMurphy, Cases Disappear as FBI Looks Away, Bos. Globe, July 22,\n\n1998, at A1; Ralph Ranalli, Whitey Taunted Fed About Slain Stoolie,\n\nBos. Herald, May 16, 1998, at 15.\n\n          Subsequent developments in the Salemme hearings were\n\nthoroughly reported by the Boston media.    Weld's suggestion that\n\nthe FBI knew about the leak of Halloran's identity before the\n\nmurder generated front-page coverage.    See, e.g., Ralph Ranalli,\n\nFBI's Mafia Bugs in Peril â€” Key Wiretap Requests May Have Contained\n\nFalse Info, Weld Testifies, Bos. Herald, May 28, 1998, at 1.\n\nSimilarly, Murray's un-investigated allegations were reported.\n\nSee, e.g., Patricia Nealon, Witness: FBI Let Languish a Tip Tying\n\nBulger to Murder, Bos. Globe, June 4, 1998, at F8; Ralph Ranalli,\n\nFBI Was Allegedly Told of Bulger Role in Murder, Bos. Herald, June\n\n\n                              - 13 -\n\f4, 1998, at 4.       Flemmi's acknowledgment that he had been tipped\n\nabout Halloran's perfidy was likewise grist for the journalistic\n\nmills.   See, e.g., Patricia Nealon, Mob Trial Judge Orders Flemmi\n\nto Answer Some Questions, Bos.

Along the way, these press dispatches\n\nreiterated time and again the corrupt Bulger-FBI linkage and its\n\ntragic consequences for Halloran and Donahue.         See, e.g., Patricia\n\nNealon, Ground Rules for Flemmi Grilling Eyed, Bos. Globe, June 25,\n\n1998, at B4; Ralph Ranalli, Questions Arise Over FBI Agent's\n\nKnowledge of Slaying, Bos. Herald, Aug. 5, 1998, at 1.\n\n           Given the astonishing nature of Morris's allegations, it\n\nis unsurprising that media outlets other than the Boston newspapers\n\ncovered this matter.      For example, CNN's broadcast \"CNN Impact\"\n\nreported on March 15, 1998, \"that Bulger and Flemmi were FBI\n\ninformants and that possible connections existed between Bulger and\n\nFlemmi   and   the   murders   of    Wheeler,   Halloran,   and   Callahan.\"\n\nCallahan, 426 F.3d at 448.          An episode of the news program \"60\n\nMinutes,\" which CBS aired on May 10, 1998, described the FBI's\n\ncomplicity in the murders.          Additionally, the telecast displayed\n\nphotographs of the Halloran crime scene and stated that detectives\n\ninvestigating the Wheeler, Halloran, and Callahan murders \"believe\n\nall three murders remain unsolved because Bulger and Flemmi were\n\nprotected by the FBI.\"          And although the government has not\n\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\fsupplied    a     reliable    inventory       of    local   television     and     radio\n\nbroadcasts, it would strain credulity to think that local stations\n\nwould not have feasted upon such tasty fare.\n\n            The Salemme hearings concluded in October of 1998.

ANALYSIS\n\n            For ease in exposition, we divide our analysis into six\n\nsegments.     We start with an overview of the FTCA's claim-filing\n\nprovisions.\n\n                                A.    The FTCA.\n\n            Writ large, the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the\n\nmaintenance of any tort claim against the federal government. FDIC\n\nv. Meyer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 475 (1994); RomÃ¡n-Cancel v.

Congress created a limited waiver\n\nof this immunity when it enacted the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1346(b),\n\n2671-2680,    which    allows   suits      against   the   United   States   for\n\npersonal    injuries,    death,      or   property   damage   \"caused   by   the\n\nnegligent or wrongful act . . . of any employee of the Government\n\nwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment.\"                  Id.\n\nÂ§ 1346(b)(1).         As part and parcel of this waiver, the FTCA\n\nestablishes firm filing requirements for both administrative claims\n\nand lawsuits.    Courts must faithfully enforce these requirements,\n\nneither \"extend[ing] the waiver beyond that which Congress intended\n\n[nor assuming] authority to narrow the waiver.\"               United States v.\n\nKubrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110159\"><a href=\"/opinion/110159/united-states-v-kubrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 118 (1979).\n\n            An FTCA claim must first be presented to the affected\n\nagency.    28 U.S.C. Â§ 2675(a).       This must be done promptly: the FTCA\n\nbuilds in a statute of limitations forever barring any \"tort claim\n\nagainst the United States . . . unless it is presented in writing\n\n\n                                      - 17 -\n\fto the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim\n\naccrues.\"       Id. Â§ 2401(b).        These appeals hinge on the temporal\n\nparameters of this claim-filing requirement.\n\n            As said, the Halloran estate filed its administrative\n\nclaim on September 25, 2000.           The Donahues followed suit on March\n\n29, 2001. Thus, if the Hallorans' claim accrued prior to September\n\n25, 1998 (that is, more than two years prior to the claim-filing\n\ndate),    the   action    founded     upon   it   is   time-barred.    For   the\n\nDonahues, the critical accrual date is March 29, 1999.                We frame\n\nthe dispositive question as whether the plaintiffs' claims accrued\n\nearlier than September 25, 1998. After all, the relevant facts for\n\ncalculating the accrual date are nearly identical for both sets of\n\nclaimants, so if the first-filed (Halloran) claim is time-barred,\n\nthe later-filed (Donahue) claim is time-barred as well.\n\n                          B.    Standard of Review.\n\n            Before we attempt to determine the precise moment at\n\nwhich the plaintiffs' claims accrued, we acknowledge the applicable\n\nstandard of review.         The government moved for dismissal under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).                  The district court\n\nexamined    a   variety    of   raw    facts   (mostly    uncontroverted)    and\n\nconcluded that, as a matter of law, \"it was not unreasonable for\n\nthe plaintiffs to have failed to discover the factual basis for\n\ntheir claims until after March 30, 1999.\"              Donahue, 204 F.

This allows the sovereign to \"rest\n\neasy after a period of time, knowing that suits for long-past\n\nwrongs are barred.\"   Rakes, 442 F.3d at 20; see Skwira, 344 F.3d at\n\n84 (Boudin, C.J., concurring) (noting that statutes of limitation\n\n\"are framed to work mechanically[, banishing any] arguments about\n\nwhether there was prejudice from delay\").\n\n\n                                  - 21 -\n\f            It follows that the government is entitled to expect that\n\ncertain facts and data will become known to a reasonable person\n\nthrough \"the channels of communication that run among people\n\nconnected through ties of neighborhood, community, friendship, and\n\nfamily.\"    Rakes, 442 F.3d at 23.       When such information achieves a\n\nlevel of local notoriety through, say, its headline-grabbing nature\n\nor its wide circulation, knowledge of it can fairly be ascribed to\n\nprospective plaintiffs.      Id. at 20.\n\n            FTCA plaintiffs can be charged with knowing two discrete\n\nsets   of   data:   (i)   generally     available    information        about   the\n\nrelevant facts and (ii) the likely results of any further inquiry\n\nthat a reasonable plaintiff, knowing these facts, would undertake.\n\nId.;   Callahan,    426   F.3d   at    451.      These   two    components      are\n\ninterrelated: if generally available information touching upon a\n\nplaintiff's claim is sufficient to cause a reasonable person in the\n\nplaintiff's position to inquire further, the results that probably\n\nwould have come to light through such an investigation must be\n\nfactored into the accrual calculus.            See McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 52.\n\nPut another way, the knowledge of facts comprising the first\n\ncomponent is imputed to the plaintiffs along with whatever other\n\nresiduum of knowledge would be dredged up through an exercise of\n\nthe duty to undertake further inquiry.            See Skwira, 344 F.3d at 84\n\n(Boudin, C.J., concurring).            Thus, when either the generally\n\navailable    information    or   the    likely    outcome      of   a   reasonably\n\n\n                                      - 22 -\n\fdiligent investigation that follows inquiry notice is sufficient to\n\nground a reasonable belief that the plaintiff has been injured and\n\nthat   there    is   a   causal   nexus   between   the   injury   and   some\n\ngovernmental conduct, accrual begins.

The Cause of Action.\n\n            We next examine what effect, if any, the plaintiffs'\n\ntheory of liability may have on the accrual date.\n\n            We begin with bedrock: cases cannot be analyzed in the\n\nabstract.      A distinct theory of liability helps to explain the\n\nrelationship between the government and the injury and to screen\n\nout facts that are impertinent to the accrual analysis. See, e.g.,\n\nMcIntyre, 367 F.3d at 57 (treating differently two Bulger-related\n\ncivil cases because they were based on \"fundamentally different\n\nlegal theor[ies]\").\n\n            Two theories have sprouted in FTCA cases growing out of\n\nBulger's and Flemmi's corrupt relationship with the FBI.                  The\n\n\"emboldening\" theory posits that the FBI placed a protective shield\n\naround the two mobsters, in effect giving them carte blanche to\n\ncommit crimes at will.         See, e.g., Rakes, 442 F.3d at 20.           In\n\ncontrast, the \"leak\" theory focuses on the wrongful disclosure of\n\nconfidences, such as informants' identities, to the mobsters. See,\n\ne.g., McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 54.\n\n            Although a plaintiff may advance multiple theories of\n\ncausation in a single case, the only relevant theory for accrual\n\n\n                                    - 23 -\n\fpurposes (at least where the two theories grow out of a common\n\nnucleus of operative fact) is the one that generates the earlier\n\naccrual date.       See Callahan, 426 F.3d at 452.                The government\n\nexhorts us to view the date of accrual through the prism of the\n\nemboldening theory, which generates an earlier accrual date.                   See,\n\ne.g., id.    In contrast, the plaintiffs argue for viewing accrual\n\nthrough the prism of the leak theory.\n\n            In Rakes, we clarified the appropriate mode of analysis\n\nfor choosing among multiple theories of causation in this kind of\n\ncase.   We cautioned that none of our earlier decisions \"should be\n\nviewed as setting forth a flat rule.\"              442 F.3d at 21.       Rather, the\n\naccrual analysis is case-specific and turns on the circumstances of\n\nthe particular case.         Id.\n\n            We need not decide which of the two theories is the\n\nproper touchstone for measuring the accrual date.                 For purposes of\n\nthis case, we assume, favorably to the plaintiffs, that the later-\n\naccruing    leak    theory     controls.        Even      on   that   questionable\n\nassumption, the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred because those\n\nclaims accrued no later than September 2, 1998 â€” more than two\n\nyears prior to the filing of the earliest claim with the FBI.\n\n            We add that, for purposes of accrual, we treat the\n\nHalloran    and    Donahue    claims    as   one    and    the   same.      This   is\n\nconsistent with the manner in which the plaintiffs have presented\n\ntheir arguments on appeal.         It is also consistent with the facts:\n\n\n                                       - 24 -\n\fHalloran    and   Donahue    were   together   during     Bulger's    murderous\n\nattack; and ever since that fateful day their deaths have become\n\ninextricably intertwined.\n\n                            E.   The Accrual Date.\n\n            We hold that the plaintiffs' claims accrued no later than\n\nSeptember 2, 1998. We premise this holding on information that was\n\ngenerally available at the time of the Salemme hearings.               Because\n\nin this case the generally available information was sufficient to\n\ntrigger the accrual of the claim on that date, we need not examine\n\nthe alternate component of the accrual calculus â€” the information\n\nthat further inquiry would have revealed.\n\n            As said, a claim accrues when the plaintiff knew or\n\nreasonably should have known of both his injury and its cause.\n\nHere, the murders were open and obvious, so the plaintiffs knew of\n\ntheir injury at that time. Consequently, we must train the lens of\n\nour inquiry on when the plaintiffs acquired information about the\n\ngovernment's role in causing the injury.                Although Boston-area\n\nnewspapers speculated as early as 1996 that Bulger and Flemmi had\n\nkilled Halloran and that the FBI was complicit, the missing piece\n\nof the puzzle was not brought squarely to the forefront of public\n\nconsciousness until April 22, 1998.            Morris's testimony that day\n\nwas widely circulated in the avalanche of publicity that followed.\n\nAs   we   suggested   in    an   earlier   case,   that   testimony    and   the\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 25 -\n\fattendant publicity spelled out in exquisite detail the facts\n\nneeded for accrual.        See Callahan, 426 F.3d at 453.\n\n            Morris unequivocally stated that he told Connolly of\n\nHalloran's cooperation with the FBI.                He also confirmed that\n\nConnolly    \"had   informed    Bulger      and   Flemmi   that       Halloran   was\n\nimplicating   them    in    Wheeler's   murder.\"      Id.        Morris     further\n\nacknowledged that, as a result of this leak, \"he believed that\n\nBulger and Flemmi may have killed Halloran.\"              Id.\n\n            That conclusion was sufficiently apparent that Morris\n\nexpressed   concern    that    \"he   had   sent   Halloran      to    his   death.\"\n\nMcIntyre, 367 F.3d at 58 (noting Morris's testimony).\n\n            This explosive testimony was extensively reported by both\n\nlocal and national media.        It was prominently featured in both of\n\nthe major Boston newspapers.         These articles repeatedly mentioned\n\nHalloran by name, usually within their lead paragraphs.                 One story\n\neven included his name in its headlines.           They tied Halloran's and\n\nDonahue's deaths directly to the FBI's misconduct.                      By way of\n\nillustration, we quote the first two paragraphs of one such exposÃ©:\n\n            In his most explosive testimony, the former\n            head of the organized crime squad of the\n            Boston FBI office said yesterday that he told\n            the agent who handled gangster/informants\n            [Bulger and Flemmi] that another informant had\n            implicated them in the [Wheeler] murder . . .\n            â€” fully expecting the agent would pass the\n            information along to his two prized snitches.\n\n            The informant, fringe gangster Edward \"Brian\"\n            Halloran, soon turned up dead. . . . Morris\n\n\n                                     - 26 -\n\f              said he suspected that Bulger and Flemmi were\n              involved in Halloran's murder.\n\nNealon, Ex-Agent Says He Told of Informer[:] Fringe Gangster Turned\n\nUp Dead, supra, at B1.\n\n              News   coverage       about    the       Halloran-Bulger-FBI        murder\n\ntriangle persisted after Morris testified. Newspapers continued to\n\nreport additional tidbits that surfaced during the balance of the\n\nSalemme hearings.        These revelations included Weld's testimony,\n\nMurray's allegations, and Flemmi's confession (which was made\n\npublic by Judge Wolf on September 1, 1998, and widely publicized\n\nthe next day).\n\n              The import of these disclosures is unmistakable.                     Under\n\nthe discovery rule as it operates in FTCA cases, irrefutable proof\n\nof a combination of wrongful conduct and government responsibility\n\nfor that conduct is not essential.               Skwira, 344 F.3d at 85 (Boudin,\n\nC.J., concurring).           It suffices if a prospective plaintiff has\n\nenough information to lead a reasonable person in his position to\n\nseek   advice    about       a    possible      claim    against       the   government.\n\nKubrick, 444 U.S. at 123; Callahan, 426 F.3d at 451.                            Morris's\n\ntestimony     was    given       under   oath    and    was     based    upon   personal\n\nknowledge.      Key aspects of it were corroborated by independent\n\naccounts, most notably by one of the alleged murderers.                              The\n\npicture painted during the Salemme hearings was widely-reported.\n\nWith   this    information        available      to     them,    the    plaintiffs   had\n\nconsiderably more than a mere hunch, hint, suspicion, or rumor\n\n                                         - 27 -\n\fabout what had transpired.      The information called into question\n\nthe   government's   responsibility    for    the   Halloran     and    Donahue\n\nmurders.\n\n           To be sure, there is no direct proof that the plaintiffs\n\nhad assimilated this information.            But whether the plaintiffs\n\nactually knew the information is not the issue.            What counts is\n\nthat the body of work was generally available to them no later than\n\nSeptember 2, 1998. Accordingly, they are charged with knowing this\n\ninformation on or before that date.          On that basis, we find that\n\nthe   combination    of   Morris's    detailed      testimony,    the     other\n\nrevelations that popped up during the Salemme hearings, and the\n\nwidespread publicity that accompanied these developments form a\n\nsolid foundation for charging the plaintiffs with knowledge of the\n\ncause of their injury no later than September 2, 1998.                 At that\n\ntime, the plaintiffs reasonably should have known of the FBI's\n\npossible connection to the murders.           They thus had sufficient\n\nfactual information to start the running of the accrual period.\n\n           The plaintiffs resist this conclusion in various ways.\n\nFirst, they suggest that the length of time between the murders and\n\nthe avalanche of generally available information about the cause of\n\nthe murders â€” approximately 16 years â€” justifies a more lenient\n\napplication of the discovery rule.        We do not agree.\n\n           In McIntyre, we dealt with a similar confluence of\n\nevents, playing out over a comparably protracted interval. That\n\n\n                                 - 28 -\n\fcase involved, inter alia, claims stemming from Wheeler's murder.\n\nWe concluded that news articles about Morris's testimony \"should\n\nhave caught the Wheelers' attention, because they specifically\n\nreferenced Roger Wheeler's murder.\"        367 F.3d at 58.      We deemed\n\nthis extensive reportage sufficient to trigger accrual for the\n\nWheeler family's claims.     Id. at 61.      Our holding today mirrors\n\nthat holding.4\n\n          That ends this aspect of the matter.            The widespread\n\npublicity given to the Halloran and Donahue murders was enough to\n\ntrigger accrual, notwithstanding the 16-year gap.         See Patterson,\n\n451 F.3d at 271 (finding \"widespread publicity\" sufficient to\n\novercome 35-year gap).\n\n          Second,   the   plaintiffs    insist   that   the   government's\n\nrepeated attempts to cover up (or at least minimize) its role in\n\nBulger's escapades should militate against accrual in this case.\n\nBut the government's uncooperative attitude hardly could have shut\n\nthe spigot on the flow of information; the facts were emerging\n\ndespite the FBI's recalcitrance.       In all events, one need not have\n\nirrefutable proof of the government's accountability in order to\n\n\n\n     4\n       The same discussion also dealt with claims arising out of\nthe murder of John McIntyre, an FBI informant.       The McIntyre\nplaintiffs' claim was different from that of the Wheeler\nplaintiffs.    Morris's statements never mentioned any leak of\nMcIntyre's identity nor did they offer any clue that McIntyre's\ndeath stemmed from Bulger's and Flemmi's corrupt relationship with\nthe FBI. See McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 56. The instant case fits the\nWheeler model, not the McIntyre model.\n\n                                - 29 -\n\ffile an administrative claim; it is enough to have \"possession of\n\nsufficient information for the agency to investigate the claim[].\"\n\nSkwira, 344 F.3d at 81 (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).      Filing such a claim puts at most a modest burden on\n\nplaintiffs,     who   can    continue   seeking   additional     corroborative\n\nevidence afterward. Id. at 81-82 & n.17 (observing that plaintiffs\n\ncould \"ask[] the agency to hold the claim in abeyance pending the\n\noutcome\" of ongoing investigations).\n\n            The Donahue plaintiffs next advance an argument unique to\n\nthem.   They asseverate that their relocation from Dorchester (a\n\nneighborhood in Boston) to Randolph (a Boston suburb) interfered\n\nwith their exposure to the relevant facts. But the two communities\n\nare situated in close proximity to one another, and both are served\n\nby the main-line print and electronic Boston media.               Under those\n\ncircumstances, a distance of roughly ten miles is not enough to\n\nobstruct the channels of communication that are likely to inform\n\npeople connected through ties of locale, friendship, and family.\n\nSee   Rakes,   442    F.3d   at   23;   cf.   Patterson,   451   F.3d   at   271\n\n(concluding that plaintiff's residence in Georgia was \"insufficient\n\nto vitiate a finding that she should have learned of the news\" of\n\nthe FBI's involvement in decedent's Boston-based murder).                    The\n\nmurder of a husband or father is a traumatic event of immense\n\nproportions, likely to raise a person's antennae when news touching\n\nupon that murder surfaces.\n\n\n                                    - 30 -\n\f           At any rate, even infrequent communication with family,\n\nfriends, and former neighbors may give a plaintiff enough knowledge\n\nto trigger accrual.    See McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 60-61.      The Donahue\n\nplaintiffs far outstripped that minimum level of communication.\n\nDespite    their   move,   they   remained     comfortably   within     the\n\ncircumference of widespread news coverage.       Thus, their relocation\n\nto a nearby town cannot mitigate the accrual of their claim.\n\n           The Halloran plaintiffs also make a separate argument.\n\nThey suggest that Bulger and Flemmi tried to kill Halloran before\n\nhe began cooperating with the FBI and that this timing should\n\nmilitate   against   accrual.     But   this   argument   boomerangs:    if\n\nHalloran was killed for a reason other than his informant status,\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim morphs into the emboldening theory â€” and,\n\nthus, would have an earlier accrual date.        See McIntyre, 367 F.3d\n\nat 58.\n\n           All the plaintiffs also place weight on Halloran's dying\n\ndeclaration that Flynn was the murderer.            They buttress that\n\ndeclaration by reference to Flynn's subsequent prosecution.           They\n\nmaintain that their reasonable belief that Flynn was the culprit\n\njustified their failure to conduct a diligent investigation after\n\nlearning of Morris's testimony.5\n\n\n     5\n       The dissent trains the lens of its inquiry on when the\nplaintiffs had reason to know the identity of the person\nresponsible for the murders. Dissent Op. at 42-45. But this focus\nmisses the mark â€” the relevant inquiry is when the plaintiffs had\nreason to know of the FBI's leak of Halloran's identity to Bulger\n\n                                  - 31 -\n\f             This   argument      does     not     withstand      scrutiny.         The\n\nplaintiffs' professed belief may have been reasonable initially,\n\nbut that rationale was severely undercut, if not wholly extirpated,\n\nby Flynn's acquittal, Morris's testimony, Flemmi's admission, and\n\nthe other new information that emerged in 1998. See Patterson, 451\n\nF.3d at 269, 271.         At this juncture, Flynn's acquittal took on\n\nadded significance.\n\n             Patterson    bears    an    eerie     resemblance     to   this   case.\n\nThere, FBI agents knew beforehand of an informants' plans to\n\nslaughter another person.          Id. at 269.           Yet, they took no steps\n\neither to forestall the murder or to head off an accusation against\n\ntwo innocent men.        Id.     Despite a wrongful conviction, we found\n\nthat an FTCA claim proffered on behalf of the murder victim began\n\nto accrue based on the \"breaking news\" about FBI corruption.                        Id.\n\nat 271.      The instant plaintiffs lack even the evanescent firmness\n\nof a wrongful conviction and, thus, cannot rely on the specter of\n\nFlynn   to    justify    their    delay.     Cf.     Skwira,      344   F.3d   at   80\n\n(concluding      that    claim    accrued        when,    among    other   factors,\n\ngovernment asked family's permission to exhume body and family was\n\ntold that the listed cause of death was incorrect).\n\n             Finally, all the plaintiffs assert that they were not\n\nchargeable with knowledge of the cause of the injury until the\n\n\n\nand Flemmi.   After all, this is a suit which alleges wrongful\ndisclosure, not wrongful death.\n\n                                        - 32 -\n\fpublication of Judge Wolf's opinion in Salemme.            Although this\n\nopinion wrapped all the pieces of the puzzle in a neat package, the\n\npieces themselves were readily available at an earlier date.             The\n\nplaintiffs fail to explain why there should be any distinction\n\nbetween the well-publicized information that surfaced during the\n\nSalemme hearings and its recapitulation in the district court's\n\nopinion.     While the latter was a more orderly and comprehensive\n\npresentation, the facts relevant to the government's responsibility\n\nfor the Halloran and Donahue murders were identical in both.\n\n                        F.    Equitable Tolling.\n\n           In a last-ditch effort to salvage a favorable judgment,\n\nHalloran's    estate   argues   that   the   accrual   period   should    be\n\nequitably tolled because of the government's fraudulent concealment\n\nof information about the corrupt relationship and the leak.         There\n\nis some authority for such an approach: in Rakes, we noted, albeit\n\nin dictum, that equitable tolling based on fraudulent concealment\n\nis feasible in an FTCA case.       442 F.3d at 26.     Nevertheless, that\n\nchannel is not navigable here.\n\n           Due diligence is a prerequisite for equitable tolling.\n\nSee Beltre-Veloz v.

Here, the plaintiffs' argument for a later\n\naccrual date under the discovery rule has been rejected because,\n\n\n                                  - 33 -\n\famong other things, having become aware of the FBI's role in the\n\ndeaths of their loved ones, they nevertheless failed to exercise\n\ndue diligence in investigating the possibility of a claim.                   See\n\nsupra, Part II(E).    In such circumstances, the plaintiffs              cannot\n\nsuccessfully argue that the statute of limitations should be\n\nequitably tolled on the ground of fraudulent concealment.                Rakes,\n\n442 F.3d at 26-27.    Put another way, \"a plaintiff [who] could have\n\nturned up needed information through investigation, but has failed\n\nto exercise the requisite diligence, . . . will not be able to\n\navail herself of [the] doctrine, and will lose her claim.\"               Id. at\n\n27.\n\n           This principle is controlling here.                 While we do not\n\ncondone the government's history of stonewalling â€” for a long time\n\nit staunchly denied any relationship between Bulger, Flemmi, and\n\nthe FBI, and concealed evidence concerning Halloran's and Donahue's\n\nmurders â€” the plaintiffs' failure to conduct a reasonably diligent\n\ninvestigation after learning, actually or constructively, of the\n\ninformation disclosed in the Salemme hearings defenestrates the\n\nclaim of equitable tolling.            As we said in connection with a\n\nsimilar claim in McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 61, \"the government's\n\ndenials were superseded when Morris testified in April 1998 in the\n\nSalemme   hearings   that   he   and    Connolly   .   .   .    may   have   been\n\nresponsible for Halloran's death.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 34 -\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We are not without sympathy for the plaintiffs' plight.\n\nThe murders robbed both the Donahue and Halloran families of loved\n\nones, and their losses were exacerbated by years of government\n\nevasion.     But statutes of limitation are designed to operate\n\nmechanically.    They aspire to bring a sense of finality to events\n\nthat occurred in the distant past and to afford defendants the\n\ncomfort of knowing that stale claims cannot be pursued. See Rakes,\n\n442 F.3d at 20.      Their mechanical operation may at times have\n\nseemingly    harsh   consequences,   but   the   amelioration   of   such\n\nconsequences is a matter for Congress rather than for the courts.\n\nSee Skwira, 344 F.3d at 86 (Boudin, C.J., concurring); cf.

The fiasco brought about by Bulger's and Flemmi's\n\nseduction of the FBI has produced an endless stream of civil\n\nlitigation, and this court, in a series of opinions, has carefully\n\ncrafted a paradigm for dealing with the legal problems caused by\n\nthe prolonged delay in the disclosure of that corrupt relationship.\n\nSee, e.g., Patterson, 451 F.3d at 270-73; Rakes, 442 F.3d at 22-27;\n\nCallahan, 426 F.3d at 451-55; McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 51-61.

The key difference\n\nbetween myself and the majority concerns the legal salience of the\n\n1985   indictment,      trial,    and       acquittal   of     Jimmy   Flynn   to   the\n\nplaintiffs' FTCA claims. In my view, the majority turns a blind eye\n\nto the fact that, because a criminal conviction can only be secured\n\nby an exceedingly high standard of proof, many of the acquitted are\n\nin fact guilty of the crimes with which they are charged, and that\n\nit was therefore entirely reasonable for the Donahue and Halloran\n\nfamilies to continue to view Flynn as the responsible party despite\n\nhis    acquittal   at    trial.         I    believe    that    this    fact   carries\n\nsignificant weight in our FTCA accrual analysis.                       Our cases have\n\nmade clear that what it takes to trigger accrual in the FTCA context\n\ndepends, in part, on whether the injured party already has a\n\nplausible explanation for his injury in hand.

The sources of the anti-Halloran sentiment\n\nwere not all related to his cooperation in the Wheeler probe. Flynn\n\napparently had his own reasons for pique: during Flynn's trial, the\n\nprosecution theorized that Flynn killed Halloran because Halloran\n\nhad facilitated Flynn's arrest on gun charges.        Moreover, in a\n\ndramatic twist, Halloran himself unequivocally identified Flynn as\n\nhis killer in a dying declaration.      This provided strong evidence\n\nof Flynn's role as the gunman.    Cf.

In particular,\n\nin those cases, no one had been charged and prosecuted for any of\n\nthe murders, and Bulger was the prime suspect.    Here, the Halloran\n\nand Donahue families held the sincere and reasonable belief that the\n\nmurderer had been identified in May of 1982, when Halloran declared\n\nthat Flynn was responsible, and the state subsequently prosecuted\n\nhim, and they held this belief for sixteen years before learning the\n\nstill more sordid truth. As Donahue's widow later explained,\"[e]ven\n\nafter we watched the jury find Mr. Flynn not guilty, I assumed that\n\nhe must have been the murderer but that somehow his lawyer had\n\ngotten him off.\" Although Halloran's widow \"did not follow\" Flynn's\n\ntrial, as it \"was not going to bring Brian back,\"     she stated that\n\nshe \"always assumed that they charged the person responsible.\"7\n\nPrior to the initiation of these lawsuits, the victims' families\n\nwere told by those investigating the murders, to the extent they\n\nwere told anything at all, that Flynn was responsible.     Because the\n\nplaintiffs had a significantly more plausible explanation for their\n\ninjury in hand, it would have been reasonable for a person in these\n\nplaintiffs'   position   to   dismiss   the   apparently   outlandish\n\n\n     7\n      Indeed, until the publication of Salemme in the fall of 1999,\nDonahue's widow testified that she had never \" . . . considered or\nhad reason to consider that my own government, the same people who\narrested and prosecuted Mr. Flynn, could have somehow been involved\nin my husband's murder.\"\n\n                                -44-\n\fpossibility    of   a    causal   link   between   the    FBI   and   the\n\nDonahue/Halloran murders as ungrounded speculation, at least until\n\nmore substantiated evidence of the connection emerged in the fall\n\nof 1999.8\n\n            While it is true that our FTCA cases require that we\n\nimpute to the plaintiffs knowledge of events widely reported in the\n\nmedia, see Rakes v.

In Skwira, the defendants\n\nwere aware that the government had exhumed the body of the deceased,\n\nhad informed them that the cause of death listed on his death\n\ncertificate was incorrect, and had initiated an investigation into\n\nthe deaths occurring in the ward of the VA hospital where Skwira\n\ndied -- meaning, given the context, that it was overwhelmingly\n\nlikely that the malefactor was a government employee.                Skwira, 344\n\nF.3d at 80.     They had, moreover, expressed their \"surprise\" and\n\n\"shock[]\" that Skwira had died of a heart attack given that he was\n\nadmitted to the hospital \"only for treatment of his alcoholism.\" Id.\n\nBy   comparison,   in    Cascone,    we   insisted    that    \"the   particular\n\ncircumstances of individual plaintiffs can be relevant to\" the\n\naccrual of their FTCA claim, and that \"[t]he issue is whether a\n\nreasonable person similarly situated to the plaintiff would have\n\nknown the necessary facts.\"         Cascone, 370 F.3d at 104 (emphasis in\n\noriginal).    The deceased in Cascone was a seventy-four-year-old man\n\nwith a history of serious heart disease, including a condition that\n\nwas listed as a cause of death, making it \"perfectly reasonable\" for\n\nthe plaintiffs to believe \"that the pneumonia [for which he was\n\nadmitted   to   the     hospital]   exacerbated      his    preexisting   heart\n\nconditions or that his heart problems simply happened to flare up\n\nat that point . . . .\" Id. at 104 n.12.

Ill. 1986)).\n\n            Just as the Cascones had no reason to suspect that the\n\nexplanation for Michele Cascone's death was false, and that in fact\n\nhe had been murdered by a government nurse, the Donahue and Halloran\n\nfamilies had no reason to suspect that the government's insistence\n\nthat Flynn was the gunman was a sham, and that in fact the\n\ngovernment itself bore a great deal of the responsibility for the\n\nmurders.    It must be borne in mind in this context that the high\n\nstandard of proof required to secure a criminal conviction means\n\nthat factually guilty individuals will regularly be acquitted of\n\ntheir crimes.     This suggests, in turn, that it would not have been\n\nreasonable to infer from Flynn's acquittal that Flynn was actually\n\ninnocent,   and   that   someone   else   had   committed   the   murders,\n\nparticularly in light of the significant evidence implicating Flynn\n\nin the murders.    The view that Flynn had simply beaten the charges\n\nwas a rather more likely scenario than the far more outlandish and\n\ndisturbing truth that emerged years later.\n\n            For these reasons, I do not believe the plaintiffs' FTCA\n\nclaims accrued until well past the March 29, 1999 cut-off date, as\n\n                                   -47-\n\fit was not until many months later -- on September 15, 1999 -- that\n\nJudge Wolf's Salemme decision came down, and that Winter Hill\n\nassociates    John    Martorano      and    Kevin     Weeks   subsequently     began\n\ntestifying as to Bulger and Flemmi's role in the murders.\n\n                                           C.\n\n            The majority raises a host of arguments to rebut this\n\nconclusion.        First, the majority points to Patterson v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202269\"><a href=\"/opinion/202269/deegan-patterson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2006), and claims that the Donahue\n\nand Halloran families \"lack even the evanescent firmness of a\n\nwrongful conviction.\" Maj. Op. at 31.                   Respectfully, this is a\n\nmisreading of Patterson.        In Patterson, we rejected a plaintiff's\n\nargument that her FTCA claim only accrued when she was informed by\n\nher sister, in the summer of 2002, that the FBI was aware of plans\n\nto murder her father, failed to take any actions to prevent it, and\n\neven allowed two innocent men to be convicted for the crime.\n\nPatterson, 451 F.3d at 269-70.             But, pace the majority, Patterson\n\ndoes not stand for the proposition that a settled and justified\n\nbelief in someone else's guilt can have no relevance to the accrual\n\nof an FTCA claim.          Patterson did not address that issue at all.\n\nGiven the newly discovered evidence that emerged in that case, the\n\nplaintiffs    were    on    notice    that      the   original    defendants    were\n\nfactually innocent, and that someone else had committed the murder\n\n(as   it   turns    out,   Flemmi's    brother        Vincent).     See   generally\n\nCommonwealth v. Peter J. Limone, 2001 Mass. Super. LEXIS 7 (Mass.\n\n\n                                       -48-\n\fSuper. Ct. Jan. 8, 2001).   In contrast, the Donahues and Hallorans\n\nknew only that a jury had not been confident in Flynn's guilt beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.    This is a far cry from being told that Flynn\n\nwas innocent, and that someone else, perhaps with the tacit approval\n\nof the FBI, had committed the murders.\n\n            Moreover, the effect of the wrongful convictions on the\n\naccrual of the plaintiffs' FTCA        claim played no role in the\n\nPatterson court's reasoning, for good reason.     The Massachusetts\n\nSuperior Court vacated the wrongful convictions on January 8 and 18,\n\n2001.     However, the plaintiffs did not file their claims until\n\nJanuary 27, 2003, more than two years later, and so no claim of\n\nreasonable reliance on the Limone and Salvati convictions was in the\n\noffing.    See Patterson, 451 F.3d at 269.   Instead, the plaintiffs\n\nraised arguments of lack of notice and medical disability.      And,\n\nalthough the court rejected those arguments, pointing inter alia to\n\nthe December 2000 publicity surrounding the news of the FBI's\n\ncorrupt role in the murder and wrongful convictions, it made clear\n\nthat what was \"most important[]\" to its analysis was the fact that\n\none of the plaintiffs had himself been interviewed about these\n\ndevelopments in December 2000, and therefore clearly knew of and,\n\napparently, was \"troubled by,\" the allegations.   Id. at 273.   This,\n\nof course, was enough to start the FTCA clock ticking.    Cf. Merck\n\n& Co., Inc. v. Reynolds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78784\"><a href=\"/opinion/78784/merck-co-v-reynolds/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1789-90 (2010) (holding\n\nthat a cause of action accrues \"when the plaintiff did in fact\n\n\n                                -49-\n\fdiscover,\" or \"when a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\n\ndiscovered, 'the facts constituting the violation' -- whichever\n\ncomes first.\" (emphasis added)).\n\n           Second, the majority also seeks to discredit the district\n\ncourt's emphasis on the lengthy period of time between the murders\n\nand the revelations of FBI corruption.         The majority does so by\n\nrelying on McIntyre, Maj. Op. at 29, for the proposition that the\n\nextensive interval between the murders and the Salemme revelations\n\nhas no bearing on the reasonableness of attributing knowledge of the\n\nlatter to the plaintiffs.       McIntyre involved, in pertinent part,\n\nclaims arising out of the murder of Roger Wheeler in 1981.            The\n\ncourt rejected the Wheeler estate's claims as untimely, reasoning\n\nthat the widespread publicity from the Salemme hearings put the\n\nWheelers   on   notice   of   their   claims   against   the   government.\n\nMcIntyre, 367 F.3d at 58-59.     But, again, the majority ignores the\n\nfact that the Donahue and Halloran families are differently situated\n\nfrom the Wheelers in one absolutely central respect.           Unlike the\n\nWheelers, the Donahue and Halloran families had been told that the\n\nmurderer had been identified, and by bringing Flynn to trial, the\n\ngovernment represented that they were confident -- indeed, confident\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt -- in his guilt.           At no point after\n\nFlynn's acquittal did the government give the plaintiffs cause to\n\nthink otherwise.    According to Donahue's widow, \"every time [she]\n\nasked the FBI for information regarding [her] husband's murder,\n\n\n                                  -50-\n\f[she] was told that the FBI had none.\" (Emphasis added).            (Not\n\ncontent with mere stonewalling, at one point FBI agents accused her\n\nof having an affair, which the agents suggested was the cause of the\n\nmurder).   The Wheelers had no officially sanctioned culprit on whom\n\nto pin responsibility for their injury.       The Halloran and Donahues\n\ndid.   This fact changes the significance of the many intervening\n\nyears -- from years spent seeking unforthcoming answers to an\n\nunsolved riddle, to years in which an officially sanctioned belief\n\nhardens into taken-for-granted fact.\n\n           Third,    under   the   rubric    of   \"generally   available\n\ninformation,\" the majority points to John Morris' testimony during\n\nthe Salemme hearings, as well as the ensuing media publicity.       See\n\nMaj. Op. at 25-28.    However, Morris's revelation on April 22, 1998\n\nthat Connolly had leaked news of Halloran's cooperation to Bulger\n\ndid not call into question the reasonableness of the families'\n\nbelief that Flynn was the killer.         Morris's testimony provided a\n\npreviously undisclosed motive for Bulger to kill Halloran, but\n\nothers, including Flynn, shared a similar motive. Cf. McIntyre, 367\n\nF.3d at 56 (\"One could not reasonably infer, for purposes of FTCA\n\naccrual, from Morris's testimony about Halloran that the FBI told\n\nBulger and Flemmi about every informant in their organization or\n\nthat Bulger and Flemmi killed every person that they knew to be\n\ninforming against them, regardless of the circumstances.\").       Where\n\nBulger was but one of a number of individuals with a motive to kill\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\fHalloran,    where       Halloran       identified      one       of    those   non-Bulger\n\nindividuals    in    a    dying       declaration,      and       where   the   government\n\ninsisted on the same at trial, the bruiting about in the papers of\n\na possible Bulger-FBI-Halloran connection, some sixteen years after\n\nthe fact, cannot be deemed sufficient to set the limitations clock\n\nticking.\n\n            The majority notes that \"one need not have irrefutable\n\nproof\" that an injury was caused by the government in order to file\n\nan administrative claim under the FTCA.                       Maj. Op. at 29 (citing\n\nSkwira).     That much is true.            But that is not yet to say quite\n\nenough. The Donahues and Hallorans had every reason to believe, and\n\nhad in fact believed for sixteen years, that someone other than\n\nBulger had committed the murder.                The government insisted as much\n\nby bringing Flynn to trial and subsequently took no steps to\n\ndisabuse the plaintiffs of this belief, even though the facts\n\nshowing its falsity were locked away in the brains of recalcitrant\n\ngovernment agents.        So although the level of proof necessary for an\n\ninjured    party    to    file    a    claim    under       the    FTCA   is    surely     not\n\n\"irrefutable,\"      given    the       situation       in   which       the   Donahues     and\n\nHallorans found themselves, it was nevertheless substantial, and it\n\nwas certainly more substantial than in cases where \"overwhelmingly,\n\nthe most likely malefactor was one of a very limited group of\n\ngovernment    employees,\"         and    involved       \"the      same    small     cast   of\n\ncharacters,\"       McIntyre,      367    F.3d     at   53.         It   makes   a   crucial\n\n\n                                           -52-\n\fdifference to our FTCA analysis, in other words, that the plaintiffs\n\nhad a \"plausible explanation for death\" that does not provide a\n\nbasis \"for supposing [government] misconduct.\" Cascone, 370 F.3d at\n\n105 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n                                     II.\n\n             The majority rejects the plaintiffs' claim of fraudulent\n\nconcealment as well, on grounds that the plaintiffs \"failed to\n\nexercise due diligence in investigating the possibility of a claim.\"\n\nMaj. Op. at 34.      The gist of the majority's argument here is that,\n\neven though the Halloran and Donahue estates did not actually know\n\nabout the media reports about the FBI-Bulger link, they should have,\n\nand they should therefore also have conducted further inquiry into\n\nthe matter, a duty imposed purely by the fictional knowledge of\n\nnewspaper articles that the court attributes to them -- and even\n\nthough had they actually conducted such an inquiry, the only\n\ndirection it would have led them is down the garden path.\n\n             I first note that the majority's reasoning under this\n\nheading   depends    crucially   upon    its   central    holding,    that   the\n\nHalloran and Donahue estates may be attributed with knowledge of the\n\nmedia reports of an FBI-Bulger link to the murders. This is because\n\nit is only if the presumption of such knowledge is reasonable that\n\nit   makes   sense   to   describe   a     failure   to   institute    further\n\ninvestigations as some kind of shirking of an epistemic duty.                If,\n\nas I have argued, the Halloran and Donahue estates have a perfectly\n\n\n                                     -53-\n\freasonable explanation for their ignorance -- clothed in the figure\n\nof one Jimmy Flynn -- then there is no duty of further investigation\n\nthere to be shirked.9\n\n              Secondly, it is clear that any efforts by the Halloran and\n\nDonahue estates to further corroborate the media reports of a FBI-\n\nBulger    link   to    the   murders   would     have    been    pointless.    The\n\ngovernment was at this point pursuing a strategy of dissimulation,\n\ndenial and stonewalling.           Judge Wolf noted in his Salemme opinion\n\nthat government intransigence during the hearings meant that it\n\nremained unclear whether Flemmi and Bulger played any role in\n\nHalloran's murder.           Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 212-13.                The\n\ngovernment withheld key documents from the defense relating to\n\nHalloran's murder, in violation of discovery obligations, until\n\nafter Morris had testified, thus preventing cross-examination of\n\nMorris as to their content.            See United States v. Flemmi, 195 F.\n\nSupp.    2d   243,    249-50   &   n.39    (D.   Mass.   2001)    (detailing   FBI\n\n\n     9\n      I note that even if our cases require attributing knowledge\nof widely disseminated media reports, this is because this is \"the\nonly practicable course,\" given the function of a statute of\nlimitations as a \"rule of repose.\" Rakes, 442 F.3d at 20. It is\nnot because it is somehow objectively unreasonable for people in\nthe plaintiffs' position -- whose husbands and fathers had been\nbrutally murdered, and who were left to raise small children on\ntheir own -- to refuse to re-open an inquiry long thought closed.\nRe-opening such an inquiry would carry significant psychic costs,\nand we need not go so far as to imply that refusing to bear those\ncosts is somehow per se unreasonable, even if we must, for other\nreasons, nevertheless attribute the corresponding knowledge. The\nsuggestion that this case may be decided under the rubric of the\nplaintiffs' unreasonable shirking of epistemic duties is simply to\nadd insult to injury.\n\n                                          -54-\n\fmisconduct during the Salemme hearings).      Indeed, not only did the\n\ngovernment fail to produce the FBI reports containing Halloran's\n\nallegations against Bulger and Flemmi during the Salemme hearings,\n\nthey insisted during the discovery phase of this case that it was\n\n\"not known how Bulger and Flemmi obtained information that Halloran\n\nwas providing information to the FBI,\" and noted that there were\n\nother reasons why members of Winter Hill, and its hangers-on, might\n\nhave   wanted   Halloran   dead.    This   disingenuous   profession   of\n\nignorance was made in 2005 -- years after the publication of Salemme\n\nand Martorano and Weeks' confirmations of the FBI's complicity in\n\nthe murders.

Our cases on this topic\n\nexhibit an arguably gratuitous hostility to FTCA claimants.            See\n\nSkwira, 344 F.3d at 69 (holding that a plaintiff's wrongful death\n\nclaim was untimely, even though at the date we held their claim to\n\n\n                                   -55-\n\fhave accrued, the plaintiffs could not possibly have discovered that\n\nthe decedent had been poisoned as there were no known scientific\n\nmethods for testing for the drug used, and, moreover, the plaintiffs\n\nwere regularly told by a government employee that autopsy results\n\nwere consistent with death by natural causes).           This hostility is\n\nparticularly indefensible given that the heightened pleading burden\n\nplaintiffs bear under Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1949-50\n\n(2009), means that plaintiffs who are unable to corroborate their\n\nclaims are likely to find themselves on the receiving end of a\n\nmotion to dismiss.    The majority suggests that FTCA plaintiffs may\n\nfile a claim with insufficient corroborative evidence and then\n\nrequest the agency to hold the claim           in    abeyance as further\n\ninvestigation proceeds.      Maj. Op. at 30, citing Skwira, 344 F.3d at\n\n81-82 n.17.   The statutory text neither imposes such a duty on FTCA\n\nplaintiffs, nor requires agencies to agree to such requests.              See\n\n28 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2671-80.    It is unclear that this paragon of lawyerly\n\nprocedure -- sue now, ask questions later -- would occur to any but\n\nthe most litigiously-minded or chronically risk-averse layman.\n\nMoreover,   by   requiring   premature    filing    of   FTCA   claims,   the\n\nmajority's position may well require lawyers to act in contravention\n\nof both the pleading standards established by the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure and their ethical obligations.10\n\n\n     10\n      Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 11(b) provides that \"[b]y presenting to\nthe court a pleading, written motion, or other paper . . . an\nattorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the\n\n                                   -56-\n\f          Despite our warning in Cascone that our FTCA jurisprudence\n\nshould not \"reward or encourage simple paranoia\" among plaintiffs,\n\nour cases may give the impression of counseling precisely this --\n\nnamely, that injured parties should bring their claims as soon as\n\nthey learn of uncorroborated speculation in the papers or even the\n\nmere \"rumor of a claim,\" for fear of later discovering their claims\n\nto be forever barred.     Because it in effect lowers the bar for\n\naccrual to a \"mere hunch, hint, suspicion, or rumor of a claim,\"\n\nMcIntyre, 367 F.3d at 52, today's decision is another step down this\n\nparanoia-inducing road.   Our cases, stingy as they already are, do\n\nnot require this result, nor should rex non potest peccare,11 when\n\napplied in the twenty-first century, allow for such an unjust\n\noutcome which rewards official uncontrolled wickedness.   I dissent.\n\n\n\n\nperson's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an\ninquiry reasonable under the circumstances: . . . (3) the factual\ncontentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so\nidentified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable\nopportunity for further investigation and discovery.\" ABA Model\nRules of Professional Conduct Rule 3.1 provides that \"[a] lawyer\nshall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or controvert an\nissue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so\nthat is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an\nextension, modification or reversal of existing law.\"\n     11\n      \"The King can do no wrong.\"      See William Blackstone, I\nCommentaries *237.\n\n                               -57-\n\f</pre>",
