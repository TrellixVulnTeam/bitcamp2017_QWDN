Apfel, with whom Gina M. Atwood and Goodwin\nProcter LLP were on brief, for petitioner.\n          David M. McConnell, with whom Michael J. Sullivan, United\nStates Attorney, and Michael Sady, Assistant United States\nAttorney, were on brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                          April 27, 2006\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge. On February 27, 2002, the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) ordered that Andley Bobby Boakai, a\n\nnative and citizen of Liberia, be removed from this country because\n\nhe had not met his burden to show he was eligible for relief under\n\nthe Convention Against Torture (CAT).     More than a year later,\n\nBoakai filed with the BIA an untimely motion to reopen his case on\n\nthe ground that he had been provided ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.   The BIA rejected the motion to reopen as untimely filed\n\nwithout reaching the merits of the ineffective assistance claim.\n\nBoakai now seeks review of the BIA's orders denying CAT relief and\n\nreopening.   He argues that we must order the BIA to consider the\n\nmotion to reopen on the merits, and that this consideration will\n\ncompel a finding of ineffective assistance, in turn requiring the\n\nBIA to reopen the case and perhaps ultimately to grant him CAT\n\nrelief.\n\n           Concluding that we lack jurisdiction to review any of the\n\nissues Boakai has presented, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           Boakai entered the United States on a visitor's visa in\n\n1990 and later was granted Temporary Protected Status, see 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1254a, because of unstable conditions in Liberia.    In May 1996,\n\nmore than a year after his Temporary Protected Status expired,\n\nBoakai was convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon\n\nand armed assault with intent to murder; he was sentenced to seven\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fto ten years' imprisonment.         Removal proceedings were commenced\n\nagainst him on the ground that he was an alien convicted of an\n\naggravated      felony.       See     id.      §   1101(a)(43)(F);   id.\n\n§ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n\n             By virtue of his conviction and sentence, Boakai was\n\nstatutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.        See\n\nid. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (B)(i) (rendering aggravated felons\n\nineligible for asylum); id. § 1231(b)(3)(B) (rendering aggravated\n\nfelons sentenced to at least five years' imprisonment ineligible\n\nfor withholding of removal).     He conceded removability and applied\n\nonly for relief under the CAT.              After hearing testimony, an\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) concluded that Boakai had met his burden for\n\nCAT protection.\n\n             For reasons not relevant here, the BIA remanded the case\n\nto the IJ.    The IJ found for a second time that Boakai had met his\n\nburden for CAT protection, and the government appealed. Boakai had\n\nnotice of the government's appeal to the BIA and filed a pro se\n\nbrief.   His former counsel did not file a brief.\n\n             In the February 27, 2002 order, the BIA vacated the grant\n\nof CAT relief and ordered Boakai removed.            The BIA found that\n\nBoakai had failed to meet his burden under the CAT, in part because\n\nthe U.S. State Department's 1998 Country Profile for Liberia\n\n\"indicate[d] that supporters of and office holders in the former\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f[Liberian] regime can generally now return to Liberia without\n\nharm.\"\n\n              Boakai did not then file a petition in this court for\n\nreview of the February 27, 2002 BIA removal order.         Nor did he file\n\na motion to reopen with the BIA within the ninety days allowed.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2).         Rather, he filed a pro se habeas\n\ncorpus action in the district court; that court appointed present\n\ncounsel on October 8, 2002.\n\n              On April 16, 2003, more than six months after present\n\ncounsel's appointment and more than a year after the BIA removal\n\norder, Boakai, through counsel, filed a motion to reopen before the\n\nBIA.       The motion argued that the CAT issue should be reopened\n\nbecause Boakai had been deprived of effective assistance of counsel\n\nin that his attorney did not file a brief with the BIA seeking to\n\nuphold     the   IJ's   order.1   Boakai's   motion   to   reopen   did   not\n\nacknowledge that it was filed late, nor did it present any argument\n\nthat the lateness should be excused, thus likely waiving the\n\nargument before this court.        See Xu v. Gonzales, 424 F.3d 45, 48\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              In its August 8, 2003 order denying the motion to reopen,\n\nthe BIA noted that \"[t]he respondent does not even acknowledge that\n\nthe motion is untimely.\"          It nonetheless assumed, in Boakai's\n\n\n       1\n       The ineffective assistance claim, of course, was unrelated\nto the IJ proceedings; Boakai won there.    It was based only on\nfailure of counsel to defend that victory on appeal to the BIA.\n\n                                    -4-\n\ffavor, that he was relying on equitable tolling to excuse his\n\nmissing a filing deadline.   The BIA correctly noted that if the\n\nequitable tolling doctrine is available at all,2 the petitioner\n\nmust first show that he has acted with due diligence.   Jobe v. INS,\n\n238 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2001) (en banc).   The BIA held:\n\n          Such due diligence is not present here. The\n          respondent acknowledges that he received\n          notice of our earlier decision in March, 2002.\n          Current counsel was appointed to represent the\n          respondent in October, 2002.     However, the\n          pending motion was not filed until April,\n          2003.   There is no basis for abrogating the\n          motions deadline here. The pending motion is,\n          therefore, denied.\n\n(internal citations omitted).    The BIA thus never reached the\n\nmerits of the ineffective assistance of counsel issue.3\n\n\n     2\n       This court has not yet decided whether the BIA has the power\nto excuse late filing on the basis of equitable tolling. See Jobe\nv. INS, 238 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2001) (en banc); see also Chen\nv. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting the\nissue remains unresolved).\n     3\n       In his briefs to this court, but not to the BIA, Boakai\nattempts to justify the delay in part on the basis that it was\nnecessary in order to prepare and file an ineffective assistance\nclaim pursuant to In re Lozada, 19 I. & N. Dec. 637 (B.I.A. 1988).\nIt is noteworthy that courts have found that the BIA did not abuse\nits discretion in finding no due diligence in similar time frames.\nIn Galvez Piñeda v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 833 (10th Cir. 2005), for\nexample, new counsel filed a motion to reopen eight months after\ntaking over, and the BIA rejected an equitable tolling argument.\nId. at 839. Counsel argued on appeal that the delay was necessary\nto fulfill the Lozada requirements; the court rejected that\nargument, stating that \"90 days [after new counsel's appointment]\nwould have been more than adequate to comply\" with Lozada. Id.\nSee also Dodaj v. Ashcroft, 109 F. App'x 763, 766 (6th Cir. 2004)\n(unpublished opinion) (equitable tolling not warranted where new\ncounsel took five months to file motion to reopen because he was\ninvestigating ineffective assistance of counsel claim).\n\n                                -5-\n\f            In the wake of the BIA's decision on the motion to\n\nreopen, Boakai filed another habeas petition in the district court.\n\nThat petition was transferred to this court pursuant to the REAL ID\n\nAct of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, Div. B, § 106(c), 119 Stat. 231,\n\n311 (2005) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1252 note) (requiring district\n\ncourts to transfer existing 28 U.S.C. § 2241 habeas cases involving\n\nchallenges to \"final administrative order[s] of removal\" to the\n\ncourt of appeals, which is to \"treat the transferred case as if it\n\nhad been filed pursuant to a petition for review\").          In his briefs\n\nto   this   court,   Boakai   argued    that   the   purported   ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel requires that this court order the BIA to\n\nreopen proceedings; he also said the BIA abused its discretion when\n\nit failed to consider his untimely motion to reopen on the merits.\n\nBoakai focused on the latter claim at oral argument.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Petitioner's first obligation is to establish that this\n\ncourt has jurisdiction.       The court also must itself address the\n\nquestion of its own jurisdiction, even when petitioner fails to\n\naddress the point adequately.4     Global NAPs, Inc. v. Mass. Dep't of\n\nTelecomms. & Energy, 427 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n      4\n       Boakai's initial brief to this court ignored the obvious\njurisdictional difficulties present in his case, simply asserted\nthere was jurisdiction under the REAL ID Act, and then concentrated\non the merits of his unexhausted ineffective assistance claim.\nLittle is to be gained and much to be lost by a \"masquerade\nignor[ing] the central question\" in a case.              Shelby v.\nSuperformance Int'l, Inc., 435 F.3d 42, 43 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                       -6-\n\f          Under pre-REAL ID Act law, we lacked \"jurisdiction to\n\nreview any final order of removal against an alien who is removable\n\nby reason of having committed\" an aggravated felony.       8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(C) (2000).   Under that regime, we clearly would have\n\nlacked the power to review both the initial BIA order denying CAT\n\nrelief and the BIA's denial of the motion to reopen.5   The REAL ID\n\nAct altered the landscape, granting limited jurisdiction to courts\n\nof appeals over petitions for review from aggravated felons who\n\nhave been denied CAT relief.   Under the new provision, the courts\n\nof   appeals    have   jurisdiction    if   such   petitions   raise\n\n\"constitutional claims or questions of law.\"       See REAL ID Act\n\n§ 106(a)(1)(A)(iii), 119 Stat. at 310 (codified at 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(a)(2)(D)); see also Enwonwu v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 22, 33 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).    On these facts, however, that limited jurisdictional\n\ngrant does not help Boakai.\n\nA.        Review of Denial of Motion to Reopen\n\n          The narrow issue before us is whether, assuming arguendo\n\nthat equitable tolling is available, Boakai's challenge to the\n\nBIA's decision not to grant such tolling presents a \"question of\n\n\n     5\n       A denial of a motion to reopen is also a final order. See\nBaez v. INS, 41 F.3d 19, 21 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that the BIA's\ndenial of a motion to reopen a deportation proceeding is a\njudicially reviewable final order) (citing Giova v. Rosenberg, 379\nU.S. 18, 18 (1964) (per curiam)); see also Jupiter v. Ashcroft, 396\nF.3d 487, 488, 490-91 (1st Cir. 2005) (referring to the BIA's\ndenial of a motion to reopen as a \"final order\" and treating it as\nsuch for purposes of jurisdictional limitations imposed by 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1252).\n\n                                 -7-\n\flaw\" within the meaning of the REAL ID Act.            The answer is plainly\n\nno.       Boakai does not question the legal standard for equitable\n\ntolling.      The only issue he raises before us is one of fact.         See\n\nNiehoff v. Maynard, 299 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir. 2002) (holding that\n\nequitable tolling determinations involve a mixed question of law\n\nand fact, but that to the extent the district court's decision as\n\nto tolling \"hinges on factual determinations,\" appellate review\n\nproceeds as it would for a pure question of fact).            The BIA relied\n\non a factual determination that Boakai had not exercised due\n\ndiligence, and Boakai simply disagrees, arguing that he did in fact\n\nexercise due diligence.           We have no jurisdiction to review this\n\nsort of challenge to a denial of a motion to reopen.6\n\nB.            Review of Denial of CAT Claim\n\n              There   is   also    no   jurisdiction   to   review   Boakai's\n\nchallenge to the BIA's order denying relief under the CAT.            That is\n\nbecause Boakai's challenge to the denial of CAT relief rests wholly\n\non his ineffective assistance claim.           The ineffective assistance\n\nclaim, because it was not timely presented, was never ruled on by\n\nthe BIA, and so Boakai has not exhausted the issue.            Cf. Hernandez\n\nv. Reno, 238 F.3d 50, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2001).           Both before and after\n\nthe REAL ID Act, this court lacks jurisdiction over a claim if the\n\n\n      6\n       The government urges that we adopt a rule that no question\ncommitted to the BIA's discretion may ever constitute a \"question\nof law\" within the REAL ID Act. There is no need for such a broad\nruling. See Saint Fort v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 191, 201 (1st Cir.\n2003).\n\n                                        -8-\n\falien has not exhausted all administrative remedies as to that\n\nclaim.7     8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).       The Tenth Circuit, on nearly\n\nidentical facts, also held that there was no jurisdiction.         Galvez\n\nPiñeda v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 833, 837-38 (10th Cir. 2005) (refusing\n\nto consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim after an\n\nuntimely attempt to raise the issue with the BIA because \"untimely\n\nfilings with administrative agencies do not constitute exhaustion\n\nof administrative remedies\").\n\n            Because the ineffective assistance claim is not before\n\nus, as to the CAT issue we are presented with no \"constitutional\n\nclaim[].\"     8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).      At oral argument, Boakai\n\ncorrectly conceded this point.      Indeed, the very purpose of this\n\npetition is to force the BIA to address an ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel claim, which he says is of constitutional dimension, in\n\nthe hopes it will ultimately lead the BIA to reopen proceedings and\n\nsubsequently change its views on CAT relief.\n\n            Finally,   to   the   extent   Boakai     is   attempting   an\n\nindependent argument that the BIA was wrong in rejecting the CAT\n\nclaim, we see no question of law presented.         This case is not like\n\nEnwonwu, where a question of law was presented only because the\n\nBIA's order denying CAT relief was so insufficiently reasoned as to\n\n\n     7\n       In Hernandez, the court noted that where a petitioner fails\nto timely pursue administrative remedies, the defect might be\nbetter characterized as waiver or forfeiture, instead of failure to\nexhaust. 238 F.3d at 54. However it is characterized, the outcome\nis the same: the issue is not before us.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fleave us uncertain of its basis and so preclude meaningful judicial\n\nreview.   See 438 F.3d at 35.\n\n                                    III.\n\n           Lest   Boakai     draw   from   this   dismissal    for   lack    of\n\njurisdiction the erroneous conclusion that he is being removed\n\nbecause of the actions or inactions of his lawyers, we add these\n\ncomments. Boakai has received, at the least, zealous advocacy. If\n\nwe had jurisdiction to ask whether the BIA abused its discretion in\n\nnot reopening his case, the answer clearly would be no for a number\n\nof reasons. The ineffective assistance claim is itself dubious, at\n\nbest, and does not present a clear case of prejudice.8          See Zeng v.\n\nGonzales, 436 F.3d 26, 31 n.8 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"To prevail on the\n\nmerits of an ineffective assistance claim, an alien must show\n\nprejudice to his case . . . .\").      Further, the BIA decision denying\n\nCAT   relief   rested   on    the   administrative    record    before      it,\n\nregardless of whether it received a brief from counsel or the pro\n\nse brief Boakai filed.        We see nothing on the record that would\n\nhave compelled the BIA to conclude that Boakai had met his burden\n\n\n      8\n       For example, former counsel's position is that he was\ndischarged by Boakai and instructed not to file an appeal, and that\nwhen Boakai so instructed him, he went so far as to call Boakai's\nmother to explain why the decision to proceed pro se was\nunreasonable. This position is supported by the fact that when\nBoakai requested an extension of time to file a pro se brief with\nthe BIA, he made no mention of any abandonment by former counsel,\nnor did he ask for time to seek new counsel. Further, it was the\nlawyer, now said to be ineffective, who was successful before the\nIJ. Finally, Boakai did file a pro se brief before the BIA largely\nrepeating what his lawyer had said.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fon CAT relief.    That is especially so here where the BIA noted,\n\ninter   alia,   that   even   assuming    the   credibility   of   Boakai's\n\nwitnesses, changed country conditions in Liberia meant that it was\n\nunlikely Boakai would be subject to torture if he returned.\n\n           The Notice to Appear was issued to Boakai in November\n\n1997; it is now over eight years later, though the courts have\n\nmoved promptly.    The petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

Under that regime, we clearly would have lacked the power to review both the initial BIA order denying CAT relief and the BIA's denial of the motion to reopen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The REAL ID Act altered the landscape, granting limited jurisdiction to courts of appeals over petitions for review from aggravated felons who have been denied CAT relief. Under the new provision, the courts of appeals have jurisdiction if such petitions raise \"constitutional claims or questions of law.\" <i>See</i> REAL ID Act &#167; 106(a)(1)(A)(iii), 119 Stat. at 310 (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D)); <i>see also Enwonwu v. Gonzales,</i> 438 F.3d 22, 33 (1st Cir.2006). On these facts, however, that limited jurisdictional grant does not help Boakai.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Review of Denial of Motion to Reopen</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narrow issue before us is whether, assuming arguendo that equitable tolling is available, Boakai's challenge to the BIA's decision not to grant such tolling presents a \"question of law\" within the meaning of the REAL ID Act. The answer is plainly no. Boakai does not question the legal standard for equitable tolling. The only issue he raises before us is one of fact. <i>See Niehoff v. Maynard,</i> 299 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir.2002) (holding that equitable tolling determinations involve a mixed question of law and fact, but that to the extent the district court's decision as to tolling \"hinges on factual determinations,\" appellate review proceeds as it would for a pure question of fact). The BIA relied on a factual determination that Boakai had not exercised due diligence, and Boakai simply disagrees, arguing that he did in fact exercise due diligence. We have no jurisdiction to review this sort of challenge to a denial of a motion to reopen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Review of Denial of CAT Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also no jurisdiction to review Boakai's challenge to the BIA's order denying relief under the CAT. That is because Boakai's challenge to the denial of CAT relief rests wholly on his ineffective assistance claim. The ineffective assistance claim, because it was not timely presented, was never ruled on by the BIA, and so Boakai has not exhausted the issue. <i>Cf. Hernandez v. Reno,</i> 238 F.3d 50, 54-55 (1st Cir.2001). Both before and after the REAL ID Act, this court lacks jurisdiction over a claim if the alien has not exhausted all administrative remedies as to that claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(d)(1). The Tenth Circuit, on nearly identical facts, also held that there was no jurisdiction. <i>Galvez Pi&#241;eda v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 833, 837-38 (10th Cir.2005) (refusing to consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim after an untimely attempt to raise the issue with the BIA because \"untimely filings with administrative agencies do not constitute exhaustion of administrative remedies\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the ineffective assistance claim is not before us, as to the CAT issue we are presented with no \"constitutional claim[].\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D). At oral argument, Boakai correctly conceded this point. Indeed, the very purpose of this petition is to force the BIA to address an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which he says is of constitutional dimension, in the hopes it will ultimately lead the BIA to reopen proceedings and subsequently change its views on CAT relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, to the extent Boakai is attempting an independent argument that the BIA was wrong in rejecting the CAT claim, we see no question of law presented. This case is not like <i>Enwonwu,</i> where a question of law was presented only because the BIA's order denying CAT relief was so insufficiently reasoned as to leave us uncertain of its basis and so preclude meaningful judicial review. <i>See</i> 438 F.3d at 35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lest Boakai draw from this dismissal for lack of jurisdiction the erroneous conclusion that he is being removed because of the actions or inactions of his lawyers, we add these comments. Boakai has received, at the least, zealous advocacy. If we had jurisdiction to ask whether the BIA abused its discretion in not reopening his case, the answer clearly would be no for a number of reasons. The ineffective assistance claim is itself dubious, at best, and does not present a clear case of prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See Zeng v. Gonzales,</i> 436 F.3d 26, 31 n. 8 (1st Cir.2006) (\"To prevail on the merits of an ineffective assistance claim, an alien must show prejudice to his case. . . .\"). Further, the BIA decision denying CAT relief rested on the administrative record before it, regardless of whether it received a brief from counsel or the pro se brief Boakai filed. We see nothing on the record that would have <i>compelled</i> the BIA to conclude that Boakai had met his burden on CAT relief. That is especially so here where the BIA noted, inter alia, that even assuming the credibility of Boakai's witnesses, changed country conditions in Liberia meant that it was unlikely Boakai would be subject to torture if he returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Notice to Appear was issued to Boakai in November 1997; it is now over eight years later, though the courts have moved promptly.

The BIA rejected the motion to reopen as untimely filed without reaching the merits of the ineffective assistance claim. Boakai now seeks review of the BIA's orders denying CAT relief and reopening.

Under that regime, we clearly would have lacked the power to review both the initial BIA order denying CAT relief and the BIA's denial of the motion to reopen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The REAL ID Act altered the landscape, granting limited jurisdiction to courts of appeals over petitions for review from aggravated felons who have been denied CAT relief. Under the new provision, the courts of appeals have jurisdiction if such petitions raise \"constitutional claims or questions of law.\" <i>See</i> REAL ID Act &#167; 106(a)(1)(A)(iii), 119 Stat. at 310 (codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D)); <i>see also Enwonwu v.

On these facts, however, that limited jurisdictional grant does not help Boakai.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Review of Denial of Motion to Reopen</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narrow issue before us is whether, assuming arguendo that equitable tolling is available, Boakai's challenge to the BIA's decision not to grant such tolling presents a \"question of law\" within the meaning of the REAL ID Act. The answer is plainly no. Boakai does not question the legal standard for equitable tolling. The only issue he raises before us is one of fact. <i>See Niehoff v. Maynard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200071\"><a href=\"/opinion/200071/niehoff-v-maynard/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2002) (holding that equitable tolling determinations involve a mixed question of law and fact, but that to the extent the district court's decision as to tolling \"hinges on factual determinations,\" appellate review proceeds as it would for a pure question of fact). The BIA relied on a factual determination that Boakai had not exercised due diligence, and Boakai simply disagrees, arguing that he did in fact exercise due diligence. We have no jurisdiction to review this sort of challenge to a denial of a motion to reopen.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Review of Denial of CAT Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also no jurisdiction to review Boakai's challenge to the BIA's order denying relief under the CAT. That is because Boakai's challenge to the denial of CAT relief rests wholly on his ineffective assistance claim. The ineffective assistance claim, because it was not timely presented, was never ruled on by the BIA, and so Boakai has not exhausted the issue. <i>Cf. Hernandez v. Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199250\"><a href=\"/opinion/199250/hernandez-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 54-55 (1st Cir.2001). Both before and after the REAL ID Act, this court lacks jurisdiction over a claim if the alien has not exhausted all administrative remedies as to that claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(d)(1). The Tenth Circuit, on nearly identical facts, also held that there was no jurisdiction. <i>Galvez Pi&#241;eda v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792316\"><a href=\"/opinion/792316/luis-galvez-pineda-jr-maria-evelyn-roque-pineda-johanna-roque-pineda/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, 837-38 (10th Cir.2005) (refusing to consider an ineffective assistance of counsel claim after an untimely attempt to raise the issue with the BIA because \"untimely filings with administrative agencies do not constitute exhaustion of administrative remedies\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the ineffective assistance claim is not before us, as to the CAT issue we are presented with no \"constitutional claim[].\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D). At oral argument, Boakai correctly conceded this point. Indeed, the very purpose of this petition is to force the BIA to address an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which he says is of constitutional dimension, in the hopes it will ultimately lead the BIA to reopen proceedings and subsequently change its views on CAT relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, to the extent Boakai is attempting an independent argument that the BIA was wrong in rejecting the CAT claim, we see no question of law presented. This case is not like <i>Enwonwu,</i> where a question of law was presented only because the BIA's order denying CAT relief was so insufficiently reasoned as to leave us uncertain of its basis and so preclude meaningful judicial review. <i>See</i> 438 F.3d at 35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lest Boakai draw from this dismissal for lack of jurisdiction the erroneous conclusion that he is being removed because of the actions or inactions of his lawyers, we add these comments. Boakai has received, at the least, zealous advocacy. If we had jurisdiction to ask whether the BIA abused its discretion in not reopening his case, the answer clearly would be no for a number of reasons. The ineffective assistance claim is itself dubious, at best, and does not present a clear case of prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See Zeng v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793127\"><a href=\"/opinion/793127/jin-dong-zeng-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 31 n. 8 (1st Cir.2006) (\"To prevail on the merits of an ineffective assistance claim, an alien must show prejudice to his case. . . .\"). Further, the BIA decision denying CAT relief rested on the administrative record before it, regardless of whether it received a brief from counsel or the pro se brief Boakai filed. We see nothing on the record that would have <i>compelled</i> the BIA to conclude that Boakai had met his burden on CAT relief. That is especially so here where the BIA noted, inter alia, that even assuming the credibility of Boakai's witnesses, changed country conditions in Liberia meant that it was unlikely Boakai would be subject to torture if he returned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Notice to Appear was issued to Boakai in November 1997; it is now over eight years later, though the courts have moved promptly.
