Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Samuel Jones on brief pro se.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and               Anita\nJohnson, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           September 15, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam.       This is an appeal from the district\n\ncourt's decision affirming a decision by an administrative law\n\njudge (\"ALJ\") in a disability insurance benefits case.              The ALJ\n\ndenied this pro se appellant's request for a waiver of recovery\n\nof an overpayment of benefits.             He also concluded that the\n\nCommissioner    of   Social     Security   had    properly     recouped    the\n\noverpayment    by    reducing    a   subsequent   award   of    retroactive\n\nbenefits.   We evaluate whether there is substantial evidence to\n\nsupport the ALJ's fact findings and whether appropriate legal\n\nstandards were employed.        Nguyen v. Chater, 172 F.3d 31, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n            After careful review of the record, we conclude that\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the ALJ's finding that Jones was\n\nnot entitled to a waiver of recovery of the overpayment because\n\nhe was not \"without fault\" regarding the overpayment.                     At a\n\nhearing, Jones admitted that, during the pertinent time period,\n\nhe knew that the agency was erroneously paying him disability\n\nbenefits that were no longer due.           Thus, he was not \"without\n\nfault,\" and the denial of his waiver request was proper.             20 CFR\n\n§ 404.507 (indicating that an overpaid individual is at fault if\n\nhe accepts \"a payment which he either knew or could have been\n\nexpected to know was incorrect\"); see 42 U.S.C. § 404(b) (only\n\nbarring any \"adjustment\" in payments to, or \"recovery\" from,\n\npersons \"without fault\").\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            Regarding the offset, Jones does not object to the\n\nALJ's determination that the agency properly used its netting\n\nregulation,      20   CFR   §   404.504,    as   explained   in     Sullivan    v.\n\nEverhart, 494 U.S. 83, 87, 93-94 (1990).                Hence, we need not\n\nconsider that question. Instead, he challenges the offset on the\n\nground    that    the   agency     waived    its   right     to    recover     the\n\noverpayment, citing language in a November 1992 notice it sent\n\nhim.      He also asserts that he was denied a pre-recoupment\n\n\"personal conference.\"          See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682,\n\n697 (1979).\n\n            The waiver claim is meritless because the agency's\n\nNovember 1992 notice contained no explicit or actual waiver of\n\nrights.    The agency stated only that \"no action will be taken to\n\nrecover the overpayment\" until Jones' request for a waiver of\n\nrecovery had been decided. As it turned out, the agency recouped\n\nthe overpayment by offsetting it against the award of retroactive\n\nbenefits before it denied Jones' waiver request.                  Its failure to\n\nhold off on recovery, as it advised Jones it would, was seemingly\n\ninadvertent, as it apparently had lost track of his waiver\n\nrequest until he mentioned it after the offset was made.                       The\n\nrecord does not support a finding of any intentional waiver of\n\nrights.\n\n            It is true that Jones did not get a hearing before the\n\nagency recouped the overpayment.            But a hearing was due only if\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe     recoupment     was    an     \"adjustment\"    under   42        U.S.C.     §\n\n404(a)(1)(A), a question that Jones does not address. Even if an\n\nadjustment occurred here (and not netting, as to which no hearing\n\nis required), the inadvertent error was entirely harmless and\n\nwould not affect the outcome on appeal.              Kerner v. Celebrezze,\n\n340 F.2d 736, 740 (2d Cir. 1965) (declining to reverse denial of\n\ndisability benefits where the challenged procedural irregularity\n\nwas harmless error).         We explain briefly.\n\n            The     record   shows    that   Jones   received     an    entirely\n\nadequate post-recoupment hearing at which he testified.                  His own\n\nadmissions at the hearing confirmed that he did not qualify for\n\na waiver of the recovery.          Substantively, therefore, his waiver\n\nrequest was meritless (and a pre-recoupment hearing, had one been\n\nheld, would have established the same point).                The agency was\n\nplainly entitled to recoup the overpayment, and there is no basis\n\nfor the remedial action Jones now seeks (return of the withheld\n\nretroactive benefits).         See Mercer v. Birchman, 700 F.2d 828,\n\n832-33 (2d Cir. 1983) (rejecting a challenge to the agency's\n\nfailure to follow its customary procedures where the deviation\n\nwas aberrant and the agency had corrected the problem during\n\nsubsequent administrative proceedings); Crites v. Weinberger, 364\n\nF. Supp. 956, 958 (N.D. Tex. 1973) (concluding that it would be\n\n\"ludicrous\" to reinstate terminated benefits just so the agency\n\ncould    hold   a    pre-termination      hearing    as   required       by     new\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fregulations where the plaintiff had already received an adequate\n\npost-termination hearing).\n\n          Jones' remaining appellate claims are unavailing and\n\nrequire no further discussion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
