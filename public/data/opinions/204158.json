George A. O'Toole, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Alan D. Rose, with whom Rose, Chinitz & Rose, was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Kelly Begg Lawrence, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael K. Loucks, Acting United States Attorney, were on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         January 29, 2010\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.               Defendant-Appellant Julio\n\nCartagena (\"Cartagena\") pled guilty to participation in a drug-\n\ntrafficking conspiracy involving the importation and distribution\n\nof heroin and cocaine along the east coast, including the Greater\n\nBoston area.        Cartagena appeals the district court's denial of\n\nthree    motions      concerning      his   suspected        involvement      in    the\n\nconspiracy.         First, Cartagena challenges the district court's\n\ndenial of a motion to suppress evidence obtained from state and\n\nfederal wiretaps, arguing that the affidavits submitted in support\n\nof the wiretap applications omitted material information and that\n\nhad this information been included, the wiretap applications would\n\nhave failed to satisfy the \"necessity requirement\" of both 18\n\nU.S.C.   §   2518(1)(c)       and    N.Y.   Crim.    Proc.    Law     §§    700.15(4),\n\n700.20(2)(d).       Second, Cartagena appeals the denial of his request\n\nfor a hearing under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978).\n\nThird, Cartagena challenges the denial of his motion to compel the\n\nproduction of documents relevant to the motion to suppress, as well\n\nas the denial of his motion for an in camera inspection of the\n\ngovernment agents' handwritten notes.               After careful consideration\n\nof Cartagena's challenges, we affirm in all respects.\n\n                                    I. Background\n\n             A. Facts\n\n             This    appeal    concerns     information      obtained       from   drug\n\ntrafficking     investigations          conducted       by     Drug        Enforcement\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fAdministration (DEA) agents operating in Boston, New York, and in\n\nBogotá, Colombia, in collaboration with the Colombian National\n\nPolice (CNP). The DEA focused its investigation on two individuals\n\noperating on the east coast, Luis López (\"López\") in New York and\n\nCartagena in Boston.        Special Agent Sean Canavan (\"Canavan\") was\n\nresponsible for the investigation of López, and Special Agent Jean\n\nDrouin    (\"Drouin\")    was      responsible          for    the   investigation          of\n\nCartagena.\n\n              Canavan's New York investigation centered on information\n\nregarding López and his role in the distribution of the imported\n\nheroin to wholesalers on the eastern seaboard, including Boston.\n\nThe   DEA's    investigation        of    López      in   New    York    was      based   on\n\ninformation     provided    by      a    confidential        informant,      Pablo       Báez\n\n(\"Báez\").      Báez worked with the DEA as a paid informant several\n\nyears earlier and had re-initiated contact with the DEA in December\n\n2004, providing information concerning drug trafficking activity in\n\nNew York.\n\n              In mid-May 2005, Báez began providing information about\n\nLópez's   activities.         The       DEA    registered       Báez    as   an   official\n\n\"confidential     source\"     on        June    8,   2005.       Báez    signed      a    DEA\n\nConfidential Source Agreement (CSA) that authorized him to engage\n\nin certain activities as an informant.                    On June 20, 2005, the New\n\nYork DEA, relying in part on information that Báez provided,\n\napplied for a warrant, pursuant to the New York state wiretap\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\fstatute, authorizing a wiretap on López's cellular telephone.                The\n\nwarrant was issued for a period of thirty days, commencing on\n\nJune 22, 2005.     The DEA discontinued the wiretap on July 11, 2005\n\nbecause it appeared that López was using a different phone to\n\nconduct his drug-related conversations.\n\n           Báez continued to provide the DEA with information and\n\nsurveillance opportunities until October 11, 2005.            After that, he\n\nceased contact with the DEA.              On November 16, 2005, Canavan\n\nformally deactivated Báez as a confidential source.\n\n           While the New York DEA investigated López, Drouin and the\n\nBoston DEA conducted their separate investigation of Cartagena,\n\nwhom   agents   believed    to   be   a   cocaine   and   heroin    dealer    in\n\nMassachusetts.     During the course of the investigation, agents\n\nsuspected López of being Cartagena's primary heroin supplier.\n\nRelying   in    part   on   information     obtained   from   the    New   York\n\ninvestigation of López, Drouin applied for electronic surveillance\n\non Cartagena's cellular telephone pursuant to Title III of the\n\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.1               The wiretap\n\n\n1\n  Congress enacted Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe\nStreets Act of 1968 with the stated purpose of \"(1) protecting the\nprivacy of wire and oral communications, and (2) delineating on a\nuniform basis the circumstances and conditions under which the\ninterception of wire and oral communications may be authorized.\"\nGelbard v. United States, 408 U.S. 41, 48 (1972)(quoting S. Rep.\nNo. 90-1097, at 66 (1968), as reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n2153)(internal quotation marks omitted). Title III makes the use of\nwiretapping or electronic surveillance by law enforcement \"an\nextraordinary investigative technique whose use 'is to be\ndistinctly the exception - not the rule.'\" United States v. López,\n\n                                      -4-\n\forder named Cartagena, López, and several of their associates as\n\ntargets.     The warrant for Cartagena's phone was issued for the\n\nperiod of September 29, 2005 to October 14, 2005.                   The only\n\nsubstantive    information    included    in   the   application    that   was\n\nderived from Báez's cooperation concerned López's role in the\n\nconspiracy.    As of the application date, Báez had not provided the\n\nDEA with any information that specifically concerned Cartagena.\n\nThe district court subsequently granted a wiretap for another phone\n\nused by Cartagena and also granted wiretaps for phones used by\n\nLópez.\n\n           B. Proceedings Below\n\n           Based on information obtained from the investigation, a\n\ngrand jury indicted Cartagena and eighteen other co-conspirators on\n\nNovember 13, 2006.       Cartagena was charged with conspiracy to\n\ndistribute    heroin   and   cocaine,    maintaining    a   place   for    drug\n\npurposes, and money laundering in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 856(a)(1), and 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), respectively.                  On\n\nAugust 30, 2006, Cartagena's co-defendant, the former informant\n\nBáez, filed a motion to suppress evidence gathered from New York\n\nand federal wiretaps, arguing that the wiretap affidavit was\n\ntainted by false and misleading statements and material omissions,\n\n\n300 F.3d   46, 51 (1st Cir. 2002)(quoting United States v. Hoffman,\n832 F.2d    1299, 1306 (1st Cir. 1987)).   Thus, a law enforcement\nofficial    seeking to use electronic surveillance must meet the\nspecific    requirements of Title III's comprehensive regulatory\nscheme.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fand that the Government failed to meet the \"necessity requirement\"\n\nof   the    state   and   federal   statutes   because   less    intrusive\n\ninvestigatory techniques were available.        18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c);\n\nN.Y. Crim. Proc. Law §§ 700.15(4), 700.20(2)(d).         Báez also moved\n\nfor an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S.\n\n154 (1978), to evaluate the alleged material omissions and false\n\nstatements in the federal and state wiretaps.             Cartagena and\n\nseveral other defendants joined Báez's motions.\n\n             The district court denied the motion to suppress as to\n\nboth the state and federal wiretaps.           Regarding the New York\n\nwiretap, the district court deemed the motion moot because the\n\nGovernment stated it would not offer evidence obtained from the New\n\nYork wiretap, and further, no information obtained from that\n\nwiretap had been used in the federal wiretap application.          United\n\nStates v. López, No. 05-10304-GAO, 2007 WL 4556904, at *2 (D. Mass.\n\nDecember 12, 2007).       Turning to the federal wiretap, the district\n\ncourt found that the facts set forth were \"minimally adequate\" to\n\nsupport a necessity determination and that the wiretap applications\n\nmet the statutory requirements of § 2518(c).        Id. at *6.\n\n             The district court briefly addressed the request for a\n\nFranks hearing, finding that there had not been a substantial\n\npreliminary showing that the affidavit omitted material facts\n\nknowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the\n\ntruth.     Id.   Additionally, because none of the omitted facts would\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fhave been material to a probable cause finding, the district court\n\ndenied the request for a Franks hearing.               Id.\n\n            Separate from, but related to, the suppression and Franks\n\nmotions, Cartagena moved to compel the production of documents\n\nrelevant to his motions to suppress on November 16, 2006.                      The\n\nmagistrate judge denied the motion holding that, because Cartagena\n\nhad not presented any evidence supporting his claim that material\n\nfacts were omitted concerning other informants' activities or the\n\nscope of the information they could provide, the government was\n\npermitted    to   withhold      the   documents   in    order   to   shield    the\n\nidentities of its confidential informants.               Cartagena objected to\n\nthe magistrate judge's ruling.            The district court affirmed the\n\nmagistrate judge's denial of the motion.\n\n            On August 8, 2007, Cartagena filed another discovery\n\nmotion for in camera inspection of handwritten notes of the Special\n\nAgents who prepared the Title III and New York wiretap affidavits.\n\nThe district court denied the motion on December 12, 2007, holding\n\nthat Cartagena's request for in camera review was not sufficiently\n\nparticularized and focused.           Following the denial of his motions,\n\nCartagena entered a conditional plea of guilty, reserving his right\n\nto appeal the denial of the motions to suppress, for a Franks\n\nhearing,    and   to   compel    discovery.       The    district    court    then\n\nsentenced Cartagena to three consecutive 150 month terms.                     This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f                                      II. Discussion\n\n              A. Motion to Suppress Wiretaps\n\n                         1. Title III Wiretap\n\n              Cartagena challenges the sufficiency of the government's\n\nshowing of necessity pursuant to § 2518(1)(c) of Title III of the\n\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2518.      Section 2518(1)(c) sets forth the necessity requirement.\n\nIt   requires      that    law    enforcement      officials    applying     to   use\n\nelectronic surveillance include \"a full and complete statement as\n\nto whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried\n\nand failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed\n\nif   tried    or    to    be    too   dangerous.\"      Id.      In   reviewing    the\n\ngovernment's showing of necessity, our role \"is not to make a de\n\nnovo determination of sufficiency as if [we] were [the issuing\n\njudge], but to decide if the facts set forth in the application\n\nwere minimally adequate to support the determination that was\n\nmade.\"    United States v. Ashley, 876 F.2d 1069, 1074 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)(quoting United States v. Scibelli, 549 F.2d 222, 226 (1st\n\nCir. 1977))(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              To establish necessity, the government is not required to\n\nshow     that      other       investigative      methods     have    been     wholly\n\nunsuccessful,        United States v. Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d 1, 9\n\n(1st   Cir.     2003),     nor    must    the    government    exhaust   all   other\n\ninvestigative measures before resorting to wiretapping.                        United\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fStates v. Abou-Saada, 785 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1986); see also\n\nLópez, 300 F.3d at 52.         The government is only required to show\n\nthat it has made \"a reasonable, good faith effort to run the gamut\n\nof normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so\n\nintrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls.\"                  López,\n\n300 F.3d at 52 (citing Hoffman, 832 F.2d at 1306-07).\n\n            Turning to the affidavit, we are satisfied that the\n\napplication was \"minimally adequate to support the determination\n\nthat was made.\"      Ashley, 876 F.2d 1074.             The DEA Special Agent\n\nfiled a fifty-nine-page affidavit that defined the goals of the\n\ngovernment's investigation and supplied a detailed overview of the\n\ninvestigation to date.       The affidavit listed specific reasons why\n\ntraditional   investigative         methods    used     up   to   that   point   --\n\nincluding informants, physical and video surveillance, controlled\n\npurchases   and   seizures     of   heroin,    and    pen    register    and   toll\n\nanalysis -– had not yielded sufficient information.                       It also\n\nprovided    thorough   explanations       as    to    why    other   traditional\n\ninvestigative     techniques    (e.g.,       physical    surveillance,     search\n\nwarrants, grand jury subpoenas, telephone records and pen register\n\ndata, trash searches, witness interviews, cooperating individuals,\n\nand undercover agents) were unlikely to be fruitful.\n\n            Cartagena argues that the affidavit in support of the\n\nwiretap contained material omissions and misleading and false\n\nstatements that, if known to the judge, would have prevented a\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\ffinding of necessity.           Cartagena contends that the government\n\nomitted   material     information      concerning     the    extent       of    Báez's\n\ninfiltration into the conspiracy, the frequency, nature, and scope\n\nof his communications with López, the activities he was authorized\n\nto perform, and the quality of information he had provided to the\n\ngovernment.2     He also alleges that the government made false\n\nstatements by creating the impression that Báez had only been able\n\nto provide the most general information about the drug enterprise.\n\nLastly, Cartagena argues that the government omitted material\n\ninformation     that    would     have     established        that     traditional\n\ninvestigative    procedures      were    producing     some    results          for   the\n\ngovernment.     Had this information been included, says Cartagena,\n\nthe issuing court would not have been able to find that a federal\n\nwiretap   was   necessary,      requiring      the    government      to    continue\n\npursuing less intrusive investigative techniques.                      Cartagena's\n\narguments are flawed for the following reasons.\n\n           Section     2518(1)(c)'s       \"full      and   complete    statement\"\n\nrequirement does not mandate that officers include every single\n\ndetail of an investigation, even if relevant to the need for a\n\nwiretap. United States v. Yeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n2\n   Cartagena additionally argues, regarding both the state and\nfederal wiretaps, that the government intentionally omitted an\nunconstitutional search of López's phone from the affidavits.\nBecause we do not believe the information obtained from the search\nwas used in support of the wiretaps, Cartagena's allegation is\nirrelevant to his necessity claim.\n\n                                        -10-\n\f2005).   Provided that sufficient facts are included supporting the\n\nneed for a wiretap over other investigative procedures, the officer\n\nneed   not   set    forth    the      minutiae     of    an    investigation.        Id.\n\nFurthermore,       \"[t]here      is    no     rule      on    the   amount    of    time\n\ninvestigators must try and fail, using other methods, before\n\nturning to a wiretap application,\"                      United States v. Nelson-\n\nRodríguez, 319 F.3d 12, 33 (1st Cir. 2003).                     Even if traditional\n\ninvestigative procedures produce some results, \"the partial success\n\nof the investigation [does] not mean that there [is] nothing more\n\nto be done.\"       United States v. Cao, 471 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n             The government's affidavit made clear that although DEA\n\nagents had secured information through traditional investigative\n\nmeasures,     their       ability      to     continue        obtaining      actionable\n\nintelligence       from   such   methods       was   limited.3       We   have     never\n\nrequired the government to \"run outlandish risks or to exhaust\n\nevery conceivable alternative before seeking a wiretap,\"                       Hoffman,\n\n832 F.2d at 1306, and we find no need to create such a requirement\n\ntoday.   On deferential review, we are satisfied with the issuing\n\ncourt's determination that the facts provided were sufficient to\n\n\n\n3\n    Specifically, the affidavit provided that traditional law\nenforcement investigative techniques had failed to identify the\nsmuggling locations to which the narcotics were transported, the\nexact method by which the conspirators imported the narcotics into\nthe United States, the persons to whom Cartagena supplied the\nnarcotics, the method by which the organization laundered its drug\nproceeds, or the full nature and scope of Cartagena's drug\ntrafficking activities.\n\n                                            -11-\n\frise above the standard of minimal adequacy.                 See United States v.\n\nRivera-Rosario,      300     F.3d   1,    19    (1st    Cir.      2002)   (necessity\n\nestablished       where     government      described        previously     pursued\n\ntechniques, stated why they were ineffective, and explained why\n\nother methods, including grand jury subpoenas and search warrants,\n\nwere not viable options).\n\n               Furthermore, even if the affidavit had contained the\n\ninformation that Cartagena alleges was omitted or misstated, we\n\nfind no reason to conclude that the inclusion of such information\n\nwould have prevented the judge from deciding that a wiretap should\n\nbe issued.        In light of the large quantities of evidence from\n\nsources other than Báez, \"if we excise (or otherwise appropriately\n\nadjust) all misleading statements from the affidavit, there is\n\nstill a more than adequate showing of 'probable cause.'                    Thus any\n\nmisstatements are immaterial.\"             Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d at 34\n\n(quoting United States v. Young, 877 F.2d 1099, 1102 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)    (Breyer,   J.)).      In   this       case,   the   affidavit     contained\n\ninformation gathered from several other cooperating informants,\n\nvideo    and    physical    surveillance,       analysis     of    toll   and   phone\n\nrecords, analysis of pen registers, and seizures of heroin and\n\ncocaine.       On these facts, we cannot say that the court erred in\n\nconcluding that the omission or misstatement of information about\n\nBáez's     informant       activities     did     not    provide      grounds    for\n\n\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fsuppression.   We therefore affirm the district court's denial of\n\nCartagena's motion to suppress.4\n\n                 2. New York Wiretap\n\n          Cartagena also challenges the district court's denial of\n\nhis motion to suppress evidence obtained from the New York wiretap.\n\nCartagena argues, as with his Title III contentions, that the\n\ndistrict court should have suppressed the fruits of the New York\n\nwiretap because the affidavit in support of the application omitted\n\nmaterial information and contained misleading statements. However,\n\nupon reviewing the record, we agree with the district court that\n\nthe government did not offer evidence obtained from the New York\n\nwiretap against Cartagena.   Further, we conclude that any evidence\n\nobtained from the New York wiretap that may have been used in the\n\nTitle III wiretap affidavit was not material.    Cartagena has not\n\n\n4\n  Although we agree with the district court's decision to suppress\nthe Title III wiretap, we briefly address its discussion of the\nnecessity standard in order to provide clarification. In applying\nTitle's III's necessity requirement, the district court imposed two\nrequirements that we have never demanded to establish necessity.\nFirst, the district court considered whether the informant in this\ncase \"was [] in a position to provide all the information that\nobjectively reasonable investigators would want or need for a\nsuccessful prosecution of the several people involved in the\ndistribution network.\" López, 2007 WL 4556904, at *4. Nowhere\ndoes § 2518(1)(c) or this Court's jurisprudence require that we\nassess the wants or needs of the objectively reasonable\ninvestigator.     Second, the district court considered the\nevidentiary reliability of informant-provided information. Id. at\n*5. Again, the evidentiary reliability of an informant's testimony\nis not part of the necessity requirement under § 2518(1)(c). In\nevaluating necessity, a court need only consider whether other\ninvestigatory procedures have been tried and failed or if they\nwould be unlikely to succeed if pursued.\n\n                               -13-\n\fdemonstrated otherwise.          Thus, we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of Cartagena's motion to suppress the fruits of the New York\n\nwiretap as moot.\n\n            B. Franks Hearing\n\n            Cartagena additionally argues that the case should be\n\nremanded for an evidentiary hearing so that his allegations of\n\nalleged omissions and false statements in the federal and state\n\nwiretap affidavits may be evaluated. To obtain such an evidentiary\n\nhearing, the defendant must make \"a substantial preliminary showing\n\nthat   a   false    statement    knowingly   and   intentionally,      or    with\n\nreckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in\n\nthe warrant affidavit, and [that] the allegedly false statement is\n\nnecessary to the finding of probable cause.\"             Franks, 438 U.S. at\n\n155-56.     Provided the defendant makes the requisite showing, a\n\nFranks hearing may be held to address allegations of both material\n\nomissions as well as false statements.         Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d\n\nat 34.     A district court's finding that the requisite showing for\n\na Franks hearing has not been made will be overturned only if it is\n\nclearly erroneous.      Rivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d at 20.\n\n            We find no clear error in the district court's denial of\n\na Franks hearing.      First, and as set forth above, we agree with the\n\ndistrict    court    that   Cartagena    failed    to   make   a    substantial\n\npreliminary showing that the wiretap applications suffered from\n\nknowingly     or    recklessly    made   material       omissions    or     false\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fstatements.       See, e.g., id. (denial of Franks hearing upheld where\n\ndefendant failed to show that alleged omission of information\n\nregarding     a    cooperating    witness,       who    had    some   information\n\nconcerning the government's targets, was sufficiently material to\n\nwarrant evidentiary hearing where that information was immaterial\n\nto the charges against defendant).             Second, and as previously set\n\nforth, even if Cartagena could meet this preliminary showing, he\n\nhas failed to show that absent the false information, or including\n\nthe   omitted     information,    the    affidavit      contained     insufficient\n\nevidence to support a finding of probable cause.                       See, e.g.,\n\nNelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d at 34 (denial of Franks hearing upheld\n\nwhere   defendant      failed    to   show     that    alleged   omissions    were\n\nnecessary to the issuing judge's finding of probable cause for\n\nwiretap).     The preliminary showing for a Franks hearing requires\n\nthat both of these elements be established.                   Id. (citing United\n\nStates v. Adams, 305 F.3d 30, 36 n.1 (1st Cir. 2002)).                  Cartagena\n\nhas established neither, and we thus affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of a Franks hearing.\n\n            C. Discovery Motions\n\n            Cartagena's final argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying his discovery motions.5                  We\n\nreview the district court's denial of discovery motions for abuse\n\n\n\n5\n   Cartagena moved for discovery pursuant to Rule 116.2(A) of the\nLocal Rules of the District of Massachusetts.\n\n                                        -15-\n\fof discretion.     United States v. Bucci, 582 F.3d 108, 113 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\n           Cartagena's first discovery motion sought disclosure of\n\ninformation   on    the   confidential           informants   identified       in    the\n\nwiretap affidavits. It is well-established that the government has\n\na \"privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons\n\nwho furnish information of violations of law to officers charged\n\nwith enforcement of that law.\"             Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S.\n\n53, 59 (1957).          This privilege is not absolute.                 \"Where the\n\ndisclosure of an informant's identity, or of the contents of his\n\ncommunication,     is    relevant    and     helpful    to    the    defense    of    an\n\naccused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the\n\nprivilege must give way.\"         Id. at 60-61.\n\n           Cartagena      bears     the    \"heavy\"     burden   of    showing       that\n\ndisclosure is necessary in raising his defense.                 United States v.\n\nLewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1335 (1st Cir. 1994)(citations omitted); see\n\nalso United States v. Robinson, 144 F.3d 104, 106 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nCartagena's argument, based entirely on speculation, falls far\n\nshort of meeting this burden.               Cartagena's claim is limited to\n\narguing that communications concerning the other informants could\n\nhave   provided    important      exculpatory       evidence    that    would       have\n\ncorroborated his subjective belief that the government omitted\n\nmaterial information from the wiretap affidavits.                     Specifically,\n\nCartagena contends that if the government made material omissions\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fin the affidavits concerning Báez, it also could have omitted\n\ninformation as to the other four informants, entitling him to\n\ndiscovery. Cartagena offers no evidence nor points to any facts to\n\nsupport this contention.\n\n           Cartagena further argues that he is only seeking the\n\ncontents   of   the   informants'   conversations,   not   their    actual\n\nidentities.     The government asserted below that disclosure of the\n\ninformants'     communications   would     effectively   disclose   their\n\nidentities and put them at risk because of the specific context in\n\nwhich the communications were made.        Roviaro makes clear that, if\n\ndisclosure of a communication's contents will also tend to reveal\n\nan informant's identity, the contents are also privileged. 353 U.S.\n\nat 60; see also United States v. Tzannos, 460 F.3d 128, 140 (1st\n\nCir. 2006)(holding that the privilege \"extends to information that\n\nwould tend to reveal the identity of the informant\")(quoting United\n\nStates v. Napier, 436 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir. 2006)). Cartagena\n\noffers no facts to dispute the government's assertion, nor does he\n\npoint to any evidence that would allow us to plausibly infer that\n\nthe contents should not be deemed privileged.\n\n           Lastly, at no point in his argument does Cartagena raise\n\nfacts or offer evidence showing that the other informants were\n\neither active participants, supporting his claim for disclosure, or\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fmere tipsters whose disclosure is \"vital to a fair trial.\"6                  Lewis,\n\n40 F.3d at 1335 (explaining that a mere tipster will generally\n\ndeserve anonymity unless an exceptional case is presented showing\n\nthat disclosure is \"vital to a fair trial.\"). This is particularly\n\nrelevant   in   this    case   because      at     the   suppression    stage,   the\n\ndefendant's     interest       in    disclosure,         weighed      against    the\n\ngovernment's      interest          in      protecting        the      informant's\n\nconfidentiality, is of a lesser magnitude than at the trial stage.\n\nTzannos, 460 F.3d at 140 (citing United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S.\n\n667, 679 (1980)); see also McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 312\n\n(1967)(informant's identity need not always be disclosed at trial,\n\n\"let alone in a preliminary hearing to determine probable cause\"\n\nfor a search).\n\n           Disclosure is only proper if Cartagena shows us \"concrete\n\ncircumstances    that    might      justify      overriding    both    the   public\n\ninterest   in    encouraging        the     flow    of    information,    and    the\n\ninformant's private interest in his or her own safety.\"                   Tzannos,\n\n460 F.3d at 139 (citation omitted).              Cartagena fails to point us to\n\nconcrete facts that would support the conclusion that disclosure\n\n\n6\n    A \"mere tipster\" is one who \"neither participated in nor\nwitnessed the events that inculpated the defendant and led to his\narrest,\" or \"who does little more than put a flea in an officer's\near.\"   Robinson, 144 F.3d at 106-07; see also United States v.\nMartínez, 922 F.2d 914, 921 (1st Cir. 1991)(\"[W]here the informant\nis a mere tipster, a conduit rather than a principal or active\nparticipant in the enterprise, disclosure is not required, even in\nthose instances where the informant was present during the\ncommission of the offense.\").\n\n                                          -18-\n\fwould have aided his defense.       Such speculation is not enough to\n\novercome the government's privilege. See, e.g., Martínez, 922 F.2d\n\nat 921 (\"Mere speculation as to the usefulness of the informant's\n\ntestimony, it must be emphasized, is insufficient to justify\n\ndisclosure of his or her identity. . . .\").          We therefore hold that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to\n\nrequire the government to produce documents containing identifying\n\ninformation as to the other informants.7\n\n             Cartagena's second discovery motion requested the court's\n\nin camera inspection of all handwritten notes taken by the two DEA\n\nagents who prepared the Title III and New York wiretap affidavits.\n\nSimilar to his document production motion, Cartagena argues that\n\nbecause the DEA agents may have omitted material information as to\n\nBáez's role as an informant, \"the Government may well have omitted\n\ninformation with respect to the other informants in the case.\"             As\n\nthe district court aptly noted, however, Cartagena never asserts\n\nthat   the   agents'   notes   contain    specific    information   that   is\n\npotentially exculpatory or material to his defense; he only asserts\n\nthat they might.8\n\n\n7\n   Based on our review of the record, it does not appear that\nCartagena sought in camera inspection of these communications at\nthe district court level, and Cartagena does not allege doing so.\n8\n   The district court cases on which Cartagena relies to support\nhis speculative proposition do not assist him. For example, in\nUnited States v. Henderson, the requested information \"was material\nto the merits of the Motion to Suppress,\" not possibly material.\n265 F. Supp. 2d 115, 116 (D. Mass. 2002)(emphasis added).        In\n\n                                   -19-\n\f          In the absence of a specific reference or \"particularized\n\nand focused request\" for potentially exculpatory evidence, we hold\n\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying in\n\ncamera review of the DEA agents' notes.9     See United States v.\n\nCaro-Muñiz, 406 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 2005)(upholding denial of in\n\ncamera review where defendant submitted that seventy-one tape\n\nrecordings \"may\" contain exculpatory evidence).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nUnited States v. Ramos, the defendant made a particularized demand,\nrequesting disclosure of an informant's name, residential address,\ntelephone number, criminal record, and any cases pending against\nhim. 210 F. Supp. 2d 1, 2 (D. Mass. 2002). Here, Cartagena has\nrequested all of the DEA agents' handwritten notes, totaling\nhundreds   of   pages,   with    no  further    specifications   or\nidentifications. Thus, his situation cannot reasonably be compared\nto that of the defendant in either case.\n9\n   Because Cartagena has provided us with no \"indication that the\nmaterials to which he . . . needs access contain material and\npotentially exculpatory evidence,\" United States v. Brandon, 17\nF.3d 409, 456 (1st Cir. 1994), there is no Brady claim pursuant to\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Compare United States v.\nDuval, 496 F.3d 64, 75 (1st Cir. 2007)(defendants' theory that\nadditional exculpatory evidence could exist in informant payment\nrecords, fostered by government's pattern of non-disclosure, deemed\nto be a \"shot in the dark\" insufficient to require in camera\nreview), with United States v. Rosario-Peralta, 175 F.3d 48 (1st\nCir. 1999)(disclosure granted where defendants made clear showing\nthat sought evidence existed and would support validity of their\ndefense theory).\n\n                               -20-\n\f",

After careful consideration\n\nof Cartagena's challenges, we affirm in all respects.\n\n                                    I. Background\n\n             A. Facts\n\n             This    appeal    concerns     information      obtained       from   drug\n\ntrafficking     investigations          conducted       by     Drug        Enforcement\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fAdministration (DEA) agents operating in Boston, New York, and in\n\nBogotá, Colombia, in collaboration with the Colombian National\n\nPolice (CNP). The DEA focused its investigation on two individuals\n\noperating on the east coast, Luis López (\"López\") in New York and\n\nCartagena in Boston.        Special Agent Sean Canavan (\"Canavan\") was\n\nresponsible for the investigation of López, and Special Agent Jean\n\nDrouin    (\"Drouin\")    was      responsible          for    the   investigation          of\n\nCartagena.\n\n              Canavan's New York investigation centered on information\n\nregarding López and his role in the distribution of the imported\n\nheroin to wholesalers on the eastern seaboard, including Boston.\n\nThe   DEA's    investigation        of    López      in   New    York    was      based   on\n\ninformation     provided    by      a    confidential        informant,      Pablo       Báez\n\n(\"Báez\").      Báez worked with the DEA as a paid informant several\n\nyears earlier and had re-initiated contact with the DEA in December\n\n2004, providing information concerning drug trafficking activity in\n\nNew York.\n\n              In mid-May 2005, Báez began providing information about\n\nLópez's   activities.         The       DEA    registered       Báez    as   an   official\n\n\"confidential     source\"     on        June    8,   2005.       Báez    signed      a    DEA\n\nConfidential Source Agreement (CSA) that authorized him to engage\n\nin certain activities as an informant.                    On June 20, 2005, the New\n\nYork DEA, relying in part on information that Báez provided,\n\napplied for a warrant, pursuant to the New York state wiretap\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\fstatute, authorizing a wiretap on López's cellular telephone.                The\n\nwarrant was issued for a period of thirty days, commencing on\n\nJune 22, 2005.     The DEA discontinued the wiretap on July 11, 2005\n\nbecause it appeared that López was using a different phone to\n\nconduct his drug-related conversations.\n\n           Báez continued to provide the DEA with information and\n\nsurveillance opportunities until October 11, 2005.            After that, he\n\nceased contact with the DEA.              On November 16, 2005, Canavan\n\nformally deactivated Báez as a confidential source.\n\n           While the New York DEA investigated López, Drouin and the\n\nBoston DEA conducted their separate investigation of Cartagena,\n\nwhom   agents   believed    to   be   a   cocaine   and   heroin    dealer    in\n\nMassachusetts.

Regarding the New York\n\nwiretap, the district court deemed the motion moot because the\n\nGovernment stated it would not offer evidence obtained from the New\n\nYork wiretap, and further, no information obtained from that\n\nwiretap had been used in the federal wiretap application.

The\n\nmagistrate judge denied the motion holding that, because Cartagena\n\nhad not presented any evidence supporting his claim that material\n\nfacts were omitted concerning other informants' activities or the\n\nscope of the information they could provide, the government was\n\npermitted    to   withhold      the   documents   in    order   to   shield    the\n\nidentities of its confidential informants.

The district court affirmed the\n\nmagistrate judge's denial of the motion.\n\n            On August 8, 2007, Cartagena filed another discovery\n\nmotion for in camera inspection of handwritten notes of the Special\n\nAgents who prepared the Title III and New York wiretap affidavits.\n\nThe district court denied the motion on December 12, 2007, holding\n\nthat Cartagena's request for in camera review was not sufficiently\n\nparticularized and focused.           Following the denial of his motions,\n\nCartagena entered a conditional plea of guilty, reserving his right\n\nto appeal the denial of the motions to suppress, for a Franks\n\nhearing,    and   to   compel    discovery.

It also\n\nprovided    thorough   explanations       as    to    why    other   traditional\n\ninvestigative     techniques    (e.g.,       physical    surveillance,     search\n\nwarrants, grand jury subpoenas, telephone records and pen register\n\ndata, trash searches, witness interviews, cooperating individuals,\n\nand undercover agents) were unlikely to be fruitful.\n\n            Cartagena argues that the affidavit in support of the\n\nwiretap contained material omissions and misleading and false\n\nstatements that, if known to the judge, would have prevented a\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\ffinding of necessity.

However,\n\nupon reviewing the record, we agree with the district court that\n\nthe government did not offer evidence obtained from the New York\n\nwiretap against Cartagena.

In applying\nTitle's III's necessity requirement, the district court imposed two\nrequirements that we have never demanded to establish necessity.\nFirst, the district court considered whether the informant in this\ncase \"was [] in a position to provide all the information that\nobjectively reasonable investigators would want or need for a\nsuccessful prosecution of the several people involved in the\ndistribution network.\" López, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4556904</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4. Nowhere\ndoes § 2518(1)(c) or this Court's jurisprudence require that we\nassess the wants or needs of the objectively reasonable\ninvestigator.     Second, the district court considered the\nevidentiary reliability of informant-provided information. Id. at\n*5. Again, the evidentiary reliability of an informant's testimony\nis not part of the necessity requirement under § 2518(1)(c). In\nevaluating necessity, a court need only consider whether other\ninvestigatory procedures have been tried and failed or if they\nwould be unlikely to succeed if pursued.\n\n                               -13-\n\fdemonstrated otherwise.          Thus, we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of Cartagena's motion to suppress the fruits of the New York\n\nwiretap as moot.\n\n            B. Franks Hearing\n\n            Cartagena additionally argues that the case should be\n\nremanded for an evidentiary hearing so that his allegations of\n\nalleged omissions and false statements in the federal and state\n\nwiretap affidavits may be evaluated. To obtain such an evidentiary\n\nhearing, the defendant must make \"a substantial preliminary showing\n\nthat   a   false    statement    knowingly   and   intentionally,      or    with\n\nreckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in\n\nthe warrant affidavit, and [that] the allegedly false statement is\n\nnecessary to the finding of probable cause.\"             Franks, 438 U.S. at\n\n155-56.     Provided the defendant makes the requisite showing, a\n\nFranks hearing may be held to address allegations of both material\n\nomissions as well as false statements.         Nelson-Rodríguez, 319 F.3d\n\nat 34.     A district court's finding that the requisite showing for\n\na Franks hearing has not been made will be overturned only if it is\n\nclearly erroneous.      Rivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d at 20.\n\n            We find no clear error in the district court's denial of\n\na Franks hearing.      First, and as set forth above, we agree with the\n\ndistrict    court    that   Cartagena    failed    to   make   a    substantial\n\npreliminary showing that the wiretap applications suffered from\n\nknowingly     or    recklessly    made   material       omissions    or     false\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fstatements.

Second, and as previously set\n\nforth, even if Cartagena could meet this preliminary showing, he\n\nhas failed to show that absent the false information, or including\n\nthe   omitted     information,    the    affidavit      contained     insufficient\n\nevidence to support a finding of probable cause.

It is well-established that the government has\n\na \"privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons\n\nwho furnish information of violations of law to officers charged\n\nwith enforcement of that law.\"             Roviaro v.

Cartagena's claim is limited to\n\narguing that communications concerning the other informants could\n\nhave   provided    important      exculpatory       evidence    that    would       have\n\ncorroborated his subjective belief that the government omitted\n\nmaterial information from the wiretap affidavits.                     Specifically,\n\nCartagena contends that if the government made material omissions\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fin the affidavits concerning Báez, it also could have omitted\n\ninformation as to the other four informants, entitling him to\n\ndiscovery. Cartagena offers no evidence nor points to any facts to\n\nsupport this contention.\n\n           Cartagena further argues that he is only seeking the\n\ncontents   of   the   informants'   conversations,   not   their    actual\n\nidentities.     The government asserted below that disclosure of the\n\ninformants'     communications   would     effectively   disclose   their\n\nidentities and put them at risk because of the specific context in\n\nwhich the communications were made.        Roviaro makes clear that, if\n\ndisclosure of a communication's contents will also tend to reveal\n\nan informant's identity, the contents are also privileged. 353 U.S.\n\nat 60; see also United States v.

Cartagena\n\noffers no facts to dispute the government's assertion, nor does he\n\npoint to any evidence that would allow us to plausibly infer that\n\nthe contents should not be deemed privileged.\n\n           Lastly, at no point in his argument does Cartagena raise\n\nfacts or offer evidence showing that the other informants were\n\neither active participants, supporting his claim for disclosure, or\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fmere tipsters whose disclosure is \"vital to a fair trial.\"6                  Lewis,\n\n40 F.3d at 1335 (explaining that a mere tipster will generally\n\ndeserve anonymity unless an exceptional case is presented showing\n\nthat disclosure is \"vital to a fair trial.\").

Such speculation is not enough to\n\novercome the government's privilege. See, e.g., Martínez, 922 F.2d\n\nat 921 (\"Mere speculation as to the usefulness of the informant's\n\ntestimony, it must be emphasized, is insufficient to justify\n\ndisclosure of his or her identity. . . .\").          We therefore hold that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to\n\nrequire the government to produce documents containing identifying\n\ninformation as to the other informants.7\n\n             Cartagena's second discovery motion requested the court's\n\nin camera inspection of all handwritten notes taken by the two DEA\n\nagents who prepared the Title III and New York wiretap affidavits.\n\nSimilar to his document production motion, Cartagena argues that\n\nbecause the DEA agents may have omitted material information as to\n\nBáez's role as an informant, \"the Government may well have omitted\n\ninformation with respect to the other informants in the case.\"             As\n\nthe district court aptly noted, however, Cartagena never asserts\n\nthat   the   agents'   notes   contain    specific    information   that   is\n\npotentially exculpatory or material to his defense; he only asserts\n\nthat they might.8\n\n\n7\n   Based on our review of the record, it does not appear that\nCartagena sought in camera inspection of these communications at\nthe district court level, and Cartagena does not allege doing so.\n8\n   The district court cases on which Cartagena relies to support\nhis speculative proposition do not assist him.
