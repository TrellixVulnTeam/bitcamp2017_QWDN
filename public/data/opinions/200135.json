At issue in this appeal\n\nis   whether      the    Manchester    School    District     (\"MSD\"),   a   school\n\ndistrict within the State of New Hampshire, has a continuing duty\n\nto pay for the special education expenses of Kimberli M.\n\n             Kimberli, now fourteen years old, is a developmentally\n\ndelayed child.          Since the age of seven months she has lived at the\n\nBrock     Home,    a    state   licensed   home    for    children   located       in\n\nPittsfield, New Hampshire.             Because the home for children where\n\nKimberli lives is located within the Pittsfield School District,\n\nshe attends school there1; and because of her disabilities she\nreceives special education services under provisions of federal and\n\nstate     law.2        But   because   state    educational    authorities     have\ndetermined that MSD was Kimberli's \"sending district,\" as that term\nis used in the relevant New Hampshire statutes, infra, the New\n\nHampshire      Department       of   Education   (\"NHDOE\")     requires      MSD   to\nreimburse the Pittsfield School District for the cost of the\neducational services furnished by the latter to Kimberli.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      New Hampshire statutory law provides that a child placed in\na home for children shall attend school in the district where the\nhome is located.    N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 193:12 V and 193:28\n(1998). Those statutes and other relevant New Hampshire statutes\npertaining to the provision of special education services to\nchildren with disabilities are cited and discussed in the body of\nthe opinion.    They are also set out, in material part, in an\nAppendix at the end of this opinion.\n      2\n      See Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (\"IDEA\"),\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A) (2000); N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186:C-1\n(1998) (providing for the furnishing of a free appropriate public\neducation to children with educational disabilities).\n\n                                         -2-\n\f            MSD    strenuously       objects         to    being        held    financially\n\nresponsible for Kimberli's educational expenses.                           It points out\n\nthat Kimberli's parents are not New Hampshire residents.                             Born in\nColorado,    Kimberli    came,       as    an    infant,         with    her    parents     to\n\nManchester, New Hampshire in 1989, where she was severely injured\n\nin an accident.      At the age of seven months, while her parents were\nstill in Manchester, she was placed, with the assistance of New\n\nHampshire    officials,        in    the    Brock         Home    in     Pittsfield,        New\n\nHampshire. Soon thereafter her parents left New Hampshire, leaving\n\nKimberli in the Brock Home where she has since resided.                              In 1995,\n\nKimberli's parents were divorced, with Kimberli's father being\n\nawarded custody of the children, including Kimberli, in a divorce\n\ndecree issued by an Ohio court.             Her father resides in Akron, Ohio,\nand apparently remains satisfied with Kimberli's placement in New\n\nHampshire.       Neither parent appears to be involved with her or to\n\ncontribute to her support.\n            In    the   view    of       MSD,    Kimberli's        residence         has,    by\n\noperation of law, become that of her father, making her an Ohio\n\nresident.     MSD resents being forced to pay for the educational\n\nexpenses of a minor whom it regards as an out-of-state resident.\n\nMSD challenges the correctness of the NHDOE's interpretation of New\n\nHampshire    statutory    law       so     as   to   charge       MSD     for    Kimberli's\n\neducational expenses.\n\n             After failing over a period of years to convince New\n\nHampshire    education     authorities           that      it    should        not   be   held\n\nresponsible for Kimberli's educational expenses, MSD sued under 20\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fU.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A), in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of New Hampshire.3   Acting on cross motions for summary\n\njudgment, the district court agreed with the NHDOE's interpretation\nof state law imposing liability for Kimberli's educational expenses\n\nupon MSD in the present circumstances.   This appeal followed.   We\n\naffirm.\n\nI.        FACTS\n\n          This case was disposed of in the district court on cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment filed by the plaintiff-appellant, MSD,\n\non the one hand, and, on the other, by the defendants-appellees,\nMargaret \"Peggy\" Crisman, as Surrogate Parent for Kimberli M., and\n\nthe Pittsfield School District.      We take the facts from the\ndocumentary record made by the parties in connection with their\ncross-motions.\n\n          Kimberli M. was born on September 5, 1988, to James and\nPaula M. in Colorado.   In January 1989, while she and her parents\nwere in Manchester, New Hampshire, Kimberli was the victim of an\n\naccident that left her blind and severely developmentally delayed.\nFollowing several months of medical treatment in Manchester, New\nHampshire, and Boston, Massachusetts, Kimberli's parents, with the\n\naid of the New Hampshire Division of Children and Youth Services,\nplaced Kimberli in the Brock Home, located in Pittsfield, New\n\n\n     3\n      20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A) states, in pertinent part, that a\nparty aggrieved by a decision of a State education agency regarding\nthe identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a\nchild, or the provision of a free appropriate education for a child\nshall have the right to bring a civil action \"in a district court\nof the United States without regard to amount in controversy.\"\n\n                               -4-\n\fHampshire, a \"home for children\" licensed by the New Hampshire\n\nDepartment of Mental Health.     See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 193:27 I.4\n\nOn the application for placement, Kimberli's parents listed their\naddress as 213 Pine Street, Manchester, New Hampshire.             Although\n\nthe parents, James and Paula M., appear to have retained legal\n\ncustody of Kimberli at this time, they had little or no contact\nwith her after she went to the Brock Home.           Her parents moved to\n\nSouth Carolina shortly after Kimberli was placed in the Brock Home.\n\n           Because   of   her   several     disabilities,     Kimberli    was\n\nentitled under federal and New Hampshire law to receive special\n\neducation services beginning at the age of three.           See 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1412(a)(1)(A); N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-C:1.5          In May 1992, the\n\nMoore Center Services, Inc.,6 on behalf of Kimberli, requested the\nNHDOE to make a so-called \"district of liability\" determination to\n\ndecide   which   school   district    in   New   Hampshire,   if   any,   was\n\nresponsible to pay for the expenses of Kimberli's education.              In a\nletter dated May 15, 1992, the NHDOE, quoting N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      This statute is set out, in relevant part, in the Appendix at\nthe end of this opinion.\n     5\n      The New Hampshire statute is set out, in relevant part, in\nthe Appendix at the end of this opinion.\n     6\n      The Moore Center is an area agency established under rules\nadopted by the New Hampshire Commissioner of Health and Human\nServices.   It channels funds and services to individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities, and helps with residential placement.\nKimberli has been a client of the Moore Center since April 1989.\nHer placement at the Brock Home has been funded through, and\nsupervised by, the Moore Center. See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 171-\nA:18 (set out, in relevant part, at the end of this opinion).\n\n                                     -5-\n\f§ 193:297, notified MSD that MSD was the district of liability for\nKimberli because it was the district in which Kimberli had \"most\n\nrecently resided\"   prior   to   her    placement    in    the   Brock   Home.\nUnhappy with this determination, MSD appealed to the Commissioner\n\nof Education, Charles H. Marston.        The Commissioner affirmed the\n\nNHDOE's decision, and MSD sought no further review of the decision\nat this time although entitled to do so.            Therefore, as matters\n\nstood, while Kimberli would attend school in the Pittsfield School\n\nDistrict where the Brock Home was located, MSD had to pay for her\n\nspecial education costs.\n\n          In 1993, James M., Kimberli's father, relocated from\n\nSouth Carolina to Akron, Ohio with his remaining children.                  On\n\nFebruary 1, 1993, Kimberli, along with Mrs. Brock of the Brock Home\nand an assistant, traveled to Ohio to visit her family.            According\n\nto MSD (but not appellees), there was some thought at the time to\n\nplace Kimberli in a facility located in Ohio.             The attempted Ohio\nplacement, if it was such, failed, and on February 4, 1993,\n\nKimberli was returned to the Brock Home.            MSD believed that the\n\nout-of-state trip formed a basis for once again challenging the\n\n1992 NHDOE's district of liability determination.             MSD argued, in\n\na letter to the NHDOE, that the four-day trip constituted a move\n\nthat altered Kimberli's residence, thereby relieving MSD of further\n\nliability.    The   NHDOE   rejected     MSD's   characterization.          It\n\ndetermined that the trip to Ohio was a mere visit that did not\n\n     7\n      This statute, together with § 193:27 defining \"sending\ndistrict,\" is set out, in relevant part, in the Appendix at the end\nof this opinion.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fconstitute a change in residence.              Thus, the NHDOE determined that\n\nMSD remained liable for Kimberli's educational expenses.                   MSD did\n\nnot seek review of this decision.\n             Also   in   1993,     the    NHDOE    appointed   an    educational\n\nsurrogate parent, Margaret \"Peggy\" Crisman, to act in the place of\n\nKimberli's parents for purposes of making educational decisions.\nSee N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-C:14 III.8              Since her appointment,\n\nMs. Crisman has acted on Kimberli's behalf in all matters related\n\nto her education. In May 2000, Ms. Crisman became Kimberli's legal\n\nguardian.9\n\n             In 1995, James and Paula M. were divorced.              James M. was\n\nawarded \"residential and legal custody\" of their four children,\n\nincluding Kimberli.         Focusing on the 1995 divorce decree, MSD\npetitioned    the   NHDOE    for    yet    another    district      of   liability\n\ndetermination.      MSD argued that, because James M. had been awarded\n\n\"residential\" custody, Kimberli, a minor, had become a resident of\nAkron, Ohio, where her father resided.               MSD reasoned that Akron,\n\nand   not    Manchester,     was    liable       financially   for       Kimberli's\n\neducation.      Consistent with this theory, MSD administratively\n\ndischarged Kimberli from special education in 1996, reiterating\n\nthat her residence, like her father's, was in Akron, Ohio.                       In\n\n\n      8\n      This statute is set out, in relevant part, in the Appendix at\nthe end of this opinion.\n      9\n      The parties have not raised any issue over the effect, if\nany, Ms. Crisman's status as Kimberli's legal guardian may have on\nthe NHDOE's 1992 district of liability determination. Because the\nparties do not raise the matter, we have no occasion to consider\nit.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fresponse, Ms. Crisman requested a due process hearing before a\n\nhearing officer of the NHDOE.                That request had the effect of\n\ntemporarily maintaining the status quo as to Kimberli's placement\nand MSD's liability for her education expenses.\n\n              In January 1997, the hearing officer issued a decision\n\nthat    the   doctrines    of    res       judicata   and   collateral   estoppel\nprevented MSD from re-litigating Kimberli's residency. The hearing\n\nofficer determined that the NHDOE's 1992 district of liability\n\ndecision constituted a final order binding upon MSD.               However, the\n\nhearing officer allowed MSD to \"produce evidence to demonstrate\n\nchanged circumstances occurring since the 1992 DOL determination\n\nwhich might justify a different result . . . .\"\n\n              Seeking to demonstrate changed circumstances, MSD argued\nthat Kimberli's 1993 trip to Ohio and the divorce decree were new\n\ncircumstances     calling       for    a    different   district   of    liability\n\ndetermination. The hearing officer disagreed. She determined that\nthe 1995 Ohio divorce decree, granting residential custody to\n\nKimberli's father,        did not affect the 1992 district of liability\n\ndetermination.      She further concluded that any argument that the\n\n1993 trip to Ohio constituted a move was barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-C:16-b I.10\n              MSD thereupon brought this action in the district court\n\nagainst Crisman, as Kimberli's surrogate parent, and the Pittsfield\n\nSchool District, contesting the hearing officer's conclusion.                  See\n\n\n       10\n      This statute is set out, in relevant part, in the Appendix\nat the end of this opinion.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fnote 3, supra.     MSD sought a determination that it was no longer\n\nfinancially liable for the special education costs associated with\n\nKimberli's education.           While the case was pending in district\ncourt, New Hampshire amended its state residency laws as they\n\nrelated to school attendance. The district court remanded the case\n\nto the hearing officer to determine\n            whether the 1998 amendments to RSA 193:12 (in\n            conjunction with the 1995 divorce decree)\n            operated   to    effectuate   a   \"change    in\n            circumstances\"    (i.e.   changed  the    legal\n            residence of a minor child), rendering\n            Kimberli M. no longer legally resident in New\n            Hampshire for educational purposes, therefore\n            relieving MSD of any future obligation to fund\n            her special education (i.e. thereby justifying\n            MSD's decision to prospectively discharge\n            Kimberli from its educational responsibility).\n\nManchester Sch. Dist. v. Margaret Crisman, as surrogate Parent for\n\nKimberli M. and Pittsfield Sch. Dist., No. 97-632-M, slip op. at 11\n\n(D.N.H. Mar. 5, 1999).\n\n            On   remand,    the    hearing   officer   concluded   that   \"MSD\nremains legally liable for Kimberli's educational costs[] based on\n\nher placement in a home for children pursuant to RSA 193:27-29.\"\nIn re Kimberli M., IDPH 96-32 at 15 (New Hampshire Dept. of Ed.\n\nAugust 4, 1999).    The hearing officer concluded that the statutory\n\nchanges to New Hampshire residency law had no legal bearing on\n\nKimberli's right to special education in New Hampshire or MSD's\n\nliability for that education.            As an alternative holding, the\n\nhearing officer also ruled that, based on the facts before her,\n\nKimberli,    although      an     unemancipated   minor,   could   establish\n\nresidency in New Hampshire.            Id. at 12.      If this were so, the\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fPittsfield School District, and not MSD, would be liable for the\n\ncosts of Kimberli's education under New Hampshire law. Recognizing\n\nthe potential implications of her decision, the hearing officer\nstated \"this finding of Kimberli's residency is secondary to my\n\nprimary ruling that MSD is responsible for the cost of educating\n\nKimberli . . . and should not be construed as placing an obligation\nupon Pittsfield . . . .\"        Id. at 14.\n\n            At MSD's request, the federal case was reopened and MSD\n\nopposed the hearing officer's primary ruling that it was ultimately\n\nliable for the costs of Kimberli's education.                 The Pittsfield\n\nSchool District contested the hearing officer's secondary holding\n\nthat    Kimberli    could   establish   residency    in   Pittsfield.       The\n\nparties, including Crisman on behalf of Kimberli, made cross-\nmotions for summary judgment.           MSD argued that, pursuant to the\n\nnewly amended section 193:12 II(a)(2)11 and the 1995 divorce decree,\n\nKimberli's legal residence was now Akron, Ohio and as such, Akron\nand not MSD was liable for the costs of her special education.\n\nPittsfield contended that the hearing officer's conclusion that\n\nKimberli had become a resident of Pittsfield contradicted the\n\nlegislative purpose behind section 193:29.12          Crisman asserted that\n\nthe hearing officer had correctly interpreted and applied the law.\n\n            After    requesting    additional      briefing   and    carefully\n\nreviewing    the    statutory   language     and   relevant   case   law,   the\n\n       11\n      This statute is set out, in relevant part, in the Appendix\nat the end of this opinion.\n       12\n      This statute is set out, in relevant part, in the Appendix\nat the end of this opinion.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fdistrict court agreed with the decision of the hearing officer and\n\ngranted Kimberli judgment as a matter of law.        Manchester Sch.\n\nDist. v. Margaret Crisman, as surrogate parent for Kimberli M., and\n\nPittsfield Sch. Dist., No. 97-632-M, 2001 WL 920056, at *3 (D.N.H.\n\nJuly 31, 2001).    The district court concluded that Kimberli had a\n\n\"placement-based right\" to special education in New Hampshire and\nthat MSD was liable for her educational costs.\n\n            Judgment originally entered on August 1, 2001.   Pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), Manchester filed a Motion to Alter or\n\nAmend the Judgment and requested that the district court certify\n\nthe state law questions to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.       On\n\nSeptember 17, 2001, the district court issued an order denying the\n\nmotion.   Meanwhile, on August 15, 2001, Crisman filed a Motion for\nReasonable Attorneys' Fees.    The district court extended the time\n\nfor filing an appeal until disposition of this motion as allowed by\n\nRule 4(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.          In\naccordance with the orders entered August 1 and September 17, 2001,\n\npost-judgment judgment was entered on October 10, 2001.      The time\n\nfor filing an appeal began to run at this time.   This appeal timely\n\nfollowed.\n\nII.         DISCUSSION\n\n            The basic question on appeal, as it was below, is whether\nMSD is financially liable for the costs of the special education\n\nbeing furnished to Kimberli by the Pittsfield School District. All\nparties agree that, while she is living at the Brock Home, Kimberli\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fwill attend school in the Pittsfield School District.13   The only\n\nissue remaining, as a practical matter, is which school district\n\npays for the costs associated with the \"free appropriate public\neducation\" guaranteed to children with educational disabilities.\n\nWhile MSD contends that Kimberli is an Ohio resident and that Ohio\n\nshould therefore provide and finance her special education, there\nis no Ohio party involved here and no form of relief of this nature\n\nis being sought or is available in this proceeding.\n\n          MSD proffers several arguments to support its contention\n\nthat it is not financially liable for the costs of Kimberli's\n\neducation. MSD first argues that, pursuant to the Individuals with\n\nDisabilities in Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1412(1)(A)14,\n\nand the recently amended New Hampshire law, a New Hampshire School\n\n\n     13\n      N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 193:28 provides that \"[w]henever any\nchild is placed and cared for in any home for children . . ., such\nchild, if of school age, shall be entitled to attend the public\nschools of the school district in which said home is\nlocated . . . .\"     See also N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 193:12 V\ndiscussed below. The parties agree that the Brock Home is a \"home\nfor children\" located in the Pittsfield School District.\n\n     14\n       In 1997, Congress amended the IDEA significantly. Pub. L.\nNo. 105-17, 11 Stat. 37 (1997).      The litigation predates the\namendments. The Amendments specified that they would \"take effect\nupon the enactment of this Act,\" which was June 4, 1997.\nAmendments, tit. II, § 201(a)(1). The Amendments nowhere state\nthat they apply retroactively, and courts addressing the effect of\nthe Amendments have held that they are prospective only.      See,\ne.g., Padilla v. Sch. Dist. No.1, 233 F.3d 1268, 1271 n.3 (10th\nCir. 2000); Peter v. Wedl, 155 F.3d 992, 998 (8th Cir. 1998);\nHeather S. v. Wis., 125 F.3d 1045, 1062 (7th Cir. 1997); Cypress-\nFairbanks Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Michael F., 118 F.3d 245, 247 n.1\n(5th Cir. 1997). The substance of the provisions at issue in this\nopinion remain substantially the same as their counterparts in the\nIDEA's present form. For ease of reference, we cite the current\nversion of the IDEA.\n\n                               -12-\n\fDistrict is not liable for special education programming of a\n\nstudent whose parents do not reside in the state.           Second, MSD\n\ncontends, even if a \"placement-based right\" exists under New\nHampshire law, it does not apply in Kimberli's case because she was\n\nnot properly \"placed\" at the Brock Home within the meaning of the\n\nstatute.    Third, MSD avers that, in the event this court agrees\nthat Kimberli was placed in the Brock Home, res judicata does not\n\nbar   it   from   re-litigating   the    1992   district   of   liability\n\ndetermination based on a significant change in circumstances.\n\nFinally, MSD urges this court, in light of the recent amendments,\n\nto certify to the New Hampshire Supreme Court the question of\n\nwhether a New Hampshire school district remains liable for the\n\ncosts of a student's special education if the parents reside out of\nstate.\n\n            The district court rejected each of the above arguments.\n\nIt determined that state law, and not the IDEA, dictated the\nfinancial liability of individual local school districts for the\n\ncosts of a free and appropriate public education.           Then, after\n\nexamining the relevant New Hampshire law, the court concluded, as\n\na matter of law, that the 1998 amendments to section 193:12 did not\n\naffect the original district of liability determination made by the\n\nNHDOE.     Based on the language of the New Hampshire statutes the\n\ncourt determined that:     (1) New Hampshire law allowed for an in-\n\nstate school district to pay for the special education costs of a\n\nchild whose parents reside outside the state; and (2) Kimberli was\n\n\"placed\" in the Brock Home as required by statute.          Finally, it\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fdenied MSD's post-judgment request for certification, viewing it as\n\na belated procedural maneuver designed to prolong litigation.\n\n           Because this case involves only questions of law - the\ninterpretation of federal and state statutes - we review the\n\ndistrict court's conclusions de novo.   Rochester Ford Sales, Inc.\n\nv. Ford Motor Co., 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2002); G.D. v.\nWestmoreland Sch. Dist., 930 F.2d 942, 945 (1st Cir. 1991).   While\n\nour review is plenary, New Hampshire, like most states, gives some\n\ndeference to the reasonable interpretation of a state statute by\n\nthe state administrative agency charged with the responsibility of\n\nenforcing that statute.   In re Markievitz, 606 A.2d 800, 802 (N.H.\n\n1992); Chambers v. Geiger, 573 A.2d 1356, 1358 (N.H. 1990).     On\n\nissues lacking an overriding federal concern, both federalism and\ncomity suggest we look at the NHDOE's interpretations in a similar\n\nlight.    The Supreme Court of the United States has admonished\n\nfederal courts, when reviewing cases under the IDEA, to take great\ncare not to displace the educational policy judgments made by state\n\nand local public education officials.     See Bd. of Educ. of the\n\nHendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206\n\n(1982).\n\nA.         Federal Law and Financial Liability\n\n           In its brief, MSD asserts that \"[a] New Hampshire school\ndistrict is not required by the [IDEA] to pay for the special\n\neducation programming of a student whose parents did not and do not\nreside in either that district or the State of New Hampshire.\" MSD\n\nargues from this assumption that the IDEA dictates that financial\n\n                               -14-\n\fliability for special education be determined by a student's legal\n\nresidency and not by any other criterion. Because Kimberli is not,\n\nin MSD's view, a \"legal resident\" of New Hampshire, MSD says that\nit cannot be held liable for her education costs.\n\n           Contrary to MSD's position, however, the IDEA contains no\n\nprovision dictating which district or agency within a state must\nassume financial liability for special education services.              The\n\nIDEA nowhere purports to allocate financial liability among the\n\nmultitude of school districts housed within the fifty states.           And\n\nwhile the IDEA, as a condition of federal funding for any state,\n\nrequires a state to provide a free appropriate public education to\n\nchildren   with    disabilities     \"residing     in    the   State,\"     §\n\n1412(a)(1)(A), it does not purport to limit the provision of such\nan   education    to   children   who    fit   that    standard,   however\n\ninterpreted. \"Residing in\" could, of course, include children like\n\nKimberli, who have resided since infancy in a New Hampshire home.\nBut even if the phrase were interpreted to exclude a minor like\n\nKimberli the IDEA does not forbid a state from providing and\n\nfunding a free appropriate public education to a disabled child who\n\nmay not be a domiciliary of that state even if, arguably, the state\n\nis not required to do so and the child may in fact be a charge\n\nunder the IDEA upon the custodial parent's state.15\n\n     15\n      Whether Kimberli \"resides in\" New Hampshire or in Ohio, as\nthat phrase is used in the IDEA, is therefore not a question we\nneed decide here and we do not do so. Congress's intent in the\nIDEA was, at a minimum, to provide a free appropriate public\neducation to all disabled children residing in the state. Given\nCongress's overall wish to assist children with disabilities, it\nwould make little sense to read into the IDEA an implied\n\n                                  -15-\n\f             The federal statute, as we say, leaves the assignment and\n\nallocation of financial responsibility for special education cost\n\nof local school districts to each individual state's legislature.\nThe IDEA provides states with federal funds to help defray the\n\ncosts of educating children with disabilities.         It requires, as a\n\ncondition of the receipt of federal financial assistance, that a\nState enact the policies and procedures necessary to ensure that\n\nthe mandates of the statute are met.          See 20 U.S.C. § 1412; 34\n\nC.F.R.   §   300.600(b).    This    duty   includes   the   allocation   of\n\nfinancial responsibility for certain special education services. §\n\n1412(a)(12)(A)(ii).     But it is the New Hampshire legislature, and\n\nnot Congress, that assigns and allocates liability for the expenses\n\nincurred by a school district administering the mandates of the\nIDEA.\n\n             The cases cited by MSD are not to the contrary.         See,\n\ne.g., Catlin v. Sobol, 93 F.3d 1112, 1115 (2d Cir. 1996); Wise v.\nOhio Dept. of Ed., 80 F.3d 177, 182 (6th Cir. 1996); Newton Pub.\n\nSchs., 25 IDELR 107 (1996).        While each court assigned financial\n\nliability to the school district where the parent resided, the\n\ndetermination was based on an interpretation of the law of the\n\nrelevant state and the particular facts of the case.           Catlin, 93\n\nF.3d at 1114 (interpreting New York law); Wise, 80 F.3d at 182\n\n\nprohibition forbidding a state from providing public educational\nservices to children like Kimberli who are present in the state\nalthough their parents are elsewhere. Whether New Hampshire is\nmore generous than is strictly required for it to meet the IDEA's\nminimum standard for state funding is not a matter that offends\nagainst Congress's purposes in the IDEA nor does it offend any\nspecific language in the IDEA.\n\n                                   -16-\n\f(interpreting         Ohio   law);   Newton     Pub.   Schs.,   25    IDELR   at   107\n\n(interpreting Massachusetts law).                  While courts have sometimes\n\nsuggested that there is a presumption that the residency of the\nstudent's      parents       dictates    which     school   district       bears   the\n\nresponsibility for meeting the requirements of the IDEA, see\n\nCatlin, 93 F.3d at 1122, no court has stated that the IDEA itself\nmandates that a state make determinations of school district\n\nliability based invariably on the parent's residency.\n\n              We therefore agree with the district court that the IDEA\n\nneither dictates the financial liability of particular school\n\ndistricts nor prevents a state from enacting laws providing for the\n\npayment of the special education costs of a child living at a\n\nschool within the state whose parents reside outside the state.\nPut another way, it is to New Hampshire law, not federal law, to\n\nwhich we must look to determine whether MSD must pay for Kimberli's\n\nspecial education costs.\n\nB.            State Law and Liability\n\n              The New Hampshire legislature has provided a statutory\nframework for assigning responsibility for special education costs\nas part of the state's responsibility to ensure that children with\n\neducational disabilities receive a free appropriate education as\nmandated by federal law.             See N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186-C:1, et\n\nseq.        Section    186-C:1316,      entitled    \"Liability       for   Expenses,\"\n\nprovides that when a child with educational disabilities is placed\n\n\n       16\n      This statute is set out, in relevant part, in the Appendix\nat the end of this opinion.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fin a \"home for children\" the liability for expenses is determined\n\nin accordance with section 193:29.        Section 193:29 states that for\n\nany child \"placed and cared for in a home for children, the sending\ndistrict shall make payments to the receiving district.\"                The\n\nstatute defines sending and receiving district as follows:\n\n           193:27 Definitions\n\n                   IV.     \"Sending   district\"    means   the\n                           school district in which the child\n                           most recently resided other than\n                           in a home for children, the home\n                           of a relative or friend in which\n                           the child is placed by the\n                           department of health and human\n                           services or a court of competent\n                           jurisdiction . . ., health care\n                           facility, or state institution, if\n                           such child is not in the legal\n                           custody of a parent or if the\n                           parent resides outside the state;\n                           if the child is retained in the\n                           legal custody of a parent residing\n                           within    the    state,    \"sending\n                           district\"     means   the    school\n                           district in which the parent\n                           resides . . . .\n                   V.      \"Receiving district\" means the\n                           school district in which the home\n                           for   children  or   health  care\n                           facility is located . . . .\n                   VI.     \"School district\" means a school\n                           district in the state.\n\n\n           The district court concluded that MSD was the \"sending\n\ndistrict\" and thus liable for the special education services that\nKimberli receives from the Pittsfield School District. MSD attacks\nthe   district   court's    determination    that   it   is   the   \"sending\n\ndistrict\" in three ways.       First, MSD argues that it can no longer\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fbe considered the \"sending district\" because the 1998 amendments to\n\nsection 193:12 establish that Kimberli is not a \"legal resident\" of\n\nNew Hampshire.     Second, MSD avers that it is not the \"sending\ndistrict\" because, based on the new definition of \"legal resident\"\n\ncontained in 193:12, Kimberli never \"resided\" in Manchester prior\n\nto her placement at the Brock Home.           Third, it contends that\nKimberli was not \"placed\" in the Brock Home within the meaning of\n\nthe statute because her placement was not facilitated by the New\n\nHampshire Department of Health and Human Services or by court\n\norder.\n\n            MSD's first two arguments, that the amendments to section\n\n193:12 relieve it of liability, are without merit.        MSD's attempt\n\nto make section 193:12, and the definition of \"legal resident\" for\npurposes of school attendance, the focal point of the financial\n\nliability determination for special education costs is a red\n\nherring.    The definition of legal resident contained in section\n193:12 does not affect the particular statutory provisions on which\n\nMSD's liability to Kimberli turns.\n\n            Section 193:12 makes provisions for where students may\n\nattend school.     The 1998 amendments17 to 193:12 provided that a\n\nchild may not attend a school in a district in which he or she is\n\nnot a legal resident except in defined circumstances.          One of the\n\ndefined    circumstances,   of   particular   relevance   to   Kimberli's\n\n\n     17\n      Previously, 193:12 provided that \"No person shall attend\nschool, or send a pupil to school, in any district in which he is\nnot an inhabitant, without the consent of the district or of the\nschool board except as herein otherwise provided.\"\n\n                                   -19-\n\fsituation, is that a child placed and cared for in a home for\n\nchildren may attend the public school in which the home for\n\nchildren is located.       § 193:12 V.     Thus, pursuant to section\n193:12,   Kimberli   is    appropriately   attending   school   in   the\n\nPittsfield School District - an issue not in dispute.\n\n          To the extent that section 193:12 addresses financial\nliability rather than only the place of school attendance, it\n\nfollows the framework developed in section 186-C:13.       Paragraph X\n\nof section 193:12, also added in 1998, provided that \"[f]or the\n\npurpose of determining liability for a child placed or cared for in\n\nany home for children or health care facility, the provisions of\n\nRSA 193:29 shall apply.\" The legislature thus retained in 1998 the\n\nexisting provision fixing the liability for the education of\nstudents, like Kimberli, placed in a home for children.         Section\n\n193:29, as already noted, provides that for any \"child placed in a\n\nhome for children, the sending district shall make payment to the\nreceiving district.\"      Thus, whether the liability analysis begins\n\nwith section 186-C:13 or section 193:12, it proceeds to section\n\n193:29 and, eventually, to the definition of \"sending district.\"\n\n          MSD's further contention, that it is no longer the\n\n\"sending district\" because the new definition of \"legal resident\"\n\ncontained in section 193:12 altered the meaning of \"resided\" for\n\npurposes of determining the \"sending district,\" is unavailing.\n\nAccording to MSD, because Kimberli's parent were never \"legal\n\nresidents\" of Manchester, Kimberli could not have \"resided\" in\n\nManchester prior to her placement.\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\f           Contrary to MSD's position, the definition of \"sending\n\ndistrict\" explicitly accounts for a situation in which a child\n\nattends school in New Hampshire and the parents reside outside the\nstate.     In those cases, the \"sending district\" is the school\n\ndistrict in which the child \"most recently resided\" prior to\n\nplacement in the home for children.                 The New Hampshire Supreme\nCourt has interpreted the phrase \"most recently resided\" to mean\n\nthe district in which the child lived prior to his or her placement\n\n- regardless of legal residency.             See In re Gary B., 466 A.2d 929,\n\n932 (N.H. 1983) (concluding in the context of 193:27 that resided\n\n\"refers to the place where the a child actually lived . . . rather\n\nthan to legal residence or domicile\").              Accord New Hampshire Att'y\n\nGen. Op. No. 85-17 (1985).\n           The    legislature,        when   it    amended   the     definition    of\n\n\"sending district\" in 1998, kept the language \"in which a child\n\nmost recently resided.\"         The Legislature is presumed to have been\ncognizant of the judicial interpretation placed upon the phrase\n\n\"most recently resided\" and \"to have adopted that construction, in\n\nthe   absence    of   any    change    in    the   phraseology     used    or   other\n\ncompetent evidence of a different purpose.\"                  Waterman v. Town of\n\nLebanon,   95    A.   657,    658   (N.H.     1915);   see    also    In   re   Cigna\n\nHealthcare, Inc., 777 A.2d 884, 889 (N.H. 2001).                       If the New\n\nHampshire legislature had intended to alter the law with regards to\n\nliability determinations, as it did for attendance, it would have\n\namended the language of the statute to reflect such a change.                     It\n\ndid not.\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\f           MSD's third argument, that Kimberli was not \"placed\" in\n\nthe Brock Home within the meaning of the statute because her\n\nplacement was not facilitated by the New Hampshire Department of\nHealth and Human Services or by court order, is not supported by\n\nthe statute or the record.        MSD grounds its argument in the 1998\n\namendments to section 193:27 that inserted into the definition of\n\"sending district\" the phrase \"the home of a relative or friend in\n\nwhich the child is placed by the department of health and human\n\nservices or a court of competent jurisdiction\" following a \"home\n\nfor   children.\"     MSD   argues   that   the    phrase    \"placed   by   the\n\ndepartment of health and human services or court of competent\n\njurisdiction\" now modifies the phrase \"home for children.\"\n\n           MSD's suggested interpretation is not supported by the\nstructure or language of the statute.            As noted by the district\n\ncourt, the use of commas to separate the phrases plainly shows an\n\nintent   by   the   legislature     to   limit   the    placed-by-the-state\nqualifier to the \"home of a relative or friend.\"                 The state-\n\ninvolved limitation on the placement of a child with a relative or\n\nfriend was apparently intended to curb potential abuse of the\n\neducational system.     When children are placed with a relative or\n\nfriend other than by state or court direction the parents may\n\nsimply be sending their children off to cities or towns with better\n\nschools so as to obtain a public education believed to be superior\n\nto that available in the parents' hometown.            In that instance, the\n\ndistrict where the parents reside should not be, (and pursuant to\n\n193:27 is not), financially liable for the child's education and\n\n\n                                    -22-\n\fthus would not qualify as the \"sending district.\"            In contrast,\n\nplacing a child in a home for children is not likely to be a\n\nsubterfuge for securing whatever extra educational benefits the\nhome's school district may provide.     And to require a child living\n\nat such a home to attend school elsewhere, perhaps at a great\n\ndistance, could be either impossible or enormously difficult.\n          While, therefore, the clause cited by MSD calling for\n\ndepartmental or court placement does not apply to minors like\n\nKimberli placed in a home for children, we note that the instant\n\nrecord reveals that the New Hampshire Department of Health and\n\nHuman Services was involved with Kimberli's placement in the Brock\n\nHome. A file memorandum from the Moore Agency, dated May 22, 1989,\n\nstates that Kimberli was placed in the Brock Home \"by her parents[]\nfollowing the recommendation of State Welfare.\"         Paula M., in a\n\nletter to the New Hampshire Bureau of Special Education Services\n\ndated May 26, 1992, states that she and Kimberli's father placed\nKimberli at the Brock Home with the assistance of the Department of\n\nChildren and Youth Services. Further, Kimberli was and is a client\n\nof the Moore Center Services, Inc., an agency which is part of the\n\nState of New Hampshire's service delivery system for persons with\n\ndevelopment   disabilities,   which     has   funded   and     supervised\n\nKimberli's placement since April 11, 1989. Thus, however one reads\n\nthe statute, Kimberli's placement in a home for children was\n\nclosely under the auspices of the state.\n\n          Given   New   Hampshire's    statutory   framework,    we   find\n\nourselves in accord with the rulings of the district court.            The\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f1998 amendments to the definition of \"legal resident\" for purposes\n\nof school attendance in no way served to relieve MSD of its\n\nfinancial responsibility under New Hampshire's statutory scheme.\nOur statutory interpretation and that of the district court comport\n\nwith that of the NHDOE, the state agency responsible for the\n\nadministration of the state laws in question.                See N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. § 186-C:3-a.      In 1992, the NHDOE determined that Manchester\n\nwas the district of liability and financially responsible for the\n\ncosts of Kimberli's special education.            It found that \"[t]he most\n\nrecent residence of Kimberli other than a licensed home was 213\n\nPine Street, Manchester, where she lived with her parents from\n\nbirth to April 11, 1989.\"            MSD concedes that it did not, as it\n\ncould have, appeal from this decision to the State Board of\nEducation or to a court of competent jurisdiction.                Consequently,\n\nthe NHDOE's decision became a final order and is binding upon MSD.\n\n            Not only has there been no change in the New Hampshire\nstatutory    landscape    that       would    alter    the    NHDOE's    original\n\ndetermination,   MSD     has   not    proffered       any   relevant    change   in\n\ncircumstances since the NHDOE's 1992 decision that would entitle it\n\nto a different finding.        MSD, moreover, is also now collaterally\n\nestopped from challenging the NHDOE's 1992 district of liability\n\ndetermination.   Under New Hampshire law, administrative decisions\n\nare subject to the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Findings of an\n\nadministrative agency may be given preclusive effect.                  Day v. N.H.\n\nRet. Sys., 635 A.2d 493, 495 (N.H. 1993).                     Pursuant to this\n\ndoctrine, MSD is not now free to challenge NHDOE's finding, made a\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\fdecade ago, that the district in which Kimberli most recently\n\nresided prior to her placement in the Brock Home was Manchester.\n\nThe    doctrine   of     res   judicata    has    also     been   applied   to\nadministrative decisions in New Hampshire.           Morin v. N. Heating &\n\nPlumbing Co., 309 A.2d 153, 155 (N.H. 1973).             Under this doctrine,\n\nMSD is barred from challenging the NHDOE's conclusion that it was\nthe district of liability for the costs associated with Kimberli's\n\nspecial education.\n\nIII.       Certification\n\n           MSD requests this court to certify to the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court the question of whether the New Hampshire legislature\n\nintended to adopt a \"residence-based theory of liability for a\nstudent's special education.\"        We decline to do so.         Not only is\ncertification unnecessary, as discussed below, it was MSD, the\n\nparty that initiated this action in the federal court, that now\nseeks certification to the state court.          We have said that \"one who\nchooses to litigate his state action in a federal forum must\n\nordinarily accept the federal court's reasonable interpretation of\nextant   state    law     rather   than    seeking   extensions      via    the\ncertification process.\"        Santiago v. Sherwin Williams Co., 3 F.3d\n\n546, 548 (1st Cir. 1993); Corteau v. Olin Corp., 884 F.2d 45, 46\n(1st Cir. 1989).        Under the IDEA, MSD had the option to bring a\ncivil action \"in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a\n\ndistrict court of the United States.\"        20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2). MSD\nmoved to re-litigate this issue in the state court only after\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fextensive proceedings in the district court and after it became\n\nclear that it would not prevail there.\n\n            Moreover, certification is not warranted here in any\nevent.      The state law at issue is not ambiguous. See Basic\n\nControlex Corp., Inc. v. Klockner Moeller Corp., 202 F.3d 450, 452\n\n(1st     Cir.   2000).   There   is   controlling   state   precedent\ninterpreting the New Hampshire statute allocating the financial\n\nliability for the education of an educationally disabled child.\n\nSee Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 187 F.3d 88, 104 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).     When state law is sufficiently clear, as it is here, to\n\nallow a federal court to predict its course, certification is both\n\ninappropriate and an unwarranted burden on the state court.     Hugel\n\nv. Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach, LLP, 175 F.3d 14, 18\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\nIV.         Conclusion\n\n            The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\f                                Appendix\n\nAll references below are to provision of the N.H.

Any action against a local school district\n                  seeking to enforce special education rights under\n                  state or federal law shall be commenced by\n                  requesting an administrative due process hearing\n                  from the department of education within 2 years\n                  from the date on which the alleged violation was\n                  or reasonably should have been discovered.\n\n193:12     Legal Residence Required\n\n           I.

Since the age of seven months she has lived at the Brock Home, a state licensed home for children located in Pittsfield, New Hampshire. Because the home for children where Kimberli lives is located within the Pittsfield School District, she attends school there<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>; and because of her disabilities she receives special education services under provisions of federal and state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But because state educational authorities have determined that MSD was Kimberli's \"sending district,\" as that term is used in the relevant New Hampshire statutes, <i>infra,</i> the New Hampshire Department of Education (\"NHDOE\") requires MSD to reimburse the Pittsfield School District for the cost of the educational services furnished by the latter to Kimberli.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD strenuously objects to being held financially responsible for Kimberli's educational expenses. It points out that Kimberli's parents are not New Hampshire residents. Born in Colorado, Kimberli came, as an infant, with her parents to Manchester, New Hampshire in 1989, where she was severely injured in an accident. At the age of seven months, while her parents were still in Manchester, she was placed, with the assistance of New Hampshire officials, in the Brock Home in Pittsfield, New Hampshire. Soon thereafter her parents left New Hampshire, leaving Kimberli in the Brock Home where she has since resided. In 1995, Kimberli's parents were divorced, with Kimberli's father being awarded custody of the children, including Kimberli, in a divorce decree issued by an Ohio court. Her father resides in Akron, Ohio, and apparently remains satisfied with Kimberli's placement in New Hampshire. Neither parent appears to be involved with her or to contribute to her support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the view of MSD, Kimberli's residence has, by operation of law, become that of her father, making her an Ohio resident. MSD resents being forced to pay for the educational expenses of a minor whom it regards as an out-of-state resident. MSD challenges the correctness of the NHDOE's interpretation of New Hampshire statutory law so as to charge MSD for Kimberli's educational expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After failing over a period of years to convince New Hampshire education authorities that it should not be held responsible for Kimberli's educational expenses, MSD sued under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2)(A), in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Acting on cross motions for summary judgment, the district court agreed with the NHDOE's interpretation of state law imposing liability for Kimberli's educational expenses upon MSD in the present circumstances.

FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case was disposed of in the district court on cross-motions for summary judgment filed by the plaintiff-appellant, MSD, on the one hand, and, on the other, by the defendants-appellees, Margaret \"Peggy\" Crisman, as Surrogate Parent for Kimberli M., and the Pittsfield School District. We take the facts from the documentary record made by the parties in connection with their cross-motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kimberli M. was born on September 5, 1988, to James and Paula M. in Colorado. In January 1989, while she and her parents were in Manchester, New Hampshire, Kimberli was the victim of an accident that left her blind and severely developmentally delayed. Following several months of medical treatment in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Boston, Massachusetts, Kimberli's parents, with the aid of the New Hampshire Division of Children and Youth Services, placed Kimberli in the Brock Home, located in Pittsfield, New Hampshire, a \"home for children\" licensed by the New Hampshire Department of Mental Health. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 193:27 I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On the application for placement, Kimberli's parents listed their address as 213 Pine Street, Manchester, New Hampshire. Although the parents, James and Paula M., appear to have retained legal custody of Kimberli at this time, they had little or no contact with her after she went to the Brock Home. Her parents moved to South Carolina shortly after Kimberli was placed in the Brock Home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of her several disabilities, Kimberli was entitled under federal and New Hampshire law to receive special education services beginning at the age of three. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(1)(A); N.H.Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In May 1992, the Moore Center Services, Inc.,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> on behalf of Kimberli, requested the NHDOE to make a so-called \"district of liability\" determination to decide which school district in New Hampshire, if any, was responsible to pay for the expenses of Kimberli's education. In a letter dated May 15, 1992, the NHDOE, quoting N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 193:29<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>, notified MSD that MSD was the district of liability for Kimberli because it was the district in which Kimberli had \"most recently resided\" prior to her placement in the Brock Home. Unhappy with this determination, MSD appealed to the Commissioner of Education, Charles H. Marston. The Commissioner affirmed the NHDOE's decision, and MSD sought no further review of the decision at this time although entitled to do so. Therefore, as matters stood, while Kimberli would attend school in the Pittsfield School District where the Brock Home was located, MSD had to pay for her special education costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, James M., Kimberli's father, relocated from South Carolina to Akron, Ohio with his remaining children. On February 1, 1993, Kimberli, along with Mrs. Brock of the Brock Home and an assistant, traveled to Ohio to visit her family. According to MSD (but not appellees), there was some thought at the time to place Kimberli in a facility located in Ohio. The attempted Ohio placement, if it was such, failed, and on February 4, 1993, Kimberli was returned to the Brock Home. MSD believed that the out-of-state trip formed a basis for once again challenging the 1992 NHDOE's district of liability determination. MSD argued, in a letter to the NHDOE, that the four-day trip constituted a move that altered Kimberli's residence, thereby relieving MSD of further liability. The NHDOE rejected MSD's characterization. It determined that the trip to Ohio was a mere visit that did not constitute a change in residence. Thus, the NHDOE determined that MSD remained liable for Kimberli's educational expenses. MSD did not seek review of this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in 1993, the NHDOE appointed an educational surrogate parent, Margaret \"Peggy\" Crisman, to act in the place of Kimberli's parents for purposes of making educational decisions. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:14 III.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Since her appointment, Ms. Crisman has acted on Kimberli's behalf in all matters related to her education. In May 2000, Ms. Crisman became Kimberli's legal guardian.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, James and Paula M. were divorced. James M. was awarded \"residential and legal custody\" of their four children, including Kimberli. Focusing on the 1995 divorce decree, MSD petitioned the NHDOE for yet another district of liability determination. MSD argued that, because James M. had been awarded \"residential\" custody, Kimberli, a minor, had become a resident of Akron, Ohio, where her father resided. MSD reasoned that Akron, and not Manchester, was liable financially for Kimberli's education. Consistent with this theory, MSD administratively discharged Kimberli from special education in 1996, reiterating that her residence, like her father's, was in Akron, Ohio. In response, Ms. Crisman requested a due process hearing before a hearing officer of the NHDOE. That request had the effect of temporarily maintaining the status quo as to Kimberli's placement and MSD's liability for her education expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1997, the hearing officer issued a decision that the doctrines of <i>res judicata</i> and collateral estoppel prevented MSD from re-litigating Kimberli's residency. The hearing officer determined that the NHDOE's 1992 district of liability decision constituted a final order binding upon MSD. However, the hearing officer allowed MSD to \"produce evidence to demonstrate changed circumstances occurring since the 1992 DOL determination which might justify a different result....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking to demonstrate changed circumstances, MSD argued that Kimberli's 1993 trip to Ohio and the divorce decree were new circumstances calling for a different district of liability determination. The hearing officer disagreed. She determined that the 1995 Ohio divorce decree, granting residential custody to Kimberli's father, did not affect the 1992 district of liability determination. She further concluded that any argument that the 1993 trip to Ohio constituted a move was barred by the statute of limitations pursuant to N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:16-b I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD thereupon brought this action in the district court against Crisman, as Kimberli's surrogate parent, and the Pittsfield School District, contesting the hearing officer's conclusion. <i>See</i> note 3, <i>supra.</i> MSD sought a determination that it was no longer financially liable for the special education costs associated with Kimberli's education.

August 4, 1999). The hearing officer concluded that the statutory changes to New Hampshire residency law had no legal bearing on Kimberli's right to special education in New Hampshire or MSD's liability for that education. As an alternative holding, the hearing officer also ruled that, based on the facts before her, Kimberli, although an unemancipated minor, could establish residency in New Hampshire. <i>Id.</i> at 12. If this were so, the Pittsfield School District, and not MSD, would be liable for the costs of Kimberli's education under New Hampshire law. Recognizing the potential implications of her decision, the hearing officer stated \"this finding of Kimberli's residency is secondary to my primary ruling that MSD is responsible for the cost of educating Kimberli... and should not be construed as placing an obligation upon Pittsfield....\" <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At MSD's request, the federal case was reopened and MSD opposed the hearing officer's primary ruling that it was ultimately liable for the costs of Kimberli's education. The Pittsfield School District contested the hearing officer's secondary holding that Kimberli could establish residency in Pittsfield. The parties, including Crisman on behalf of Kimberli, made cross-motions for summary judgment. MSD argued that, pursuant to the newly amended section 193:12 II(a)(2)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and the 1995 divorce decree, Kimberli's legal residence was now Akron, Ohio and as such, Akron and not MSD was liable for the costs of her special education. Pittsfield contended that the hearing officer's conclusion that Kimberli had become a resident of Pittsfield contradicted the legislative purpose behind section 193:29.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Crisman asserted that the hearing officer had correctly interpreted and applied the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After requesting additional briefing and carefully reviewing the statutory language and relevant case law, the district court agreed with the decision of the hearing officer and granted Kimberli judgment as a matter of law. <i>Manchester Sch.

The district court extended the time for filing an appeal until disposition of this motion as allowed by Rule 4(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. In accordance with the orders entered August 1 and September 17, 2001, post-judgment judgment was entered on October 10, 2001. The time for filing an appeal began to run at this time. This appeal timely followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic question on appeal, as it was below, is whether MSD is financially liable for the costs of the special education being furnished to Kimberli by the Pittsfield School District. All parties agree that, while she is living at the Brock Home, Kimberli will attend school in the Pittsfield School District.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The only issue remaining, as a practical matter, is which school district pays for the costs associated with the \"free appropriate public education\" guaranteed to children with educational disabilities. While MSD contends that Kimberli is an Ohio resident and that Ohio should therefore provide and finance her special education, there is no Ohio party involved here and no form of relief of this nature is being sought or is available in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD proffers several arguments to support its contention that it is not financially liable for the costs of Kimberli's education. MSD first argues that, pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(1)(A)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>, and the recently amended New Hampshire law, a New Hampshire School District is not liable for special education programming of a student whose parents do not reside in the state. Second, MSD contends, even if a \"placement-based right\" exists under New Hampshire law, it does not apply in Kimberli's case because she was not properly \"placed\" at the Brock Home within the meaning of the statute. Third, MSD avers that, in the event this court agrees that Kimberli was placed in the Brock Home, <i>res judicata</i> does not bar it from re-litigating the 1992 district of liability determination based on a significant change in circumstances. Finally, MSD urges this court, in light of the recent amendments, to certify to the New Hampshire Supreme Court the question of whether a New Hampshire school district remains liable for the costs of a student's special education if the parents reside out of state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected each of the above arguments. It determined that state law, and not the IDEA, dictated the financial liability of individual local school districts for the costs of a free and appropriate public education. Then, after examining the relevant New Hampshire law, the court concluded, as a matter of law, that the 1998 amendments to section 193:12 did not affect the original district of liability determination made by the NHDOE. Based on the language of the New Hampshire statutes the court determined that: (1) New Hampshire law allowed for an in-state school district to pay for the special education costs of a child whose parents reside outside the state; and (2) Kimberli was \"placed\" in the Brock Home as required by statute. Finally, it denied MSD's post-judgment request for certification, viewing it as a belated procedural maneuver designed to prolong litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case involves only questions of law &#8212; the interpretation of federal and state statutes &#8212; we review the district court's conclusions <i>de novo. Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 287 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir.2002); <i>G.D. v. Westmoreland Sch. Dist.,</i> 930 F.2d 942, 945 (1st Cir.1991). While our review is plenary, New Hampshire, like most states, gives some deference to the reasonable interpretation of a state statute by the state administrative agency charged with the responsibility of enforcing that statute. <i>In re Markievitz,</i> 135 N.H. 455, 606 A.2d 800, 802 (1992); <i>Chambers v. Geiger,</i> 133 N.H. 149, 573 A.2d 1356, 1358 (1990). On issues lacking an overriding federal concern, both federalism and comity suggest we look at the NHDOE's interpretations in a similar light. The Supreme Court of the United States has admonished federal courts, when reviewing cases under the IDEA, to take great care not to displace the educational policy judgments made by state and local public education officials. <i>See Bd. of Educ. of the Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley,</i> 458 U.S. 176, 206, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Federal Law and Financial Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, MSD asserts that \"[a] New Hampshire school district is not required by the [IDEA] to pay for the special education programming of a student whose parents did not and do not reside in either that district or the State of New Hampshire.\" MSD argues from this assumption that the IDEA dictates that financial liability for special education be determined by a student's legal residency and not by any other criterion. Because Kimberli is not, in MSD's view, a \"legal resident\" of New Hampshire, MSD says that it cannot be held liable for her education costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to MSD's position, however, the IDEA contains no provision dictating which district or agency within a state must assume financial liability for special education services. The IDEA nowhere purports to allocate financial liability among the multitude of school districts housed within the fifty states. And while the IDEA, as a condition of federal funding for any state, requires a state to provide a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities \"residing in the State,\" &#167; 1412(a)(1)(A), it does not purport to limit the provision of such an education to children who fit that standard, however interpreted. \"Residing in\" could, of course, include children like Kimberli, who have resided since infancy in a New Hampshire home. But even if the phrase were interpreted to exclude a minor like Kimberli the IDEA does not forbid a state from providing and funding a free appropriate public education to a disabled child who may not be a domiciliary of that state even if, arguably, the state is not required to do so and the child may in fact be a charge under the IDEA upon the custodial parent's state.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal statute, as we say, leaves the assignment and allocation of financial responsibility for special education cost of local school districts to each individual state's legislature. The IDEA provides states with federal funds to help defray the costs of educating children with disabilities. It requires, as a condition of the receipt of federal financial assistance, that a State enact the policies and procedures necessary to ensure that the mandates of the statute are met. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412; 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.600(b). This duty includes the allocation of financial responsibility for certain special education services. &#167; 1412(a)(12)(A)(ii). But it is the New Hampshire legislature, and not Congress, that assigns and allocates liability for the expenses incurred by a school district administering the mandates of the IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases cited by MSD are not to the contrary. <i>See, e.g., Catlin v. Sobol,</i> 93 F.3d 1112, 1115 (2d Cir.1996); <i>Wise v. Ohio Dept. of Ed.,</i> 80 F.3d 177, 182 (6th Cir.1996); <i>Newton Pub. Schs.,</i> 25 IDELR 107 (1996). While each court assigned financial liability to the school district where the parent resided, the determination was based on an interpretation of the law of the relevant state and the particular facts of the case. <i>Catlin,</i> 93 F.3d at 1114 (interpreting New York law); <i>Wise,</i> 80 F.3d at 182 (interpreting Ohio law); <i>Newton Pub. Schs.,</i> 25 IDELR at 107 (interpreting Massachusetts law). While courts have sometimes suggested that there is a presumption that the residency of the student's parents dictates which school district bears the responsibility for meeting the requirements of the IDEA, <i>see Catlin,</i> 93 F.3d at 1122, no court has stated that the IDEA itself mandates that a state make determinations of school district liability based invariably on the parent's residency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore agree with the district court that the IDEA neither dictates the financial liability of particular school districts nor prevents a state from enacting laws providing for the payment of the special education costs of a child living at a school within the state whose parents reside outside the state. Put another way, it is to New Hampshire law, not federal law, to which we must look to determine whether MSD must pay for Kimberli's special education costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. State Law and Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire legislature has provided a statutory framework for assigning responsibility for special education costs as part of the state's responsibility to ensure that children with educational disabilities receive a free appropriate education as mandated by federal law. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:1, <i>et seq.</i> Section 186-C:13<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>, entitled \"Liability for Expenses,\" provides that when a child with educational disabilities is placed in a \"home for children\" the liability for expenses is determined in accordance with section 193:29. Section 193:29 states that for any child \"placed and cared for in a home for children, the sending district shall make payments to the receiving district.\" The statute defines sending and receiving district as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">193:27 Definitions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. \"Sending district\" means the school district in which the child most recently resided other than in a home for children, the home of a relative or friend in which the child is placed by the department of health and human services or a court of competent jurisdiction..., health care facility, or state institution, if such child is not in the legal custody of a parent or if the parent resides outside the state; if the child is retained in the legal custody of a parent residing within the state, \"sending district\" means the school district in which the parent resides....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V. \"Receiving district\" means the school district in which the home for children or health care facility is located....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI. \"School district\" means a school district in the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that MSD was the \"sending district\" and thus liable for the special education services that Kimberli receives from the Pittsfield School District. MSD attacks the district court's determination that it is the \"sending district\" in three ways. First, MSD argues that it can no longer be considered the \"sending district\" because the 1998 amendments to section 193:12 establish that Kimberli is not a \"legal resident\" of New Hampshire. Second, MSD avers that it is not the \"sending district\" because, based on the new definition of \"legal resident\" contained in 193:12, Kimberli never \"resided\" in Manchester prior to her placement at the Brock Home. Third, it contends that Kimberli was not \"placed\" in the Brock Home within the meaning of the statute because her placement was not facilitated by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services or by court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD's first two arguments, that the amendments to section 193:12 relieve it of liability, are without merit. MSD's attempt to make section 193:12, and the definition of \"legal resident\" for purposes of school attendance, the focal point of the financial liability determination for special education costs is a red herring. The definition of legal resident contained in section 193:12 does not affect the particular statutory provisions on which MSD's liability to Kimberli turns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 193:12 makes provisions for where students may attend school. The 1998 amendments<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> to 193:12 provided that a child may not attend a school in a district in which he or she is not a legal resident <i>except</i> in defined circumstances. One of the defined circumstances, of particular relevance to Kimberli's situation, is that a child placed and cared for in a home for children may attend the public school in which the home for children is located. &#167; 193:12 V. Thus, pursuant to section 193:12, Kimberli is appropriately attending school in the Pittsfield School District &#8212; an issue not in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that section 193:12 addresses financial liability rather than only the place of school attendance, it follows the framework developed in section 186-C:13. Paragraph X of section 193:12, also added in 1998, provided that \"[f]or the purpose of determining liability for a child placed or cared for in any home for children or health care facility, the provisions of RSA 193:29 shall apply.\" The legislature thus retained in 1998 the existing provision fixing the liability for the education of students, like Kimberli, placed in a home for children. Section 193:29, as already noted, provides that for any \"child placed in a home for children, the sending district shall make payment to the receiving district.\" Thus, whether the liability analysis begins with section 186-C:13 or section 193:12, it proceeds to section 193:29 and, eventually, to the definition of \"sending district.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD's further contention, that it is no longer the \"sending district\" because the new definition of \"legal resident\" contained in section 193:12 altered the meaning of \"resided\" for purposes of determining the \"sending district,\" is unavailing. According to MSD, because Kimberli's parent were never \"legal residents\" of Manchester, Kimberli could not have \"resided\" in Manchester prior to her placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to MSD's position, the definition of \"sending district\" explicitly accounts for a situation in which a child attends school in New Hampshire and the parents reside outside the state. In those cases, the \"sending district\" is the school district in which the child \"most recently resided\" prior to placement in the home for children. The New Hampshire Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \"most recently resided\" to mean the district in which the child lived prior to his or her placement &#8212; regardless of legal residency. <i>See In re Gary B.,</i> 124 N.H. 28, 466 A.2d 929, 932 (1983) (concluding in the context of 193:27 that resided \"refers to the place where the a child actually lived... rather than to legal residence or domicile\"). <i>Accord</i> New Hampshire Att'y Gen. Op. No. 85-17 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislature, when it amended the definition of \"sending district\" in 1998, kept the language \"in which a child most recently resided.\" The Legislature is presumed to have been cognizant of the judicial interpretation placed upon the phrase \"most recently resided\" and \"to have adopted that construction, in the absence of any change in the phraseology used or other competent evidence of a different purpose.\" <i>Waterman v. Town of Lebanon,</i> 78 N.H. 23, 95 A. 657, 658 (1915); <i>see also In re Cigna Healthcare, Inc.,</i> 146 N.H. 683, 777 A.2d 884, 889 (2001). If the New Hampshire legislature had intended to alter the law with regards to liability determinations, as it did for attendance, it would have amended the language of the statute to reflect such a change. It did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD's third argument, that Kimberli was not \"placed\" in the Brock Home within the meaning of the statute because her placement was not facilitated by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services or by court order, is not supported by the statute or the record. MSD grounds its argument in the 1998 amendments to section 193:27 that inserted into the definition of \"sending district\" the phrase \"the home of a relative or friend in which the child is placed by the department of health and human services or a court of competent jurisdiction\" following a \"home for children.\" MSD argues that the phrase \"placed by the department of health and human services or court of competent jurisdiction\" now modifies the phrase \"home for children.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD's suggested interpretation is not supported by the structure or language of the statute. As noted by the district court, the use of commas to separate the phrases plainly shows an intent by the legislature to limit the placed-by-the-state qualifier to the \"home of a relative or friend.\" The state-involved limitation on the placement of a child with a relative or friend was apparently intended to curb potential abuse of the educational system. When children are placed with a relative or friend other than by state or court direction the parents may simply be sending their children off to cities or towns with better schools so as to obtain a public education believed to be superior to that available in the parents' hometown. In that instance, the district where the parents reside should not be, (and pursuant to 193:27 is not), financially liable for the child's education and thus would not qualify as the \"sending district.\" In contrast, placing a child in a home for children is not likely to be a subterfuge for securing whatever extra educational benefits the home's school district may provide. And to require a child living at such a home to attend school elsewhere, perhaps at a great distance, could be either impossible or enormously difficult.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While, therefore, the clause cited by MSD calling for departmental or court placement does not apply to minors like Kimberli placed in a home for children, we note that the instant record reveals that the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services <i>was</i> involved with Kimberli's placement in the Brock Home. A file memorandum from the Moore Agency, dated May 22, 1989, states that Kimberli was placed in the Brock Home \"by her parents[ ] following the recommendation of State Welfare.\" Paula M., in a letter to the New Hampshire Bureau of Special Education Services dated May 26, 1992, states that she and Kimberli's father placed Kimberli at the Brock Home with the assistance of the Department of Children and Youth Services. Further, Kimberli was and is a client of the Moore Center Services, Inc., an agency which is part of the State of New Hampshire's service delivery system for persons with development disabilities, which has funded and supervised Kimberli's placement since April 11, 1989. Thus, however one reads the statute, Kimberli's placement in a home for children was closely under the auspices of the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given New Hampshire's statutory framework, we find ourselves in accord with the rulings of the district court. The 1998 amendments to the definition of \"legal resident\" for purposes of school attendance in no way served to relieve MSD of its financial responsibility under New Hampshire's statutory scheme. Our statutory interpretation and that of the district court comport with that of the NHDOE, the state agency responsible for the administration of the state laws in question. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:3-a. In 1992, the NHDOE determined that Manchester was the district of liability and financially responsible for the costs of Kimberli's special education. It found that \"[t]he most recent residence of Kimberli other than a licensed home was 213 Pine Street, Manchester, where she lived with her parents from birth to April 11, 1989.\" MSD concedes that it did not, as it could have, appeal from this decision to the State Board of Education or to a court of competent jurisdiction. Consequently, the NHDOE's decision became a final order and is binding upon MSD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only has there been no change in the New Hampshire statutory landscape that would alter the NHDOE's original determination, MSD has not proffered any relevant change in circumstances since the NHDOE's 1992 decision that would entitle it to a different finding. MSD, moreover, is also now collaterally estopped from challenging the NHDOE's 1992 district of liability determination. Under New Hampshire law, administrative decisions are subject to the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Findings of an administrative agency may be given preclusive effect. <i>Day v. N.H. Ret. Sys.,</i> 138 N.H. 120, 635 A.2d 493, 495 (1993). Pursuant to this doctrine, MSD is not now free to challenge NHDOE's finding, made a decade ago, that the district in which Kimberli most recently resided prior to her placement in the Brock Home was Manchester. The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> has also been applied to administrative decisions in New Hampshire. <i>Morin v. N. Heating &amp; Plumbing Co.,</i> 113 N.H. 431, 309 A.2d 153, 155 (1973). Under this doctrine, MSD is barred from challenging the NHDOE's conclusion that it was the district of liability for the costs associated with Kimberli's special education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Certification</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD requests this court to certify to the New Hampshire Supreme Court the question of whether the New Hampshire legislature intended to adopt a \"residence-based theory of liability for a student's special education.\" We decline to do so. Not only is certification unnecessary, as discussed below, it was MSD, the party that initiated this action in the federal court, that now seeks certification to the state court. We have said that \"one who chooses to litigate his state action in a federal forum must ordinarily accept the federal court's reasonable interpretation of extant state law rather than seeking extensions via the certification process.\" <i>Santiago v. Sherwin Williams Co.,</i> 3 F.3d 546, 548 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Croteau v. Olin Corp.,</i> 884 F.2d 45, 46 (1st Cir.1989). Under the IDEA, MSD had the option to bring a civil action \"in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2). MSD moved to re-litigate this issue in the state court only after extensive proceedings in the district court and after it became clear that it would not prevail there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, certification is not warranted here in any event. The state law at issue is not ambiguous. <i>See Basic Controlex Corp., Inc. v. Klockner Moeller Corp.,</i> 202 F.3d 450, 452 (1st Cir.2000). There is controlling state precedent interpreting the New Hampshire statute allocating the financial liability for the education of an educationally disabled child. <i>See Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,</i> 187 F.3d 88, 104 (1st Cir.1999). When state law is sufficiently clear, as it is here, to allow a federal court to predict its course, certification is both inappropriate and an unwarranted burden on the state court. <i>Hugel v. Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &amp; Lerach, LLP,</i> 175 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

Since the age of seven months she has lived at the Brock Home, a state licensed home for children located in Pittsfield, New Hampshire. Because the home for children where Kimberli lives is located within the Pittsfield School District, she attends school there<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>; and because of her disabilities she receives special education services under provisions of federal and state law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But because state educational authorities have determined that MSD was Kimberli's \"sending district,\" as that term is used in the relevant New Hampshire statutes, <i>infra,</i> the New Hampshire Department of Education (\"NHDOE\") requires MSD to reimburse the Pittsfield School District for the cost of the educational services furnished by the latter to Kimberli.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD strenuously objects to being held financially responsible for Kimberli's educational expenses. It points out that Kimberli's parents are not New Hampshire residents. Born in Colorado, Kimberli came, as an infant, with her parents to Manchester, New Hampshire in 1989, where she was severely injured in an accident. At the age of seven months, while her parents were still in Manchester, she was placed, with the assistance of New Hampshire officials, in the Brock Home in Pittsfield, New Hampshire. Soon thereafter her parents left New Hampshire, leaving Kimberli in the Brock Home where she has since resided. In 1995, Kimberli's parents were divorced, with Kimberli's father being awarded custody of the children, including Kimberli, in a divorce decree issued by an Ohio court. Her father resides in Akron, Ohio, and apparently remains satisfied with Kimberli's placement in New Hampshire. Neither parent appears to be involved with her or to contribute to her support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the view of MSD, Kimberli's residence has, by operation of law, become that of her father, making her an Ohio resident. MSD resents being forced to pay for the educational expenses of a minor whom it regards as an out-of-state resident. MSD challenges the correctness of the NHDOE's interpretation of New Hampshire statutory law so as to charge MSD for Kimberli's educational expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After failing over a period of years to convince New Hampshire education authorities that it should not be held responsible for Kimberli's educational expenses, MSD sued under 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2)(A), in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Acting on cross motions for summary judgment, the district court agreed with the NHDOE's interpretation of state law imposing liability for Kimberli's educational expenses upon MSD in the present circumstances.

FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case was disposed of in the district court on cross-motions for summary judgment filed by the plaintiff-appellant, MSD, on the one hand, and, on the other, by the defendants-appellees, Margaret \"Peggy\" Crisman, as Surrogate Parent for Kimberli M., and the Pittsfield School District. We take the facts from the documentary record made by the parties in connection with their cross-motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kimberli M. was born on September 5, 1988, to James and Paula M. in Colorado. In January 1989, while she and her parents were in Manchester, New Hampshire, Kimberli was the victim of an accident that left her blind and severely developmentally delayed. Following several months of medical treatment in Manchester, New Hampshire, and Boston, Massachusetts, Kimberli's parents, with the aid of the New Hampshire Division of Children and Youth Services, placed Kimberli in the Brock Home, located in Pittsfield, New Hampshire, a \"home for children\" licensed by the New Hampshire Department of Mental Health. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 193:27 I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On the application for placement, Kimberli's parents listed their address as 213 Pine Street, Manchester, New Hampshire. Although the parents, James and Paula M., appear to have retained legal custody of Kimberli at this time, they had little or no contact with her after she went to the Brock Home. Her parents moved to South Carolina shortly after Kimberli was placed in the Brock Home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of her several disabilities, Kimberli was entitled under federal and New Hampshire law to receive special education services beginning at the age of three. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(a)(1)(A); N.H.Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In May 1992, the Moore Center Services, Inc.,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> on behalf of Kimberli, requested the NHDOE to make a so-called \"district of liability\" determination to decide which school district in New Hampshire, if any, was responsible to pay for the expenses of Kimberli's education. In a letter dated May 15, 1992, the NHDOE, quoting N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 193:29<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>, notified MSD that MSD was the district of liability for Kimberli because it was the district in which Kimberli had \"most recently resided\" prior to her placement in the Brock Home. Unhappy with this determination, MSD appealed to the Commissioner of Education, Charles H. Marston. The Commissioner affirmed the NHDOE's decision, and MSD sought no further review of the decision at this time although entitled to do so. Therefore, as matters stood, while Kimberli would attend school in the Pittsfield School District where the Brock Home was located, MSD had to pay for her special education costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, James M., Kimberli's father, relocated from South Carolina to Akron, Ohio with his remaining children. On February 1, 1993, Kimberli, along with Mrs. Brock of the Brock Home and an assistant, traveled to Ohio to visit her family. According to MSD (but not appellees), there was some thought at the time to place Kimberli in a facility located in Ohio. The attempted Ohio placement, if it was such, failed, and on February 4, 1993, Kimberli was returned to the Brock Home. MSD believed that the out-of-state trip formed a basis for once again challenging the 1992 NHDOE's district of liability determination. MSD argued, in a letter to the NHDOE, that the four-day trip constituted a move that altered Kimberli's residence, thereby relieving MSD of further liability. The NHDOE rejected MSD's characterization. It determined that the trip to Ohio was a mere visit that did not constitute a change in residence. Thus, the NHDOE determined that MSD remained liable for Kimberli's educational expenses. MSD did not seek review of this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in 1993, the NHDOE appointed an educational surrogate parent, Margaret \"Peggy\" Crisman, to act in the place of Kimberli's parents for purposes of making educational decisions. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:14 III.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Since her appointment, Ms. Crisman has acted on Kimberli's behalf in all matters related to her education. In May 2000, Ms. Crisman became Kimberli's legal guardian.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, James and Paula M. were divorced. James M. was awarded \"residential and legal custody\" of their four children, including Kimberli. Focusing on the 1995 divorce decree, MSD petitioned the NHDOE for yet another district of liability determination. MSD argued that, because James M. had been awarded \"residential\" custody, Kimberli, a minor, had become a resident of Akron, Ohio, where her father resided. MSD reasoned that Akron, and not Manchester, was liable financially for Kimberli's education. Consistent with this theory, MSD administratively discharged Kimberli from special education in 1996, reiterating that her residence, like her father's, was in Akron, Ohio. In response, Ms. Crisman requested a due process hearing before a hearing officer of the NHDOE. That request had the effect of temporarily maintaining the status quo as to Kimberli's placement and MSD's liability for her education expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1997, the hearing officer issued a decision that the doctrines of <i>res judicata</i> and collateral estoppel prevented MSD from re-litigating Kimberli's residency. The hearing officer determined that the NHDOE's 1992 district of liability decision constituted a final order binding upon MSD. However, the hearing officer allowed MSD to \"produce evidence to demonstrate changed circumstances occurring since the 1992 DOL determination which might justify a different result....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking to demonstrate changed circumstances, MSD argued that Kimberli's 1993 trip to Ohio and the divorce decree were new circumstances calling for a different district of liability determination. The hearing officer disagreed. She determined that the 1995 Ohio divorce decree, granting residential custody to Kimberli's father, did not affect the 1992 district of liability determination. She further concluded that any argument that the 1993 trip to Ohio constituted a move was barred by the statute of limitations pursuant to N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:16-b I.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD thereupon brought this action in the district court against Crisman, as Kimberli's surrogate parent, and the Pittsfield School District, contesting the hearing officer's conclusion. <i>See</i> note 3, <i>supra.</i> MSD sought a determination that it was no longer financially liable for the special education costs associated with Kimberli's education. While the case was pending in district court, New Hampshire amended its state residency laws as they related to school attendance. The district court remanded the case to the hearing officer to determine</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">whether the 1998 amendments to RSA 193:12 (in conjunction with the 1995 divorce decree) operated to effectuate a \"change in circumstances\" (i.e. changed the legal residence of a minor child), rendering Kimberli M. no longer legally resident in New Hampshire for educational purposes, therefore relieving MSD of any future obligation to fund her special education (i.e. thereby justifying MSD's decision to prospectively discharge Kimberli from its educational responsibility).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Manchester Sch. Dist. v. Margaret Crisman, as surrogate Parent for Kimberli M. and Pittsfield Sch. Dist.,</i> No. 97-632-M, slip op. at 11 (D.N.H.

August 4, 1999). The hearing officer concluded that the statutory changes to New Hampshire residency law had no legal bearing on Kimberli's right to special education in New Hampshire or MSD's liability for that education. As an alternative holding, the hearing officer also ruled that, based on the facts before her, Kimberli, although an unemancipated minor, could establish residency in New Hampshire. <i>Id.</i> at 12. If this were so, the Pittsfield School District, and not MSD, would be liable for the costs of Kimberli's education under New Hampshire law. Recognizing the potential implications of her decision, the hearing officer stated \"this finding of Kimberli's residency is secondary to my primary ruling that MSD is responsible for the cost of educating Kimberli... and should not be construed as placing an obligation upon Pittsfield....\" <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At MSD's request, the federal case was reopened and MSD opposed the hearing officer's primary ruling that it was ultimately liable for the costs of Kimberli's education. The Pittsfield School District contested the hearing officer's secondary holding that Kimberli could establish residency in Pittsfield. The parties, including Crisman on behalf of Kimberli, made cross-motions for summary judgment. MSD argued that, pursuant to the newly amended section 193:12 II(a)(2)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and the 1995 divorce decree, Kimberli's legal residence was now Akron, Ohio and as such, Akron and not MSD was liable for the costs of her special education. Pittsfield contended that the hearing officer's conclusion that Kimberli had become a resident of Pittsfield contradicted the legislative purpose behind section 193:29.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Crisman asserted that the hearing officer had correctly interpreted and applied the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After requesting additional briefing and carefully reviewing the statutory language and relevant case law, the district court agreed with the decision of the hearing officer and granted Kimberli judgment as a matter of law. <i>Manchester Sch. Dist. v. Margaret Crisman, as Surrogate Parent for Kimberli M., and Pittsfield Sch. Dist.,</i> No. 97-632-M, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">920056</span></span>, at *3 (D.N.H. July 31, 2001). The district court concluded that Kimberli had a \"placement-based right\" to special education in New Hampshire and that MSD was liable for her educational costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment originally entered on August 1, 2001. Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), Manchester filed a Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment and requested that the district court certify the state law questions to the New Hampshire Supreme Court. On September 17, 2001, the district court issued an order denying the motion. Meanwhile, on August 15, 2001, Crisman filed a Motion for Reasonable Attorneys' Fees. The district court extended the time for filing an appeal until disposition of this motion as allowed by Rule 4(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. In accordance with the orders entered August 1 and September 17, 2001, post-judgment judgment was entered on October 10, 2001. The time for filing an appeal began to run at this time. This appeal timely followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic question on appeal, as it was below, is whether MSD is financially liable for the costs of the special education being furnished to Kimberli by the Pittsfield School District. All parties agree that, while she is living at the Brock Home, Kimberli will attend school in the Pittsfield School District.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The only issue remaining, as a practical matter, is which school district pays for the costs associated with the \"free appropriate public education\" guaranteed to children with educational disabilities. While MSD contends that Kimberli is an Ohio resident and that Ohio should therefore provide and finance her special education, there is no Ohio party involved here and no form of relief of this nature is being sought or is available in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD proffers several arguments to support its contention that it is not financially liable for the costs of Kimberli's education. MSD first argues that, pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412(1)(A)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>, and the recently amended New Hampshire law, a New Hampshire School District is not liable for special education programming of a student whose parents do not reside in the state. Second, MSD contends, even if a \"placement-based right\" exists under New Hampshire law, it does not apply in Kimberli's case because she was not properly \"placed\" at the Brock Home within the meaning of the statute. Third, MSD avers that, in the event this court agrees that Kimberli was placed in the Brock Home, <i>res judicata</i> does not bar it from re-litigating the 1992 district of liability determination based on a significant change in circumstances. Finally, MSD urges this court, in light of the recent amendments, to certify to the New Hampshire Supreme Court the question of whether a New Hampshire school district remains liable for the costs of a student's special education if the parents reside out of state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected each of the above arguments. It determined that state law, and not the IDEA, dictated the financial liability of individual local school districts for the costs of a free and appropriate public education. Then, after examining the relevant New Hampshire law, the court concluded, as a matter of law, that the 1998 amendments to section 193:12 did not affect the original district of liability determination made by the NHDOE. Based on the language of the New Hampshire statutes the court determined that: (1) New Hampshire law allowed for an in-state school district to pay for the special education costs of a child whose parents reside outside the state; and (2) Kimberli was \"placed\" in the Brock Home as required by statute. Finally, it denied MSD's post-judgment request for certification, viewing it as a belated procedural maneuver designed to prolong litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this case involves only questions of law &#8212; the interpretation of federal and state statutes &#8212; we review the district court's conclusions <i>de novo. Rochester Ford Sales, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199925\"><a href=\"/opinion/199925/rochester-ford-sales-v-ford-motor-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2002); <i>G.D. v.

While our review is plenary, New Hampshire, like most states, gives some deference to the reasonable interpretation of a state statute by the state administrative agency charged with the responsibility of enforcing that statute. <i>In re Markievitz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></span>, 802 (1992); <i>Chambers v.

On issues lacking an overriding federal concern, both federalism and comity suggest we look at the NHDOE's interpretations in a similar light. The Supreme Court of the United States has admonished federal courts, when reviewing cases under the IDEA, to take great care not to displace the educational policy judgments made by state and local public education officials. <i>See Bd. of Educ. of the Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span>, 206, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Federal Law and Financial Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, MSD asserts that \"[a] New Hampshire school district is not required by the [IDEA] to pay for the special education programming of a student whose parents did not and do not reside in either that district or the State of New Hampshire.\" MSD argues from this assumption that the IDEA dictates that financial liability for special education be determined by a student's legal residency and not by any other criterion. Because Kimberli is not, in MSD's view, a \"legal resident\" of New Hampshire, MSD says that it cannot be held liable for her education costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to MSD's position, however, the IDEA contains no provision dictating which district or agency within a state must assume financial liability for special education services. The IDEA nowhere purports to allocate financial liability among the multitude of school districts housed within the fifty states. And while the IDEA, as a condition of federal funding for any state, requires a state to provide a free appropriate public education to children with disabilities \"residing in the State,\" &#167; 1412(a)(1)(A), it does not purport to limit the provision of such an education to children who fit that standard, however interpreted. \"Residing in\" could, of course, include children like Kimberli, who have resided since infancy in a New Hampshire home. But even if the phrase were interpreted to exclude a minor like Kimberli the IDEA does not forbid a state from providing and funding a free appropriate public education to a disabled child who may not be a domiciliary of that state even if, arguably, the state is not required to do so and the child may in fact be a charge under the IDEA upon the custodial parent's state.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal statute, as we say, leaves the assignment and allocation of financial responsibility for special education cost of local school districts to each individual state's legislature. The IDEA provides states with federal funds to help defray the costs of educating children with disabilities. It requires, as a condition of the receipt of federal financial assistance, that a State enact the policies and procedures necessary to ensure that the mandates of the statute are met. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1412; 34 C.F.R. &#167; 300.600(b). This duty includes the allocation of financial responsibility for certain special education services. &#167; 1412(a)(12)(A)(ii). But it is the New Hampshire legislature, and not Congress, that assigns and allocates liability for the expenses incurred by a school district administering the mandates of the IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases cited by MSD are not to the contrary. <i>See, e.g., Catlin v.

While each court assigned financial liability to the school district where the parent resided, the determination was based on an interpretation of the law of the relevant state and the particular facts of the case. <i>Catlin,</i> 93 F.3d at 1114 (interpreting New York law); <i>Wise,</i> 80 F.3d at 182 (interpreting Ohio law); <i>Newton Pub. Schs.,</i> 25 IDELR at 107 (interpreting Massachusetts law). While courts have sometimes suggested that there is a presumption that the residency of the student's parents dictates which school district bears the responsibility for meeting the requirements of the IDEA, <i>see Catlin,</i> 93 F.3d at 1122, no court has stated that the IDEA itself mandates that a state make determinations of school district liability based invariably on the parent's residency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore agree with the district court that the IDEA neither dictates the financial liability of particular school districts nor prevents a state from enacting laws providing for the payment of the special education costs of a child living at a school within the state whose parents reside outside the state. Put another way, it is to New Hampshire law, not federal law, to which we must look to determine whether MSD must pay for Kimberli's special education costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. State Law and Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The New Hampshire legislature has provided a statutory framework for assigning responsibility for special education costs as part of the state's responsibility to ensure that children with educational disabilities receive a free appropriate education as mandated by federal law. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev. Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:1, <i>et seq.</i> Section 186-C:13<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>, entitled \"Liability for Expenses,\" provides that when a child with educational disabilities is placed in a \"home for children\" the liability for expenses is determined in accordance with section 193:29. Section 193:29 states that for any child \"placed and cared for in a home for children, the sending district shall make payments to the receiving district.\" The statute defines sending and receiving district as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">193:27 Definitions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IV. \"Sending district\" means the school district in which the child most recently resided other than in a home for children, the home of a relative or friend in which the child is placed by the department of health and human services or a court of competent jurisdiction..., health care facility, or state institution, if such child is not in the legal custody of a parent or if the parent resides outside the state; if the child is retained in the legal custody of a parent residing within the state, \"sending district\" means the school district in which the parent resides....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V. \"Receiving district\" means the school district in which the home for children or health care facility is located....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI. \"School district\" means a school district in the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that MSD was the \"sending district\" and thus liable for the special education services that Kimberli receives from the Pittsfield School District. MSD attacks the district court's determination that it is the \"sending district\" in three ways. First, MSD argues that it can no longer be considered the \"sending district\" because the 1998 amendments to section 193:12 establish that Kimberli is not a \"legal resident\" of New Hampshire. Second, MSD avers that it is not the \"sending district\" because, based on the new definition of \"legal resident\" contained in 193:12, Kimberli never \"resided\" in Manchester prior to her placement at the Brock Home. Third, it contends that Kimberli was not \"placed\" in the Brock Home within the meaning of the statute because her placement was not facilitated by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services or by court order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD's first two arguments, that the amendments to section 193:12 relieve it of liability, are without merit. MSD's attempt to make section 193:12, and the definition of \"legal resident\" for purposes of school attendance, the focal point of the financial liability determination for special education costs is a red herring. The definition of legal resident contained in section 193:12 does not affect the particular statutory provisions on which MSD's liability to Kimberli turns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 193:12 makes provisions for where students may attend school. The 1998 amendments<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> to 193:12 provided that a child may not attend a school in a district in which he or she is not a legal resident <i>except</i> in defined circumstances. One of the defined circumstances, of particular relevance to Kimberli's situation, is that a child placed and cared for in a home for children may attend the public school in which the home for children is located. &#167; 193:12 V. Thus, pursuant to section 193:12, Kimberli is appropriately attending school in the Pittsfield School District &#8212; an issue not in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that section 193:12 addresses financial liability rather than only the place of school attendance, it follows the framework developed in section 186-C:13. Paragraph X of section 193:12, also added in 1998, provided that \"[f]or the purpose of determining liability for a child placed or cared for in any home for children or health care facility, the provisions of RSA 193:29 shall apply.\" The legislature thus retained in 1998 the existing provision fixing the liability for the education of students, like Kimberli, placed in a home for children. Section 193:29, as already noted, provides that for any \"child placed in a home for children, the sending district shall make payment to the receiving district.\" Thus, whether the liability analysis begins with section 186-C:13 or section 193:12, it proceeds to section 193:29 and, eventually, to the definition of \"sending district.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD's further contention, that it is no longer the \"sending district\" because the new definition of \"legal resident\" contained in section 193:12 altered the meaning of \"resided\" for purposes of determining the \"sending district,\" is unavailing. According to MSD, because Kimberli's parent were never \"legal residents\" of Manchester, Kimberli could not have \"resided\" in Manchester prior to her placement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to MSD's position, the definition of \"sending district\" explicitly accounts for a situation in which a child attends school in New Hampshire and the parents reside outside the state. In those cases, the \"sending district\" is the school district in which the child \"most recently resided\" prior to placement in the home for children. The New Hampshire Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \"most recently resided\" to mean the district in which the child lived prior to his or her placement &#8212; regardless of legal residency. <i>See In re Gary B.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></span>, 932 (1983) (concluding in the context of 193:27 that resided \"refers to the place where the a child actually lived... rather than to legal residence or domicile\"). <i>Accord</i> New Hampshire Att'y Gen. Op. No. 85-17 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislature, when it amended the definition of \"sending district\" in 1998, kept the language \"in which a child most recently resided.\" The Legislature is presumed to have been cognizant of the judicial interpretation placed upon the phrase \"most recently resided\" and \"to have adopted that construction, in the absence of any change in the phraseology used or other competent evidence of a different purpose.\" <i>Waterman v. Town of Lebanon,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></span>, 658 (1915); <i>see also In re Cigna Healthcare, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></span>, 889 (2001). If the New Hampshire legislature had intended to alter the law with regards to liability determinations, as it did for attendance, it would have amended the language of the statute to reflect such a change. It did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD's third argument, that Kimberli was not \"placed\" in the Brock Home within the meaning of the statute because her placement was not facilitated by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services or by court order, is not supported by the statute or the record. MSD grounds its argument in the 1998 amendments to section 193:27 that inserted into the definition of \"sending district\" the phrase \"the home of a relative or friend in which the child is placed by the department of health and human services or a court of competent jurisdiction\" following a \"home for children.\" MSD argues that the phrase \"placed by the department of health and human services or court of competent jurisdiction\" now modifies the phrase \"home for children.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD's suggested interpretation is not supported by the structure or language of the statute. As noted by the district court, the use of commas to separate the phrases plainly shows an intent by the legislature to limit the placed-by-the-state qualifier to the \"home of a relative or friend.\" The state-involved limitation on the placement of a child with a relative or friend was apparently intended to curb potential abuse of the educational system. When children are placed with a relative or friend other than by state or court direction the parents may simply be sending their children off to cities or towns with better schools so as to obtain a public education believed to be superior to that available in the parents' hometown. In that instance, the district where the parents reside should not be, (and pursuant to 193:27 is not), financially liable for the child's education and thus would not qualify as the \"sending district.\" In contrast, placing a child in a home for children is not likely to be a subterfuge for securing whatever extra educational benefits the home's school district may provide. And to require a child living at such a home to attend school elsewhere, perhaps at a great distance, could be either impossible or enormously difficult.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While, therefore, the clause cited by MSD calling for departmental or court placement does not apply to minors like Kimberli placed in a home for children, we note that the instant record reveals that the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services <i>was</i> involved with Kimberli's placement in the Brock Home. A file memorandum from the Moore Agency, dated May 22, 1989, states that Kimberli was placed in the Brock Home \"by her parents[ ] following the recommendation of State Welfare.\" Paula M., in a letter to the New Hampshire Bureau of Special Education Services dated May 26, 1992, states that she and Kimberli's father placed Kimberli at the Brock Home with the assistance of the Department of Children and Youth Services. Further, Kimberli was and is a client of the Moore Center Services, Inc., an agency which is part of the State of New Hampshire's service delivery system for persons with development disabilities, which has funded and supervised Kimberli's placement since April 11, 1989. Thus, however one reads the statute, Kimberli's placement in a home for children was closely under the auspices of the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given New Hampshire's statutory framework, we find ourselves in accord with the rulings of the district court. The 1998 amendments to the definition of \"legal resident\" for purposes of school attendance in no way served to relieve MSD of its financial responsibility under New Hampshire's statutory scheme. Our statutory interpretation and that of the district court comport with that of the NHDOE, the state agency responsible for the administration of the state laws in question. <i>See</i> N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 186-C:3-a. In 1992, the NHDOE determined that Manchester was the district of liability and financially responsible for the costs of Kimberli's special education. It found that \"[t]he most recent residence of Kimberli other than a licensed home was 213 Pine Street, Manchester, where she lived with her parents from birth to April 11, 1989.\" MSD concedes that it did not, as it could have, appeal from this decision to the State Board of Education or to a court of competent jurisdiction. Consequently, the NHDOE's decision became a final order and is binding upon MSD.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only has there been no change in the New Hampshire statutory landscape that would alter the NHDOE's original determination, MSD has not proffered any relevant change in circumstances since the NHDOE's 1992 decision that would entitle it to a different finding. MSD, moreover, is also now collaterally estopped from challenging the NHDOE's 1992 district of liability determination. Under New Hampshire law, administrative decisions are subject to the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Findings of an administrative agency may be given preclusive effect. <i>Day v. N.H. Ret. Sys.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></span>, 495 (1993). Pursuant to this doctrine, MSD is not now free to challenge NHDOE's finding, made a decade ago, that the district in which Kimberli most recently resided prior to her placement in the Brock Home was Manchester. The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> has also been applied to administrative decisions in New Hampshire. <i>Morin v. N. Heating &amp; Plumbing Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2355569\"><a href=\"/opinion/2355569/morin-v-jh-valliere-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></span>, 155 (1973). Under this doctrine, MSD is barred from challenging the NHDOE's conclusion that it was the district of liability for the costs associated with Kimberli's special education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Certification</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MSD requests this court to certify to the New Hampshire Supreme Court the question of whether the New Hampshire legislature intended to adopt a \"residence-based theory of liability for a student's special education.\" We decline to do so. Not only is certification unnecessary, as discussed below, it was MSD, the party that initiated this action in the federal court, that now seeks certification to the state court. We have said that \"one who chooses to litigate his state action in a federal forum must ordinarily accept the federal court's reasonable interpretation of extant state law rather than seeking extensions via the certification process.\" <i>Santiago v. Sherwin Williams Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628965\"><a href=\"/opinion/628965/monica-santiago-v-sherwin-williams-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 548 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Croteau v. Olin Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528447\"><a href=\"/opinion/528447/paul-croteau-v-olin-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.1989). Under the IDEA, MSD had the option to bring a civil action \"in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States.\" 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1415(i)(2). MSD moved to re-litigate this issue in the state court only after extensive proceedings in the district court and after it became clear that it would not prevail there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, certification is not warranted here in any event. The state law at issue is not ambiguous. <i>See Basic Controlex Corp., Inc. v. Klockner Moeller Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198815\"><a href=\"/opinion/198815/basic-controlex-v-klockner-moeller/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 452 (1st Cir.2000). There is controlling state precedent interpreting the New Hampshire statute allocating the financial liability for the education of an educationally disabled child. <i>See Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765609\"><a href=\"/opinion/765609/elizabeth-trull-nathaniel-trull-by-his-father-and-next-friend-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir.1999). When state law is sufficiently clear, as it is here, to allow a federal court to predict its course, certification is both inappropriate and an unwarranted burden on the state court. <i>Hugel v.

Congress's intent in the IDEA was, at a minimum, to provide a free appropriate public education to all disabled children residing in the state. Given Congress's overall wish to assist children with disabilities, it would make little sense to read into the IDEA an implied prohibition forbidding a state from providing public educational services to children like Kimberli who are present in the state although their parents are elsewhere. Whether New Hampshire is more generous than is strictly required for it to meet the IDEA's minimum standard for state funding is not a matter that offends against Congress's purposes in the IDEA nor does it offend any specific language in the IDEA</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> This statute is set out, in relevant part, in the Appendix at the end of this opinion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Previously, 193:12 provided that \"No person shall attend school, or send a pupil to school, in any district in which he is not an inhabitant, without the consent of the district or of the school board except as herein otherwise provided.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
