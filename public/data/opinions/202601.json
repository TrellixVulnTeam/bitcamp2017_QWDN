Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Bahig F. Bishay on brief pro se.\n     Elise Busny, James W. Stoll and Brown Rudnick Berlack Israels\nLLP on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            January 19, 2007\n\f            Per    Curiam.      We   affirm   the   judgment     of    dismissal\n\nsubstantially for the reasons recited in the district court’s\n\nmemorandum and order, see 2005 WL 2514929 (D. Mass. 2005), adding\n\nonly the following comments.\n\n            To recover an unpaid loan, appellee Citizens Bank of\n\nMassachusetts (“Citizens”) brought a state court action in 1995\n\nagainst appellant Bishay and a company he owned (collectively\n\n“Bishay”).      Bishay filed two counterclaims and later applied for\n\nbankruptcy protection.        The ensuing reorganization plan contained\n\na    reservation    clause,    which   permitted     Bishay     to    pursue   his\n\ncounterclaims on condition that he procure a letter of credit\n\n(“LOC”) to compensate Citizens for its expenses if it prevailed in\n\nstate court.       Bishay did so and then added four new counterclaims\n\nin an amended filing.        At the summary judgment stage, the superior\n\ncourt concluded that the four new claims were not covered by the\n\nreservation clause and were subject to dismissal on preclusion\n\ngrounds.     The court rejected the original two claims on other\n\ngrounds and later awarded attorney’s fees to Citizens. When Bishay\n\nrefused to make payment, Citizens collected its fees award in 1999\n\nby drawing on the LOC.           The state appeals court subsequently\n\naffirmed.    See 56 Mass. App. Ct. 1104 (2002).\n\n            Bishay filed the instant action in 2005.            In six counts,\n\nhe    charged     that   Citizens’     draw   on    the   LOC    violated      the\n\nreorganization plan and was actionable on various grounds including\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fbreach of contract.       But his underlying allegations mirrored those\n\nhe had earlier advanced in state court.              For example, the LOC draw\n\nwas   supposedly   unlawful     (or    at    least     premature)    because     the\n\nreservation   clause      had   been    misinterpreted      and     he   had    been\n\nwrongfully    denied    the     opportunity       to    pursue     his   four    new\n\ncounterclaims.      The    district     court     deemed    the    complaint     “an\n\nimproper   collateral     attack”      on   the   state    court    judgment     and\n\nconcluded that “Bishay’s recasting of his dissatisfaction with the\n\nadverse rulings of [the state] courts into a breach of contract\n\nclaim ... does not alter the fact of preclusion.”                  We agree.\n\n           The precise nature of Bishay’s breach of contract claim--\n\nthe only claim he has pursued on appeal–-is unclear.                 At times, he\n\nappears to be raising a procedural objection: that disposition of\n\nhis counterclaims at the summary judgment stage was improper\n\nbecause the reservation clause entitled him to prosecute his claims\n\nthrough trial.     At other times, he appears to be raising a more\n\nsubstantive objection: that the reservation clause barred Citizens\n\nfrom relying on a preclusion defense, regardless of the procedural\n\nmechanism chosen to do so.              Yet this ambiguity need not be\n\nresolved, since both of these arguments involve the scope of the\n\nreservation clause.       That issue has already been decided in state\n\ncourt, whose rulings are entitled to full faith and credit. Bishay\n\ncannot now relitigate the matter in federal court.                  See generally\n\nMcDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f(applying    Massachusetts   law   of   claim    preclusion);    Johnson   v.\n\nMahoney, 424 F.3d 83, 93 (1st Cir. 2005) (applying Massachusetts law\n\nof issue preclusion).\n\n            Bishay argues that his contract claim is not subject to\n\npreclusion because it did not exist in 1996 when he filed his\n\namended counterclaims in state court.       But his attempt to lump all\n\nsuch   claims   together   for   purposes   of   preclusion     analysis   is\n\nmisplaced.      The superior court found the counterclaims to be\n\nprecluded by the bankruptcy court ruling. See, e.g., In re Belmont\n\nRealty Corp., 11 F.3d 1092, 1095 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting that\n\n“normal rules of res judicata apply to decisions of bankruptcy\n\ncourts”). By contrast, the district court found the contract claim\n\nto be precluded by the state court judgment.            That the contract\n\nclaim may not have existed in 1996 had no bearing on the district\n\ncourt’s analysis.\n\n            Bishay also asserts that Citizens “opened the door” to\n\nhis bringing the contract claim when it drew on the LOC in 1999.\n\nYet his objections to the LOC draw, rather than advancing any new\n\nbasis for relief, simply reproduce the arguments earlier resolved\n\nby the state court regarding the scope of the reservation clause.\n\nThe district court properly rejected this attempt to get a second\n\nbite of the apple.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
