The  plaintiff,  having\n                               \n\nsupplied steel to a now bankrupt subcontractor, has sued the\n\ngeneral contractor, seeking to recover payment for the steel\n\nfrom  the  bond that  a  federal  statute, the  Miller  Act,\n\nrequires  certain general contractors to provide.  40 U.S.C.\n\n   270a-270b.   The  general contractor  says the steel  was\n\ndefective, and it wants to deduct from the promised purchase\n\nprice the amount  that it says it  had to spend to  cure the\n\ndefects.

We  disagree  with  the  Ninth  Circuit.    We\n\ntherefore vacate the district court's judgment.\n\n                             I\n\n                         Background\n                                   \n\n          The  Miller   Act  requires   general  contractors\n\nworking  on federal government projects to furnish a payment\n\nbond \"for the protection of all persons supplying  labor and\n\nmaterial\"  to the  project.   40  U.S.C.    270a(a)(2).   It\n\npermits   a   supplier  who   has   a  \"direct   contractual\n\nrelationship  with  a   subcontractor  but  no   contractual\n\nrelationship . . . with  the contractor furnishing\" the bond\n\nto sue on the bond for \"the balance . . . unpaid at the time\n\nof institution\" of  the suit, and  to recover \"judgment  for\n\nthe sum or sums justly due him,\" as long as he complies with\n\ncertain notice  requirements.  Id.   270b(a).  Puerto Rico's\n                                  \n\n\"Little Miller  Act\" sets  up a similar  scheme for  work on\n\nprojects  undertaken by  the Puerto  Rican  government.   22\n\nL.P.R.A.    47, 51.\n\n          The  plaintiff,   United  Structures   of  America\n\n(\"United\"),  supplied  steel  to  a   subcontractor  on  two\n\nprojects,  one for the United States government at Roosevelt\n\nRoads   Naval  Station,  the  other  for  the  Puerto  Rican\n\ngovernment at  Hato  Rey  Police  Headquarters.    Defendant\n\nG.R.G.  Engineering (\"GRG\")  was the  general  contractor on\n\nboth  projects.   The  subcontractor did  not pay  United in\n\nfull.  When the subcontractor went bankrupt, United gave GRG\n\nproper notice, and then sued  GRG (and GRG's insurer) on the\n\npayment  bond for  the amounts it  believed were  still due,\n\napproximately $105,000  for the Roosevelt  Roads project and\n\n$177,000 for the police station project.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          United  moved  for   summary  judgment,  attaching\n\nvarious bills  and receipts in  support of its claims.   GRG\n\nopposed the summary  judgment motion.   An affidavit (and  a\n\nfew working papers) of Luis  Marin Aponte, a GRG partner and\n\nlicensed  engineer, constituted  GRG's only  effort to  \"set\n\nforth specific facts  showing that there is a genuine issue\"\n\nthat might warrant a trial, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).   Marin's\n\naffidavit said that GRG did not owe United any money because\n\n(1) United engaged in a fraudulent billing practice known as\n\n\"front loading\"; (2) GRG had to spend \"$88,887 . . . due to\"\n\nUnited's \"non-compliance  with  the  specifications  of  the\n\nequipment supplied\" for the Roosevelt Roads project; and (3)\n\nGRG  had to spend an  additional \"$107,622 .  . . to correct\n\ndefects  and/or deficiencies in  the materials\"  that United\n\n\"furnished\" for the police station project.\n\n          The  district court  granted  summary judgment  in\n\nfavor of United, holding  (1) that this affidavit failed  to\n\nprovide,  or  to  point to,  any  specific  factual evidence\n\nsupporting  GRG's  \"front  loading\"  theory;  (2)  that  the\n\nevidence regarding allegedly defective steel was  irrelevant\n\nbecause  the law does  not give GRG  \"the right to  assert a\n\nset-off defense\";  and (3) that  GRG, in any event,  had not\n\n\"offered specific evidence  in support of\"  its allegations,\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n\"for  example,   an  affidavit  prepared   by  an   engineer\n\ntestifying that the materials were indeed defective.\"  \n\n          GRG then  moved for  reconsideration.  It  pointed\n\nout that Marin, its affiant, was indeed a licensed engineer,\n\nand  it  provided  a  few  additional  documents  and  bills\n\nsuggesting possible defects and related costs.  The district\n\ncourt,   although  it   acknowledged  Marin's   professional\n\nqualifications,  denied  the   motion  for  reconsideration,\n\nsolely on the basis of  the Ninth Circuit's holding that the\n\nMiller Act does not \"allow[]  a set-off defense by a general\n\ncontractor not  in privity  with\" a  supplier.   Avanti, 750\n                                                       \n\nF.2d at 762.\n\n          GRG  now  appeals,  claiming  primarily  that  the\n\ndistrict  court and  the Ninth  Circuit  have not  correctly\n\ninterpreted  the Miller  Act with  regard  to the  \"set-off\"\n\nissue.  We agree with GRG.\n\n                             II\n\n                  Analyzing the \"Set-off\"\n                                         \n\n          In Avanti, the  Ninth Circuit considered a  set of\n                   \n\nfacts  virtually  identical  to  the facts  before  us.    A\n\nsubcontractor  on a government  project bought steel  from a\n\nsupplier; the subcontractor went bankrupt; the supplier sued\n\nthe  general contractor  on  its Miller  Act  bond; and  the\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\ngeneral  contractor asserted,  as  a  defense,  a  claim  of\n\ndamages  arising   from  \"late  and   defective  shipments.\"\n\nAvanti, 750  F.2d at 760.   The  Ninth Circuit held  that \"a\n      \n\nset-off defense  is not available  in a Miller Act  claim in\n\nthe absence of privity.\"   It added that \"allowing a set-off\n\ndefense by  a general  contractor not  in privity with  [the\n\nsupplier]  would unduly burden the enforcement of the rights\n\ncreated by the Act.\"  Id. at 762.\n                         \n\n          We disagree with the Ninth Circuit.  We believe it\n\nappropriate to draw a distinction that the Ninth Circuit did\n\nnot  draw, namely a  technical distinction between  what the\n\nlaw normally calls  a \"setoff\" (or \"set-off,\"  or \"offset\"),\n\nand what it calls \"recoupment.\"   The law dictionary defines\n\na  \"setoff\" as a \"counter-claim demand which defendant holds\n\nagainst plaintiff, arising out of a transaction extrinsic of\n                                                            \n\nplaintiff's cause of  action.\"  Black's Law  Dictionary 1230\n                            \n\n(5th ed.  1979) (emphasis added).   If Smith sues  Jones for\n\n$10,000 for grain  that Smith supplied,  and Jones seeks  to\n\nreduce   the  judgment   by   $5,000  representing   Smith's\n\n(unrelated) unpaid rental of Jones' summer cottage, Jones is\n\nseeking a  setoff.  \"Recoupment,\"  on the other hand,  is \"a\n                 \n\nreduction  or  rebate  by  the  defendant  of  part  of  the\n\nplaintiff's  claim because  of  a  right  in  the  defendant\n\n                            -6-\n                             6\n\narising out of the same transaction.\"  Id. at 1147 (emphasis\n                                          \n\nadded).   If  Smith sues  Jones for  $10,000 for  grain that\n\nSmith supplied, and  Jones seeks to  reduce the judgment  by\n\n$5,000 representing  Jones' expenditure  to dry  out Smith's\n\n(defectively) wet grain  (or the cost of  buying replacement\n\ngrain, or  the  grain's  lost value),  Jones  is  seeking  a\n\nrecoupment.\n          \n\n          This distinction, although  somewhat technical, is\n\nwell established in  the law.   See, e.g., In re  B &amp; L  Oil\n                                                            \n\nCo., 782 F.2d 155, 157 (10th Cir. 1986); 1 David G.  Epstein\n   \n\net al., Bankruptcy    6-45, at 703  (1992) (\"setoff involves\n\nmutual  debts  arising   from  unrelated  transactions   and\n                                                      \n\nrecoupment covers reciprocal obligations arising  out of the\n\nsame transaction\")  (footnotes omitted);  Michael E.

See\n                                                            \n\ngenerally  20  Am.

After  all, a  grain\n\nbuyer who wants  to deduct from the contract  price the cost\n\nof drying the defectively wet grain might say that he simply\n\nwants to  \"set off\" the  drying costs  against the  contract\n\nprice.    Lawyers, too,  might  fall  into  this  manner  of\n\nspeaking, for often the technical legal distinction does not\n\nmatter.   See,  e.g., B &amp;  L Oil,  782 F.2d at  157 (\"Modern\n                                \n\nrules  of pleading  have diminished  the  importance of  the\n\ncommon-law  distinctions  surrounding   recoupment  and  its\n\ncompanion,  setoff.\"); 20  Am.  Jur. 2d     10 (1965)  (\"The\n\ndistinctions between  . .  .  recoupment and  setoff are  no\n\nlonger of  much importance . . . .\").   In a few specialized\n\ncircumstances,  however,   the  difference  takes   on  more\n\nsignificance.\n\n          One  such circumstance is bankruptcy.  The unusual\n\nnature of bankruptcy proceedings means that certain devices,\n\nordinarily available  to creditors  seeking to  recover from\n\ndebtors, may be unavailable when  the debtor is in, or near,\n\nbankruptcy.   Among these  devices is  setoff, which  may be\n\nused  by a  creditor against an  insolvent debtor  who later\n\nfiles for bankruptcy only under the circumstances  described\n\nin  11  U.S.C.     553,  and against  a  debtor  already  in\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nbankruptcy only by  seeking relief from the  automatic stay,\n\n11 U.S.C.   362(a)(7).  See  1 Epstein et al., supra,     3-\n                                                    \n\n15, 6-38  to 6-44.  The  reason is that the  bankruptcy laws\n\nare generally designed  to maximize the debtor's  assets for\n\nthe benefit  of all creditors,  and allowing  a creditor  to\n\ninvoke setoff might  allow the creditor an  unfair advantage\n\nover other creditors (the creditor, by reducing  the debt he\n\nowes the debtor dollar for  dollar against the debt owed him\n\nby the debtor,  receives full  value for  the latter  simply\n\nbecause he  owed money to  the debtor).  Thus,  returning to\n\nour earlier example, if Smith  is in bankruptcy and Jones is\n\npermitted  to  reduce his  $10,000  grain debt  to  Smith by\n\n$5,000 because of  the unpaid cottage rental,  Jones has (1)\n\ndeprived the estate of $5,000 it would otherwise have had to\n\nbenefit other creditors;  and (2) received full value on his\n\n$5,000  claim  against Smith,  even  though other  creditors\n\nmight not receive full value. \n\n          Recoupment,  on the other hand, is not a mechanism\n\nwhich  reduces mutual debts  \"for the sake  of convenience,\"\n\nid.    6-45, at 704  (describing setoff), but rather  is \"in\n   \n\nthe nature of  a defense\" and is  intended to \"permit .  . .\n\njudgment to be rendered that does justice in view of the one\n\ntransaction as  a whole.\"   Rothensies  v. Electric  Storage\n                                                            \n\n                            -9-\n                             9\n\nBattery Co., 329 U.S. 296, 299 (1946); see also 4 Collier on\n                                               \n\nBankruptcy   553.03, at 553-17  (Lawrence P. King, ed., 15th\n\ned. 1993) (point of recoupment is to \"arriv[e] at a just and\n\nproper liability\" on the plaintiff's  claim).  As such, when\n\na  debtor in  bankruptcy  seeks to  recover from  a creditor\n\nwhose claim  against  the  debtor arises  out  of  the  same\n\ntransaction, allowing the creditor to recoup  damages simply\n\nallows the debtor precisely what  it is due when viewing the\n\ntransaction \"as  a whole.\"   So although  it might  not make\n\nsense  to  allow   Jones  to  claim  a  setoff   in  Smith's\n                                              \n\nbankruptcy, allowing Jones to recoup  the $5,000 that he had\n                                    \n\nto spend  to dry out  Smith's defective grain seems  fair to\n\nall concerned, perhaps because a  debtor has, in a sense, no\n\nright to  funds subject to  recoupment.  See In  re Holford,\n                                                           \n\n896  F.2d 176,  179  (5th  Cir. 1990).    This explains  why\n\nrecoupment  is  not expressly  regulated  by the  Bankruptcy\n\nCode; some  courts even  find recoupment  unaffected by  the\n\nautomatic stay.   See id.; 1 Epstein  et al., supra,   6-45,\n                                                   \n\nat  712 &amp;  n.36.    Whether a  creditor's  action against  a\n\nbankrupt debtor is characterized as a setoff or a recoupment\n\nwill,  therefore, have important  effects on  the creditor's\n\nability to prosecute the action.\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\n          The  Miller Act  seems  to  us  to  offer  another\n\nsituation  in  which  one  should  distinguish  setoff  from\n\nrecoupment.  The  language of the Act permits  a supplier to\n\nrecover, not the  full contract price, but  the \"sums justly\n\ndue him.\"   40 U.S.C.    270b(a).  In  our view, the  aim of\n\nrecoupment,  \"do[ing] justice in view of the one transaction\n\nas  a whole,\"  Rothensies, 329  U.S. at  299, would  seem to\n                         \n\nmatch  the statute's  requirement  of determining  the  sums\n\n\"justly  due\" a  supplier, making recoupment  an appropriate\n\ndefense in Miller Act cases.  Indeed, we do not see  how the\n\nfull  contract price  of  goods  supplied  can  possibly  be\n\n\"justly due\" a person who supplied defective goods.  Setoff,\n\non the other hand, has  less bearing on whether a particular\n\nsum is  \"justly due\"  the claimant,  since setoff  functions\n\nmostly  as a  convenient  method  of  dealing  with  mutual,\n\nunrelated  debts.   Since a  true setoff  is not  before us,\n\nhowever, we  need only note  the difference and need  not go\n\nbeyond the subject of recoupment to consider when or whether\n\nsetoff is unavailable under the Miller Act.\n\n          Further, the  policies underlying  the Miller  Act\n\nseem to permit recoupment.   The Act is intended \"to protect\n\nthose  whose labor and  materials go into  public projects,\"\n\nClifford  F. MacEvoy  Co.  v. United  States ex  rel.

We\n\nknow this  is true because  a Miller Act claim  brought by a\n\nsubcontractor  who is in privity with the general contractor\n                     \n\n\"is  subject to reduction\" for \"defective articles or work,\"\n\neven  though the subcontractor's  \"labor and materials\" were\n\nas much a  part of the project  as were those of  an out-of-\n\nprivity supplier.   8  John C.

On  the contrary,  disallowing\n      \n\nrecoupment would seem to give the supplier \"rights\" to which\n\nhis contract does not entitle him.\n\n          In short,  neither  United nor  the  Avanti  court\n                                                     \n\nitself has  pointed to  any policy of  the Miller  Act which\n\nwould be served by the Avanti rule,  nor can we imagine what\n                             \n\nsuch a  policy would be.   We have examined  the legislative\n\nhistory  of the  Miller  Act, and  the  cases and  treatises\n\ndiscussing it,  but we have found nothing  that suggests the\n\nconclusion reached in Avanti.  The materials and policies we\n                            \n\nhave considered, and the language of the statute,  point the\n\nother way.\n\n          For  these reasons,  we conclude that  the general\n\ncontractor in this case  is entitled to assert a  recoupment\n\ntype of defense.  Insofar as GRG shows that United delivered\n\ndefective goods that failed to meet contract specifications,\n\nand proves reasonably  foreseeable damages  caused by  those\n\ndefects, GRG may reduce the award to United by the amount of\n\nthose damages.  \n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n          United also  asserted a claim  under Puerto Rico's\n\nLittle Miller  Act (for  the police  station project).   Our\n\nreview of  that Act has  suggested no reason why  the result\n\nshould   be  different.      We   note   our   belief   that\n\n\"compensation,\"  the  Puerto  Rican  equivalent  of   setoff\n\ndiscussed  at length by the  parties and the district court,\n\nsee 31 L.P.R.A.    3221-22; Garcia Mendez  v.

Supp. 985,  988-89 (D.P.R. 1977), is as  inapplicable\n\nto  this case  as setoff  itself,  since compensation,  like\n\nsetoff,  is  primarily  a  device  allowing  the  convenient\n\nsimplification  of   relations  between   mutually  indebted\n\nparties.  See  Walla Corp. v.

The district court, therefore,  should reconsider\n\nthe  motion.   The  summary  judgment  record,  however,  is\n\nsomewhat  confused  because  GRG  presented some  pieces  of\n\nevidence  in  its  initial opposition  and  other  pieces of\n\nevidence when  it moved  for reconsideration.   Under  these\n\ncircumstances, we shall ask the district  court to begin the\n\nsummary judgment proceedings  anew, so that the  parties and\n\nthe court may proceed under the proper legal standard.  GRG,\n\nhowever, may  raise only  the issue of  recoupment.   In all\n\nother  respects,  the  court  will  assume  that  United  is\n\nentitled to summary judgment.\n\n          The  judgment of  the  district court  is vacated.\n\nThe plaintiff may file a  new motion for summary judgment in\n\nthe  district court.    The defendant  may  not oppose  that\n\nmotion on the  issue of liability,  but may contest  damages\n\nbased  on the principles  of recoupment as  outlined in this\n\nopinion.\n\n          So ordered.\n                     \n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n",

Puerto Rico's\n                                  \n\n\"Little Miller  Act\" sets  up a similar  scheme for  work on\n\nprojects  undertaken by  the Puerto  Rican  government.   22\n\nL.P.R.A.    47, 51.\n\n          The  plaintiff,   United  Structures   of  America\n\n(\"United\"),  supplied  steel  to  a   subcontractor  on  two\n\nprojects,  one for the United States government at Roosevelt\n\nRoads   Naval  Station,  the  other  for  the  Puerto  Rican\n\ngovernment at  Hato  Rey  Police  Headquarters.    Defendant\n\nG.R.G.  Engineering (\"GRG\")  was the  general  contractor on\n\nboth  projects.   The  subcontractor did  not pay  United in\n\nfull.  When the subcontractor went bankrupt, United gave GRG\n\nproper notice, and then sued  GRG (and GRG's insurer) on the\n\npayment  bond for  the amounts it  believed were  still due,\n\napproximately $105,000  for the Roosevelt  Roads project and\n\n$177,000 for the police station project.\n\n                            -3-\n                             3\n\n          United  moved  for   summary  judgment,  attaching\n\nvarious bills  and receipts in  support of its claims.   GRG\n\nopposed the summary  judgment motion.   An affidavit (and  a\n\nfew working papers) of Luis  Marin Aponte, a GRG partner and\n\nlicensed  engineer, constituted  GRG's only  effort to  \"set\n\nforth specific facts  showing that there is a genuine issue\"\n\nthat might warrant a trial, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).   Marin's\n\naffidavit said that GRG did not owe United any money because\n\n(1) United engaged in a fraudulent billing practice known as\n\n\"front loading\"; (2) GRG had to spend \"$88,887 . . . due to\"\n\nUnited's \"non-compliance  with  the  specifications  of  the\n\nequipment supplied\" for the Roosevelt Roads project; and (3)\n\nGRG  had to spend an  additional \"$107,622 .  . . to correct\n\ndefects  and/or deficiencies in  the materials\"  that United\n\n\"furnished\" for the police station project.\n\n          The  district court  granted  summary judgment  in\n\nfavor of United, holding  (1) that this affidavit failed  to\n\nprovide,  or  to  point to,  any  specific  factual evidence\n\nsupporting  GRG's  \"front  loading\"  theory;  (2)  that  the\n\nevidence regarding allegedly defective steel was  irrelevant\n\nbecause  the law does  not give GRG  \"the right to  assert a\n\nset-off defense\";  and (3) that  GRG, in any event,  had not\n\n\"offered specific evidence  in support of\"  its allegations,\n\n                            -4-\n                             4\n\n\"for  example,   an  affidavit  prepared   by  an   engineer\n\ntestifying that the materials were indeed defective.\"  \n\n          GRG then  moved for  reconsideration.  It  pointed\n\nout that Marin, its affiant, was indeed a licensed engineer,\n\nand  it  provided  a  few  additional  documents  and  bills\n\nsuggesting possible defects and related costs.  The district\n\ncourt,   although  it   acknowledged  Marin's   professional\n\nqualifications,  denied  the   motion  for  reconsideration,\n\nsolely on the basis of  the Ninth Circuit's holding that the\n\nMiller Act does not \"allow[]  a set-off defense by a general\n\ncontractor not  in privity  with\" a  supplier.

A\n\nsubcontractor  on a government  project bought steel  from a\n\nsupplier; the subcontractor went bankrupt; the supplier sued\n\nthe  general contractor  on  its Miller  Act  bond; and  the\n\n                            -5-\n                             5\n\ngeneral  contractor asserted,  as  a  defense,  a  claim  of\n\ndamages  arising   from  \"late  and   defective  shipments.\"\n\nAvanti, 750  F.2d at 760.   The  Ninth Circuit held  that \"a\n      \n\nset-off defense  is not available  in a Miller Act  claim in\n\nthe absence of privity.\"   It added that \"allowing a set-off\n\ndefense by  a general  contractor not  in privity with  [the\n\nsupplier]  would unduly burden the enforcement of the rights\n\ncreated by the Act.\"  Id. at 762.\n                         \n\n          We disagree with the Ninth Circuit.  We believe it\n\nappropriate to draw a distinction that the Ninth Circuit did\n\nnot  draw, namely a  technical distinction between  what the\n\nlaw normally calls  a \"setoff\" (or \"set-off,\"  or \"offset\"),\n\nand what it calls \"recoupment.\"   The law dictionary defines\n\na  \"setoff\" as a \"counter-claim demand which defendant holds\n\nagainst plaintiff, arising out of a transaction extrinsic of\n                                                            \n\nplaintiff's cause of  action.\"  Black's Law  Dictionary 1230\n                            \n\n(5th ed.  1979) (emphasis added).

Lawyers, too,  might  fall  into  this  manner  of\n\nspeaking, for often the technical legal distinction does not\n\nmatter.   See,  e.g., B &amp;  L Oil,  782 F.2d at  157 (\"Modern\n                                \n\nrules  of pleading  have diminished  the  importance of  the\n\ncommon-law  distinctions  surrounding   recoupment  and  its\n\ncompanion,  setoff.\"); 20  Am.  Jur. 2d     10 (1965)  (\"The\n\ndistinctions between  . .  .  recoupment and  setoff are  no\n\nlonger of  much importance . . . .\").   In a few specialized\n\ncircumstances,  however,   the  difference  takes   on  more\n\nsignificance.\n\n          One  such circumstance is bankruptcy.  The unusual\n\nnature of bankruptcy proceedings means that certain devices,\n\nordinarily available  to creditors  seeking to  recover from\n\ndebtors, may be unavailable when  the debtor is in, or near,\n\nbankruptcy.   Among these  devices is  setoff, which  may be\n\nused  by a  creditor against an  insolvent debtor  who later\n\nfiles for bankruptcy only under the circumstances  described\n\nin  11  U.S.C.     553,  and against  a  debtor  already  in\n\n                            -8-\n                             8\n\nbankruptcy only by  seeking relief from the  automatic stay,\n\n11 U.S.C.   362(a)(7).  See  1 Epstein et al., supra,     3-\n                                                    \n\n15, 6-38  to 6-44.  The  reason is that the  bankruptcy laws\n\nare generally designed  to maximize the debtor's  assets for\n\nthe benefit  of all creditors,  and allowing  a creditor  to\n\ninvoke setoff might  allow the creditor an  unfair advantage\n\nover other creditors (the creditor, by reducing  the debt he\n\nowes the debtor dollar for  dollar against the debt owed him\n\nby the debtor,  receives full  value for  the latter  simply\n\nbecause he  owed money to  the debtor).  Thus,  returning to\n\nour earlier example, if Smith  is in bankruptcy and Jones is\n\npermitted  to  reduce his  $10,000  grain debt  to  Smith by\n\n$5,000 because of  the unpaid cottage rental,  Jones has (1)\n\ndeprived the estate of $5,000 it would otherwise have had to\n\nbenefit other creditors;  and (2) received full value on his\n\n$5,000  claim  against Smith,  even  though other  creditors\n\nmight not receive full value. \n\n          Recoupment,  on the other hand, is not a mechanism\n\nwhich  reduces mutual debts  \"for the sake  of convenience,\"\n\nid.    6-45, at 704  (describing setoff), but rather  is \"in\n   \n\nthe nature of  a defense\" and is  intended to \"permit .  . .\n\njudgment to be rendered that does justice in view of the one\n\ntransaction as  a whole.\"   Rothensies  v.

King, ed., 15th\n\ned. 1993) (point of recoupment is to \"arriv[e] at a just and\n\nproper liability\" on the plaintiff's  claim).  As such, when\n\na  debtor in  bankruptcy  seeks to  recover from  a creditor\n\nwhose claim  against  the  debtor arises  out  of  the  same\n\ntransaction, allowing the creditor to recoup  damages simply\n\nallows the debtor precisely what  it is due when viewing the\n\ntransaction \"as  a whole.\"   So although  it might  not make\n\nsense  to  allow   Jones  to  claim  a  setoff   in  Smith's\n                                              \n\nbankruptcy, allowing Jones to recoup  the $5,000 that he had\n                                    \n\nto spend  to dry out  Smith's defective grain seems  fair to\n\nall concerned, perhaps because a  debtor has, in a sense, no\n\nright to  funds subject to  recoupment.  See In  re Holford,\n                                                           \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536547\"><a href=\"/opinion/536547/in-the-matter-of-alden-d-holford-debtor-alden-d-holford-v-melvin-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  179  (5th  Cir. 1990).    This explains  why\n\nrecoupment  is  not expressly  regulated  by the  Bankruptcy\n\nCode; some  courts even  find recoupment  unaffected by  the\n\nautomatic stay.   See id.; 1 Epstein  et al., supra,   6-45,\n                                                   \n\nat  712 &amp;  n.36.    Whether a  creditor's  action against  a\n\nbankrupt debtor is characterized as a setoff or a recoupment\n\nwill,  therefore, have important  effects on  the creditor's\n\nability to prosecute the action.\n\n                            -10-\n                             10\n\n          The  Miller Act  seems  to  us  to  offer  another\n\nsituation  in  which  one  should  distinguish  setoff  from\n\nrecoupment.  The  language of the Act permits  a supplier to\n\nrecover, not the  full contract price, but  the \"sums justly\n\ndue him.\"   40 U.S.C.    270b(a).  In  our view, the  aim of\n\nrecoupment,  \"do[ing] justice in view of the one transaction\n\nas  a whole,\"  Rothensies, 329  U.S. at  299, would  seem to\n                         \n\nmatch  the statute's  requirement  of determining  the  sums\n\n\"justly  due\" a  supplier, making recoupment  an appropriate\n\ndefense in Miller Act cases.  Indeed, we do not see  how the\n\nfull  contract price  of  goods  supplied  can  possibly  be\n\n\"justly due\" a person who supplied defective goods.  Setoff,\n\non the other hand, has  less bearing on whether a particular\n\nsum is  \"justly due\"  the claimant,  since setoff  functions\n\nmostly  as a  convenient  method  of  dealing  with  mutual,\n\nunrelated  debts.   Since a  true setoff  is not  before us,\n\nhowever, we  need only note  the difference and need  not go\n\nbeyond the subject of recoupment to consider when or whether\n\nsetoff is unavailable under the Miller Act.\n\n          Further, the  policies underlying  the Miller  Act\n\nseem to permit recoupment.

On  the contrary,  disallowing\n      \n\nrecoupment would seem to give the supplier \"rights\" to which\n\nhis contract does not entitle him.\n\n          In short,  neither  United nor  the  Avanti  court\n                                                     \n\nitself has  pointed to  any policy of  the Miller  Act which\n\nwould be served by the Avanti rule,  nor can we imagine what\n                             \n\nsuch a  policy would be.   We have examined  the legislative\n\nhistory  of the  Miller  Act, and  the  cases and  treatises\n\ndiscussing it,  but we have found nothing  that suggests the\n\nconclusion reached in Avanti.  The materials and policies we\n                            \n\nhave considered, and the language of the statute,  point the\n\nother way.\n\n          For  these reasons,  we conclude that  the general\n\ncontractor in this case  is entitled to assert a  recoupment\n\ntype of defense.  Insofar as GRG shows that United delivered\n\ndefective goods that failed to meet contract specifications,\n\nand proves reasonably  foreseeable damages  caused by  those\n\ndefects, GRG may reduce the award to United by the amount of\n\nthose damages.  \n\n                            -13-\n                             13\n\n          United also  asserted a claim  under Puerto Rico's\n\nLittle Miller  Act (for  the police  station project).

The district court, therefore,  should reconsider\n\nthe  motion.   The  summary  judgment  record,  however,  is\n\nsomewhat  confused  because  GRG  presented some  pieces  of\n\nevidence  in  its  initial opposition  and  other  pieces of\n\nevidence when  it moved  for reconsideration.   Under  these\n\ncircumstances, we shall ask the district  court to begin the\n\nsummary judgment proceedings  anew, so that the  parties and\n\nthe court may proceed under the proper legal standard.  GRG,\n\nhowever, may  raise only  the issue of  recoupment.   In all\n\nother  respects,  the  court  will  assume  that  United  is\n\nentitled to summary judgment.\n\n          The  judgment of  the  district court  is vacated.\n\nThe plaintiff may file a  new motion for summary judgment in\n\nthe  district court.    The defendant  may  not oppose  that\n\nmotion on the  issue of liability,  but may contest  damages\n\nbased  on the principles  of recoupment as  outlined in this\n\nopinion.\n\n          So ordered.\n                     \n\n                            -15-\n                             15\n</pre>",
