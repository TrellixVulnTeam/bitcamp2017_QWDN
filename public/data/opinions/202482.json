Bazile and Bazile & Associates on brief for\npetitioner.\n     Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nTerri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, and Judith A. Hagley, Attorney, United States\nDepartment of Justice, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                        November 3, 2006\n\f               SELYA, Circuit Judge.               The petitioner, Burel Orelien,\n\nseeks judicial review of an order of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals    (BIA)        denying        his   omnibus       application      for    asylum,\n\nwithholding      of     removal,        or   relief      under    the    United    Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).                  The petitioner asserts that the\n\nBIA erred in refusing to grant relief because he presented strong\n\nand   credible     evidence        of    persecution        (past     and   anticipated).\n\nDiscerning no error, we deny the petition.\n\n               The procedural background against which this proceeding\n\nplays out is straightforward.                  The petitioner is a 54-year-old\n\nnative    of    Haiti       who    arrived    in     the     United     States,    without\n\ninspection, on May 15, 2000.                 He filed a timely application for\n\nasylum.    An immigration officer interviewed him, found no merit in\n\nhis application, and referred his case to the Immigration Court for\n\nthe institution of a removal proceeding.                          In due course, the\n\nauthorities instituted such a proceeding.\n\n               On May 17, 2004, an immigration judge (IJ) convened a\n\nhearing.       The petitioner conceded removability but pressed his\n\ncross-application for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief\n\nunder the CAT.          The IJ rejected the petitioner's asseverational\n\narray    for    two     principal        reasons:      (i)    a     perceived     lack    of\n\ncredibility       and       (ii)   a    failure     to     demonstrate       either      past\n\npersecution      or     a    likelihood      of    future    persecution.         The     BIA\n\naffirmed the decision, relying exclusively on the latter ground.\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fMindful   of    this     circumscription,        we    treat   the    petitioner's\n\ntestimony as credible for purposes of our factual rehearsal.\n\n           The petitioner testified that, while in Haiti, he toiled\n\non a farm.     He and his cousin, Frances Leger, were close friends.\n\nLeger, who worked in a fabric factory, felt that she was being\n\n\"persecuted\" by a co-worker. The petitioner testified that the co-\n\nworker followed Leger around at work, once accused her of harboring\n\nsentiments adverse to those of the political party in power, and\n\nthreatened her with harm.             In his testimony before the IJ, the\n\npetitioner     did     not   identify    any     specific      acts   of   violence\n\nperpetrated by the co-worker; however, he stated on his asylum\n\napplication    that     Leger,   on     one    occasion,    was   beaten    by     the\n\nantagonistic co-worker and two of his cohorts.\n\n           Leger did not testify at the hearing, but the petitioner\n\nattributed this \"persecution\" to the co-worker's envy of Leger's\n\njob.   He readily admitted both that he was not a party to this feud\n\nand that he himself had never actually experienced any violence.\n\nHe said, however, that he feared collateral damage because he was\n\nLeger's constant companion.\n\n           Leger       was   dismissed        from    her   employment     after     a\n\nparticularly vitriolic and accusatory encounter with the co-worker.\n\nConcerned about her safety, she decided to flee the country.                       The\n\npetitioner opted to join her and, in December of 1999, the two left\n\nHaiti.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f               As a second basis for his application, the petitioner\n\ntestified that some of his family members are adherents of the\n\nConvergence Party, a group that opposes Haiti's ruling Lavelas\n\nParty.      The petitioner mentioned no specific incidents of physical\n\nharm involving his relatives.              Nevertheless, he suggested that,\n\nshould he be deported to Haiti, he would be subject to persecution\n\nbecause of his relatives' political beliefs (the petitioner himself\n\nhas    never    been    a   member   of    the    Convergence       Party    and   his\n\ntrepidation      is    based   entirely     on    the   possibility     of    imputed\n\npolitical opinion).\n\n               The administrative record contains a State Department\n\nreport on country conditions in Haiti for the year 2003. According\n\nto    that    document,     the   Lavelas       Party   came   to    power    through\n\ncorruption and ballot manipulation in national elections held in\n\nNovember of 2000.        The Convergence Party contested those elections\n\nand thereafter challenged the Lavelas Party's hegemony.                            The\n\nstruggle grew acrimonious and sporadic violence ensued, culminating\n\nin    the    attempted      murder   of   two     Convergence       Party    leaders.\n\nVirtually all of the violence occurred after the petitioner's\n\ndeparture from his homeland.\n\n               Neither the IJ nor the BIA found this two-faceted account\n\npersuasive.       Our review is directed at the BIA's decision.                    In\n\nconducting that appraisal, we evaluate the BIA's findings of fact\n\nunder the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard. Guzman v.\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fINS, 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).                         This standard applies\n\nequally    to    asylum,      withholding           of   removal,    and      CAT   claims.\n\nSettenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             This standard of review dictates that the BIA's fact-\n\nbased determinations be upheld unless a \"reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\"                                Bocova v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1252(b)(4)(B)).           Put another way, the BIA's findings of fact must\n\nbe   accepted        as   long    as    they    are      \"supported      by   reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\"      Id. (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992)).        In    contrast,        the   BIA's       answers    to   abstract    legal\n\nquestions are reviewed de novo.1                Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1,\n\n5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             With this tapestry in place, we turn to the petitioner's\n\nasylum claim.         It is the alien's burden to show eligibility for\n\nasylum.    To do so, the alien must establish that he is a \"refugee\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1).         See Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).    The alien can achieve refugee status by showing that, as a\n\npractical matter, he cannot \"return to his country of nationality\n\nor   avail      himself      of   that       country's      protections       because   of\n\n\n      1\n      There is an exception to this rule for the BIA's\ninterpretation of statutes that it must administer. See Bocova,\n412 F.3d at 262. That exception is of no moment here.\n\n                                              -5-\n\fpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in an particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"            Ang v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 55\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted);\n\nsee 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).\n\n           If the alien succeeds in showing past persecution based\n\non one of these five enumerated grounds, he is entitled to a\n\nrebuttable    presumption    of   future    persecution.        Harutyunan    v.\n\nGonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir. 2005).            If — and only if — that\n\npresumption arises, the burden shifts to the government to prove\n\neither \"a fundamental change in circumstances such that the alien\n\nno longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in [his] country\n\nof nationality\" or a practicable means of \"avoid[ing] future\n\npersecution by relocating to another part of [his] country of\n\nnationality.\"    8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B).\n\n           The inability of an alien to establish past persecution\n\ndoes not entirely dash his hopes for asylum.            An alien may prevail\n\non an asylum claim by proving, simpliciter, a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution independent of any presumption.               See Ang, 430\n\nF.3d at 55; Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 124 (1st\n\nCir.   2005).     Traversing      this    avenue     requires   the   alien   to\n\ndemonstrate     that   his   fear    of     future     persecution    is   both\n\nsubjectively and objectively reasonable. See Da Silva v. Ashcroft,\n\n394 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).       In other words, the professed fear\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fmust be both genuine and nestled on a plausible factual predicate.\n\nSee id.\n\n           Here, the petitioner strives to keep both routes open by\n\nshowing not only past persecution but also an independent fear of\n\nfuture persecution.    In the last analysis, neither route affords\n\nhim the access that he seeks.\n\n           With respect to past persecution, the petitioner relies\n\nmainly on the Leger evidence (after all, the Lavelas Party did not\n\nobtain broad control over the various units of government in Haiti\n\nuntil after the petitioner had departed).         To determine whether\n\nthis route is passable, we must consider the supportability of the\n\nBIA's determination that no past persecution occurred.\n\n           The word \"persecution\" has not been defined by statute,\n\nand this court — like the BIA — has decided that the concept is\n\nbest addressed on a case-by-case basis.        See Bocova, 412 F.3d at\n\n263; see also In re L—K—, 23 I&N Dec. 677, 683 (BIA 2004).              This\n\ndoes not mean, however, that the inquiry is standardless.           It is\n\nclear, for example, that the term \"requires that the totality of a\n\npetitioner's experiences add up to more then mere discomfiture,\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.\"           Nikijuluw v.\n\nGonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005); accord Nelson v. INS,\n\n232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).         This threshold is not easily\n\ncrossed.   See, e.g., Bocova, 412 F.3d at 264 (upholding the BIA's\n\ndetermination   that   harassment    and   occasional   beatings   by    the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fAlbanian police did not amount to persecution); Rodriguez-Ramirez,\n\n398 F.3d at 124 (upholding the BIA's determination that an isolated\n\nact of violence against a family member is not enough to establish\n\npersecution).\n\n             In the hot glare of these precedents, the petitioner's\n\nclaim of past persecution melts away.                For one thing, he has\n\nproffered no evidence showing any actual violence directed against\n\nhim.    For another thing, he has not shown that his cousin, though\n\nthreatened, stalked, and perhaps beaten on one occasion, has\n\nactually experienced anything that might resemble persecution.\n\nEven crediting his evidence fully, the most that the petitioner has\n\nshown   is   that    his   cousin    (and,    by   indirection,   he   himself)\n\nexperienced a modicum of discomfiture, harassment and abuse.              That\n\nis too frail a lance to unhorse the BIA's fact-based finding that\n\nnothing amounting to persecution occurred. See Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d\n\nat 121.\n\n             We     add,   moreover,        that   the   petitioner's    \"past\n\npersecution\" claim is doubly deficient. Persecution always implies\n\nsome connection to governmental action or inaction, related to a\n\nprotected ground for asylum (say, social group membership or\n\npolitical opinion).        See id.; Harutyunyan, 421 F.3d at 68.          This\n\nmeans, among other things, that one who seeks asylum must show\n\nmistreatment that is the \"direct result of government action,\n\ngovernment-supported       action,     or    government's   unwillingness   or\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\finability to control private conduct.\" Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 121.\n\n\"[A]ction by non-governmental actors can undergird a claim of\n\npersecution   only   if   there    is    some     showing    that   the   alleged\n\npersecutors   are    in   league    with      the   government      or    are   not\n\ncontrollable by the government.\"          Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 7.\n\n          The   petitioner        has    wholly     failed    to    attain      this\n\nmilestone. He has not demonstrated that any of the actors involved\n\nin Leger's mistreatment were somehow tied to the government.                    For\n\naught that appears, his cousin was threatened (and perhaps roughed\n\nup) by a co-worker who was envious of her job.\n\n          It is, of course, true that government inaction sometimes\n\ncan be sufficient to show persecution.            See, e.g., Singh v. INS, 94\n\nF.3d 1353, 1360 (9th Cir. 1996); de la Llana-Castellon v. INS, 16\n\nF.3d 1093,1097 (10th Cir. 1994). Here, however, the petitioner did\n\nnot offer a scintilla of evidence to show that either he or his\n\ncousin sought governmental protection from the maraudings of this\n\njealous co-worker, let alone that the authorities could not or\n\nwould not provide protection.2\n\n          We turn next to the petitioner's claim that he proved a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.                This is a claim of\n\n\n\n     2\n      If more were needed — and we do not believe that it is — the\npetitioner also failed to demonstrate that the abuse he described\nwas related in any way to his or his cousin's race, religion,\nnationality, social group membership, or political opinion. The\nabsence of such a demonstration is a fatal flaw.      See Toloza-\nJimenez v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 155, 160 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                        -9-\n\fpersecution on the basis of consanguinity; the petitioner himself\n\ntestified that he had no political allegiances. Instead, he relies\n\nprincipally on his relatives' membership in the Convergence Party.\n\nHis premise is sound: claims of persecution may, in appropriate\n\ncircumstances, rest on imputed political opinion.           See Vasquez v.\n\nINS, 177 F.3d 62, 65 (1st Cir. 1999) (articulating this premise);\n\nRavindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 760 (1st Cir. 1992) (same).\n\n           In this instance, however, the claim founders. To begin,\n\nthe   record   indicates    that   neither     the   petitioner    nor    his\n\npolitically active family members experienced any mistreatment\n\nbefore the petitioner emigrated to the United States.                 As to\n\nviolence that may have occurred thereafter, the record is sparse.\n\nFrom what we can tell, the violence between the Convergence Party\n\nand the Lavelas Party consisted of isolated incidents directed\n\nagainst certain party leaders.        There is no indication that any of\n\nthe petitioner's relatives were targeted or that any of them\n\ncomprised part of the Convergence Party's leadership. Nor is there\n\nany evidence that rank-and-file members of the Convergence Party\n\nare routinely exposed to persecution.\n\n           The thinness of the record dooms the petitioner's claim.\n\nThe petitioner has the burden of proof on this issue, see Berrio-\n\nBarrera v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir. 2006), and he has\n\nadduced   insufficient     evidence    to   compel   a   finding   that   his\n\nprofessed fear of future persecution has a plausible basis in fact.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fUnder those circumstances, we cannot set aside the challenged\n\nfinding.     See Khem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 51, 54 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(upholding the BIA's ruling that a person who never had held party\n\noffice or made public speeches had not demonstrated a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution on the basis of political belief).\n\n           This brings us to the petitioner's quest for withholding\n\nof removal.    That quest carries with it a more stringent burden of\n\nproof than does a counterpart effort to obtain asylum.      See Ang,\n\n430 F.3d at 58 (explaining that withholding of removal requires an\n\nalien to establish a clear probability of persecution, rather than\n\na well-founded fear of persecution); Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at\n\n123 (same).    In view of our holding that the BIA supportably denied\n\nthe petitioner's asylum claim, see supra, his claim for withholding\n\nof removal becomes a dead letter.\n\n           The final leg of our journey takes us to the petitioner's\n\nCAT claim.    Under the terms of the CAT, the United States cannot\n\nreturn an alien to his country of nationality if \"there are\n\nsubstantial grounds for believing [he] would be in danger of being\n\nsubjected to torture.\"     Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112 Stat.\n\n2681, 2681-822 (1998).    In order to find sanctuary under the CAT,\n\nhowever, an alien must show that he will more likely than not be\n\ntortured upon returning to his homeland.    See Ang, 430 F.3d at 58.\n\nTorture is a term of art, defined by regulation as \"any act by\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fwhich severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is\n\nintentionally inflicted on a person.\"          8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1).\n\n            In   this   instance,    the    petitioner   has    proffered   no\n\nevidence of physical harm directed against him while he was in\n\nHaiti.     By the same token, he has proffered no evidence, either\n\ndirect or circumstantial, that he will be tortured at the hands of\n\nthe government should he be returned to Haiti.           This utter failure\n\nof proof compels us to uphold the BIA's denial of redress under the\n\nCAT.     In this particular, as in other particulars, the BIA's\n\ndecision    must   stand   because    the    evidence    does   not   \"point[]\n\nunerringly in the opposite direction.\"           Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359\n\nF.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe sustain the final order of removal and deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f",

The petitioner, Burel Orelien,\n\nseeks judicial review of an order of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals    (BIA)        denying        his   omnibus       application      for    asylum,\n\nwithholding      of     removal,        or   relief      under    the    United    Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).                  The petitioner asserts that the\n\nBIA erred in refusing to grant relief because he presented strong\n\nand   credible     evidence        of    persecution        (past     and   anticipated).\n\nDiscerning no error, we deny the petition.\n\n               The procedural background against which this proceeding\n\nplays out is straightforward.                  The petitioner is a 54-year-old\n\nnative    of    Haiti       who    arrived    in     the     United     States,    without\n\ninspection, on May 15, 2000.                 He filed a timely application for\n\nasylum.    An immigration officer interviewed him, found no merit in\n\nhis application, and referred his case to the Immigration Court for\n\nthe institution of a removal proceeding.                          In due course, the\n\nauthorities instituted such a proceeding.\n\n               On May 17, 2004, an immigration judge (IJ) convened a\n\nhearing.       The petitioner conceded removability but pressed his\n\ncross-application for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief\n\nunder the CAT.          The IJ rejected the petitioner's asseverational\n\narray    for    two     principal        reasons:      (i)    a     perceived     lack    of\n\ncredibility       and       (ii)   a    failure     to     demonstrate       either      past\n\npersecution      or     a    likelihood      of    future    persecution.         The     BIA\n\naffirmed the decision, relying exclusively on the latter ground.\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fMindful   of    this     circumscription,        we    treat   the    petitioner's\n\ntestimony as credible for purposes of our factual rehearsal.\n\n           The petitioner testified that, while in Haiti, he toiled\n\non a farm.     He and his cousin, Frances Leger, were close friends.\n\nLeger, who worked in a fabric factory, felt that she was being\n\n\"persecuted\" by a co-worker. The petitioner testified that the co-\n\nworker followed Leger around at work, once accused her of harboring\n\nsentiments adverse to those of the political party in power, and\n\nthreatened her with harm.             In his testimony before the IJ, the\n\npetitioner     did     not   identify    any     specific      acts   of   violence\n\nperpetrated by the co-worker; however, he stated on his asylum\n\napplication    that     Leger,   on     one    occasion,    was   beaten    by     the\n\nantagonistic co-worker and two of his cohorts.\n\n           Leger did not testify at the hearing, but the petitioner\n\nattributed this \"persecution\" to the co-worker's envy of Leger's\n\njob.   He readily admitted both that he was not a party to this feud\n\nand that he himself had never actually experienced any violence.\n\nHe said, however, that he feared collateral damage because he was\n\nLeger's constant companion.\n\n           Leger       was   dismissed        from    her   employment     after     a\n\nparticularly vitriolic and accusatory encounter with the co-worker.\n\nConcerned about her safety, she decided to flee the country.                       The\n\npetitioner opted to join her and, in December of 1999, the two left\n\nHaiti.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f               As a second basis for his application, the petitioner\n\ntestified that some of his family members are adherents of the\n\nConvergence Party, a group that opposes Haiti's ruling Lavelas\n\nParty.      The petitioner mentioned no specific incidents of physical\n\nharm involving his relatives.              Nevertheless, he suggested that,\n\nshould he be deported to Haiti, he would be subject to persecution\n\nbecause of his relatives' political beliefs (the petitioner himself\n\nhas    never    been    a   member   of    the    Convergence       Party    and   his\n\ntrepidation      is    based   entirely     on    the   possibility     of    imputed\n\npolitical opinion).\n\n               The administrative record contains a State Department\n\nreport on country conditions in Haiti for the year 2003. According\n\nto    that    document,     the   Lavelas       Party   came   to    power    through\n\ncorruption and ballot manipulation in national elections held in\n\nNovember of 2000.        The Convergence Party contested those elections\n\nand thereafter challenged the Lavelas Party's hegemony.                            The\n\nstruggle grew acrimonious and sporadic violence ensued, culminating\n\nin    the    attempted      murder   of   two     Convergence       Party    leaders.\n\nVirtually all of the violence occurred after the petitioner's\n\ndeparture from his homeland.\n\n               Neither the IJ nor the BIA found this two-faceted account\n\npersuasive.       Our review is directed at the BIA's decision.                    In\n\nconducting that appraisal, we evaluate the BIA's findings of fact\n\nunder the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard.

It is the alien's burden to show eligibility for\n\nasylum.    To do so, the alien must establish that he is a \"refugee\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1).         See Makhoul v.

Harutyunan    v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201799\"><a href=\"/opinion/201799/harutyunyan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1st Cir. 2005).            If — and only if — that\n\npresumption arises, the burden shifts to the government to prove\n\neither \"a fundamental change in circumstances such that the alien\n\nno longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in [his] country\n\nof nationality\" or a practicable means of \"avoid[ing] future\n\npersecution by relocating to another part of [his] country of\n\nnationality.\"    8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B).\n\n           The inability of an alien to establish past persecution\n\ndoes not entirely dash his hopes for asylum.            An alien may prevail\n\non an asylum claim by proving, simpliciter, a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution independent of any presumption.

Traversing      this    avenue     requires   the   alien   to\n\ndemonstrate     that   his   fear    of     future     persecution    is   both\n\nsubjectively and objectively reasonable. See Da Silva v.

In other words, the professed fear\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fmust be both genuine and nestled on a plausible factual predicate.\n\nSee id.\n\n           Here, the petitioner strives to keep both routes open by\n\nshowing not only past persecution but also an independent fear of\n\nfuture persecution.    In the last analysis, neither route affords\n\nhim the access that he seeks.\n\n           With respect to past persecution, the petitioner relies\n\nmainly on the Leger evidence (after all, the Lavelas Party did not\n\nobtain broad control over the various units of government in Haiti\n\nuntil after the petitioner had departed).         To determine whether\n\nthis route is passable, we must consider the supportability of the\n\nBIA's determination that no past persecution occurred.\n\n           The word \"persecution\" has not been defined by statute,\n\nand this court — like the BIA — has decided that the concept is\n\nbest addressed on a case-by-case basis.        See Bocova, 412 F.3d at\n\n263; see also In re L—K—, 23 I&N Dec. 677, 683 (BIA 2004).              This\n\ndoes not mean, however, that the inquiry is standardless.           It is\n\nclear, for example, that the term \"requires that the totality of a\n\npetitioner's experiences add up to more then mere discomfiture,\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.\"           Nikijuluw v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 120 (1st Cir. 2005); accord Nelson v.

This threshold is not easily\n\ncrossed.   See, e.g., Bocova, 412 F.3d at 264 (upholding the BIA's\n\ndetermination   that   harassment    and   occasional   beatings   by    the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fAlbanian police did not amount to persecution); Rodriguez-Ramirez,\n\n398 F.3d at 124 (upholding the BIA's determination that an isolated\n\nact of violence against a family member is not enough to establish\n\npersecution).\n\n             In the hot glare of these precedents, the petitioner's\n\nclaim of past persecution melts away.                For one thing, he has\n\nproffered no evidence showing any actual violence directed against\n\nhim.    For another thing, he has not shown that his cousin, though\n\nthreatened, stalked, and perhaps beaten on one occasion, has\n\nactually experienced anything that might resemble persecution.\n\nEven crediting his evidence fully, the most that the petitioner has\n\nshown   is   that    his   cousin    (and,    by   indirection,   he   himself)\n\nexperienced a modicum of discomfiture, harassment and abuse.              That\n\nis too frail a lance to unhorse the BIA's fact-based finding that\n\nnothing amounting to persecution occurred. See Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d\n\nat 121.\n\n             We     add,   moreover,        that   the   petitioner's    \"past\n\npersecution\" claim is doubly deficient. Persecution always implies\n\nsome connection to governmental action or inaction, related to a\n\nprotected ground for asylum (say, social group membership or\n\npolitical opinion).        See id.; Harutyunyan, 421 F.3d at 68.          This\n\nmeans, among other things, that one who seeks asylum must show\n\nmistreatment that is the \"direct result of government action,\n\ngovernment-supported       action,     or    government's   unwillingness   or\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\finability to control private conduct.\" Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 121.\n\n\"[A]ction by non-governmental actors can undergird a claim of\n\npersecution   only   if   there    is    some     showing    that   the   alleged\n\npersecutors   are    in   league    with      the   government      or    are   not\n\ncontrollable by the government.\"          Da Silva, 394 F.3d at 7.\n\n          The   petitioner        has    wholly     failed    to    attain      this\n\nmilestone. He has not demonstrated that any of the actors involved\n\nin Leger's mistreatment were somehow tied to the government.                    For\n\naught that appears, his cousin was threatened (and perhaps roughed\n\nup) by a co-worker who was envious of her job.\n\n          It is, of course, true that government inaction sometimes\n\ncan be sufficient to show persecution.

Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783401\"><a href=\"/opinion/783401/sovann-khem-v-john-ashcroft-united-states-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(upholding the BIA's ruling that a person who never had held party\n\noffice or made public speeches had not demonstrated a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution on the basis of political belief).\n\n           This brings us to the petitioner's quest for withholding\n\nof removal.    That quest carries with it a more stringent burden of\n\nproof than does a counterpart effort to obtain asylum.      See Ang,\n\n430 F.3d at 58 (explaining that withholding of removal requires an\n\nalien to establish a clear probability of persecution, rather than\n\na well-founded fear of persecution); Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at\n\n123 (same).    In view of our holding that the BIA supportably denied\n\nthe petitioner's asylum claim, see supra, his claim for withholding\n\nof removal becomes a dead letter.\n\n           The final leg of our journey takes us to the petitioner's\n\nCAT claim.    Under the terms of the CAT, the United States cannot\n\nreturn an alien to his country of nationality if \"there are\n\nsubstantial grounds for believing [he] would be in danger of being\n\nsubjected to torture.\"     Pub. L. No. 105-277, § 2242, 112 Stat.\n\n2681, 2681-822 (1998).    In order to find sanctuary under the CAT,\n\nhowever, an alien must show that he will more likely than not be\n\ntortured upon returning to his homeland.    See Ang, 430 F.3d at 58.\n\nTorture is a term of art, defined by regulation as \"any act by\n\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fwhich severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is\n\nintentionally inflicted on a person.\"          8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1).\n\n            In   this   instance,    the    petitioner   has    proffered   no\n\nevidence of physical harm directed against him while he was in\n\nHaiti.     By the same token, he has proffered no evidence, either\n\ndirect or circumstantial, that he will be tortured at the hands of\n\nthe government should he be returned to Haiti.           This utter failure\n\nof proof compels us to uphold the BIA's denial of redress under the\n\nCAT.     In this particular, as in other particulars, the BIA's\n\ndecision    must   stand   because    the    evidence    does   not   \"point[]\n\nunerringly in the opposite direction.\"           Laurent v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe sustain the final order of removal and deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f</pre>",
