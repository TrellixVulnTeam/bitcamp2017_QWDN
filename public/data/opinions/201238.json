COLÓN-TORRES,\n\n                      Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n        [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Torruella, Selya, and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Alexander Zeno for appellant.\n\n     Rose M. Vega, with whom H.S. García, United States Attorney,\nSonia I. Torres, Assistant United States Attorney and Chief,\nCriminal Division, and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States\nAttorney, were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        September 9, 2004\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.        Defendant Jaime O. Colón-Torres\n\n(\"Colón\") pled guilty to one count of an indictment for a drug\n\noffense. On appeal, Colón argues that his plea was not knowing and\n\nvoluntary and that his sentence should be vacated because he was\n\ndeprived of the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by\n\nthe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In pursuing\n\nthis Sixth Amendment claim, Colón alleges several deficiencies in\n\nthe performance of his attorney, Joaquín Peña Ríos (\"Peña\"),\n\nincluding claims that Peña failed to investigate Colón's criminal\n\nhistory prior to recommending a plea agreement (Colón was sentenced\n\nas a career offender), and that Peña became ensnared in an actual\n\nconflict of interest during Colón's sentencing hearing, effectively\n\ndepriving Colón of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings.\n\n            Although we rarely entertain ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claims on direct appeal, instead relying on collateral\n\nproceedings for such challenges, this case fits within an exception\n\nto the rule. Here, the indicia of ineffectiveness are sufficiently\n\ndeveloped   in   the   record   to   warrant,     in    the   exercise   of   our\n\ndiscretion, direct appellate review.          After a careful analysis of\n\nthe record and the case law, we remand for an evidentiary hearing\n\non whether the judgment should be vacated and Colón should be\n\nallowed   to   withdraw   his   guilty     plea   due    to   the   ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f                                        I.\n\n             Because the background facts of the underlying criminal\n\nactivity are not at issue in this case, we do not repeat the\n\ndetails here.      For our purposes, it suffices to say that defendant\n\npled guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute,\n\ninter alia, five kilograms or more of a substance containing a\n\ndetectable    amount    of   cocaine,      in   violation   of   21    U.S.C.   §§\n\n841(a)(1)    and   846.1     The   facts     and   circumstances      surrounding\n\ndefendant's relationship with his attorney are both more relevant\n\nand complicated.       We turn now to those details.\n\n              A.    Colón's Pro Se Motion for New Counsel\n\n            After Colón was indicted and arrested in November 2001,\n\nthe court appointed Peña as defendant's counsel on the day of\n\ndefendant's arraignment.       Following two status conferences held on\n\nDecember 19, 2001, and February 1, 2002, Colón filed a pro se\n\nmotion requesting the appointment of a new attorney.               The district\n\ncourt received the motion on April 2.              In his pro se motion, which\n\nColón filed in Spanish and which is now reproduced in English for\n\nthe appellate record, Colón contended that \"the client-attorney\n\n\n     1\n      21 U.S.C. § 841 (a)(1) provides that \"[e]xcept as authorized\nby this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly\nor intentionally . . . to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or\npossess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a\ncontrolled substance . . . .\" 21 U.S.C. § 846 states that \"[a]ny\nperson who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in\nthis subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those\nprescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object\nof the attempt or conspiracy.\"\n\n                                      -3-\n\frelationship has deteriorated due to the attitude by counselor Peña\n\nof insisting in his persuasive way to try to push me into a\n\ndecision without having counseled me in a competent and effective\n\nmanner so that [the defendant] would make a correct decision before\n\nthe Court.\"    Defendant's pro se motion specifically alleged that\n\nhis attorney had provided him with no documents related to his\n\ncase,    including   the   indictment,    discovery   materials,      or   any\n\nstatements of governmental witnesses producible under the Jencks\n\nAct, 18 U.S.C. § 3500.2      Additionally, the defendant alleged that\n\nwhile he was talking to his attorney on March 25, 2002, they \"were\n\napproached by another one of [Peña's] clients . . . [who] started\n\nyelling to Peña saying he was an incompetent and anti-ethical\n\nattorney, that he never handed him any document regarding his\n\ncriminal case and that he cheated him by stating that he was ready\n\nto see his case.\" Then, according to defendant's translated pro se\n\nmotion, \"Peña reacted in an anti-professional and anti-ethical\n\nmanner   and   the   argument   between   him   and   his   [other]   client\n\ndescended to levels which cannot be quoted at this time.\"                  The\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The Jencks Act provides, inter alia, that \"[a]fter a witness\ncalled by the United States has testified on direct examination,\nthe court shall, on motion of the defendant, order the United\nStates to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) of the\nwitness in the possession of the United States which relates to the\nsubject matter as to which the witness has testified.\" 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3500(b). The term \"statement\" includes \"a statement, however\ntaken or recorded, or a transcription thereof, if any, made by said\nwitness to a grand jury.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e)(3).\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdistrict court did not respond to defendant's pro se motion for new\n\ncounsel.\n\n                           B.   The Plea Agreement\n\n            On April 24, 2002, Peña filed a motion for change of plea\n\non behalf of Colón, and the district court set the change of plea\n\nhearing for May 2.         On that date, the defendant pled guilty to\n\ncount one of the indictment after signing the plea agreement that\n\nsame day.     The plea agreement indicated that the penalty for the\n\noffense charged \"is a term of imprisonment which shall not be less\n\nthan ten (10) years and not more than Life\" in addition to certain\n\nfines and a period of supervised release, in accordance with 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) (detailing the minimum and maximum sentences\n\nfor, inter     alia,   crimes      involving   five   or   more   kilograms   of\n\ncocaine).     The plea agreement also stated that \"the Court shall\n\nimpose a sentence in accordance with the applicable provisions of\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines . . . without regard to any statutory\n\nminimum sentence [a reference to the so-called \"safety valve\"\n\nprovision],    if    the   court    finds    that   the   defendant   meets   the\n\ncriteria contained in [18 U.S.C.] § 3553(f)(1)-(5) [which are\n\nreflected in]       Guidelines § 5C1.2.\"\n\n            The United States Sentencing Guidelines set forth the\n\ncriteria referred to in the plea agreement. The first criterion is\n\nthat \"the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history\n\npoint, as determined under the sentencing guidelines [in U.S.S.G.\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f§4A1.1].\" U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(1).         Sentencing Guidelines § 4A1.1\n\nsets forth the number of criminal history points assigned to a\n\ndefendant based on his prior sentences of imprisonment.            In the\n\nplea agreement, the parties assumed a criminal history category of\n\nII, which corresponds to a defendant having two or three criminal\n\nhistory points as described in U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1.          This assumption\n\n– that Colón has two or three criminal history points – would\n\npreclude the application of U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2, which requires, inter\n\nalia, that a defendant have no more than one criminal history\n\npoint. Accordingly, under the criminal history category assumption\n\nin the plea agreement, Colón was not eligible for sentencing\n\nwithout regard to the statutory minimum.\n\n          The   Sentencing     Guidelines   calculations    in   the    plea\n\nagreement provide that based on a drug quantity amount of at least\n\nfive hundred grams but less than two kilograms of cocaine, Colón's\n\nbase offense level (\"BOL\") was 26 pursuant to the drug quantity\n\ntable in U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(7).      The plea agreement also stipulates\n\nthat   \"[s]hould   defendant    clearly     demonstrate    acceptance     of\n\nresponsibility for the offense, defendant's base offense level\n\nshall be reduced by three levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b).\"\n\nThese agreements resulted in a BOL of 23, and, given the assumption\n\nof a criminal history category of two, a Sentencing Guidelines\n\nrange of fifty-one to sixty-three months of imprisonment.                The\n\ngovernment and the defendant agreed to a recommended sentence of\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fsixty months of imprisonment.       Because Colón pled guilty to a drug\n\nquantity of five hundred grams to two kilograms (as opposed to the\n\nmore than five kilogram quantity for which he was indicted), his\n\nstatutory minimum sentence dropped from ten years to five years.\n\nCompare 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) (providing that in cases involving\n\nfive   kilograms   or   more   of   cocaine,   the   defendant   shall   be\n\nimprisoned for not less than ten years and not more than life),\n\nwith id. § 841(b)(1)(B) (providing that in cases involving five\n\nhundred grams or more – and, implicitly, less than five kilograms\n\n–   of cocaine, the defendant shall be imprisoned for not less than\n\nfive years and not more than forty years).\n\n                        C. Change of Plea Hearing\n\n           At the change of plea hearing on May 2, the district\n\ncourt orally went through the plea agreement with Colón. The court\n\nsaid that \"if we assume a criminal history category of one, then\n\nthe guideline range would be 46 to 57 months.         But if we assume a\n\ncriminal history category of two, which apparently is what you and\n\nyour attorney and the attorney for the government think that is the\n\ncorrect criminal history category, then the guideline range would\n\nbe 51 to 63 months.       Do you understand that up to now?\"        Colón\n\nreplied that he did.       The district court continued: \"But since\n\nthere is a statutory mandatory minimum of 60 months, then the\n\nguideline range would be 60 to 63 months and then the government\n\nand you would recommend to the court that I sentence you to the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fbottom end of the guideline range which is 60 months.\"3      Again,\n\nupon questioning, Colón indicated that he understood the court's\n\nexplanation that because the statute imposed a minimum sentence of\n\nfive years for the drug quantity to which Colón pled guilty, the\n\nGuidelines sentencing range was effectively sixty to sixty-three\n\nmonths.\n\n          Finally, the court stated: \"Now, are you aware of the\n\nfact that there is no stipulation as to the criminal history\n\ncategory but, as I mentioned before, it is assumed that your\n\ncriminal history category is two. . . .     And if it's higher than\n\ntwo, then the guideline range would be 60 to 71 months instead of\n\n60 to 63 months.\"   Since the plea agreement did not suggest that a\n\ncareer offender designation was a possibility, the court did not\n\nrefer to the possibility of Colón being sentenced as a career\n\noffender under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1.        Instead, the district court\n\nconveyed the impression that the likely maximum sentence Colón\n\nfaced was seventy-one months, corresponding to a criminal history\n\ncategory of III, which is one category higher than the category\n\nassumed in the plea agreement.4    Peña said nothing to dispel this\n\n\n     3\n      This statement of a sixty-month mandatory minimum is based on\nthe drug quantity to which Colón pled guilty – at least five\nhundred grams but less than two kilograms of cocaine – and not the\ndrug quantity for which he was indicted, i.e., in excess of five\nkilograms of cocaine.\n     4\n      In fact, the Guidelines provide increasing sentences by\ncriminal history category up to a criminal history category of VI.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fimpression.          Upon questioning, Colón continued to state that he\n\nunderstood the court's explanation.\n\n                             D.   The Presentence Report\n\n               The presentence report (\"PSR\"), prepared on September 3,\n\n2002,       stated    that    Colón   had    three   prior   convictions   under\n\nCommonwealth laws, and that his criminal history points totaled\n\neight under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1.            Ordinarily, eight criminal history\n\npoints would have earned Colón a criminal history category of IV.\n\nHowever, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 provides that a defendant will be treated\n\nas a career offender if he was at least eighteen years old when he\n\ncommitted the instant crime of violence or a controlled substance\n\noffense and has two prior convictions for either type of offense.\n\nThe PSR then correctly identified Colón as a career offender, based\n\non his prior convictions.5\n\n               Colón's career offender status affected the applicable\n\nsentence in two ways under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1.                 First, all career\n\n\n\n        5\n      As we will describe in greater detail, Colón does not dispute\nthat he is in fact a career offender under the Guidelines, but he\nand Peña disagree about the timing of Peña's awareness of Colón's\nprior convictions. Colón's prior convictions and sentences, all of\nwhich took place after his eighteenth birthday, are as follows:\n(1) possession of an illegal weapon as violations of Article 168 of\nthe Puerto Rico Penal Code and Article 8 of the Puerto Rico Weapons\nLaw, for which he was sentenced to six months of imprisonment on\nFebruary 17, 1987; (2) robbery with a weapon in violation of\nArticles 5, 6, and 8 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, for which he\nwas sentenced to ten years of imprisonment on November 4, 1987; and\n(3) kidnaping, attempted murder, robbery, and illegal appropriation\nin violation of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, for which he was\nsentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment on November 28, 1990.\n\n                                            -9-\n\foffenders are assigned to criminal history category VI, the highest\n\ncategory in the Guidelines. Second, a career offender's BOL is the\n\ngreater of either the BOL otherwise calculated under the Guidelines\n\nor the BOL listed in a table in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1.                    This table sets\n\nthe BOL      according      to    the   statutory     maximum      sentence   for   the\n\nunderlying offense.          Because the statutory maximum for the drug\n\nquantity to which Colón pled guilty (five hundred grams to two\n\nkilograms) was forty years under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B), his BOL\n\nas a career offender under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1 should have been 34,\n\nwhich corresponds to a statutory maximum sentence of twenty-five\n\nyears   or    more,    but       less   than   life    imprisonment.          The   PSR\n\nincorrectly stated that \"[b]ased on the statutory maximum term of\n\nimprisonment     of    20    years,      the   base   offense      level   should    be\n\nincreased to 32\" under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, which corresponds to a\n\nstatutory maximum sentence of between twenty and twenty-five years.\n\nThe PSR committed this mistake despite correctly stating later that\n\n\"[p]ursuant     to    the    stipulation       [in    the   plea    agreement],     the\n\nstatutory maximum term of imprisonment is forty (40) years and the\n\nminimum is five (5) years per 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\"\n\n             The PSR carries the BOL error into its description of the\n\nsentencing options under the Guidelines provisions. There, the PSR\n\nassigns a total offense level (\"TOL\") of 29, which reflects a\n\nthree-level acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment from\n\nthe erroneous BOL of 32.                A TOL of 29, coupled with a criminal\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fhistory category of VI, results in a Guidelines sentencing range of\n\n151 to 188 months, which is the recommendation of the PSR.                In\n\nfact, the TOL should have been 31, which would reflect a three-\n\nlevel acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment from the\n\ncorrect BOL of 34.    A TOL of 31, coupled with a criminal history\n\ncategory of VI, would have resulted in a Guidelines sentencing\n\nrange of 188 to 235 months.            In short, the PSR was internally\n\ninconsistent on the statutory maximum sentence and incorrectly\n\ncalculated the sentence that ought to be imposed on Colón under the\n\nGuidelines.\n\n           Additionally, it appears that the United States probation\n\nofficer   who   prepared   the   PSR    encountered   some   difficulty    in\n\nreaching Peña to inform him that the PSR was available.                   The\n\nprobation officer certified an addendum to the document noting\n\nthese difficulties:\n\n           Counsel for the Government was duly notified\n           on September 24, 2002, and several attempts\n           were made to notify Counsel for the defendant,\n           pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3552(d) that the\n           presentence investigation report was ready for\n           their inspection. However, as they have not\n           been able to review the report, objections, if\n           any, have not been submitted.\n\nAccording to the district court docket, the presentence report was\n\ntransmitted to Peña on October 2, five days before the sentencing\n\nscheduled on October 7.6\n\n\n     6\n      The sentencing hearing was rescheduled            more   than   once,\neventually taking place on November 14.\n\n                                   -11-\n\f                    E. The Amended Plea Agreement\n\n            In light of the information in the PSR about Colón's\n\ncareer offender status, Peña renegotiated the terms of Colón's plea\n\nwith the government.     The negotiations produced an amended plea\n\nagreement, which stipulated a drug quantity amount of four hundred\n\nto five hundred grams of cocaine, a smaller figure than the amount\n\nindicated in the original plea agreement (at least five hundred\n\ngrams but less than two kilograms).     As set forth in the amended\n\nplea agreement, this drug quantity resulted in a BOL of 24 under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(8).    The parties further agreed that Colón would\n\nreceive the three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility for a TOL of 21.\n\n            Next, the amended plea agreement erroneously stated that\n\n\"[a]ssuming a Criminal History of VII, the sentence would be\n\nbetween fifty-seven (57) to seventy-one (71) months.\" The criminal\n\nhistory categories in the Guidelines do not exceed VI, and the\n\nsentencing range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months actually\n\ncorresponds to a criminal history category of IV, which, leaving\n\naside Colón's career offender status, would have been Colón's\n\ncorrect criminal history category.\n\n            However, the amended plea agreement went on to explain\n\nthat \"the   parties are aware based on the Pre-Sentence Report that\n\nthe defendant is a Career Offender . . . .\"         The amended plea\n\nagreement states that Colón's career offender status would result\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fin a BOL of 29, a criminal history category of VI, and a Guidelines\n\nsentencing range of 151 to 188 months. While this criminal history\n\ncategory and Guidelines sentencing range are ultimately correct,\n\nColón's total offense level, and not his base offense level, would\n\nbe   29   once   the   three-level    adjustment   for   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility was incorporated.7         The government then agreed to\n\nrecommend a sentence at the lowest end of the Guidelines range.\n\n                       F.   The Sentencing Hearing\n\n           On the morning of November 14, 2002, the district court\n\ncalled Colón's sentencing hearing and received the amended plea\n\nagreement, which Colón again had signed the day of the hearing.       At\n\nthe sentencing hearing, the district court asked Colón a series of\n\nquestions about the PSR.       Colón responded that his attorney had\n\ninformed him of the PSR \"[a] little bit\" and that Peña \"just told\n\nme that the [PSR] was recommending that my sentence be increased\n\nbecause I'm a career criminal.\" After several exchanges, the court\n\nasked whether Colón needed more time to go over the PSR with Peña,\n\nand Colón said that he did not.      The court also asked whether Colón\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Colón's BOL would have been 32 because under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1\nthis is the BOL corresponding to a statutory maximum sentence of\ntwenty years, the maximum provided by the relevant statute. See 21\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (providing a maximum sentence of twenty years\nfor violations involving less than five hundred grams of cocaine).\nThe BOL of 32 presumably would be reduced to a TOL of 29 because of\nthe   three-level    downward   adjustment    for   acceptance   of\nresponsibility.\n\n                                   -13-\n\fwished the court to correct any information in that report.       The\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n          Colón: Well, what I don't understand is that\n          when I plead guilty here the first time and\n          that was because of advise [sic] that I had\n          received that I should plead guilty to a\n          lesser offense [and] what surprises me that\n          now my criminal record is being used –\n\n          The court: Why does that surprise you?  You\n          know the criminal record you had before you\n          plead guilty, did you not?\n\n             Colón:   Well, it surprises me because my\n             attorney came to talk to me about what was to\n             my best advantage.\n\n          The court:    Of course, did you tell your\n          attorney that you had three prior convictions?\n\n          Colón:    I gave him documents that so stated.\n\nAt that point, the court inquired of Peña whether he had seen those\n\ndocuments.      Peña replied: \"No, Your Honor. . . .         The only\n\ninformation he gave me regarding the prior convictions of him was\n\na charge for robbery and that was all the information I had from\n\nhim regarding his prior convictions.    So that's not true at all.\"\n\n          Hearing this account from Peña, the court recalled that\n\nfive days earlier, on November 9, when Colón's sentencing had been\n\nscheduled and then postponed, Peña and the Assistant U.S. Attorney\n\n(AUSA) approached the bench and \"at that time [Peña] informed the\n\ncourt that you were surprised because the criminal history category\n\n[as set forth in the PSR] had come out much higher than what you\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fwere aware of.\"   When Peña confirmed that the court's recollection\n\nwas correct, the court said:\n\n          So, taking that into consideration it would\n          seem to me that you were never informed by\n          your client of the extent of his criminal\n          record, otherwise you would have been aware\n          that his criminal history category would be\n          higher and, therefore, that would have been\n          considered by you in talking to the government\n          for a possible plea.\n\nPeña confirmed the accuracy of the court's statement.      The court\n\nthen went on to conclude:\n\n          So, I believe that counsel's statement to the\n          court is the truth in view of counsel's\n          reaction when he came here for your sentence\n          originally November 9th and he was surprised\n          that your criminal history category was higher\n          because of the prior convictions that you had\n          which he had not learned about from you. So,\n          it would seem to me that the statements you\n          are making to the court are not accurate.\n\n          Colón replied that \"[t]he only thing I want to tell you,\n\nYour Honor, is that I have nothing against counsel.\"       After the\n\ncourt said \"[o]h, I know that,\" Colón continued:\n\n          So you can see that I am not lying to you, he\n          has the document there and if he could please\n          show it to you. It's a document that states\n          the cases that I had before and that I had\n          given that document to him way at the\n          beginning.   That is simply so you could see\n          that I wasn't lying, that I am being honest.\n\n\nWhen the court again turned to Peña for a response, counsel\n\nadmitted that \"we do have the document that was handed by him but\n\nthis document was not handed previously to the change of plea\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fhearing.   This was handed afterwards.    We were not at the moment of\n\nthe change of plea aware of the fact that he had those previous\n\nconvictions, Your Honor.\"   The court then observed that \"[i]n any\n\nevent, once you learned of that fact, I believe you went back to\n\nthe [AUSA] and tried to renegotiate the plea?\" Peña confirmed that\n\nhe had in fact done so.\n\n           The court then confirmed that Colón had signed the\n\namended plea agreement and began discussing the agreement's terms,\n\nnoting that the reduction in drug quantity reduced Colón's TOL and\n\nthus his Guidelines sentencing range from 188-235 months down to\n\n151-188 months. After confirming that Colón was aware of both that\n\nreduction and that the government recommended a 151-month sentence,\n\nthe court asked Peña if there was anything he would like to state\n\nfor the record on behalf of Colón.     Peña offered that \"the sentence\n\nthat defendant is facing right now due to his category as a career\n\noffender . . . is much harsher than it should be if we do consider\n\nthe instant offense by itself . . . .\"    Peña then acknowledged that\n\nthe court had limited discretion to depart from the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines and reiterated that the proposed sentence is a \"very\n\nharsh sentence for our client . . . .\"     Counsel went on to say that\n\n           [o]ther than that, Your Honor, this is the\n           first time that we ever face a situation like\n           this. The representation that defendant had\n           done to the court is in terms of that. We did\n           not discharge our responsibility adequately\n           although our position, Your Honor, is that we\n           were from the very beginning trying to help\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f              our client, defendant, in terms                     of   the\n              negotiations with the government.\n\nFollowing brief          statements     by    Colón   and   the   AUSA,      the   court\n\nsentenced Colón to 151 months of imprisonment, a six-year term of\n\nsupervised release with certain conditions, and a special monetary\n\nassessment of $100.\n\n                                             II.\n\n              On appeal, Colón now argues that he was denied effective\n\nassistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Before\n\nwe reach the merits of Colón's argument, we must first address the\n\npropriety of considering it on direct appellate review.\n\n                    A.    Availability of Appellate Review\n\n              When we receive ineffective assistance of counsel claims\n\non   direct    appeal,      we   have   three      options.       First,     and   most\n\ntypically,     we    respond     that    such      claims   \"must      originally    be\n\npresented to the district court\" as a collateral attack under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255.8      United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 221\n\n\n\n      8\n      28 U.S.C. § 2255 provides that prisoners may seek relief\nthrough a writ of habeas corpus:\n\n      A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court\n      established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be\n      released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in\n      violation of the Constitution or laws of the United\n      States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to\n      impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess\n      of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject\n      to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed\n      the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the\n      sentence.\n\n                                         -17-\n\f(1st Cir. 1994) (quoting United States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955,\n\n956 (1st Cir. 1989)); see also United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,\n\n219 F.3d 37, 41-42 (1st Cir. 2000) (collecting cases).                             Often the\n\nrecord    is        not    sufficiently            developed      to       allow    adequate\n\nconsideration of the issue on appeal, and district courts are in a\n\nbetter position to adduce the relevant evidence. See United States\n\nv. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"A principal purpose\n\nfor the rule is the need to marshal and evaluate evidentiary facts\n\nrequired to place the adequacy of a defendant's representation into\n\nproper perspective.\").\n\n            A second option is available \"where the critical facts\n\nare not     genuinely          in    dispute      and   the    record      is   sufficiently\n\ndeveloped      to    allow      reasoned         consideration       of    an    ineffective\n\nassistance claim.\"             Id.        In those comparatively rare situations,\n\n\"an   appellate       court         may    dispense     with   the     usual     praxis   and\n\ndetermine the merits of such a contention on direct appeal.\"                              Id.;\n\nsee also United States v. Downs-Moses, 329 F.3d 253, 264-265 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n            This case falls into the gray area between these two\n\ncategories.         In ways that we will explain, the record here is not\n\ndeveloped enough to decide the ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim on the merits, yet it does contain sufficient indicia of\n\nineffectiveness           in    the       plea    agreements,        the    PSR,   and    the\n\ntranscripts of the change of plea and sentencing hearings to\n\n\n                                                 -18-\n\fwarrant remanding for an evidentiary hearing on the issue without\n\nrequiring defendant to bring a collateral attack instead.                            See\n\nUnites States v. Theodore, 354 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding\n\n\"indicia of ineffectiveness\" and remanding to the district court so\n\nthat it could \"determine in the first instance whether defense\n\ncounsel's     total       performance      was    such    that   a     new   trial   is\n\nwarranted\"); see also United States v. Leone, 215 F.3d 253, 256 (2d\n\nCir. 2000) (observing that \"when faced with such a claim for\n\nineffective assistance on direct appeal, we may do one of three\n\nthings: (1) decline to hear the claim, permitting the appellant to\n\nraise the issue as part of a subsequent § 2255 petition; (2) remand\n\nthe claim to the district court for necessary fact-finding; or (3)\n\ndecide the claim on the record before us\"); accord Wayne R. LaFave\n\net al., Criminal Procedure § 11.7(e) (2d ed. 1999).\n\n                B.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n            The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nguarantees that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall\n\nenjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his\n\ndefence.\"      It     is   well     settled      that   this   right    to   effective\n\nassistance of counsel attaches at all critical stages of the trial,\n\nUnited   States      v.     Wade,    388    U.S.    218    (1967),      including    at\n\nsentencing.    Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 358 (1977) (holding\n\nthat \"sentencing is a critical stage of the criminal proceeding at\n\n\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\fwhich [defendant] is entitled to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel\").\n\n           The touchstone for any ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim is the two-part test laid down by the Supreme Court in\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).\n\n           First, the defendant must show that counsel's\n           performance was deficient. This requires\n           showing that counsel made errors so serious\n           that counsel was not functioning as the\n           \"counsel\" guaranteed the defendant by the\n           Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must\n           show that the deficient performance prejudiced\n           the defense. This requires showing that\n           counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive\n           the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose\n           result is reliable.\n\nId. at 687.     In other words, defendant \"must show that counsel's\n\nperformance was so deficient that it prejudiced his defense.\"\n\nUnited   States   v.   Ademaj,   170   F.3d   58,   64   (1st   Cir.   1999)\n\n(summarizing Strickland).        As the Strickland Court explained,\n\n\"[u]nless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that\n\nthe conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the\n\nadversary process that renders the result unreliable.\" Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 687.\n\n             In Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985), the Supreme\n\nCourt applied Strickland's two-part test to ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel claims in the guilty plea context.        Id. at 58 (\"We hold,\n\ntherefore, that the two-part Strickland v. Washington test applies\n\nto challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fcounsel.\").        As the Hill Court explained, \"[i]n the context of\n\nguilty pleas, the first half of the Strickland v. Washington test\n\nis nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney\n\ncompetence already set forth in [other cases].                        The second, or\n\n'prejudice,' requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether\n\ncounsel's constitutionally ineffective performance affected the\n\noutcome of the plea process.\"            Id. at 58-59.          Accordingly, Colón\n\nwill have to show on remand \"a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have\n\ninsisted on going to trial.\" Id. at 59.\n\n             1.     Alleged Deficiencies in Peña's Performance\n\n             This    record    raises    troubling      questions      about   Peña's\n\nperformance.\n\n                         a. Colón's criminal history\n\n             It     is   undisputed     that    Peña    did     not    independently\n\ninvestigate his client's criminal history before recommending that\n\nColón enter into the plea agreement.              Instead, according to Peña,\n\nhe relied on Colón's representation that he had been convicted only\n\nonce, for robbery, prior to this case.                  There is no per se rule\n\nthat    an   attorney's      failure    to     investigate      independently     his\n\nclient's criminal history before advising him to accept a plea\n\noffer is ineffective assistance.              Clients should answer truthfully\n\ntheir   attorney's        inquiries    about    their    past    convictions,     and\n\nlawyers      are    entitled    to     rely     reasonably      on     the   explicit\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\frepresentations of clients about their criminal histories.                     See\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 691 (explaining that counsel need not\n\nundertake investigations if they reach \"a reasonable decision that\n\nmakes particular investigations unnecessary\").            We agree with one\n\nof our sister circuits that \"a determination of whether reliance on\n\na client's statement of his own criminal history constitutes\n\ndeficient       performance    depends      on   the   peculiar        facts   and\n\ncircumstances of each case.\" United States v. Pease, 240 F.3d 938,\n\n941-42 (11th Cir. 2001).       See also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691 (\"In\n\nany ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate\n\nmust       be   directly   assessed   for    reasonableness       in     all   the\n\ncircumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel's\n\njudgments.\"); United States v. Russell, 221 F.3d 615, 621 (4th Cir.\n\n2000) (\"When representing a criminal client, the obligation to\n\nconduct an adequate investigation will often include verifying the\n\nstatus of the client's criminal record, and the failure to do so\n\nmay support a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.\")9\n\n\n       9\n      A client's criminal history almost always has significant\nbearing on the sentence a defendant will face under the Guidelines.\nHere, the recommended sentence agreed to by the parties in the\noriginal plea agreement (sixty months) was never a possibility in\nlight of Colón's actual criminal history. Moreover, in the absence\nof any indication that Colón would have to be sentenced as a career\noffender, the sentence described by the judge at the change of plea\nhearing (a maximum of seventy-one months, based on a criminal\nhistory category only one step higher than that assumed in the plea\nagreement) was far below the sentence Colón actually faced.\nColón's career offender status exposed him to an additional\nimprisonment term of between ten and fourteen years under the drug\nquantity calculation and other stipulations of the original plea\n\n                                      -22-\n\f             In this case, as in many cases involving claims of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel, a factual dispute must be\n\nresolved before a court makes any judgment about the effectiveness\n\nof Peña's performance in dealing with Colón's criminal history.\n\nAccording to Colón, as recounted to the district court, he gave\n\nPeña a document that detailed Colón's full criminal history \"way at\n\nthe beginning\" of their relationship.             As we have noted, Peña\n\ndisagreed with the account Colón gave the district court. He first\n\ntold the     court    that   \"[t]he   only   information   [Colón]   gave   me\n\nregarding the prior convictions of him was a charge for robbery and\n\nthat was all the information I had from him regarding his prior\n\nconvictions.\"        Then, once Colón pointed out that Peña had the\n\ndocument detailing his criminal history           with him in court, Peña\n\nadmitted that \"we do have the document that was handed by him but\n\nthis document was not handed previously to the change of plea\n\nhearing.     This was handed afterwards.\"\n\n             It is somewhat curious that Peña says that he received\n\nthe document after the change of plea hearing, which was held May\n\n2.   The district court commented that Peña was surprised about\n\nColón’s career offender status, as revealed in the PSR, at the\n\nNovember 9 hearing.      Presumably, if Peña had received the document\n\nbefore receipt of the PSR (transmitted to Peña on October 2,\n\naccording to the district court docket), he would not have been\n\n\nagreement.\n\n                                      -23-\n\fsurprised at the November 9 hearing and would not have waited to\n\nrenegotiate the plea agreement until after receipt of the PSR.         On\n\nthe other hand, if Peña had received the document from Colón after\n\nhe received the PSR, it seems likely that he would have said that\n\nColón gave him the criminal history document after Peña received\n\nthe PSR, not after the change of plea hearing.\n\n             On remand, the district court will have to engage in fact\n\nfinding on what information Colón gave Peña about his criminal\n\nhistory and when he gave it to him.        If Colón misinformed Peña\n\nabout Colón's prior convictions when Peña recommended that Colón\n\nenter into the original plea agreement, that fact would have to be\n\nweighed carefully in deciding whether Peña still should have\n\nconducted    some   independent   investigation   of   Colón's   criminal\n\nhistory.10     On the other hand, if Colón provided Peña with a\n\ndocument accurately detailing his past convictions prior to the\n\nrecommendation of Peña that he accept a plea agreement that would\n\nnot withstand scrutiny because of those past convictions, Peña's\n\nrecommendation would seem to be clear evidence of ineffectiveness\n\nof counsel.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       Colón's appellate attorney plausibly represents that\n\"obtaining a criminal record under local laws [is] a routine\nmatter\" and can be accomplished easily, presumably in part because\nall of Colón's prior convictions are for violations of Commonwealth\nlaws.\n\n                                   -24-\n\f                    b.    Explaining the PSR or Plea Agreements\n\n           Colón also alleges that Peña did not adequately explain\n\nthe PSR or the plea agreements.                Colón signed both the plea\n\nagreement and the amended plea agreement on the day that they were\n\neach presented in court.        In the peculiar circumstances of this\n\ncase, these last-minute signings suggest that Colón might have\n\nlacked sufficient time to consider the pleas, their ramifications,\n\nand any relevant advice Peña offered.           Additionally, the appellate\n\nrecord suggests that when Peña received the PSR, he did not discuss\n\nthe PSR with Colón prior to renegotiating a plea on his behalf with\n\nthe government.      In fact, the material before us suggests that\n\nColón may have seen the PSR and the amended plea agreement for the\n\nfirst time the morning of his sentencing hearing. Moreoever, if\n\nPeña ever discussed with Colón the possibility of withdrawing the\n\nplea in light of the career offender disclosure of the PSR, there\n\nis no hint of such discussion in the record.\n\n           These suggestions of haste and limited communication with\n\nColón add significance to Peña's failures to correct errors in the\n\nPSR (misstating the BOL, statutory maximum sentence, and Guidelines\n\nsentencing    calculation)      and    in     the   amended    plea   agreement\n\n(misstating the criminal history category and substituting a \"base\n\noffense   level\"    for   a   \"total    offense     level\").     Unnoticed   or\n\nunaddressed    by    Peña,     these     errors     reflect     the   kind   of\n\ninattentiveness to detail by Peña described by Colón in his pro se\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fmotion for change of counsel. The last-minute signings of the plea\n\nagreements, coupled with the uncorrected errors in the documents,\n\nmay be further indicia of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n                     c.     Peña's Admission of Inadequacy at Sentencing\n\n            At the sentencing, Peña said that \"[w]e did not discharge\n\nour responsibility adequately although our position, Your Honor, is\n\nthat we were from the very beginning trying to help our client,\n\ndefendant, in terms of the negotiations with the government.\" This\n\nrevealing comment was made after Colón insisted that Peña show the\n\ndocument detailing Colón's criminal history to the court. Although\n\nPeña may not have intended this statement as an admission of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel, it is an unusual concession for\n\ncounsel    to   make,     and    it   is   one    more   indication     of   possible\n\nineffectiveness      that       justifies    the   remand    for   an   evidentiary\n\nhearing.\n\n                     d.     Conflict of Interest\n\n            Few commitments from an attorney to a client are more\n\nimportant than \"a duty of loyalty, a duty to avoid conflicts of\n\ninterest.\"      Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688.             On remand, the court must\n\nexplore whether Peña's interests became adverse to Colón's during\n\nthe sentencing hearing.           There are worrisome indications of such a\n\nconflict.\n\n            We have held that \"in order to show an actual conflict of\n\ninterest, a defendant must show that (1) the lawyer could have\n\n\n                                           -26-\n\fpursued a plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic and (2)\n\nthe alternative strategy or tactic was inherently in conflict with\n\nor   not   undertaken   due     to   the    attorney's    other   interests    or\n\nloyalties.\"     United States v. Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d 480, 486\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).        Here, the relevant defense strategy was a\n\npossible motion for the withdrawal of Colón's plea.                   Peña might\n\nwell have argued at the sentencing hearing that Colón should be\n\nallowed to withdraw his guilty plea because Colón was unaware of\n\nthe consequences of his plea, given the impact of his criminal\n\nhistory     category    under    the       Sentencing    Guidelines    and    the\n\nimpossibility of the sixty month sentence agreed to by the parties.\n\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2) (allowing plea withdrawals prior to\n\nsentencing when \"the defendant can show a fair and just reason for\n\nrequesting the withdrawal\").11 There is no indication in the record\n\nthat Peña advised Colón at any time after receipt of the PSR of the\n\npossibility that he might file with the court a motion to withdraw\n\nhis plea.\n\n            A conflict of interest might explain this silence.               Such\n\na withdrawal motion would likely implicate Peña's lack of awareness\n\nof Colón's criminal history, or his failure to appreciate its\n\n\n\n      11\n      When Colón pled guilty in November 2002, the relevant\nstandard was then reflected in Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(d), which\nallowed withdrawal prior to sentencing for \"any fair and just\nreason.\" This provision of Rule 32 was incorporated into current\nRule 11 as part of the 2002 amendments designed to generally\nrestyle and reorganize the Criminal Rules.\n\n                                       -27-\n\fsignificance,     in   recommending       the   original   plea   agreement.12\n\nMoreover, unaware of the possibility of a career offender sentence\n\nfor Colón, the court itself arguably might have misled Colón at the\n\nchange of plea hearing when it suggested to him that if his\n\ncriminal history category was higher than a II, the Guidelines\n\nrange he faced was only sixty to seventy-one months (corresponding\n\nto a criminal history category of III, when the statutory minimum\n\nof sixty months is taken into account).            Together, Peña's pre-plea\n\nperformance and the district court's explanation of the sentence\n\nmight have provided \"a fair and just reason\" for withdrawal of the\n\nguilty plea.      But Peña, perhaps absorbed in defending his own\n\nperformance before the judge and inattentive to important details\n\nof the plea proceedings, apparently overlooked or chose to ignore\n\nthe option of a motion to withdraw Colón's plea.\n\n           This   would   not   be    a    small   oversight.     During   the\n\nsentencing hearing, it would appear to Colón that he had only two\n\noptions.    He could disavow the amended plea agreement and be\n\nsentenced as a career offender under the original plea agreement's\n\n\n\n     12\n      As we have described, Colón claimed that he had provided Peña\nwith documents detailing his conviction history at an early stage\nin the proceedings and that Peña failed to properly advise Colón of\nthe effect his career offender status would have on sentencing if\nColón pled guilty. At the sentencing hearing, the district court\nasked Peña whether Colón was being truthful in his representations\nto the court. At that point, Peña and Colón were pitted against\neach other in a credibility contest, with the court ultimately\ndeciding   that   Peña  was   truthful   and   Colón   (potentially\nunrepresented in that contest) was not.\n\n                                     -28-\n\fhigher drug quantity calculation. Under that scenario, Colón would\n\nbe exposed to a Sentencing Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months.\n\nAlternatively, he could continue under the terms of the amended\n\nplea agreement and be sentenced as a career offender under the\n\namended plea agreement's reduced drug quantity calculation.   Under\n\nthat scenario, Colón would be exposed to a Sentencing Guidelines\n\nrange of 151 to 188 months.   Not surprisingly, he chose the latter\n\ncourse.     If he was unaware that there was a third option – the\n\npossibility of withdrawing his plea entirely – his choice to go\n\nforward with the amended plea agreement was not an informed one.\n\n            We recognize that the silence of this record on Colón's\n\nawareness of the plea withdrawal possibility at this critical\n\njuncture of the proceedings may reflect only the inadequacy of the\n\nrecord.   Perhaps Peña discussed that possibility with Colón and he\n\nrejected it.13   An evidentiary hearing on remand can explore that\n\nquestion.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n      In his briefs to this court, Colón claims that he was not\naware that he could have moved to withdraw his guilty plea. In\nresponse to the government's point that Colón did not seek to\nwithdraw his guilty plea below, Colón's reply brief states that\n\"[o]ur position throughout our argument is that Appellant's [trial]\ncounsel was ineffective, and, at sentencing, it did not exist at\nall. So, how could, and why, would the Appellant request something\nhe did not know he had the right to.\" Colón's appellate briefs go\non to claim that \"[h]e was never offered a fair chance to withdraw\nhis plea, nor did he know that he could have requested so since he\nattended a crucial part of the trial without legal representation\nas mandated by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution.\"\n\n                                -29-\n\f              Also, we are not suggesting that Peña should not have\n\nbeen allowed to defend himself at the sentencing hearing against a\n\ncharge by his client that he claimed was inaccurate.                     We only\n\nobserve that the court's inquiry into Peña's and his client's\n\nconflicting versions of Peña's performance arguably put their\n\ninterests at odds, at least at that juncture, leaving Peña to\n\ndefend   himself    against      his   client's   accusations    and     possibly\n\nleaving Colón without conflict-free representation at a crucial\n\npoint in the sentencing hearing.\n\n              Other courts have faced the implications of this kind of\n\ncredibility contest between counsel and client at a critical stage\n\nof the criminal proceedings.           In Lopez v. Scully, 58 F.3d 38 (2d\n\nCir. 1995), the Second Circuit addressed petitioner's contention\n\n\"that he was denied effective assistance of counsel since his\n\nattorney labored under an actual conflict of interest during the\n\nsentencing proceeding\" because of the charges of incompetence\n\npetitioner brought forth against his attorney during the sentencing\n\nhearing.      Id. at 41.   Specifically, the petitioner filed a pro se\n\nmotion   to    withdraw    his   guilty   plea    at   the   beginning    of   the\n\nsentencing hearing, claiming that his attorney had coerced him into\n\npleading guilty.     The Lopez court observed that \"to argue in favor\n\nof his client's [position] would require admitting to serious\n\nethical violations and possibly subject him to liability for\n\nmalpractice; on the other hand, any contention by counsel that\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fdefendant's allegations were not true would contradict his client.\"\n\nId. at 41 (finding a conflict of interest between an attorney and\n\nhis client when the client alleged that the attorney coerced him\n\ninto   pleading    guilty)    (citation       and   internal     quotation   marks\n\nomitted).   Here, as in Lopez, \"the attorney [arguably] put his own\n\ninterests ahead of his client's by denying the truth of [his\n\nclient's]   allegations       and   thereby     attacking   his    own    client's\n\ncredibility.\"     Id.\n\n            Similarly,     when     defense    counsel   denied     his   client's\n\naccusations of wrongdoing at a plea-withdrawal hearing, the Seventh\n\nCircuit held that \"[a]ny contention by counsel that defendant's\n\nallegations were not true would (and did) contradict his client.\n\nIn testifying against his client, counsel acted as both counselor\n\nand witness for the prosecution.                These roles are inherently\n\ninconsistent.\"     United States v. Ellison, 798 F.2d 1102, 1107 (7th\n\nCir. 1986). In combination with the other factors cited, there are\n\nsufficient indicia of such a conflict of interest here to justify\n\nremanding this case for a full evidentiary hearing on Colón's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n\n            2.    Prejudice\n\n            As    we    observed     earlier,       Strickland    requires    both\n\ndeficient attorney performance and resulting prejudice.                   466 U.S.\n\nat 687.     Here, the potential prejudice to Colón is easy to\n\nidentify: the lost opportunity to attempt to withdraw the guilty\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\fplea – or perhaps reject the original plea agreement – and exercise\n\nhis constitutional right to a trial.               Colón is now adamant that he\n\nwants to have that trial option.               In his briefs to this court,\n\nColón clearly expresses his desire to withdraw his plea and go to\n\ntrial, claiming that he \"was never given the option to choose\n\nbetween a long sentence or going to trial, and, if he had been\n\noffered it, he would have rejected it due to the little evidence\n\nagainst him. . . .         He was never given such option nor did he know\n\nhe had it.     He knows now and he does request so now.\"              Of course,\n\nthese claims will be tested on remand in accordance with Hill's\n\nrequirement that defendant show \"a reasonable probability that, but\n\nfor counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would\n\nhave insisted on going to trial.\" Hill, 474 U.S. at 59.\n\n             In an attempt to blunt this prejudice argument, the\n\ngovernment asserts that the trial court \"cured\" any problems with\n\nPeña's performance with its careful explanation of the consequences\n\nof Colón's plea at the change of plea and sentencing hearings.                  We\n\nhave already noted one problem with the court's explanation of the\n\nplea consequences at the change of plea hearing because of its\n\nunawareness that Colón might be sentenced as a career offender.\n\nBut   the    more    basic   issue    is    that   the   court's   questions   and\n\nexplanations        to   Colón   at   the   sentencing    hearing   (which     were\n\ngenerally on the mark) never addressed the withdrawal of plea\n\nissue.      We do not fault the court for this omission.             Indeed, the\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\fcourt established at the sentencing hearing that Peña renegotiated\n\nthe plea agreement with the government when he read in the PSR that\n\nhis client was a career offender.            In light of this description by\n\nPeña of     his   renegotiation    effort,     the   court   might   well   have\n\ninferred that Peña was carrying out his client's wishes.              It would\n\ncertainly be unusual for counsel to conduct such renegotiations\n\nwithout first discussing with the client the range of options\n\navailable, including the possibility of filing a motion to withdraw\n\nthe plea.    Yet the record raises the real possibility that such a\n\ndiscussion never took place.           On the option of possibly moving to\n\nwithdraw the plea, the trial court's questions and explanations\n\nabout the consequences of a plea agreement are not a substitute for\n\nadequate legal advice by a competent attorney. The colloquies with\n\nthe court did not cure the possible prejudice identified here.\n\n\n\n                                       III.\n\n            The factors we have identified – Peña's handling of\n\nColón's criminal history, his failure to correct errors in the PSR\n\nand the amended plea agreement, the plausible suggestion that he\n\ndid not adequately explain the PSR or the plea agreements to Colón,\n\nthe   comment     that   \"[w]e   did   not    discharge   our   responsibility\n\nadequately,\" and the potential conflict of interest – provide\n\nserious indicia of ineffective performance that may have induced\n\nColón to enter an improvident plea and then deprived him of the\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\fopportunity to attempt to withdraw that plea and exercise his right\n\nto go to trial.      Under these circumstances, we choose, in the\n\nexercise of our discretion, to remand this case to the district\n\ncourt for a full hearing on Colón's Sixth Amendment claim.               If\n\nColón establishes that claim, his sentence should be vacated and he\n\nshould be afforded an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.14\n\nThat    said,   nothing   contained   herein   should   be   construed   as\n\nexpressing any opinion on the appropriate outcome of this case on\n\nremand.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n       14\n      We suggest that the district court allow Colón’s appellate\nattorney to continue to represent him on remand, given his\nfamiliarity with the case and his success on appeal.\n\n                                  -34-\n\f",

Col&#243;n-Torres (\"Col&#243;n\") pled guilty to one count of an indictment for a drug offense. On appeal, Col&#243;n argues that his plea was not knowing and voluntary and that his sentence should be vacated because he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In pursuing this Sixth Amendment claim, Col&#243;n alleges several deficiencies in the performance of his attorney, Joaqu&#237;n Pe&#241;a R&#237;os (\"Pe&#241;a\"), including claims that Pe&#241;a failed to investigate Col&#243;n's criminal history prior to recommending a plea agreement (Col&#243;n was sentenced as a career offender), and that Pe&#241;a became ensnared in an actual conflict of interest during Col&#243;n's sentencing hearing, effectively depriving Col&#243;n of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we rarely entertain ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal, instead relying on collateral proceedings for such challenges, this case fits within an exception to the rule.

After a careful analysis of the record and the case law, we remand for an evidentiary hearing on whether the judgment should be vacated and Col&#243;n should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea due to the ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the background facts of the underlying criminal activity are not at issue in this case, we do not repeat the details here. For our purposes, it suffices to say that defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute, <i>inter alia,</i> five kilograms or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The facts and circumstances surrounding defendant's relationship with his attorney are both more relevant and complicated.

Following two status conferences held on December 19, 2001, and February 1, 2002, Col&#243;n filed a pro se motion requesting the appointment of a new attorney. The district court received the motion on April 2. In his pro se motion, which Col&#243;n filed in Spanish and which is now reproduced in English for the appellate record, Col&#243;n contended that \"the client-attorney relationship has deteriorated due to the attitude by counselor Pe&#241;a of insisting in his persuasive way to try to push me into a decision without having counseled me in a competent and effective manner so that [the defendant] would make a correct decision before the Court.\" Defendant's pro se motion specifically alleged that his attorney had provided him with no documents related to his case, including the indictment, discovery materials, or any statements of governmental witnesses producible under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Additionally, the defendant alleged that while he was talking to his attorney on March 25, 2002, they \"were approached by another one of [Pe&#241;a's] clients ... [who] started yelling to Pe&#241;a saying he was an incompetent and anti-ethical attorney, that he never handed him any document regarding his criminal case and that he cheated him by stating that he was ready to see his case.\" Then, according to defendant's translated pro se motion, \"Pe&#241;a reacted in an anti-professional and anti-ethical manner and the argument between him and his [other] client descended to levels which cannot be quoted at this time.\" The district court did not respond to defendant's pro se motion for new counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Plea Agreement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 2002, Pe&#241;a filed a motion for change of plea on behalf of Col&#243;n, and the district court set the change of plea hearing for May 2. On that date, the defendant pled guilty to count one of the indictment after signing the plea agreement that same day. The plea agreement indicated that the penalty for the offense charged \"is a term of imprisonment which shall not be less than ten (10) years and not more than Life\" in addition to certain fines and a period of supervised release, in accordance with 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) (detailing the minimum and maximum sentences for, <i>inter alia,</i> crimes involving five or more kilograms of cocaine). The plea agreement also stated that \"the Court shall impose a sentence in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines... without regard to any statutory minimum sentence [a reference to the so-called \"safety valve\" provision], if the court finds that the defendant meets the criteria contained in [18 U.S.C.] &#167; 3553(f)(1)-(5) [which are reflected in] Guidelines &#167; 5C1.2.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Sentencing Guidelines set forth the criteria referred to in the plea agreement. The first criterion is that \"the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines [in U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1].\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a)(1). Sentencing Guidelines &#167; 4A1.1 sets forth the number of criminal history points assigned to a defendant based on his prior sentences of imprisonment. In the plea agreement, the parties assumed a criminal history category of II, which corresponds to a defendant having two or three criminal history points as described in U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1. This assumption &#8212; that Col&#243;n has two or three criminal history points &#8212; would preclude the application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which requires, <i>inter alia,</i> that a defendant have no more than one criminal history point. Accordingly, under the criminal history category assumption in the plea agreement, Col&#243;n was not eligible for sentencing without regard to the statutory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines calculations in the plea agreement provide that based on a drug quantity amount of at least five hundred grams but less than two kilograms of cocaine, Col&#243;n's base offense level (\"BOL\") was 26 pursuant to the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(7). The plea agreement also stipulates that \"[s]hould defendant clearly demonstrate acceptance of responsibility for the offense, defendant's base offense level shall be reduced by three levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b).\" These agreements resulted in a BOL of 23, and, given the assumption of a criminal history category of two, a Sentencing Guidelines range of fifty-one to sixty-three months of imprisonment. The government and the defendant agreed to a recommended sentence of sixty months of imprisonment. Because Col&#243;n pled guilty to a drug quantity of five hundred grams to two kilograms (as opposed to the more than five kilogram quantity for which he was indicted), his statutory minimum sentence dropped from ten years to five years. <i>Compare</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) (providing that in cases involving five kilograms or more of cocaine, the defendant shall be imprisoned for not less than ten years and not more than life), <i>with id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) (providing that in cases involving five hundred grams or more &#8212; and, implicitly, less than five kilograms &#8212; of cocaine, the defendant shall be imprisoned for not less than five years and not more than forty years).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Change of Plea Hearing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the change of plea hearing on May 2, the district court orally went through the plea agreement with Col&#243;n. The court said that \"if we assume a criminal history category of one, then the guideline range would be 46 to 57 months. But if we assume a criminal history category of two, which apparently is what you and your attorney and the attorney for the government think that is the correct criminal history category, then the guideline range would be 51 to 63 months. Do you understand that up to now?\" Col&#243;n replied that he did. The district court continued: \"But since there is a statutory mandatory minimum of 60 months, then the guideline range would be 60 to 63 months and then the government and you would recommend to the court that I sentence you to the bottom end of the guideline range which is 60 months.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Again, upon questioning, Col&#243;n indicated that he understood the court's explanation that because the statute imposed a minimum sentence of five years for the drug quantity to which Col&#243;n pled guilty, the Guidelines sentencing range was effectively sixty to sixty-three months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court stated: \"Now, are you aware of the fact that there is no stipulation as to the criminal history category but, as I mentioned before, it is assumed that your criminal history category is two.... And if it's higher than two, then the guideline range would be 60 to 71 months instead of 60 to 63 months.\" Since the plea agreement did not suggest that a career offender designation was a possibility, the court did not refer to the possibility of Col&#243;n being sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. Instead, the district court conveyed the impression that the likely maximum sentence Col&#243;n faced was seventy-one months, corresponding to a criminal history category of III, which is one category higher than the category assumed in the plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Pe&#241;a said nothing to dispel this impression. Upon questioning, Col&#243;n continued to state that he understood the court's explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>The Presentence Report</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report (\"PSR\"), prepared on September 3, 2002, stated that Col&#243;n had three prior convictions under Commonwealth laws, and that his criminal history points totaled eight under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1. Ordinarily, eight criminal history points would have earned Col&#243;n a criminal history category of IV. However, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1 provides that a defendant will be treated as a career offender if he was at least eighteen years old when he committed the instant crime of violence or a controlled substance offense and has two prior convictions for either type of offense. The PSR then correctly identified Col&#243;n as a career offender, based on his prior convictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n's career offender status affected the applicable sentence in two ways under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. First, all career offenders are assigned to criminal history category VI, the highest category in the Guidelines. Second, a career offender's BOL is the greater of either the BOL otherwise calculated under the Guidelines or the BOL listed in a table in U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. This table sets the BOL according to the statutory maximum sentence for the underlying offense. Because the statutory maximum for the drug quantity to which Col&#243;n pled guilty (five hundred grams to two kilograms) was forty years under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), his BOL as a career offender under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1 should have been 34, which corresponds to a statutory maximum sentence of twenty-five years or more, but less than life imprisonment. The PSR incorrectly stated that \"[b]ased on the statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, the base offense level should be increased to 32\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, which corresponds to a statutory maximum sentence of between twenty and twenty-five years. The PSR committed this mistake despite correctly stating later that \"[p]ursuant to the stipulation [in the plea agreement], the statutory maximum term of imprisonment is forty (40) years and the minimum is five (5) years per 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR carries the BOL error into its description of the sentencing options under the Guidelines provisions. There, the PSR assigns a total offense level (\"TOL\") of 29, which reflects a three-level acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment from the erroneous BOL of 32. A TOL of 29, coupled with a criminal history category of VI, results in a Guidelines sentencing range of 151 to 188 months, which is the recommendation of the PSR. In fact, the TOL should have been 31, which would reflect a three-level acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment from the correct BOL of 34. A TOL of 31, coupled with a criminal history category of VI, would have resulted in a Guidelines sentencing range of 188 to 235 months. In short, the PSR was internally inconsistent on the statutory maximum sentence and incorrectly calculated the sentence that ought to be imposed on Col&#243;n under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, it appears that the United States probation officer who prepared the PSR encountered some difficulty in reaching Pe&#241;a to inform him that the PSR was available. The probation officer certified an addendum to the document noting these difficulties:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for the Government was duly notified on September 24, 2002, and several attempts were made to notify Counsel for the defendant, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3552(d) that the presentence investigation report was ready for their inspection. However, as they have not been able to review the report, objections, if any, have not been submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the district court docket, the presentence report was transmitted to Pe&#241;a on October 2, five days before the sentencing scheduled on October 7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>The Amended Plea Agreement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the information in the PSR about Col&#243;n's career offender status, Pe&#241;a renegotiated the terms of Col&#243;n's plea with the government. The negotiations produced an amended plea agreement, which stipulated a drug quantity amount of four hundred to five hundred grams of cocaine, a smaller figure than the amount indicated in the original plea agreement (at least five hundred grams but less than two kilograms). As set forth in the amended plea agreement, this drug quantity resulted in a BOL of 24 under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(8). The parties further agreed that Col&#243;n would receive the three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for a TOL of 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the amended plea agreement erroneously stated that \"[a]ssuming a Criminal History of VII, the sentence would be between fifty-seven (57) to seventy-one (71) months.\" The criminal history categories in the Guidelines do not exceed VI, and the sentencing range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months actually corresponds to a criminal history category of IV, which, leaving aside Col&#243;n's career offender status, would have been Col&#243;n's correct criminal history category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the amended plea agreement went on to explain that \"the parties are aware based on the Pre-Sentence Report that the defendant is a Career Offender....\" The amended plea agreement states that Col&#243;n's career offender status would result in a BOL of 29, a criminal history category of VI, and a Guidelines sentencing range of 151 to 188 months. While this criminal history category and Guidelines sentencing range are ultimately correct, Col&#243;n's <i>total</i> offense level, and not his <i>base</i> offense level, would be 29 once the three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was incorporated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The government then agreed to recommend a sentence at the lowest end of the Guidelines range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">F. <i>The Sentencing Hearing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of November 14, 2002, the district court called Col&#243;n's sentencing hearing and received the amended plea agreement, which Col&#243;n again had signed the day of the hearing. At the sentencing hearing, the district court asked Col&#243;n a series of questions about the PSR. Col&#243;n responded that his attorney had informed him of the PSR \"[a] little bit\" and that Pe&#241;a \"just told me that the [PSR] was recommending that my sentence be increased because I'm a career criminal.\" After several exchanges, the court asked whether Col&#243;n needed more time to go over the PSR with Pe&#241;a, and Col&#243;n said that he did not. The court also asked whether Col&#243;n wished the court to correct any information in that report. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n: Well, what I don't understand is that when I plead guilty here the first time and that was because of advise [sic] that I had received that I should plead guilty to a lesser offense [and] what surprises me that now my criminal record is being used &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court: Why does that surprise you? You know the criminal record you had before you plead guilty, did you not?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n: Well, it surprises me because my attorney came to talk to me about what was to my best advantage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court: Of course, did you tell your attorney that you had three prior convictions?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n: I gave him documents that so stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, the court inquired of Pe&#241;a whether he had seen those documents. Pe&#241;a replied: \"No, Your Honor.... The only information he gave me regarding the prior convictions of him was a charge for robbery and that was all the information I had from him regarding his prior convictions. So that's not true at all.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hearing this account from Pe&#241;a, the court recalled that five days earlier, on November 9, when Col&#243;n's sentencing had been scheduled and then postponed, Pe&#241;a and the Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) approached the bench and \"at that time [Pe&#241;a] informed the court that you were surprised because the criminal history category [as set forth in the PSR] had come out much higher than what you were aware of.\" When Pe&#241;a confirmed that the court's recollection was correct, the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, taking that into consideration it would seem to me that you were never informed by your client of the extent of his criminal record, otherwise you would have been aware that his criminal history category would be higher and, therefore, that would have been considered by you in talking to the government for a possible plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pe&#241;a confirmed the accuracy of the court's statement. The court then went on to conclude:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, I believe that counsel's statement to the court is the truth in view of counsel's reaction when he came here for your sentence originally November 9th and he was surprised that your criminal history category was higher because of the prior convictions that you had which he had not learned about from you. So, it would seem to me that the statements you are making to the court are not accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n replied that \"[t]he only thing I want to tell you, Your Honor, is that I have nothing against counsel.\" After the court said \"[o]h, I know that,\" Col&#243;n continued: So you can see that I am not lying to you, he has the document there and if he could please show it to you. It's a document that states the cases that I had before and that I had given that document to him way at the beginning. That is simply so you could see that I wasn't lying, that I am being honest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the court again turned to Pe&#241;a for a response, counsel admitted that \"we do have the document that was handed by him but this document was not handed previously to the change of plea hearing. This was handed afterwards. We were not at the moment of the change of plea aware of the fact that he had those previous convictions, Your Honor.\" The court then observed that \"[i]n any event, once you learned of that fact, I believe you went back to the [AUSA] and tried to renegotiate the plea?\" Pe&#241;a confirmed that he had in fact done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then confirmed that Col&#243;n had signed the amended plea agreement and began discussing the agreement's terms, noting that the reduction in drug quantity reduced Col&#243;n's TOL and thus his Guidelines sentencing range from 188-235 months down to 151-188 months. After confirming that Col&#243;n was aware of both that reduction and that the government recommended a 151-month sentence, the court asked Pe&#241;a if there was anything he would like to state for the record on behalf of Col&#243;n. Pe&#241;a offered that \"the sentence that defendant is facing right now due to his category as a career offender ... is much harsher than it should be if we do consider the instant offense by itself. . . .\" Pe&#241;a then acknowledged that the court had limited discretion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines and reiterated that the proposed sentence is a \"very harsh sentence for our client....\" Counsel went on to say that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]ther than that, Your Honor, this is the first time that we ever face a situation like this. The representation that defendant had done to the court is in terms of that. We did not discharge our responsibility adequately although our position, Your Honor, is that we were from the very beginning trying to help our client, defendant, in terms of the negotiations with the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following brief statements by Col&#243;n and the AUSA, the court sentenced Col&#243;n to 151 months of imprisonment, a six-year term of supervised release with certain conditions, and a special monetary assessment of $100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Col&#243;n now argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Before we reach the merits of Col&#243;n's argument, we must first address the propriety of considering it on direct appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Availability of Appellate Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we receive ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal, we have three options. First, and most typically, we respond that such claims \"must originally be presented to the district court\" as a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>United States v. Ovalle-Marquez</i>, 36 F.3d 212, 221 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting <i>United States v. Hunnewell,</i> 891 F.2d 955, 956 (1st Cir.1989)); <i>see also United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,</i> 219 F.3d 37, 41-42 (1st Cir.2000) (collecting cases). Often the record is not sufficiently developed to allow adequate consideration of the issue on appeal, and district courts are in a better position to adduce the relevant evidence. <i>See United States v. Natanel,</i> 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.1991) (\"A principal purpose for the rule is the need to marshal and evaluate evidentiary facts required to place the adequacy of a defendant's representation into proper perspective.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second option is available \"where the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of an ineffective assistance claim.\" <i>Id.</i> In those comparatively rare situations, \"an appellate court may dispense with the usual praxis and determine the merits of such a contention on direct appeal.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v.

In ways that we will explain, the record here is not developed enough to decide the ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the merits, yet it does contain sufficient indicia of ineffectiveness in the plea agreements, the PSR, and the transcripts of the change of plea and sentencing hearings to warrant remanding for an evidentiary hearing on the issue without requiring defendant to bring a collateral attack instead. <i>See Unites States v. Theodore,</i> 354 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2003) (finding \"indicia of ineffectiveness\" and remanding to the district court so that it could \"determine in the first instance whether defense counsel's total performance was such that a new trial is warranted\"); <i>see also United States v.

There is no per se rule that an attorney's failure to investigate independently his client's criminal history before advising him to accept a plea offer is ineffective assistance.

As we have noted, Pe&#241;a disagreed with the account Col&#243;n gave the district court. He first told the court that \"[t]he only information [Col&#243;n] gave me regarding the prior convictions of him was a charge for robbery and that was all the information I had from him regarding his prior convictions.\" Then, once Col&#243;n pointed out that Pe&#241;a had the document detailing his criminal history with him in court, Pe&#241;a admitted that \"we do have the document that was handed by him but this document was not handed previously to the change of plea hearing. This was handed afterwards.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is somewhat curious that Pe&#241;a says that he received the document after the change of plea hearing, which was held May 2. The district court commented that Pe&#241;a was surprised about Col&#243;n's career offender status, as revealed in the PSR, at the November 9 hearing. Presumably, if Pe&#241;a had received the document <i>before</i> receipt of the PSR (transmitted to Pe&#241;a on October 2, according to the district court docket), he would not have been surprised at the November 9 hearing and would not have waited to renegotiate the plea agreement until after receipt of the PSR. On the other hand, if Pe&#241;a had received the document from Col&#243;n <i>after</i> he received the PSR, it seems likely that he would have said that Col&#243;n gave him the criminal history document after Pe&#241;a received the PSR, not after the change of plea hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court will have to engage in fact finding on what information Col&#243;n gave Pe&#241;a about his criminal history and when he gave it to him. If Col&#243;n misinformed Pe&#241;a about Col&#243;n's prior convictions when Pe&#241;a recommended that Col&#243;n enter into the original plea agreement, that fact would have to be weighed carefully in deciding whether Pe&#241;a still should have conducted some independent investigation of Col&#243;n's criminal history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> On the other hand, if Col&#243;n provided Pe&#241;a with a document accurately detailing his past convictions prior to the recommendation of Pe&#241;a that he accept a plea agreement that would not withstand scrutiny because of those past convictions, Pe&#241;a's recommendation would seem to be clear evidence of ineffectiveness of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Explaining the PSR or Plea Agreements</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n also alleges that Pe&#241;a did not adequately explain the PSR or the plea agreements. Col&#243;n signed both the plea agreement and the amended plea agreement on the day that they were each presented in court. In the peculiar circumstances of this case, these last-minute signings suggest that Col&#243;n might have lacked sufficient time to consider the pleas, their ramifications, and any relevant advice Pe&#241;a offered. Additionally, the appellate record suggests that when Pe&#241;a received the PSR, he did not discuss the PSR with Col&#243;n prior to renegotiating a plea on his behalf with the government. In fact, the material before us suggests that Col&#243;n may have seen the PSR and the amended plea agreement for the first time the morning of his sentencing hearing. Moreover, if Pe&#241;a ever discussed with Col&#243;n the possibility of withdrawing the plea in light of the career offender disclosure of the PSR, there is no hint of such discussion in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These suggestions of haste and limited communication with Col&#243;n add significance to Pe&#241;a's failures to correct errors in the PSR (misstating the BOL, statutory maximum sentence, and Guidelines sentencing calculation) and in the amended plea agreement (misstating the criminal history category and substituting a \"<i>base</i> offense level\" for a \"<i>total</i> offense level\"). Unnoticed or unaddressed by Pe&#241;a, these errors reflect the kind of inattentiveness to detail by Pe&#241;a described by Col&#243;n in his pro se motion for change of counsel. The last-minute signings of the plea agreements, coupled with the uncorrected errors in the documents, may be further indicia of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>Pe&#241;a's Admission of Inadequacy at Sentencing</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing, Pe&#241;a said that \"[w]e did not discharge our responsibility adequately although our position, Your Honor, is that we were from the very beginning trying to help our client, defendant, in terms of the negotiations with the government.\" This revealing comment was made after Col&#243;n insisted that Pe&#241;a show the document detailing Col&#243;n's criminal history to the court. Although Pe&#241;a may not have intended this statement as an admission of ineffective assistance of counsel, it is an unusual concession for counsel to make, and it is one more indication of possible ineffectiveness that justifies the remand for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. <i>Conflict of Interest</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Few commitments from an attorney to a client are more important than \"a duty of loyalty, a duty to avoid conflicts of interest.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. On remand, the court must explore whether Pe&#241;a's interests became adverse to Col&#243;n's during the sentencing hearing. There are worrisome indications of such a conflict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that \"in order to show an actual conflict of interest, a defendant must show that (1) the lawyer could have pursued a plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic and (2) the alternative strategy or tactic was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney's other interests or loyalties.\" <i>United States v. Soldevila-Lopez,</i> 17 F.3d 480, 486 (1st Cir.1994). Here, the relevant defense strategy was a possible motion for the withdrawal of Col&#243;n's plea. Pe&#241;a might well have argued at the sentencing hearing that Col&#243;n should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because Col&#243;n was unaware of the consequences of his plea, given the impact of his criminal history category under the Sentencing Guidelines and the impossibility of the sixty month sentence agreed to by the parties. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2) (allowing plea withdrawals prior to sentencing when \"the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> There is no indication in the record that Pe&#241;a advised Col&#243;n at any time after receipt of the PSR of the possibility that he might file with the court a motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conflict of interest might explain this silence. Such a withdrawal motion would likely implicate Pe&#241;a's lack of awareness of Col&#243;n's criminal history, or his failure to appreciate its significance, in recommending the original plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Moreover, unaware of the possibility of a career offender sentence for Col&#243;n, the court itself arguably might have misled Col&#243;n at the change of plea hearing when it suggested to him that if his criminal history category was higher than a II, the Guidelines range he faced was only sixty to seventy-one months (corresponding to a criminal history category of III, when the statutory minimum of sixty months is taken into account). Together, Pe&#241;a's pre-plea performance and the district court's explanation of the sentence might have provided \"a fair and just reason\" for withdrawal of the guilty plea. But Pe&#241;a, perhaps absorbed in defending his own performance before the judge and inattentive to important details of the plea proceedings, apparently overlooked or chose to ignore the option of a motion to withdraw Col&#243;n's plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would not be a small oversight. During the sentencing hearing, it would appear to Col&#243;n that he had only two options. He could disavow the amended plea agreement and be sentenced as a career offender under the original plea agreement's higher drug quantity calculation. Under that scenario, Col&#243;n would be exposed to a Sentencing Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. Alternatively, he could continue under the terms of the amended plea agreement and be sentenced as a career offender under the amended plea agreement's reduced drug quantity calculation. Under that scenario, Col&#243;n would be exposed to a Sentencing Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months. Not surprisingly, he chose the latter course. If he was unaware that there was a third option &#8212; the possibility of withdrawing his plea entirely &#8212; his choice to go forward with the amended plea agreement was not an informed one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the silence of this record on Col&#243;n's awareness of the plea withdrawal possibility at this critical juncture of the proceedings may reflect only the inadequacy of the record. Perhaps Pe&#241;a discussed that possibility with Col&#243;n and he rejected it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> An evidentiary hearing on remand can explore that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, we are not suggesting that Pe&#241;a should not have been allowed to defend himself at the sentencing hearing against a charge by his client that he claimed was inaccurate. We only observe that the court's inquiry into Pe&#241;a's and his client's conflicting versions of Pe&#241;a's performance arguably put their interests at odds, at least at that juncture, leaving Pe&#241;a to defend himself against his client's accusations and possibly leaving Col&#243;n without conflict-free representation at a crucial point in the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have faced the implications of this kind of credibility contest between counsel and client at a critical stage of the criminal proceedings. In <i>Lopez v. Scully,</i> 58 F.3d 38 (2d Cir.1995), the Second Circuit addressed petitioner's contention \"that he was denied effective assistance of counsel since his attorney labored under an actual conflict of interest during the sentencing proceeding\" because of the charges of incompetence petitioner brought forth against his attorney during the sentencing hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 41. Specifically, the petitioner filed a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea at the beginning of the sentencing hearing, claiming that his attorney had coerced him into pleading guilty. The <i>Lopez</i> court observed that \"to argue in favor of his client's [position] would require admitting to serious ethical violations and possibly subject him to liability for malpractice; on the other hand, any contention by counsel that defendant's allegations were not true would contradict his client.\" <i>Id.</i> at 41 (finding a conflict of interest between an attorney and his client when the client alleged that the attorney coerced him into pleading guilty) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, as in <i>Lopez,</i> \"the attorney [arguably] put his own interests ahead of his client's by denying the truth of [his client's] allegations and thereby attacking his own client's credibility.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, when defense counsel denied his client's accusations of wrongdoing at a plea-withdrawal hearing, the Seventh Circuit held that \"[a]ny contention by counsel that defendant's allegations were not true would (and did) contradict his client. In testifying against his client, counsel acted as both counselor and witness for the prosecution. These roles are inherently inconsistent.\" <i>United States v. Ellison,</i> 798 F.2d 1102, 1107 (7th Cir.1986). In combination with the other factors cited, there are sufficient indicia of such a conflict of interest here to justify remanding this case for a full evidentiary hearing on Col&#243;n's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Prejudice</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we observed earlier, <i>Strickland</i> requires both deficient attorney performance and resulting prejudice. 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Here, the potential prejudice to Col&#243;n is easy to identify: the lost opportunity to attempt to withdraw the guilty plea &#8212; or perhaps reject the original plea agreement &#8212; and exercise his constitutional right to a trial. Col&#243;n is now adamant that he wants to have that trial option. In his briefs to this court, Col&#243;n clearly expresses his desire to withdraw his plea and go to trial, claiming that he \"was never given the option to choose between a long sentence or going to trial, and, if he had been offered it, he would have rejected it due to the little evidence against him.... He was never given such option nor did he know he had it. He knows now and he does request so now.\" Of course, these claims will be tested on remand in accordance with <i>Hill</i>'s requirement that defendant show \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\" <i>Hill,</i> 474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to blunt this prejudice argument, the government asserts that the trial court \"cured\" any problems with Pe&#241;a's performance with its careful explanation of the consequences of Col&#243;n's plea at the change of plea and sentencing hearings. We have already noted one problem with the court's explanation of the plea consequences at the change of plea hearing because of its unawareness that Col&#243;n might be sentenced as a career offender. But the more basic issue is that the court's questions and explanations to Col&#243;n at the sentencing hearing (which were generally on the mark) never addressed the withdrawal of plea issue. We do not fault the court for this omission. Indeed, the court established at the sentencing hearing that Pe&#241;a renegotiated the plea agreement with the government when he read in the PSR that his client was a career offender. In light of this description by Pe&#241;a of his renegotiation effort, the court might well have inferred that Pe&#241;a was carrying out his client's wishes. It would certainly be unusual for counsel to conduct such renegotiations without first discussing with the client the range of options available, including the possibility of filing a motion to withdraw the plea. Yet the record raises the real possibility that such a discussion never took place. On the option of possibly moving to withdraw the plea, the trial court's questions and explanations about the consequences of a plea agreement are not a substitute for adequate legal advice by a competent attorney. The colloquies with the court did not cure the possible prejudice identified here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factors we have identified &#8212; Pe&#241;a's handling of Col&#243;n's criminal history, his failure to correct errors in the PSR and the amended plea agreement, the plausible suggestion that he did not adequately explain the PSR or the plea agreements to Col&#243;n, the comment that \"[w]e did not discharge our responsibility adequately,\" and the potential conflict of interest &#8212; provide serious indicia of ineffective performance that may have induced Col&#243;n to enter an improvident plea and then deprived him of the opportunity to attempt to withdraw that plea and exercise his right to go to trial. Under these circumstances, we choose, in the exercise of our discretion, to remand this case to the district court for a full hearing on Col&#243;n's Sixth Amendment claim. If Col&#243;n establishes that claim, his sentence should be vacated and he should be afforded an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> That said, nothing contained herein should be construed as expressing any opinion on the appropriate outcome of this case on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) provides that \"[e]xcept as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally... to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance....\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 states that \"[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Jencks Act provides,<i>inter alia,</i> that \"[a]fter a witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination, the court shall, on motion of the defendant, order the United States to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500(b).

In pursuing this Sixth Amendment claim, Col&#243;n alleges several deficiencies in the performance of his attorney, Joaqu&#237;n Pe&#241;a R&#237;os (\"Pe&#241;a\"), including claims that Pe&#241;a failed to investigate Col&#243;n's criminal history prior to recommending a plea agreement (Col&#243;n was sentenced as a career offender), and that Pe&#241;a became ensnared in an actual conflict of interest during Col&#243;n's sentencing hearing, effectively depriving Col&#243;n of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we rarely entertain ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal, instead relying on collateral proceedings for such challenges, this case fits within an exception to the rule. Here, the indicia of ineffectiveness are sufficiently developed in the record to warrant, in the exercise of our discretion, direct appellate review. After a careful analysis of the record and the case law, we remand for an evidentiary hearing on whether the judgment should be vacated and Col&#243;n should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea due to the ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the background facts of the underlying criminal activity are not at issue in this case, we do not repeat the details here. For our purposes, it suffices to say that defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute, <i>inter alia,</i> five kilograms or more of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The facts and circumstances surrounding defendant's relationship with his attorney are both more relevant and complicated. We turn now to those details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Col&#243;n's Pro Se Motion for New Counsel</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Col&#243;n was indicted and arrested in November 2001, the court appointed Pe&#241;a as defendant's counsel on the day of defendant's arraignment. Following two status conferences held on December 19, 2001, and February 1, 2002, Col&#243;n filed a pro se motion requesting the appointment of a new attorney. The district court received the motion on April 2. In his pro se motion, which Col&#243;n filed in Spanish and which is now reproduced in English for the appellate record, Col&#243;n contended that \"the client-attorney relationship has deteriorated due to the attitude by counselor Pe&#241;a of insisting in his persuasive way to try to push me into a decision without having counseled me in a competent and effective manner so that [the defendant] would make a correct decision before the Court.\" Defendant's pro se motion specifically alleged that his attorney had provided him with no documents related to his case, including the indictment, discovery materials, or any statements of governmental witnesses producible under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Additionally, the defendant alleged that while he was talking to his attorney on March 25, 2002, they \"were approached by another one of [Pe&#241;a's] clients ... [who] started yelling to Pe&#241;a saying he was an incompetent and anti-ethical attorney, that he never handed him any document regarding his criminal case and that he cheated him by stating that he was ready to see his case.\" Then, according to defendant's translated pro se motion, \"Pe&#241;a reacted in an anti-professional and anti-ethical manner and the argument between him and his [other] client descended to levels which cannot be quoted at this time.\" The district court did not respond to defendant's pro se motion for new counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Plea Agreement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 24, 2002, Pe&#241;a filed a motion for change of plea on behalf of Col&#243;n, and the district court set the change of plea hearing for May 2. On that date, the defendant pled guilty to count one of the indictment after signing the plea agreement that same day. The plea agreement indicated that the penalty for the offense charged \"is a term of imprisonment which shall not be less than ten (10) years and not more than Life\" in addition to certain fines and a period of supervised release, in accordance with 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) (detailing the minimum and maximum sentences for, <i>inter alia,</i> crimes involving five or more kilograms of cocaine). The plea agreement also stated that \"the Court shall impose a sentence in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines... without regard to any statutory minimum sentence [a reference to the so-called \"safety valve\" provision], if the court finds that the defendant meets the criteria contained in [18 U.S.C.] &#167; 3553(f)(1)-(5) [which are reflected in] Guidelines &#167; 5C1.2.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Sentencing Guidelines set forth the criteria referred to in the plea agreement. The first criterion is that \"the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines [in U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1].\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2(a)(1). Sentencing Guidelines &#167; 4A1.1 sets forth the number of criminal history points assigned to a defendant based on his prior sentences of imprisonment. In the plea agreement, the parties assumed a criminal history category of II, which corresponds to a defendant having two or three criminal history points as described in U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1. This assumption &#8212; that Col&#243;n has two or three criminal history points &#8212; would preclude the application of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which requires, <i>inter alia,</i> that a defendant have no more than one criminal history point. Accordingly, under the criminal history category assumption in the plea agreement, Col&#243;n was not eligible for sentencing without regard to the statutory minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines calculations in the plea agreement provide that based on a drug quantity amount of at least five hundred grams but less than two kilograms of cocaine, Col&#243;n's base offense level (\"BOL\") was 26 pursuant to the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(7). The plea agreement also stipulates that \"[s]hould defendant clearly demonstrate acceptance of responsibility for the offense, defendant's base offense level shall be reduced by three levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(b).\" These agreements resulted in a BOL of 23, and, given the assumption of a criminal history category of two, a Sentencing Guidelines range of fifty-one to sixty-three months of imprisonment. The government and the defendant agreed to a recommended sentence of sixty months of imprisonment. Because Col&#243;n pled guilty to a drug quantity of five hundred grams to two kilograms (as opposed to the more than five kilogram quantity for which he was indicted), his statutory minimum sentence dropped from ten years to five years. <i>Compare</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) (providing that in cases involving five kilograms or more of cocaine, the defendant shall be imprisoned for not less than ten years and not more than life), <i>with id.</i> &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) (providing that in cases involving five hundred grams or more &#8212; and, implicitly, less than five kilograms &#8212; of cocaine, the defendant shall be imprisoned for not less than five years and not more than forty years).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Change of Plea Hearing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the change of plea hearing on May 2, the district court orally went through the plea agreement with Col&#243;n. The court said that \"if we assume a criminal history category of one, then the guideline range would be 46 to 57 months. But if we assume a criminal history category of two, which apparently is what you and your attorney and the attorney for the government think that is the correct criminal history category, then the guideline range would be 51 to 63 months. Do you understand that up to now?\" Col&#243;n replied that he did. The district court continued: \"But since there is a statutory mandatory minimum of 60 months, then the guideline range would be 60 to 63 months and then the government and you would recommend to the court that I sentence you to the bottom end of the guideline range which is 60 months.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Again, upon questioning, Col&#243;n indicated that he understood the court's explanation that because the statute imposed a minimum sentence of five years for the drug quantity to which Col&#243;n pled guilty, the Guidelines sentencing range was effectively sixty to sixty-three months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court stated: \"Now, are you aware of the fact that there is no stipulation as to the criminal history category but, as I mentioned before, it is assumed that your criminal history category is two.... And if it's higher than two, then the guideline range would be 60 to 71 months instead of 60 to 63 months.\" Since the plea agreement did not suggest that a career offender designation was a possibility, the court did not refer to the possibility of Col&#243;n being sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. Instead, the district court conveyed the impression that the likely maximum sentence Col&#243;n faced was seventy-one months, corresponding to a criminal history category of III, which is one category higher than the category assumed in the plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Pe&#241;a said nothing to dispel this impression. Upon questioning, Col&#243;n continued to state that he understood the court's explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>The Presentence Report</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report (\"PSR\"), prepared on September 3, 2002, stated that Col&#243;n had three prior convictions under Commonwealth laws, and that his criminal history points totaled eight under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1. Ordinarily, eight criminal history points would have earned Col&#243;n a criminal history category of IV. However, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1 provides that a defendant will be treated as a career offender if he was at least eighteen years old when he committed the instant crime of violence or a controlled substance offense and has two prior convictions for either type of offense. The PSR then correctly identified Col&#243;n as a career offender, based on his prior convictions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n's career offender status affected the applicable sentence in two ways under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. First, all career offenders are assigned to criminal history category VI, the highest category in the Guidelines. Second, a career offender's BOL is the greater of either the BOL otherwise calculated under the Guidelines or the BOL listed in a table in U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. This table sets the BOL according to the statutory maximum sentence for the underlying offense. Because the statutory maximum for the drug quantity to which Col&#243;n pled guilty (five hundred grams to two kilograms) was forty years under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), his BOL as a career offender under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1 should have been 34, which corresponds to a statutory maximum sentence of twenty-five years or more, but less than life imprisonment. The PSR incorrectly stated that \"[b]ased on the statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, the base offense level should be increased to 32\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1, which corresponds to a statutory maximum sentence of between twenty and twenty-five years. The PSR committed this mistake despite correctly stating later that \"[p]ursuant to the stipulation [in the plea agreement], the statutory maximum term of imprisonment is forty (40) years and the minimum is five (5) years per 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR carries the BOL error into its description of the sentencing options under the Guidelines provisions. There, the PSR assigns a total offense level (\"TOL\") of 29, which reflects a three-level acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment from the erroneous BOL of 32. A TOL of 29, coupled with a criminal history category of VI, results in a Guidelines sentencing range of 151 to 188 months, which is the recommendation of the PSR. In fact, the TOL should have been 31, which would reflect a three-level acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment from the correct BOL of 34. A TOL of 31, coupled with a criminal history category of VI, would have resulted in a Guidelines sentencing range of 188 to 235 months. In short, the PSR was internally inconsistent on the statutory maximum sentence and incorrectly calculated the sentence that ought to be imposed on Col&#243;n under the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, it appears that the United States probation officer who prepared the PSR encountered some difficulty in reaching Pe&#241;a to inform him that the PSR was available. The probation officer certified an addendum to the document noting these difficulties:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for the Government was duly notified on September 24, 2002, and several attempts were made to notify Counsel for the defendant, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3552(d) that the presentence investigation report was ready for their inspection. However, as they have not been able to review the report, objections, if any, have not been submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the district court docket, the presentence report was transmitted to Pe&#241;a on October 2, five days before the sentencing scheduled on October 7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">E. <i>The Amended Plea Agreement</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the information in the PSR about Col&#243;n's career offender status, Pe&#241;a renegotiated the terms of Col&#243;n's plea with the government. The negotiations produced an amended plea agreement, which stipulated a drug quantity amount of four hundred to five hundred grams of cocaine, a smaller figure than the amount indicated in the original plea agreement (at least five hundred grams but less than two kilograms). As set forth in the amended plea agreement, this drug quantity resulted in a BOL of 24 under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(8). The parties further agreed that Col&#243;n would receive the three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for a TOL of 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the amended plea agreement erroneously stated that \"[a]ssuming a Criminal History of VII, the sentence would be between fifty-seven (57) to seventy-one (71) months.\" The criminal history categories in the Guidelines do not exceed VI, and the sentencing range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months actually corresponds to a criminal history category of IV, which, leaving aside Col&#243;n's career offender status, would have been Col&#243;n's correct criminal history category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the amended plea agreement went on to explain that \"the parties are aware based on the Pre-Sentence Report that the defendant is a Career Offender....\" The amended plea agreement states that Col&#243;n's career offender status would result in a BOL of 29, a criminal history category of VI, and a Guidelines sentencing range of 151 to 188 months. While this criminal history category and Guidelines sentencing range are ultimately correct, Col&#243;n's <i>total</i> offense level, and not his <i>base</i> offense level, would be 29 once the three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was incorporated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The government then agreed to recommend a sentence at the lowest end of the Guidelines range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">F. <i>The Sentencing Hearing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of November 14, 2002, the district court called Col&#243;n's sentencing hearing and received the amended plea agreement, which Col&#243;n again had signed the day of the hearing. At the sentencing hearing, the district court asked Col&#243;n a series of questions about the PSR. Col&#243;n responded that his attorney had informed him of the PSR \"[a] little bit\" and that Pe&#241;a \"just told me that the [PSR] was recommending that my sentence be increased because I'm a career criminal.\" After several exchanges, the court asked whether Col&#243;n needed more time to go over the PSR with Pe&#241;a, and Col&#243;n said that he did not. The court also asked whether Col&#243;n wished the court to correct any information in that report. The following exchange occurred:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n: Well, what I don't understand is that when I plead guilty here the first time and that was because of advise [sic] that I had received that I should plead guilty to a lesser offense [and] what surprises me that now my criminal record is being used &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court: Why does that surprise you? You know the criminal record you had before you plead guilty, did you not?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n: Well, it surprises me because my attorney came to talk to me about what was to my best advantage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court: Of course, did you tell your attorney that you had three prior convictions?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n: I gave him documents that so stated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, the court inquired of Pe&#241;a whether he had seen those documents. Pe&#241;a replied: \"No, Your Honor.... The only information he gave me regarding the prior convictions of him was a charge for robbery and that was all the information I had from him regarding his prior convictions. So that's not true at all.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hearing this account from Pe&#241;a, the court recalled that five days earlier, on November 9, when Col&#243;n's sentencing had been scheduled and then postponed, Pe&#241;a and the Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) approached the bench and \"at that time [Pe&#241;a] informed the court that you were surprised because the criminal history category [as set forth in the PSR] had come out much higher than what you were aware of.\" When Pe&#241;a confirmed that the court's recollection was correct, the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, taking that into consideration it would seem to me that you were never informed by your client of the extent of his criminal record, otherwise you would have been aware that his criminal history category would be higher and, therefore, that would have been considered by you in talking to the government for a possible plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pe&#241;a confirmed the accuracy of the court's statement. The court then went on to conclude:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, I believe that counsel's statement to the court is the truth in view of counsel's reaction when he came here for your sentence originally November 9th and he was surprised that your criminal history category was higher because of the prior convictions that you had which he had not learned about from you. So, it would seem to me that the statements you are making to the court are not accurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Col&#243;n replied that \"[t]he only thing I want to tell you, Your Honor, is that I have nothing against counsel.\" After the court said \"[o]h, I know that,\" Col&#243;n continued: So you can see that I am not lying to you, he has the document there and if he could please show it to you. It's a document that states the cases that I had before and that I had given that document to him way at the beginning. That is simply so you could see that I wasn't lying, that I am being honest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the court again turned to Pe&#241;a for a response, counsel admitted that \"we do have the document that was handed by him but this document was not handed previously to the change of plea hearing. This was handed afterwards. We were not at the moment of the change of plea aware of the fact that he had those previous convictions, Your Honor.\" The court then observed that \"[i]n any event, once you learned of that fact, I believe you went back to the [AUSA] and tried to renegotiate the plea?\" Pe&#241;a confirmed that he had in fact done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then confirmed that Col&#243;n had signed the amended plea agreement and began discussing the agreement's terms, noting that the reduction in drug quantity reduced Col&#243;n's TOL and thus his Guidelines sentencing range from 188-235 months down to 151-188 months. After confirming that Col&#243;n was aware of both that reduction and that the government recommended a 151-month sentence, the court asked Pe&#241;a if there was anything he would like to state for the record on behalf of Col&#243;n. Pe&#241;a offered that \"the sentence that defendant is facing right now due to his category as a career offender ... is much harsher than it should be if we do consider the instant offense by itself. . . .\" Pe&#241;a then acknowledged that the court had limited discretion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines and reiterated that the proposed sentence is a \"very harsh sentence for our client....\" Counsel went on to say that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[o]ther than that, Your Honor, this is the first time that we ever face a situation like this. The representation that defendant had done to the court is in terms of that. We did not discharge our responsibility adequately although our position, Your Honor, is that we were from the very beginning trying to help our client, defendant, in terms of the negotiations with the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following brief statements by Col&#243;n and the AUSA, the court sentenced Col&#243;n to 151 months of imprisonment, a six-year term of supervised release with certain conditions, and a special monetary assessment of $100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Col&#243;n now argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.

According to Col&#243;n, as recounted to the district court, he gave Pe&#241;a a document that detailed Col&#243;n's full criminal history \"way at the beginning\" of their relationship. As we have noted, Pe&#241;a disagreed with the account Col&#243;n gave the district court. He first told the court that \"[t]he only information [Col&#243;n] gave me regarding the prior convictions of him was a charge for robbery and that was all the information I had from him regarding his prior convictions.\" Then, once Col&#243;n pointed out that Pe&#241;a had the document detailing his criminal history with him in court, Pe&#241;a admitted that \"we do have the document that was handed by him but this document was not handed previously to the change of plea hearing.

The district court commented that Pe&#241;a was surprised about Col&#243;n's career offender status, as revealed in the PSR, at the November 9 hearing. Presumably, if Pe&#241;a had received the document <i>before</i> receipt of the PSR (transmitted to Pe&#241;a on October 2, according to the district court docket), he would not have been surprised at the November 9 hearing and would not have waited to renegotiate the plea agreement until after receipt of the PSR. On the other hand, if Pe&#241;a had received the document from Col&#243;n <i>after</i> he received the PSR, it seems likely that he would have said that Col&#243;n gave him the criminal history document after Pe&#241;a received the PSR, not after the change of plea hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court will have to engage in fact finding on what information Col&#243;n gave Pe&#241;a about his criminal history and when he gave it to him.

Col&#243;n signed both the plea agreement and the amended plea agreement on the day that they were each presented in court. In the peculiar circumstances of this case, these last-minute signings suggest that Col&#243;n might have lacked sufficient time to consider the pleas, their ramifications, and any relevant advice Pe&#241;a offered. Additionally, the appellate record suggests that when Pe&#241;a received the PSR, he did not discuss the PSR with Col&#243;n prior to renegotiating a plea on his behalf with the government. In fact, the material before us suggests that Col&#243;n may have seen the PSR and the amended plea agreement for the first time the morning of his sentencing hearing. Moreover, if Pe&#241;a ever discussed with Col&#243;n the possibility of withdrawing the plea in light of the career offender disclosure of the PSR, there is no hint of such discussion in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These suggestions of haste and limited communication with Col&#243;n add significance to Pe&#241;a's failures to correct errors in the PSR (misstating the BOL, statutory maximum sentence, and Guidelines sentencing calculation) and in the amended plea agreement (misstating the criminal history category and substituting a \"<i>base</i> offense level\" for a \"<i>total</i> offense level\"). Unnoticed or unaddressed by Pe&#241;a, these errors reflect the kind of inattentiveness to detail by Pe&#241;a described by Col&#243;n in his pro se motion for change of counsel. The last-minute signings of the plea agreements, coupled with the uncorrected errors in the documents, may be further indicia of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. <i>Pe&#241;a's Admission of Inadequacy at Sentencing</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing, Pe&#241;a said that \"[w]e did not discharge our responsibility adequately although our position, Your Honor, is that we were from the very beginning trying to help our client, defendant, in terms of the negotiations with the government.\" This revealing comment was made after Col&#243;n insisted that Pe&#241;a show the document detailing Col&#243;n's criminal history to the court.

Here, the relevant defense strategy was a possible motion for the withdrawal of Col&#243;n's plea. Pe&#241;a might well have argued at the sentencing hearing that Col&#243;n should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because Col&#243;n was unaware of the consequences of his plea, given the impact of his criminal history category under the Sentencing Guidelines and the impossibility of the sixty month sentence agreed to by the parties. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2) (allowing plea withdrawals prior to sentencing when \"the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> There is no indication in the record that Pe&#241;a advised Col&#243;n at any time after receipt of the PSR of the possibility that he might file with the court a motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conflict of interest might explain this silence. Such a withdrawal motion would likely implicate Pe&#241;a's lack of awareness of Col&#243;n's criminal history, or his failure to appreciate its significance, in recommending the original plea agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Moreover, unaware of the possibility of a career offender sentence for Col&#243;n, the court itself arguably might have misled Col&#243;n at the change of plea hearing when it suggested to him that if his criminal history category was higher than a II, the Guidelines range he faced was only sixty to seventy-one months (corresponding to a criminal history category of III, when the statutory minimum of sixty months is taken into account). Together, Pe&#241;a's pre-plea performance and the district court's explanation of the sentence might have provided \"a fair and just reason\" for withdrawal of the guilty plea. But Pe&#241;a, perhaps absorbed in defending his own performance before the judge and inattentive to important details of the plea proceedings, apparently overlooked or chose to ignore the option of a motion to withdraw Col&#243;n's plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would not be a small oversight. During the sentencing hearing, it would appear to Col&#243;n that he had only two options. He could disavow the amended plea agreement and be sentenced as a career offender under the original plea agreement's higher drug quantity calculation. Under that scenario, Col&#243;n would be exposed to a Sentencing Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. Alternatively, he could continue under the terms of the amended plea agreement and be sentenced as a career offender under the amended plea agreement's reduced drug quantity calculation. Under that scenario, Col&#243;n would be exposed to a Sentencing Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months. Not surprisingly, he chose the latter course. If he was unaware that there was a third option &#8212; the possibility of withdrawing his plea entirely &#8212; his choice to go forward with the amended plea agreement was not an informed one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the silence of this record on Col&#243;n's awareness of the plea withdrawal possibility at this critical juncture of the proceedings may reflect only the inadequacy of the record. Perhaps Pe&#241;a discussed that possibility with Col&#243;n and he rejected it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> An evidentiary hearing on remand can explore that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, we are not suggesting that Pe&#241;a should not have been allowed to defend himself at the sentencing hearing against a charge by his client that he claimed was inaccurate. We only observe that the court's inquiry into Pe&#241;a's and his client's conflicting versions of Pe&#241;a's performance arguably put their interests at odds, at least at that juncture, leaving Pe&#241;a to defend himself against his client's accusations and possibly leaving Col&#243;n without conflict-free representation at a crucial point in the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have faced the implications of this kind of credibility contest between counsel and client at a critical stage of the criminal proceedings.

Scully,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698360\"><a href=\"/opinion/698360/antonio-lopez-v-charles-scully-superintendent-green-haven-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1995), the Second Circuit addressed petitioner's contention \"that he was denied effective assistance of counsel since his attorney labored under an actual conflict of interest during the sentencing proceeding\" because of the charges of incompetence petitioner brought forth against his attorney during the sentencing hearing. <i>Id.</i> at 41. Specifically, the petitioner filed a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea at the beginning of the sentencing hearing, claiming that his attorney had coerced him into pleading guilty. The <i>Lopez</i> court observed that \"to argue in favor of his client's [position] would require admitting to serious ethical violations and possibly subject him to liability for malpractice; on the other hand, any contention by counsel that defendant's allegations were not true would contradict his client.\" <i>Id.</i> at 41 (finding a conflict of interest between an attorney and his client when the client alleged that the attorney coerced him into pleading guilty) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, as in <i>Lopez,</i> \"the attorney [arguably] put his own interests ahead of his client's by denying the truth of [his client's] allegations and thereby attacking his own client's credibility.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, when defense counsel denied his client's accusations of wrongdoing at a plea-withdrawal hearing, the Seventh Circuit held that \"[a]ny contention by counsel that defendant's allegations were not true would (and did) contradict his client. In testifying against his client, counsel acted as both counselor and witness for the prosecution. These roles are inherently inconsistent.\" <i>United States v. Ellison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474884\"><a href=\"/opinion/474884/united-states-v-max-allen-ellison/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></a></span>, 1107 (7th Cir.1986). In combination with the other factors cited, there are sufficient indicia of such a conflict of interest here to justify remanding this case for a full evidentiary hearing on Col&#243;n's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Prejudice</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we observed earlier, <i>Strickland</i> requires both deficient attorney performance and resulting prejudice. 466 U.S. at 687, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2052</span></a></span>. Here, the potential prejudice to Col&#243;n is easy to identify: the lost opportunity to attempt to withdraw the guilty plea &#8212; or perhaps reject the original plea agreement &#8212; and exercise his constitutional right to a trial. Col&#243;n is now adamant that he wants to have that trial option. In his briefs to this court, Col&#243;n clearly expresses his desire to withdraw his plea and go to trial, claiming that he \"was never given the option to choose between a long sentence or going to trial, and, if he had been offered it, he would have rejected it due to the little evidence against him.... He was never given such option nor did he know he had it. He knows now and he does request so now.\" Of course, these claims will be tested on remand in accordance with <i>Hill</i>'s requirement that defendant show \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\" <i>Hill,</i> 474 U.S. at 59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an attempt to blunt this prejudice argument, the government asserts that the trial court \"cured\" any problems with Pe&#241;a's performance with its careful explanation of the consequences of Col&#243;n's plea at the change of plea and sentencing hearings. We have already noted one problem with the court's explanation of the plea consequences at the change of plea hearing because of its unawareness that Col&#243;n might be sentenced as a career offender. But the more basic issue is that the court's questions and explanations to Col&#243;n at the sentencing hearing (which were generally on the mark) never addressed the withdrawal of plea issue. We do not fault the court for this omission. Indeed, the court established at the sentencing hearing that Pe&#241;a renegotiated the plea agreement with the government when he read in the PSR that his client was a career offender. In light of this description by Pe&#241;a of his renegotiation effort, the court might well have inferred that Pe&#241;a was carrying out his client's wishes. It would certainly be unusual for counsel to conduct such renegotiations without first discussing with the client the range of options available, including the possibility of filing a motion to withdraw the plea. Yet the record raises the real possibility that such a discussion never took place. On the option of possibly moving to withdraw the plea, the trial court's questions and explanations about the consequences of a plea agreement are not a substitute for adequate legal advice by a competent attorney. The colloquies with the court did not cure the possible prejudice identified here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factors we have identified &#8212; Pe&#241;a's handling of Col&#243;n's criminal history, his failure to correct errors in the PSR and the amended plea agreement, the plausible suggestion that he did not adequately explain the PSR or the plea agreements to Col&#243;n, the comment that \"[w]e did not discharge our responsibility adequately,\" and the potential conflict of interest &#8212; provide serious indicia of ineffective performance that may have induced Col&#243;n to enter an improvident plea and then deprived him of the opportunity to attempt to withdraw that plea and exercise his right to go to trial. Under these circumstances, we choose, in the exercise of our discretion, to remand this case to the district court for a full hearing on Col&#243;n's Sixth Amendment claim. If Col&#243;n establishes that claim, his sentence should be vacated and he should be afforded an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> That said, nothing contained herein should be construed as expressing any opinion on the appropriate outcome of this case on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) provides that \"[e]xcept as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally... to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance....\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846 states that \"[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Jencks Act provides,<i>inter alia,</i> that \"[a]fter a witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination, the court shall, on motion of the defendant, order the United States to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500(b).

Col&#243;n's prior convictions and sentences, all of which took place after his eighteenth birthday, are as follows: (1) possession of an illegal weapon as violations of Article 168 of the Puerto Rico Penal Code and Article 8 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, for which he was sentenced to six months of imprisonment on February 17, 1987; (2) robbery with a weapon in violation of Articles 5, 6, and 8 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, for which he was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment on November 4, 1987; and (3) kidnaping, attempted murder, robbery, and illegal appropriation in violation of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, for which he was sentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment on November 28, 1990</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The sentencing hearing was rescheduled more than once, eventually taking place on November 14</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Col&#243;n's BOL would have been 32 because under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1 this is the BOL corresponding to a statutory maximum sentence of twenty years, the maximum provided by the relevant statute<i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) (providing a maximum sentence of twenty years for violations involving less than five hundred grams of cocaine).

Here, the recommended sentence agreed to by the parties in the original plea agreement (sixty months) was never a possibility in light of Col&#243;n's actual criminal history. Moreover, in the absence of any indication that Col&#243;n would have to be sentenced as a career offender, the sentence described by the judge at the change of plea hearing (a maximum of seventy-one months, based on a criminal history category only one step higher than that assumed in the plea agreement) was far below the sentence Col&#243;n actually faced. Col&#243;n's career offender status exposed him to an additional imprisonment term of between ten and fourteen years under the drug quantity calculation and other stipulations of the original plea agreement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Col&#243;n's appellate attorney plausibly represents that \"obtaining a criminal record under local laws [is] a routine matter\" and can be accomplished easily, presumably in part because all of Col&#243;n's prior convictions are for violations of Commonwealth laws</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> When Col&#243;n pled guilty in November 2002, the relevant standard was then reflected in Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d), which allowed withdrawal prior to sentencing for \"any fair and just reason.\" This provision of Rule 32 was incorporated into current Rule 11 as part of the 2002 amendments designed to generally restyle and reorganize the Criminal Rules</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> As we have described, Col&#243;n claimed that he had provided Pe&#241;a with documents detailing his conviction history at an early stage in the proceedings and that Pe&#241;a failed to properly advise Col&#243;n of the effect his career offender status would have on sentencing if Col&#243;n pled guilty. At the sentencing hearing, the district court asked Pe&#241;a whether Col&#243;n was being truthful in his representations to the court. At that point, Pe&#241;a and Col&#243;n were pitted against each other in a credibility contest, with the court ultimately deciding that Pe&#241;a was truthful and Col&#243;n (potentially unrepresented in that contest) was not</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> In his briefs to this court, Col&#243;n claims that he was not aware that he could have moved to withdraw his guilty plea.
