Gene Carter, U.S. Senior District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n               Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n               and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     F. Mark Terison, Senior Litigation Counsel, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellant.\n     Bruce M.

David Hilton was convicted of a one-count\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B), the Child Pornography\n\nPrevention Act (\"CPPA\"), on June 30, 2000.           In light of the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234\n\n(2002), holding that the government may not criminalize possession\n\nof non-obscene sexually explicit images that appear to, but do not\n\nin fact, depict actual children, Hilton sought and was granted\n\npost-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.                The government\n\nappeals.      Because the habeas court correctly held that the trial\n\ncourt did not find every element of the crime, we affirm the grant\n\nof relief vacating Hilton's conviction.\n\n                            I.    Procedural History\n\n              A.   Indictment, Dismissal and Appeal\n\n              Based on evidence discovered by local law enforcement\n\npursuant to a valid search warrant, a federal grand jury indicted\n\nHilton   on    December     17,   1997,   charging   him   with   a   one-count\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B).1            Hilton moved to dismiss\n\nthe indictment, arguing that the CPPA violated the First Amendment.\n\nSection 2252A(a)(5)(B) criminalizes the knowing possession of child\n\n\n1\n   The statute provides that \"Any person who . . . knowingly\npossesses any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer\ndisk, or any other material that contains an image of child\npornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in\ninterstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer,\nor that was produced using materials that have been mailed, or\nshipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any\nmeans, including by computer . . . shall be punished . . . .\" 18\nU.S.C. 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n\n                                       -2-\n\fpornography that has traveled between states or between countries.\n\nHilton's First Amendment challenge involved the definition of\n\n\"child pornography\" in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). That provision defines\n\nchild pornography to include \"any visual depiction, including any\n\nphotograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated\n\nimage   or    picture,   whether     made   or   produced     by   electronic,\n\nmechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where\n\nsuch visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in\n\nsexually explicit conduct.\"           18 U.S.C. § 2256(8)(B).          Section\n\n2256(8)(B) was added by Congress in 1996 after finding that \"new\n\nphotographic and computer imaging technologies make it possible to\n\nproduce      by   electronic,   mechanical,      or   other   means,    visual\n\ndepictions of what appear to be children engaging in sexually\n\nexplicit     conduct   that   are   virtually    indistinguishable     to   the\n\nunsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images of actual\n\nchildren engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" Child Pornography\n\nPrevention Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, div. A, tit. I, § 121\n\n(1)(5), 110 Stat. 3009-26 (1996) (emphasis added).\n\n             Hilton argued that this new definition violated the First\n\nAmendment by prohibiting some adult pornography -- that appearing\n\nto be of children -- and by virtue of vagueness and overbreadth.\n\nThe district court agreed, holding that the CPPA's \"appears to be\"\n\nprovision was overbroad and left unclear exactly what images were\n\nillegal.     The district court dismissed the indictment on March 26,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f1998.   United States v. Hilton, 999 F. Supp. 131 (D. Me. 1998)\n\n(\"Hilton I\").     The United States appealed, and this court reversed\n\nand reinstated the indictment.       See United States v. Hilton,       167\n\nF.3d 61 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"Hilton II\").\n\n           B.   Trial and Appeal\n\n           After the Supreme Court denied Hilton's petition for\n\ncertiorari, the case advanced to trial. Hilton waived his right to\n\na jury trial.     After the issuance of a superseding indictment on\n\nJanuary 5, 2000, the district court heard the case against Hilton\n\nover the course of three days.       This court reviewed the district\n\ncourt's findings extensively in United States v. Hilton, 257 F.3d\n\n50 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Hilton IV\") (reviewing United States v.\n\nHilton, No. 97-78-P-C, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9220 (D. Me. June 30,\n\n2000) (\"Hilton III\")).       Here we concentrate on the evidence at\n\nissue in this appeal.\n\n           The search of Hilton's computer room on November 7, 1997\n\nproduced a number of pornographic images.        These were found on a\n\nSony Backup Tape, in Hilton's hard drive, and printed up and stored\n\nin a \"gray box.\"    According to Agent Marx of the local police, whom\n\nthe parties stipulated as a computer forensics expert, the Sony\n\nBackup Tape was used to back up Hilton's computer two months before\n\nseizure.    The    Sony   tape   contained   thousands   of   images;   the\n\ngovernment introduced seven of them.         The \"gray box\" contained a\n\nprint-out with four images identical to four in the Sony tape.          The\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhard drive contained three images, and this court on review found\n\ntwo to be non-explicit.    See Hilton IV, 257 F.3d at 58.\n\n           To prove that these images depicted children, rather than\n\nadults, the government introduced the testimony of Dr. Lawrence\n\nRicci.     Dr. Ricci testified as to the Tanner Scale and its\n\napplication to the seized images.      The Tanner Scale was developed\n\nthrough analysis of many children both in the United States and\n\nthroughout the world and provides a basis for estimating a person's\n\nstage of physiological development.     Dr. Ricci marked on the backs\n\nof the images his opinion as to the children's ages.           In his\n\nopinion, apart from an image that morphed a child's face with an\n\nadult woman's body, the other nine images represented children at\n\nvarious stages of development, ranging from pre-school to young\n\nteen.    See Hilton III, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9220 at *23-26.\n\n            Based on this evidence, the district court found beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that the images satisfied the definition of\n\nchild pornography in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8).    The court also found the\n\nrequired element of scienter and an interstate nexus.       Since the\n\ncourt did not find merit in Hilton's affirmative defenses that he\n\nwas possessing the images under authority of the government, it\n\nconvicted Hilton on June 30, 2000, and subsequently sentenced him\n\nto forty months imprisonment.\n\n            Hilton   appealed   his    conviction,   challenging   the\n\nconstitutionality of the CPPA and the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fHe reiterated his affirmative defense that he had collected the\n\nimages at the government's request.            Hilton IV, 257 F.3d 50.\n\nHilton   also    claimed   that    the   district    court   erred    in   his\n\nsentencing.      We rejected all but the sentencing claim.           Since we\n\nconcluded that two of the three hard drive images did not qualify\n\nas child pornography or did not involve the sexual exploitation of\n\na minor, we remanded for resentencing because the record did not\n\nsupport the Sentencing Guidelines upward adjustment applied by the\n\ndistrict court for possession of \"ten or more . . . items,\n\ncontaining a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of\n\na minor.\"    U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(b)(2); see Hilton IV, 257 F.3d at 58.\n\nAs for Hilton's constitutional challenge, we noted that we had\n\n\"rejected this claim on Hilton's earlier appeal.\"            Hilton IV, 257\n\nF.3d at 53.      Hilton asked us to reconsider our prior holding in\n\nlight of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Free Speech Coalition v.\n\nReno, 198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 1999), but we declined to do so.2\n\nId.   Thus, on July 27, 2001, we affirmed Hilton's conviction and\n\nremanded for resentencing.\n\n            On   remand,   the    district   court   sentenced   Hilton     to\n\nthirty-four months of incarceration.\n\n\n\n2\n  We noted that \"the Ninth Circuit struck down only those portions\nof the Act making illegal possession of computer generated images\nof fictitious children.\"      Hilton IV, 257 F.3d at 53.        The\ngovernment argues that this language implies that we found Hilton's\nimages to represent actual children.     Our review here, though,\nconcerns the findings of fact the district court actually made.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f             C.    The CPPA after Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition\n\n             While Hilton's direct appeal was pending, the Supreme\n\nCourt granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's Free Speech\n\nCoalition v. Reno, 198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 1999), a civil suit\n\nchallenging on its face the constitutionality of the CPPA as\n\namended in 1996.        The key challenge, and the one relevant here, was\n\nagainst prosecution for \"child pornography\" that only \"appears to\n\nbe, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\"                    18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2256(8)(B).       In Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234\n\n(2002), the Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit holding that such\n\nprosecutions      violate      the     First   Amendment's    protection    against\n\ngovernmental abridgement of the freedom of speech. Id. at 258; see\n\nU.S. Const. amend. I.\n\n             The First Amendment does not protect obscenity, Miller v.\n\nCalifornia,       413   U.S.     15    (1973),   or    the   possession   of     child\n\npornography produced using children.                  Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S.\n\n103,   110    (1990)      (\"It        rarely   has    been   suggested    that     the\n\nconstitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to\n\nspeech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation\n\nof a valid criminal statute.\") (quoting New York v. Ferber, 458\n\nU.S. 747, 761-62 (1982) (quoting Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice\n\nCo., 336 U.S. 490, 498 (1949))).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f             The CPPA is not circumscribed by the Miller definition of\n\nobscenity.     Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 246.3             Therefore,\n\nsince the \"appears to be\" definition prohibits non-obscene speech,\n\nthe   Free    Speech   Coalition     Court    addressed    the    government's\n\ncontention that the rationale behind Osborne and Ferber extended to\n\nthe criminalization of sexually explicit images that appear to\n\ncontain   children.      Those   two    cases   viewed    the    trade    in   and\n\npossession of child pornography as bearing a proximate link to the\n\nchild abuse that produced the images in the first place.                 See Free\n\nSpeech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 249-50. The government presented two\n\ntypes   of   arguments   to   show     that   the   prohibition    on    virtual\n\n\n\n3\n    Congress has responded with amendments to the CPPA in the\nProsecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of\nChildren Today Act of 2003 (\"PROTECT\") that specify a class of\nobscene child pornography reaching \"Any person who . . . knowingly\nproduces, distributes, receives, or possesses with intent to\ndistribute, a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing,\ncartoon, sculpture, or painting, that:\n\n      (1) (A) depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit\n      conduct; and\n           (B) is obscene; or\n      (2) (A) depicts an image that is, or appears to be, of\n      a minor engaging in graphic bestiality, sadistic or\n      masochistic abuse, or sexual intercourse, including\n      genital-genital,    oral-genital,    anal-genital,    or\n      oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or\n      opposite sex; and\n           (B) lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or\n      scientific value; or attempts or conspires to do so,\n      shall be subject to the penalties provided in section\n      2252A(b)(1), including the penalties provided for cases\n      involving a prior conviction.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1466A(a) (2003).\n\n                                       -8-\n\fpornography was indeed proximate to compelling interests; one\n\nargument was based on the injuries allegedly flowing from \"appears\n\nto be\" child pornography and the second on prosecutorial necessity.\n\n            Two concerns motivated the first argument: (1) that\n\n\"pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children,\"\n\nid. at 251, and (2) that virtual child pornography \"whets the\n\nappetites of pedophiles and encourages them to engage in illegal\n\nconduct.\"    Id. at 253.     Contrary to our earlier conclusion in\n\nHilton II, 167 F.3d at 72-74, the Court held that the availability\n\nof virtual child pornography to child abusers does not provide a\n\nbasis for the prohibition because while \"[t]he objective is to\n\nprohibit illegal conduct . . . this restriction goes well beyond\n\nthat interest by restricting the speech available to law-abiding\n\nadults.\"    Id. at 252-53.   As for the concern that virtual child\n\npornography motivates child abuse, the Court disagreed with the\n\npremise behind the government's argument: \"[t]he mere tendency of\n\nspeech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for\n\nbanning it.\"     Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 253.   Because\n\n\"[t]he Government has shown no more than a remote connection\n\nbetween speech that might encourage thoughts or impulses and any\n\nresulting child abuse,\" it \"may not prohibit speech on the ground\n\nthat it may encourage pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct.\"\n\nId. at 253-54.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            The government's second argument was that eliminating\n\nactual child pornography necessitates the prohibition on virtual\n\npornography because virtual images are indistinguishable from real\n\nones.     Id. at 254-55.      First, the government contended that\n\n\"[v]irtual images . . . are indistinguishable from real ones[, and]\n\nthey are part of the same market and are often exchanged.\"              Id. at\n\n254.    The Court found this \"hypothesis . . . somewhat implausible.\n\nIf virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the\n\nillegal    images   would   be    driven         from   the   market   by    the\n\nindistinguishable    substitutes.          Few    pornographers   would     risk\n\nprosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized\n\nimages would suffice.\"        Id.       To the government's claim that\n\nindistinguishability     meant   that    the     successful   prosecution    of\n\nactual child pornography necessitated criminalization of virtual\n\nchild pornography,       the Court responded: \"[t]he argument, in\n\nessence, is that protected speech may be banned as a means to ban\n\nunprotected speech. This analysis turns the First Amendment upside\n\ndown.\"     Id. at 255.      Thus the Court held that possession of\n\nmaterial that satisfied only § 2256(8)(B) could not be punished.4\n\nId. at 256.\n\n\n4\n    The Court applied the same reasoning to find § 2256(8)(D)\ncontrary to the First Amendment.      That section, defining as\nprohibited child pornography \"such visual depiction [that] is\nadvertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such\na manner that conveys the impression that the material is or\ncontains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually\nexplicit conduct,\" is not at issue in this case.\n\n                                    -10-\n\f            D.   Post-Conviction Relief\n\n            Based on the Court's ruling in Free Speech Coalition,\n\nHilton filed a motion for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255 on November 13, 2002.         The magistrate judge hearing the\n\npetition agreed that Hilton was entitled to relief.          United States\n\nv. Hilton, Crim. No. 97-78-P-C, Civ. No. 02-235-P-C, 2003 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 4208, (D. Me. March 20, 2003) (\"Hilton V\").                    The\n\ndistrict court adopted that recommendation and vacated Hilton's\n\nconviction. United States v. Hilton, Crim. No. 97-78-P-C, Civ. No.\n\n02-235-P-C, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8130, 2003 WL 21135703 (D. Me.\n\nMay   15,   2003).    The   government's   appeal   has   placed     Hilton's\n\npetition before this court.\n\n                              II.   Analysis\n\n            After Free Speech Coalition, the government must prove\n\nthat an image depicts actual children to sustain a § 2252A(a)(5)(B)\n\nconviction.      Both parties agree that the holding of Free Speech\n\nCoalition applies retroactively, as it \"places certain kinds of\n\nprimary,    private   individual    conduct   beyond   the   power    of   the\n\ncriminal law-making authority to proscribe.\"           Teague v. Lane, 489\n\nU.S. 288, 311 (1989) (quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S.\n\n667, 675 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\n\npart)).\n\n            It bears repeating that the government is not released\n\nfrom its burden of proof by a defendant's failure to argue, or by\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fan absence of evidence otherwise suggesting, the artificiality of\n\nthe children portrayed.           That the children in the images are real\n\namounts to an element of the crime which the government must prove,\n\nthe burden of which should not be displaced to the defendant as an\n\naffirmative defense.          Cf. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 256.\n\n\"Protected speech does not become unprotected merely because it\n\nresembles the latter.\"            Id. at 255.     Instead, \"[t]he Constitution\n\ngives     a    criminal    defendant     the    right    to    demand    that      [the\n\nfactfinder] find him guilty of all the elements of the crime with\n\nwhich he is charged.\"            United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 511\n\n(1995).       In the present case, that the children in the images are\n\nreal is an element of the crime; Hilton therefore had a right to\n\nhave the factfinder decide whether the children were real.                      Id.\n\n              The government urges that \"a factual review compellingly\n\ndemonstrates that the images Hilton possessed were indeed of actual\n\nchildren.\"       The question before us, though, does not call for our\n\nevaluation of the evidence but rather of what the trial court\n\nactually found.5          The government advances one argument we must\n\naddress,      namely,     that    in   finding,    according     to     Dr.   Ricci's\n\ntestimony, that the images represented children rather than adults,\n\nthe trial court necessarily concluded as a matter of fact that the\n\nchildren       were   real.        According      to   the    government,     it    is\n\n\n\n5\n  Because the government failed effectively to preserve the issue\nof harmless error review on appeal, we do not address that issue.\n\n                                         -12-\n\f\"commonsense\" that findings as to age based on the Tanner Scale\n\nsatisfy the further element of actuality:\n\n          The \"Tanner Scale\" was developed through an\n          analysis of \"large numbers of children\" both\n          in the United States and throughout the world.\n          Commonsense establishes that the scale was\n          developed through the assessment of actual\n          children.    The reasonable and commonsense\n          inference is also that Dr. Ricci, as an expert\n          pediatrician, would apply the \"Tanner Scale\"\n          only to actual children.\n\nWe find more commonsensical a proposition leading to the contrary\n\ninference that someone manufacturing images to look like children\n\nwill try -- and with sufficient technology will manage -- to\n\nproduce images that would be amenable to expert analysis under the\n\nTanner Scale.   Whatever parameters of body proportion, growth and\n\ndevelopment serve as signs of age under the Tanner Scale, those\n\nparameters will be mimicked by the virtual pornographer -- whether\n\nby design or as a byproduct of the goal of realism.\n\n          We cannot endorse the view that it is commonsense that\n\nthe trial court also found -- or must have found -- that the images\n\nrepresented real children.     Rather, it is plain to us that the\n\ntrial court found Hilton guilty of possessing images that appeared\n\nto be children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.       Under the\n\nerroneous understanding at the time of conviction, possession of\n\nchild pornography could be punished criminally even if the depicted\n\nchildren were artificial and real children were not involved in the\n\nproduction of the images.

The government appeals.

Section 2252A(a)(5)(B) criminalizes the knowing possession of child pornography that has traveled between states or between countries. Hilton's First Amendment challenge involved the definition of \"child pornography\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8). That provision defines child pornography to include \"any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8)(B). Section 2256(8)(B) was added by Congress in 1996 after finding that \"new photographic and computer imaging technologies make it possible to produce by electronic, mechanical, or other means, visual depictions of what <i>appear to be</i> children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, div. A, tit. I, &#167; 121(1)(5), 110 Stat. 3009-26 (1996) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hilton argued that this new definition violated the First Amendment by prohibiting some adult pornography &#8212; that appearing to be of children &#8212; and by virtue of vagueness and overbreadth. The district court agreed, holding that the CPPA's \"appears to be\" provision was overbroad and left unclear exactly what images were illegal. The district court dismissed the indictment on March 26, 1998. <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 999 F.Supp. 131 (D.Me.1998) (\"<i>Hilton I</i>\"). The United States appealed, and this court reversed and reinstated the indictment. <i>See United States v. Hilton,</i> 167 F.3d 61 (1st Cir.1999) (\"<i>Hilton II</i>\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Trial and Appeal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Supreme Court denied Hilton's petition for certiorari, the case advanced to trial. Hilton waived his right to a jury trial. After the issuance of a superseding indictment on January 5, 2000, the district court heard the case against Hilton over the course of three days. This court reviewed the district court's findings extensively in <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 257 F.3d 50 (1st Cir.2001) (\"<i>Hilton IV</i>\") (reviewing <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> 2000 WL 894679, No. 97-78-P-C, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9220 (D. Me. June 30, 2000) (\"<i>Hilton III</i>\")). Here we concentrate on the evidence at issue in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search of Hilton's computer room on November 7, 1997 produced a number of pornographic images. These were found on a Sony Backup Tape, in Hilton's hard drive, and printed up and stored in a \"gray box.\" According to Agent Marx of the local police, whom the parties stipulated as a computer forensics expert, the Sony Backup Tape was used to back up Hilton's computer two months before seizure. The Sony tape contained thousands of images; the government introduced seven of them. The \"gray box\" contained a print-out with four images identical to four in the Sony tape. The hard drive contained three images, and this court on review found two to be non-explicit. <i>See Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove that these images depicted children, rather than adults, the government introduced the testimony of Dr. Lawrence Ricci. Dr. Ricci testified as to the Tanner Scale and its application to the seized images. The Tanner Scale was developed through analysis of many children both in the United States and throughout the world and provides a basis for estimating a person's stage of physiological development. Dr. Ricci marked on the backs of the images his opinion as to the children's ages. In his opinion, apart from an image that morphed a child's face with an adult woman's body, the other nine images represented children at various stages of development, ranging from pre-school to young teen. <i>See Hilton III,</i> 2000 WL 894679, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9220 at *23-26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence, the district court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the images satisfied the definition of child pornography in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8). The court also found the required element of scienter and an interstate nexus. Since the court did not find merit in Hilton's affirmative defenses that he was possessing the images under authority of the government, it convicted Hilton on June 30, 2000, and subsequently sentenced him to forty months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hilton appealed his conviction, challenging the constitutionality of the CPPA and the sufficiency of the evidence. He reiterated his affirmative defense that he had collected the images at the government's request. <i>Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d 50. Hilton also claimed that the district court erred in his sentencing. We rejected all but the sentencing claim. Since we concluded that two of the three hard drive images did not qualify as child pornography or did not involve the sexual exploitation of a minor, we remanded for resentencing because the record did not support the Sentencing Guidelines upward adjustment applied by the district court for possession of \"ten or more... items, containing a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2G2.4(b)(2); <i>see Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 58. As for Hilton's constitutional challenge, we noted that we had \"rejected this claim on Hilton's earlier appeal.\" <i>Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 53. Hilton asked us to reconsider our prior holding in light of the Ninth Circuit's decision in <i>Free Speech Coalition v. Reno,</i> 198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir.1999), but we declined to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Id.</i> Thus, on July 27, 2001, we affirmed Hilton's conviction and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court sentenced Hilton to thirty-four months of incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The CPPA after Ashcroft v.

Reno,</i> 198 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir.1999), a civil suit challenging on its face the constitutionality of the CPPA as amended in 1996. The key challenge, and the one relevant here, was against prosecution for \"child pornography\" that only \"appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8)(B). In <i>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. 234, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002), the Court affirmed the Ninth Circuit holding that such prosecutions violate the First Amendment's protection against governmental abridgement of the freedom of speech. <i>Id.</i> at 258, 122 S.Ct. 1389; <i>see</i> U.S. Const. amend.

Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co.,</i> 336 U.S. 490, 498, 69 S.Ct. 684, 93 L.Ed. 834 (1949))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CPPA is not circumscribed by the <i>Miller</i> definition of obscenity. <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 246, 122 S.Ct. 1389.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Therefore, since the \"appears to be\" definition prohibits non-obscene speech, the <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> Court addressed the government's contention that the rationale behind <i>Osborne</i> and <i>Ferber</i> extended to the criminalization of sexually explicit images that appear to contain children. Those two cases viewed the trade in and possession of child pornography as bearing a proximate link to the child abuse that produced the images in the first place. <i>See Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 249-50, 122 S.Ct. 1389. The government presented two types of arguments to show that the prohibition on virtual pornography was indeed proximate to compelling interests; one argument was based on the injuries allegedly flowing from \"appears to be\" child pornography and the second on prosecutorial necessity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two concerns motivated the first argument: (1) that \"pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children,\" <i>id.</i> at 251, 122 S.Ct. 1389, and (2) that virtual child pornography \"whets the appetites of pedophiles and encourages them to engage in illegal conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 253, 122 S.Ct. 1389. Contrary to our earlier conclusion in <i>Hilton II,</i> 167 F.3d at 72-74, the Court held that the availability of virtual child pornography to child abusers does not provide a basis for the prohibition because while \"[t]he objective is to prohibit illegal conduct ... this restriction goes well beyond that interest by restricting the speech available to law-abiding adults.\" <i>Id.</i> at 252-53, 122 S.Ct. 1389. As for the concern that virtual child pornography motivates child abuse, the Court disagreed with the premise behind the government's argument: \"[t]he mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it.\" <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 253, 122 S.Ct. 1389. Because \"[t]he Government has shown no more than a remote connection between speech that might encourage thoughts or impulses and any resulting child abuse,\" it \"may not prohibit speech on the ground that it may encourage pedophiles to engage in illegal conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 253-54, 122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's second argument was that eliminating actual child pornography necessitates the prohibition on virtual pornography because virtual images are indistinguishable from real ones. <i>Id.</i> at 254-55, 122 S.Ct. 1389. First, the government contended that \"[v]irtual images ... are indistinguishable from real ones[, and] they are part of the same market and are often exchanged.\" <i>Id.</i> at 254, 122 S.Ct. 1389. The Court found this \"hypothesis ... somewhat implausible. If virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from the market by the indistinguishable substitutes. Few pornographers would risk prosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized images would suffice.\" <i>Id.</i> To the government's claim that indistinguishability meant that the successful prosecution of actual child pornography necessitated criminalization of virtual child pornography, the Court responded: \"[t]he argument, in essence, is that protected speech may be banned as a means to ban unprotected speech. This analysis turns the First Amendment upside down.\" <i>Id.</i> at 255, 122 S.Ct. 1389. Thus the Court held that possession of material that satisfied only &#167; 2256(8)(B) could not be punished.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Id.</i> at 256, 122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Post-Conviction Relief</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the Court's ruling in <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> Hilton filed a motion for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 on November 13, 2002. The magistrate judge hearing the petition agreed that Hilton was entitled to relief. <i>United States v. Hilton,</i> Crim. No. 97-78-P-C, Civ. No. 02-235-P-C, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4208, (D.Me.

Both parties agree that the holding of <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> applies retroactively, as it \"places certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe.\" <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (quoting <i>Mackey v.

That the children in the images are real amounts to an element of the crime which the government must prove, the burden of which should not be displaced to the defendant as an affirmative defense. <i>Cf. Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 256, 122 S.Ct. 1389. \"Protected speech does not become unprotected merely because it resembles the latter.\" <i>Id.</i> at 255, 122 S.Ct. 1389. Instead, \"[t]he Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to demand that [the factfinder] find him guilty of all the elements of the crime with which he is charged.\" <i>United States v. Gaudin,</i> 515 U.S. 506, 511, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995). In the present case, that the children in the images are real is an element of the crime; Hilton therefore had a right to have the factfinder decide whether the children were real. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government urges that \"a factual review compellingly demonstrates that the images Hilton possessed were indeed of actual children.\" The question before us, though, does not call for our evaluation of the evidence but rather of what the trial court actually found.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The government advances one argument we must address, namely, that in finding, according to Dr. Ricci's testimony, that the images represented children rather than adults, the trial court necessarily concluded as a matter of fact that the children were real. According to the government, it is \"commonsense\" that findings as to age based on the Tanner Scale satisfy the further element of actuality:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"Tanner Scale\" was developed through an analysis of \"large numbers of children\" both in the United States and throughout the world.

Rather, it is plain to us that the trial court found Hilton guilty of possessing images that appeared to be children engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Under the erroneous understanding at the time of conviction, possession of child pornography could be punished criminally <i>even if</i> the depicted children were artificial and real children were not involved in the production of the images.

Section 2252A(a)(5)(B) criminalizes the knowing possession of child pornography that has traveled between states or between countries. Hilton's First Amendment challenge involved the definition of \"child pornography\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8). That provision defines child pornography to include \"any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8)(B). Section 2256(8)(B) was added by Congress in 1996 after finding that \"new photographic and computer imaging technologies make it possible to produce by electronic, mechanical, or other means, visual depictions of what <i>appear to be</i> children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, div. A, tit.

The district court agreed, holding that the CPPA's \"appears to be\" provision was overbroad and left unclear exactly what images were illegal. The district court dismissed the indictment on March 26, 1998. <i>United States v.

Hilton waived his right to a jury trial. After the issuance of a superseding indictment on January 5, 2000, the district court heard the case against Hilton over the course of three days. This court reviewed the district court's findings extensively in <i>United States v.

LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">9220</span></span> (D. Me. June 30, 2000) (\"<i>Hilton III</i>\")). Here we concentrate on the evidence at issue in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search of Hilton's computer room on November 7, 1997 produced a number of pornographic images. These were found on a Sony Backup Tape, in Hilton's hard drive, and printed up and stored in a \"gray box.\" According to Agent Marx of the local police, whom the parties stipulated as a computer forensics expert, the Sony Backup Tape was used to back up Hilton's computer two months before seizure. The Sony tape contained thousands of images; the government introduced seven of them. The \"gray box\" contained a print-out with four images identical to four in the Sony tape. The hard drive contained three images, and this court on review found two to be non-explicit. <i>See Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove that these images depicted children, rather than adults, the government introduced the testimony of Dr. Lawrence Ricci. Dr. Ricci testified as to the Tanner Scale and its application to the seized images. The Tanner Scale was developed through analysis of many children both in the United States and throughout the world and provides a basis for estimating a person's stage of physiological development. Dr. Ricci marked on the backs of the images his opinion as to the children's ages. In his opinion, apart from an image that morphed a child's face with an adult woman's body, the other nine images represented children at various stages of development, ranging from pre-school to young teen. <i>See Hilton III,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">894679</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist.

The court also found the required element of scienter and an interstate nexus. Since the court did not find merit in Hilton's affirmative defenses that he was possessing the images under authority of the government, it convicted Hilton on June 30, 2000, and subsequently sentenced him to forty months imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hilton appealed his conviction, challenging the constitutionality of the CPPA and the sufficiency of the evidence. He reiterated his affirmative defense that he had collected the images at the government's request. <i>Hilton IV,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199515\"><a href=\"/opinion/199515/united-states-v-hilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>. Hilton also claimed that the district court erred in his sentencing. We rejected all but the sentencing claim. Since we concluded that two of the three hard drive images did not qualify as child pornography or did not involve the sexual exploitation of a minor, we remanded for resentencing because the record did not support the Sentencing Guidelines upward adjustment applied by the district court for possession of \"ten or more... items, containing a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2G2.4(b)(2); <i>see Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 58.

Contrary to our earlier conclusion in <i>Hilton II,</i> 167 F.3d at 72-74, the Court held that the availability of virtual child pornography to child abusers does not provide a basis for the prohibition because while \"[t]he objective is to prohibit illegal conduct ... this restriction goes well beyond that interest by restricting the speech available to law-abiding adults.\" <i>Id.</i> at 252-53, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That the children in the images are real amounts to an element of the crime which the government must prove, the burden of which should not be displaced to the defendant as an affirmative defense. <i>Cf.

Instead, \"[t]he Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to demand that [the factfinder] find him guilty of all the elements of the crime with which he is charged.\" <i>United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span> (1995). In the present case, that the children in the images are real is an element of the crime; Hilton therefore had a right to have the factfinder decide whether the children were real. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government urges that \"a factual review compellingly demonstrates that the images Hilton possessed were indeed of actual children.\" The question before us, though, does not call for our evaluation of the evidence but rather of what the trial court actually found.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The government advances one argument we must address, namely, that in finding, according to Dr. Ricci's testimony, that the images represented children rather than adults, the trial court necessarily concluded as a matter of fact that the children were real. According to the government, it is \"commonsense\" that findings as to age based on the Tanner Scale satisfy the further element of actuality:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"Tanner Scale\" was developed through an analysis of \"large numbers of children\" both in the United States and throughout the world. Commonsense establishes that the scale was developed through the assessment of actual children. The reasonable and commonsense inference is also that Dr. Ricci, as an expert pediatrician, would apply the \"Tanner Scale\" only to actual children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find more commonsensical a proposition leading to the contrary inference that someone manufacturing images to look like children will try &#8212; and with sufficient technology will manage &#8212; to produce images that would be amenable to expert analysis under the Tanner Scale. Whatever parameters of body proportion, growth and development serve as signs of age under the Tanner Scale, those parameters will be mimicked by the virtual pornographer &#8212; whether by design or as a byproduct of the goal of realism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot endorse the view that it is commonsense that the trial court also found &#8212; or must have found &#8212; that the images represented real children. Rather, it is plain to us that the trial court found Hilton guilty of possessing images that appeared to be children engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Under the erroneous understanding at the time of conviction, possession of child pornography could be punished criminally <i>even if</i> the depicted children were artificial and real children were not involved in the production of the images. Because the trial court did not make a finding of fact as to an essential element of the crime &#8212; the reality of the children represented in the images &#8212; we affirm the grant of habeas relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The statute provides that \"Any person who ... knowingly possesses any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, or that was produced using materials that have been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer ... shall be punished....\" 18 U.S.C. 2252A(a)(5)(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We noted that \"the Ninth Circuit struck down only those portions of the Act making illegal possession of computer generated images of fictitious children.\"<i>Hilton IV,</i> 257 F.3d at 53.
