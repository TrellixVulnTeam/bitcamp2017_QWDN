R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 02-2162\n\n                          VASILIOS MILIOS,\n\n                       Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                 v.\n\n                 MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT TRIBAL NATION;\n               MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT GAMING COMMISSION;\n               MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT GAMING ENTERPRISE,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Edwin T. Scallon for appellant.\n     Elizabeth Conway, with whom Office of Legal Counsel\nMashantucket Pequot Tribe, and Mark R. Kravitz, with whom Wiggin &\nDana, were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                           March 21, 2003\n\f           Per    Curiam.          In    September       1998,     plaintiff-appellant\n\nVasilios   Milios        was    dealt         a    royal     straight       flush    while\n\nparticipating in a game known as Caribbean Stud Poker at defendant-\n\nappellee Mashantucket Pequot Gaming Enterprise (also known as\n\nFoxwoods Casino), which is located on a reservation of defendant-\n\nappellee Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.                       If Milios had placed\n\na $1 bet prior to being dealt this hand, he would have been\n\nentitled to a \"progressive jackpot\" of more than $158,000.                              But\n\ncasino officials determined that he had not placed such a bet after\n\nreviewing a surveillance videotape of the table at which Milios had\n\nbeen playing.     Milios unsuccessfully challenged this determination\n\nbefore defendant-appellee Mashantucket Pequot Gaming Commission,\n\nunsuccessfully       appealed      this       ruling,       and   then     unsuccessfully\n\nattempted to sue defendants in the Mashantucket Tribal Court under\n\nthe   Indian     Civil    Rights        Act       (ICRA),    25    U.S.C.    §     1302(8).\n\nThereafter,     he   brought       the    underlying         federal       court    action,\n\nasserting that defendants had violated his civil rights under the\n\nICRA and 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2), and had breached common law duties\n\nthey owed to him.\n\n           The district court dismissed Milios's complaint for want\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction.                   The court first reasoned that it\n\nlacked diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 because an\n\nIndian   tribe    is     not   a    citizen         of   any      state.    See    Ninigret\n\nDevelopment Corp. v. Narragansett Indian Wetuomuck Housing Auth.,\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\f207 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2000).   The court next determined that it\n\nlacked federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n\n1343(4) because (1) the only federal cause of action available\n\nunder the ICRA is one brought pursuant to its habeas corpus\n\nprovision, U.S.C. § 1303, see Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436\n\nU.S. 49, 61 (1978); (2) the portion of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(2) upon\n\nwhich Milios relied in his first amended complaint prohibits only\n\nconspiracies that interfere with the administration of justice in\n\nfederal courts, see Kush v. Rutledge, 460 U.S. 719, 724 (1983), and\n\nno such conspiracy was alleged; and (3) an additional portion of §\n\n1985(2) which prohibits conspiracies to obstruct \"the due course of\n\njustice in any State or Territory\" -- a provision not referenced in\n\nthe first amended complaint -- could not in any event provide\n\nMilios with a cause of action because an essential element of such\n\na claim is a class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus, see\n\nHahn v. Sargent, 523 F.2d 461, 469 (1st Cir. 1975), and Milios had\n\nnot asserted that he was the victim of conduct so motivated.\n\n          Milios has appealed the district court's ruling only\n\ninsofar as it rejected jurisdiction under the ICRA and the portion\n\nof § 1985(2) discussed by the court which his first amended\n\ncomplaint did not recite.   We reject his appeal.     As an initial\n\nmatter, Milios failed to file a notice of appeal within the thirty\n\ndays specified in Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(a).          Although the\n\ndistrict court summarily granted Milios's motion to extend the\n\n\n                               -3-\n\fperiod of time in which he might take an appeal, see Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 4(a)(5)(A), the correctness of this ruling is open to serious\n\ndoubt because Milios made no effort to establish that he missed the\n\noriginal deadline for good cause or through excusable neglect, see\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(ii); see also Graphic Communications\n\nIntern. Union, Local 12-N v. Quebecor Printing Providence, Inc.,\n\n270 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2001).      Regardless, Milios's arguments,\n\nwhich are somewhat difficult to understand, do not present us with\n\nany basis for concluding that the court misread Santa Clara Pueblo\n\n(and this court's cases elaborating upon this decision) or his\n\nfirst amended complaint in concluding that the pleading failed to\n\nset forth a colorable federal claim under either the ICRA or any\n\nportion of § 1985.    We thus affirm on the basis of the lower\n\ncourt's memorandum and order to the extent that it addresses the\n\nissues raised by Milios's appeal.    See Lawton v. State Mut. Life.\n\nAssur. Co. of Am., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[W]hen a\n\nlower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an\n\nappellate court should refrain from writing at length to other end\n\nthan to hear its own words resonate.\").\n\n          We affirm the dismissal of the action.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
