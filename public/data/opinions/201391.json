Edward F. Harrington, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Howard, Circuit Judge,\n\n\n\n     David J.

Richard   North   seeks   a   certificate   of\n\nappealability (COA) to appeal from the district court's denial of\n\nhis petition for habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254 from a\n\nstate court conviction on twenty-two indictments for larceny by\n\nfalse pretenses.     North seeks a COA to pursue his claims that he\n\nwas denied counsel or, in the alternative, received ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.\n\nWe may grant a COA only if the district court's application of the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) to\n\ndeny habeas relief was \"debatable among jurists of reason.\" Miller-\n\nEl v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003).\n\n           Under AEDPA, a federal court may grant a state prisoner's\n\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus if the underlying state\n\nadjudication     \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n\ninvolved   an    unreasonable   application   of,   clearly   established\n\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates.\" 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d).       With respect to the \"unreasonable\n\napplication\" clause, the focus \"is on whether the state court's\n\napplication of clearly established federal law is objectively\n\nunreasonable, and . . .     an unreasonable application is different\n\nfrom an incorrect one.\" Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 694 (2002).\n\n           I. Constructive Denial of Counsel\n\n           In United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984), the\n\nSupreme Court held that there are some circumstances of deficient\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\frepresentation    \"that are so likely to prejudice the accused that\n\nthe cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is\n\nunjustified\" and, therefore, prejudice will be presumed. Id. at\n\n658-59.   The Court in Bell \"reiterated that prejudice may be\n\npresumed only in three narrowly circumscribed situations.\" Ouber v.\n\nGuarino, 293 F.3d 19, 33 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          First, a trial is presumptively unfair if the\n          accused is completely denied the presence of\n          counsel   at   a   critical  stage   of   the\n          proceedings.   Second, such a presumption is\n          warranted if \"counsel entirely fails to\n          subject the prosecution's case to meaningful\n          adversarial testing.\" Third, prejudice may be\n          presumed in the presence of circumstances\n          under which a competent lawyer would likely\n          not be able to render effective assistance.\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n          In his memorandum in support of his habeas petition,\n\nNorth argued     that   the   circumstances   of   his   case   fell   within\n\nCronic's second exception to the prejudice requirement:\n\n          [Defense counsel] completely failed to subject\n          the   Commonwealth's   case    to   meaningful\n          adversarial testing by: (1) her complete\n          failure to participate in jury selection, (2)\n          her failure to cross-examine thirty-six of\n          forty-five witnesses (including three of the\n          five complainants, and none of North's\n          employees), and (3) her baseless waiver of an\n          opening statement.\n\nNorth's Memorandum in Support of Petition for Writ of Habeas\n\nCorpus, Dkt No. 11, p. 13.      The trial transcript indicates that at\n\neach of the identified points in the trial, defense counsel stated\n\nthat she was not in a position to challenge jurors, make an opening\n\n                                    -3-\n\fstatement or cross-examine certain prosecution witnesses because\n\nshe hadn't been provided with adequate discovery to try the case.\n\n                 In Bell, the Supreme Court explained that in order to\n\ncome within Cronic's second exception, \"the attorney's failure [to\n\ntest the prosecutor's case] must be complete.\" Bell, 535 U.S. at\n\n697.       By contrast, an argument that \"counsel failed to oppose the\n\nprosecution . . . at specific points\" is subject to Strickland's\n\nperformance and prejudice components. Id. at 697-98.                The state\n\ncourt in this case supportably found that defense counsel was\n\npresent      throughout    the   trial,    effectively     cross-examined   key\n\nprosecution witnesses and presented to the jury a \"defense of good-\n\nfaith failure to provide a return on investments.\" Commonwealth v.\n\nNorth,      52    Mass.App.Ct.   603,     614   (2001).1    On   this   record,\n\nreasonable jurists could not find debatable the district court's\n\nconclusion that the state court did not unreasonably apply Cronic\n\nin concluding that North's representation did not fall within the\n\nsecond Cronic exception.\n\n                 II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       The record also supports the state court's finding that\ndespite counsel's protests that she had not been provided with\ndiscovery, \"[by] the time trial commenced, the trial judge and\nother judges had made every reasonable accommodation to insure that\ncounsel and the defendant were prepared,\" and that \"[w]hile trial\nwas ongoing, the judge adjusted the trial schedule repeatedly to\naccommodate the defendant's review of documents.\" North, 52\nMass.App.Ct. at 613.\n\n                                        -4-\n\f                In analyzing North's ineffective assistance claim, the\n\nstate court applied Commonwealth v. Saferian 366 Mass. 89 (1974),\n\nwhich this court has concluded is \"for habeas purposes . . ., a\n\nfunctional equivalent of Strickland.\" Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d\n\n19,   32       (1st   Cir.   2002).       \"To   establish   such   a     violation,\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-96 (1984), requires\n\nthat [defendant] show (1) that [defense counsel's] performance fell\n\nbelow     an     objective     standard    of   reasonableness     and    (2)   that\n\nprejudice resulted.\" Tejeda v. Dubois, 142 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).     The state court held that North had failed to satisfy\n\neither prong of the Strickland test, and the district court found\n\nthat the state court had reasonably applied Strickland in reaching\n\nthat conclusion.\n\n                Reasonable jurists could not dispute the district court's\n\ndetermination.          \"Under the applicable constitutional standard, a\n\nfailure of proof on either prong of the Strickland test defeats an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.\" United States v. LaBonte,\n\n70 F.3d 1396, 1413-14 (1st Cir. 1995), rev'd on other grounds, 520\n\nU.S. 751 (1997).             We focus on the prejudice prong.2 To satisfy\n\nStrickland's second prong, a defendant\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       We therefore need not resolve petitioner's claim that the\nstate court applied a standard contrary to Supreme Court precedent\nin holding that his acquiescence in his attorney's improper tactics\nprecluded a finding that the first prong of Strickland had been\nsatisfied.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f           must demonstrate that there was a reasonable\n           probability that but for [his attorney's]\n           errors, the outcome of the trial would have\n           been different. For that purpose a reasonable\n           probability is defined as      \"a probability\n           sufficient to undermine confidence in the\n           outcome.\" And in that respect our analysis is\n           not limited to outcome determination - we must\n           also contemplate \"whether the result of the\n           proceeding   was   fundamentally   unfair   or\n           unreliable.\"\n\nTejeda, 142 F.3d at 22.\n\n           In his memorandum in support of his habeas petition and\n\nin his COA application, North specifically claims that he was\n\nprejudiced     by   his   counsel's   failure   to   cross-examine   certain\n\nwitnesses, failure to call other witnesses, and failure to consult\n\nan accountant.       Having considered those claims and reviewed the\n\nstate court trial transcript, we conclude that reasonable jurists\n\ncould    not   dispute     the   district   court's    determination    that\n\npetitioner failed to make the requisite showing that the state\n\ncourt's prejudice determination was objectively unreasonable.3\n\n\n     3\n       Petitioner's reliance upon Tejeda v. Dubois, 142 F.3d 18 (1st\nCir. 1998),is misplaced. As an initial matter, Tejeda filed his\nhabeas petition before the effective date of AEDPA and, therefore,\nAEDPA's \"more stringent limitations on the federal courts' review\nof state court determinations via habeas proceedings\" did not apply\nand we reviewed his ineffective assistance claim de novo. Id. at\n22.   Moreover, our review of the record in this case indicates\nother dissimilarities. We found that Tejeda's counsel \"fail[ed] to\npresent a coherent argument\" in support of the defense of police\nfabrication. Id. at 25. We also found that Tejeda's counsel and\nthe trial judge \"simply could not tolerate each other\" and that\ntheir relationship \"ruptured completely.\" Id. at 22. The state\ncourt made no such finding with respect to defense counsel's\nrelationship with the trial judge in this case, nor would the trial\ntranscript have supported such a finding.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          Petitioner's request for a COA is denied and the appeal\n\nis terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f",

We focus on the prejudice prong.2 To satisfy\n\nStrickland's second prong, a defendant\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       We therefore need not resolve petitioner's claim that the\nstate court applied a standard contrary to Supreme Court precedent\nin holding that his acquiescence in his attorney's improper tactics\nprecluded a finding that the first prong of Strickland had been\nsatisfied.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f           must demonstrate that there was a reasonable\n           probability that but for [his attorney's]\n           errors, the outcome of the trial would have\n           been different. For that purpose a reasonable\n           probability is defined as      \"a probability\n           sufficient to undermine confidence in the\n           outcome.\" And in that respect our analysis is\n           not limited to outcome determination - we must\n           also contemplate \"whether the result of the\n           proceeding   was   fundamentally   unfair   or\n           unreliable.\"\n\nTejeda, 142 F.3d at 22.\n\n           In his memorandum in support of his habeas petition and\n\nin his COA application, North specifically claims that he was\n\nprejudiced     by   his   counsel's   failure   to   cross-examine   certain\n\nwitnesses, failure to call other witnesses, and failure to consult\n\nan accountant.       Having considered those claims and reviewed the\n\nstate court trial transcript, we conclude that reasonable jurists\n\ncould    not   dispute     the   district   court's    determination    that\n\npetitioner failed to make the requisite showing that the state\n\ncourt's prejudice determination was objectively unreasonable.3\n\n\n     3\n       Petitioner's reliance upon Tejeda v. Dubois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197917\"><a href=\"/opinion/197917/tejeda-v-dubois/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\nCir. 1998),is misplaced. As an initial matter, Tejeda filed his\nhabeas petition before the effective date of AEDPA and, therefore,\nAEDPA's \"more stringent limitations on the federal courts' review\nof state court determinations via habeas proceedings\" did not apply\nand we reviewed his ineffective assistance claim de novo. Id. at\n22.   Moreover, our review of the record in this case indicates\nother dissimilarities. We found that Tejeda's counsel \"fail[ed] to\npresent a coherent argument\" in support of the defense of police\nfabrication. Id. at 25. We also found that Tejeda's counsel and\nthe trial judge \"simply could not tolerate each other\" and that\ntheir relationship \"ruptured completely.\" Id. at 22. The state\ncourt made no such finding with respect to defense counsel's\nrelationship with the trial judge in this case, nor would the trial\ntranscript have supported such a finding.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          Petitioner's request for a COA is denied and the appeal\n\nis terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f</pre>",
