Negrón-Vargas,\nDeputy Solicitor General, were on brief for defendants, appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                         January 6, 2006\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge.    The background to this litigation\n\nunder section 1983 is easily recounted.    In 1996, Dorcas Rosario-\n\nUrdaz (\"Rosario-Urdaz\") began work as an employee with the rank of\n\nEmployee I in the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human\n\nResources (\"DLHR\").   She earned career status as an Information\n\nRepresentative and was rather quickly promoted to a \"trust\" (i.e.,\n\npolitical) position in 1997.     At that time, the governorship was\n\nheld by the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") with which Rosario-Urdaz\n\nis associated.\n\n          In November 2000, a new governor was elected representing\n\nthe Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\").   As permitted by Puerto Rico\n\nlaw, 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1350(8)(a) (2000), Rosario-Urdaz then\n\nexercised her option to resume her earlier status as a career\n\nemployee effective December 29, 2000, shortly before the new\n\nadministration took power in January 2001.    When the new governor\n\ntook office, she appointed, as Secretary of the DLHR, Victor\n\nRivera-Hernandez, who was later succeeded by Roman Velazco. In the\n\nnew administration, Carmen Rosario-Morales was Assistant Secretary\n\nfor Human Resources; she was later replaced by Gladys Rivera.\n\n          According to Rosario-Urdaz, she was made a target of\n\nharassment after the new PDP administration came to power.      She\n\nsaid that her duties were reduced and given at least in part to a\n\nformer subordinate, Maira Gonzalez, a member of the PDP; that she\n\nwas harassed by Gonzalez and by another co-worker, Angel Agosto;\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fand that her entire office was abolished in October 2001. Although\n\nRosario-Urdaz was initially given an equivalent job in another part\n\nof the DLHR, she was discharged in March 2002.\n\n          The discharge, which is a central issue in the present\n\nappeal, occurred after an audit in 2001 studied transfers within\n\nthe department that had occurred during a so-called freeze period\n\nsurrounding the 2000 election.          The audit was conducted under the\n\nsupervision of Gladys Rivera and it concluded, as to Rosario-Urdaz,\n\nthat there were irregularities in her original 1996 appointment to\n\nthe career position of Information Representative that rendered the\n\nappointment a nullity.         Gladys Rivera's report led to Rosario-\n\nUrdaz' discharge by Rivera-Hernandez.\n\n          Following      the   discharge,      Rosario-Urdaz    brought    the\n\npresent suit in April 2002.       Along with claims under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw, the complaint asserted a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n(2000), based on two different theories: first, that the alleged\n\nharassment   and   the    discharge     were    politically    motivated    in\n\nviolation of Rosario-Urdaz' first amendment rights, and second,\n\nthat her discharge without a prior hearing violated fifth amendment\n\ndue process rights, given that her career position is a protected\n\nproperty right.\n\n          The defendants named in the suit were Rivera-Hernandez,\n\nRosario-Morales,   Gonzalez      and    Agosto;   Velazco,     who   succeeded\n\nRivera-Hernandez as secretary of the DLHR, was later added for\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fpurposes of reinstatement relief.         Gladys Rivera was not named as\n\na defendant. Rosario-Urdaz sought huge damages against all four in\n\ntheir personal capacity (official-capacity damage claims were made\n\nbut are barred) and reinstatement as Information Representative.\n\nShe requested a preliminary injunction to restore her to her\n\nposition pendente lite; this was denied by the district court but\n\nthis court vacated and remanded the matter for further proceedings.\n\nRosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernandez, 350 F.3d 219 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           In June 2004, the district court granted pending motions\n\nto   dismiss   the    personal   capacity   damage   claims   against   all\n\ndefendants based on qualified immunity.          On June 21, 2004, the\n\ncourt held a bench trial on the request for reinstatement, which it\n\ngranted on the ground that termination without a prior hearing was\n\nimpermissible because the department had not shown that Rosario-\n\nUrdaz' career appointment was void.         In August 2004, the district\n\ncourt issued a final judgment.\n\n           These cross appeals followed: Rosario-Urdaz to contest\n\nthe dismissal of her damage claims and the secretary to contest her\n\nreinstatement.       On the former, resolved on summary judgment, our\n\nreview is plenary, Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, 131 (1st Cir.\n\n2000); on the latter, which followed a bench trial, fact-findings\n\nare reviewed for clear error and legal determinations de novo save\n\nthat some deference may be shown to rulings that effectively apply\n\nabstract rules to specific events.           Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); 9A\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fWright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 2d § 2588 at\n\n600-08 (1995).\n\n              We begin with Rosario-Urdaz' damage claims against the\n\ndefendants, which the district court dismissed based on qualified\n\nimmunity.       The underlying substantive law protects government\n\nemployees from adverse action or harassment against them motivated\n\nby hostility to their political views or affiliation. Padilla-\n\nGarcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez, 212 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nDefendants did not assert that Rosario-Urdaz held a position for\n\nwhich   her    political   opinions   could   be   treated   as   pertinent;\n\ninstead, they denied any violation and, in the alternative, said\n\nthat qualified immunity protected them.\n\n              We may affirm the district court's dismissal if the\n\nclaims fail on their merits at the summary judgment stage or if, on\n\nthis record, qualified immunity has been made out. Indeed, the two\n\ninquiries now overlap in part due to the Supreme Court's direction\n\nin Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001), that qualified\n\nimmunity determinations begin with an inquiry into whether the\n\nright asserted exists at all in relation to the facts.                  The\n\nindividual defendants are charged with distinct acts performed by\n\neach and, in addition, with a joint and general effort to drive\n\nRosario-Urdaz from her post.\n\n              Rosario-Urdaz was deprived of her position by a single\n\nact--Rivera-Hernandez' decision to terminate her employment on the\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fprofessed       ground    that        her        original    career    appointment     as\n\nInformation Representative was flawed in its inception.                          Rosario-\n\nUrdaz asserts that Rivera-Hernandez was wrongfully motivated by her\n\nparty    affiliation;      if      so,      he    would     presumptively   be    liable,\n\nPadilla-Garcia, 212 F.3d at 74--subject to qualified immunity or\n\nother possible defenses, see, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd.\n\nof Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977).\n\n            There is no evidence that Rivera-Hernandez' action was\n\npolitically motivated.                He received a report, resulting from\n\nGladys Rivera's audit, colorably asserting that Rosario-Urdaz was\n\nholding a career position to which she was not entitled.                          He has\n\ndenied a political motive; in his deposition, he identified others\n\nwho were terminated as a result of the audit.                         Rosario-Urdaz has\n\npointed    to    nothing      to    show         political    motivation    on    Rivera-\n\nHernandez' part.\n\n            If anything, Rosario-Urdaz' brief on this issue tends\n\nmore to undercut her position than to support it.                            In a short\n\nmustering of \"evidence\" against Rivera-Hernandez, the brief says he\n\n\"admitted\" considering Rosario-Urdaz' party membership; so he did,\n\nsaying    that    it   made     him      hesitate      (i.e.,    in   her   favor)   when\n\nconfronted with the recommendation against her.                         The brief also\n\nconjures    up    an     imaginary          conflict      between     Rivera-Hernandez'\n\nstatements that he questioned Gladys Rivera actively as to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\frecommendation          and     his    eventual   reliance      on   the     audit\n\nrecommendation.\n\n               There are four charges against Rosario-Morales: that she\n\ndeprived Rosario-Urdaz of prior duties, assigned Gonzalez to the\n\nsame office with some of those duties, transferred all of the\n\npersonnel of Rosario-Urdaz' then-existing office incident to its\n\nclosing, and ordered an earlier audit of personnel transactions\n\noccurring in August 2000--just before the pre-election freeze\n\nbecame effective.             The earlier audit had no effect on Rosario-\n\nUrdaz;1 the other three charges pose the only issue of general\n\nimportance in this case.\n\n               Rosario-Urdaz does not claim that Rosario-Morales is\n\nresponsible for her termination; this occurred as a result of\n\nactions taken by Gladys Rivera and Rivera-Hernandez after Rosario-\n\nMorales left the department at the end of 2001.              Instead, the three\n\nincidents involve reassignments of duties and of personnel to\n\ndifferent offices.             None of these changes resulted in Rosario-\n\nUrdaz' discharge or reduction in salary.             Two of them, perhaps all\n\nthree       depending    on     what   duties   Rosario-Urdaz    retained,    are\n\ncommonplace personnel decisions likely to be shielded by qualified\n\nimmunity if objective reasonableness overcomes imputed motive.\n\n\n        1\n      Rosario-Urdaz was apparently transferred back to career\nstatus during the freeze period itself--how is unexplained--and the\naudit in question is not the one later conducted by Gladys Rivera\nthat led to Rosario-Urdaz' ultimate termination for reasons having\nnothing to do with the freeze.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f          This is the rub.     Traditionally--search and seizure is\n\nthe best example--the Supreme Court has said that private motive is\n\nirrelevant if the defendant had objective probable cause or, for\n\nqualified immunity purposes, a reasonable officer might have so\n\nbelieved, even if wrongly.      Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n\n818-19 (1982).      By contrast, in cases involving first amendment\n\nrights, some of our decisions have left open the possibility that\n\nan objectively reasonable action could still be denied qualified\n\nimmunity if improperly motivated. See Mihos v. Swift, 358 F.3d 91,\n\n103-07 (1st Cir. 2004); Tang v. Rhode Island, 120 F.3d 325, 327\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).2\n\n          In all events, even if the existence of a political\n\nmotivation underlying an objectively reasonable employment decision\n\nwere enough to preclude qualified immunity, Rosario-Urdaz must make\n\na threshold showing that she was adversely affected by these\n\npersonnel decisions.     Padilla-Garcia, 212 F.3d at 74.   Employment\n\nactions short of outright dismissal or demotion are redressable if\n\nimproperly motivated, Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S.\n\n62, 75-76 (1990), but only if the employment action resulted in\n\nconditions \"unreasonably inferior\" to the norm for that position,\n\n\n     2\n      These cases note, without resolving, the tension between\nspecific-intent constitutional violations and the requirement that\nqualified immunity be decided on a purely objective basis. Tang\nexpressed the hope that the Supreme Court would shed light on this\nquestion, 120 F.3d at 328; in the event, it did not. See Crawford-\nEl v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574 (1998); id. at 602 (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fAgosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1218-19 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (en banc).3\n\n          The personnel decisions of which Rosario-Urdaz complains\n\ndo not rise to this level.   Gonzalez once had an altercation with\n\nRosario-Urdaz; allegedly Gonzalez had thrown food at Rosario-Urdaz\n\nwhen the latter, then Gonzalez' supervisor, reprimanded Gonzalez\n\nfor eating outside of the lunch hour. Gonzalez was reprimanded and\n\ntransferred.   Nor can one make a federal law suit out of Gonzalez'\n\ntransfer back by Rosario-Morales several years later, whatever\n\nprivate motive Rosario-Morales may have had (Gonzalez was a PDP\n\nsupporter) and even though this was distasteful to Rosario-Urdaz.\n\nAgosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1217.\n\n          Rosario-Urdaz says that the office in which she was\n\noperating was regarded by the new administration as a nest of NPP\n\nsupporters; Rosario-Morales says in her deposition that the office\n\nhad been performing poorly and that the decision to close the\n\noffice and transfer employees elsewhere (some of whom were PDP\n\nmembers) was made for operational reasons which she described in\n\nher deposition.   Whether or not political differences played some\n\npart in the decision to close the office and reassign employees,\n\n\n     3\n      Agosto-de-Feliciano was decided before the Supreme Court\ndecision in Rutan rejecting as too stringent another circuit's\nrequirement that such actions be the \"substantial equivalent of a\ndismissal,\" 497 U.S. at 75-76.      We follow previous panels in\nassuming that the \"unreasonably inferior\" standard is still viable.\nSee Acosta-Orozco v. Rodriguez-de-Rivera, 132 F.3d 97, 101 n. 5\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                               -10-\n\fthe fact remains that Rosario-Urdaz was reassigned to a position of\n\nthe same rank and salary and has not shown \"unreasonably inferior\"\n\nconditions.\n\n          The only charge that gives us any pause is Rosario-Urdaz'\n\nbrief statement that she lost duties after the new administration\n\ntook over.    In certain circumstances--say, utterly depriving an\n\nemployee of work indefinitely for political reasons--this might\n\nmake out a claim.     See Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1219-20.\n\nBut Rosario-Urdaz' brief provides no detail whatsoever as to why\n\nher change of duties was so reprehensible or even what the change\n\nin duties entailed.\n\n          As to Gonzalez and Agosto, they were not supervisors but\n\nco-workers.    Unless they carried on a substantial campaign of\n\nharassment, instigated or knowingly tolerated by superiors, their\n\nacts would not constitute the mis-exercise of government power at\n\nwhich section 1983 is aimed.   Guzman v. City of Cranston, 812 F.2d\n\n24, 26 (1st Cir. 1987); see also Woodward v. City of Worland, 977\n\nF.2d 1392, 1400 (10th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 509 U.S. 923\n\n(1993).   There is no evidence that what they did was either\n\ninstigated or tolerated by Rivera-Hernandez, Rosario-Morales, or\n\nanyone else in authority.\n\n          Gonzalez criticized Rosario-Urdaz in a letter to Rivera-\n\nHernandez, implying that she was not cooperating with the new\n\nadministration and saying that a restructuring was needed; the\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fletter had strong political coloration but Gonzalez was entitled to\n\nher opinion, and this was not an adverse employment decision.                      As\n\nfor Agosto, on one occasion he told Rosario-Urdaz that the prior\n\nadministration was a bunch of crooks; for this he was reprimanded\n\nby   Rivera-Hernandez,      who    wrote   Agosto    a    letter    \"emphatically\n\nreject[ing]\"      this   behavior    and   warning      that   it   could    not   be\n\nrepeated \"under any circumstances.\"\n\n            A single insult by a co-worker with no supervisory power\n\nis   not   political      discrimination     by     one    exercising       official\n\nauthority.     Cf. Webber v. Int'l Paper Co., 417 F.3d 229, 236-37\n\n(1st Cir. 2005).         Rosario-Urdaz says that the incidents must be\n\nconsidered as a whole and the joint action of the defendants\n\ncomprised a \"witch hunt\" directed against her.                 Incidents can take\n\ncolor from, and cumulate with, other incidents, and conspiracy can\n\nsometimes    be   inferred    from    parallel     or     interrelated      actions.\n\nNothing in the disparate incidents before us suggests any such\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            We turn now to the cross-appeal by the DLHR secretary,\n\nobjecting to the district court's bench-trial finding of a due\n\nprocess violation in Rosario-Urdaz' termination and the court's\n\nresultant    reinstatement        order.     The    reinstatement       calls      for\n\nofficial action, but the secretary does not challenge the district\n\ncourt's authority to order it.             The secretary asserts only that\n\nthere was no due process violation because Rosario-Urdaz was not\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fproperly appointed as a career employee and therefore never had a\n\nproperty interest in her job.\n\n              The parties agree that if Rosario-Urdaz was a career\n\nemployee under Puerto Rico law, then she had a right in the present\n\ncircumstances to a due process hearing from the state before\n\ntermination.        Cf. Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co., 841 F.2d 1169, 1173\n\n(1st Cir. 1988).        The parties also assume that under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw, a serious flaw in the process of Rosario-Urdaz' original\n\nappointment, however many years earlier, permits the secretary to\n\ndischarge her summarily.       Finally, they assume that if the flaw is\n\nestablished in the federal court proceeding, this nullifies the\n\nappointment both under state law and for purposes of due process\n\nprotection, although the secretary concedes that the burden is upon\n\nthe secretary to show the nullifying flaw.\n\n              Whether this is a good way to operate a civil service\n\nsystem   or    to   frame   federal   due    process   protections   might   be\n\ndebated.      However, the Supreme Court, e.g., Town of Castle Rock v.\n\nGonzales, 125 S. Ct. 2796, 2803 (2005), makes the issue whether\n\nthere is a protectible property right turn on state law, and the\n\nparties' view of Puerto Rico law is supported by precedent. Colón-\n\nPérez v. Mayor of the Municipality of Ceiba, 112 P.R. Dec. 740, 12\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 934, 940 (P.R. 1982) (flawed appointment \"void\"\n\nunder Puerto Rico law); Kauffman, 841 F.2d at 1173 (same).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            At    the    bench   trial     on    reinstatement,     Rosario-Urdaz'\n\ncounsel presented evidence of her appointment to a career position\n\nand her termination from this position without a hearing, and\n\ncounsel then rested Rosario-Urdaz' case in chief.                   The DLHR then\n\npresented Rosario-Urdaz' personnel file and one witness, Gladys\n\nRivera, who described the audit of Rosario-Urdaz' appointment which\n\nunderpinned the discharge.            The first reason offered for finding\n\nthe original appointment void was Rosario-Urdaz' alleged lack of\n\nthe required experience to qualify for the appointment.\n\n            The    evidence      is   that       the   position    of   Information\n\nRepresentative requires a bachelor's degree and \"one year of\n\nexperience in functions of similar nature and complexity to those\n\ncarried out by a Writer of Information\"--a term that the parties\n\ntreat as equivalent to Information Representative.                  Rosario-Urdaz\n\nhad the degree; as to the required experience, Rosario-Urdaz'\n\npersonnel    file       contained     a    verification     that    she    met   the\n\nrequirement because she had \"two (2) years and four (4) months of\n\nexperience in functions of a nature and complexity similar to those\n\nheld by an Information Writer.\"\n\n            Gladys Rivera asserted that the verification was not\n\nsupported by anything in the file and that an \"equivalency study\"\n\nrevealed that Rosario-Urdaz' prior position overlapped in some\n\nrespects with the position of Information Representative but that\n\noverlap was not enough to establish equivalency.                        It followed\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f(Gladys Rivera argued) that lacking equivalency, Rosario-Urdaz did\n\nnot have the specified experience for her career position.\n\n             Surprisingly, Gladys Rivera also testified at the bench\n\ntrial that she had never examined the requirements or duties of an\n\nInformation Writer. This, from the district court's point of view,\n\nundermined her testimony as to Rosario-Urdaz' lack of equivalent\n\nexperience and also contradicted, at least implicitly, the letter\n\nthat Gladys Rivera had drafted for Rivera-Hernandez explaining why\n\nRosario-Urdaz was being terminated.         The district court's refusal\n\nto credit Gladys Rivera's opinion as sufficient to establish\n\nRosario-Urdaz' lack of the experience qualifications was within its\n\ndiscretion.     EIMSKIP v. Atl. Fish Mkt., Inc., 417 F.3d 72, 76 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n             The termination letter and Gladys Rivera's testimony gave\n\nan alternative ground for treating the appointment as a nullity,\n\nnamely,   the   inference   that    Rosario-Urdaz    short-circuited        the\n\nrequisite merit process to receive the position.             The inference\n\nrested on the facts that in 1995 the DLHR had begun the process of\n\ndetermining Rosario-Urdaz' qualifications a month before the job\n\nannouncement was publicly posted and that Rosario-Urdaz resigned\n\nfrom   her   former   position     three   days   before   she   was   to    be\n\ninterviewed for the Information Representative position.\n\n             The district court did not discuss this alternative\n\nground, but the inference is not very compelling and the district\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fcourt was not obliged to accept it.           The timing of the equivalency\n\nstudy could indicate that Rosario-Urdaz anticipated applying for a\n\njob she expected to become available; her early resignation could\n\nhave     reflected     confidence      that   she   would    succeed     in     her\n\napplication.       Just what happened is quite obscure.\n\n            The DLHR accepted that it had the burden of proof to show\n\nthat a decade-old appointment, valid on its face, was instead a\n\nnullity.    Conceivably, Rosario-Urdaz might have shed light on the\n\nmatter; but the defense deposed her and apparently adduced nothing\n\nto support its position.             Had it given Rosario-Urdaz a pre-\n\ntermination    hearing,      the    DLHR's    own   fact-finding    might     have\n\nresolved the issue; as it is, the matter was left to the district\n\njudge to resolve and we cannot say that his decision was wrong.\n\n            To sum up, we affirm both the dismissal of Rosario-Urdaz'\n\ndamage    claims     for   political    discrimination      and   the   grant    of\n\ninjunctive relief restoring her to her career position.                 Each side\n\nshall bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f",

In 1996, Dorcas Rosario-Urdaz (\"Rosario-Urdaz\") began work as an employee with the rank of Employee I in the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources (\"DLHR\"). She earned career status as an Information Representative and was rather quickly promoted to a \"trust\" (<i>i.e.,</i> political) position in 1997. At that time, the governorship was held by the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") with which Rosario-Urdaz is associated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2000, a new governor was elected representing the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"). As permitted by Puerto Rico law, 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1350(8)(a) (2000), Rosario-Urdaz then exercised her option to resume her earlier status as a career employee effective December 29, 2000, shortly before the new administration took power in January 2001. When the new governor took office, she appointed, as Secretary of the DLHR, Victor Rivera-Hernandez, who was later succeeded by Roman Velazco. In the new administration, Carmen Rosario-Morales was Assistant Secretary for Human Resources; she was later replaced by Gladys Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Rosario-Urdaz, she was made a target of harassment after the new PDP administration came to power. She said that her duties were reduced and given at least in part to a former subordinate, Maira Gonzalez, a member of the PDP; that she was harassed by Gonzalez and by another co-worker, Angel Agosto; and that her entire office was abolished in October 2001. Although Rosario-Urdaz was initially given an equivalent job in another part of the DLHR, she was discharged in March 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The discharge, which is a central issue in the present appeal, occurred after an audit in 2001 studied transfers within the department that had occurred during a so-called freeze period surrounding the 2000 election. The audit was conducted under the supervision of Gladys Rivera and it concluded, as to Rosario-Urdaz, that there were irregularities in her original 1996 appointment to the career position of Information Representative that rendered the appointment a nullity. Gladys Rivera's report led to Rosario-Urdaz' discharge by Rivera-Hernandez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the discharge, Rosario-Urdaz brought the present suit in April 2002. Along with claims under Puerto Rico law, the complaint asserted a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), based on two different theories: first, that the alleged harassment and the discharge were politically motivated in violation of Rosario-Urdaz' first amendment rights, and second, that her discharge without a prior hearing violated fifth amendment due process rights, given that her career position is a protected property right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants named in the suit were Rivera-Hernandez, Rosario-Morales, Gonzalez and Agosto; Velazco, who succeeded Rivera-Hernandez as secretary of the DLHR, was later added for purposes of reinstatement relief. Gladys Rivera was not named as a defendant. Rosario-Urdaz sought huge damages against all four in their personal capacity (official-capacity damage claims were made but are barred) and reinstatement as Information Representative. She requested a preliminary injunction to restore her to her position <i>pendente lite;</i> this was denied by the district court but this court vacated and remanded the matter for further proceedings. <i>Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernandez,</i> 350 F.3d 219 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2004, the district court granted pending motions to dismiss the personal capacity damage claims against all defendants based on qualified immunity. On June 21, 2004, the court held a bench trial on the request for reinstatement, which it granted on the ground that termination without a prior hearing was impermissible because the department had not shown that Rosario-Urdaz' career appointment was void. In August 2004, the district court issued a final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cross appeals followed: Rosario-Urdaz to contest the dismissal of her damage claims and the secretary to contest her reinstatement. On the former, resolved on summary judgment, our review is plenary, <i>Carmona v. Toledo,</i> 215 F.3d 124, 131 (1st Cir.2000); on the latter, which followed a bench trial, fact-findings are reviewed for clear error and legal determinations <i>de novo</i> save that some deference may be shown to rulings that effectively apply abstract rules to specific events. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); 9A Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil 2d</i> &#167; 2588 at 600-08 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Rosario-Urdaz' damage claims against the defendants, which the district court dismissed based on qualified immunity. The underlying substantive law protects government employees from adverse action or harassment against them motivated by hostility to their political views or affiliation. <i>Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez,</i> 212 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir.2000). Defendants did not assert that Rosario-Urdaz held a position for which her political opinions could be treated as pertinent; instead, they denied any violation and, in the alternative, said that qualified immunity protected them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We may affirm the district court's dismissal if the claims fail on their merits at the summary judgment stage or if, on this record, qualified immunity has been made out. Indeed, the two inquiries now overlap in part due to the Supreme Court's direction in <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), that qualified immunity determinations begin with an inquiry into whether the right asserted exists at all in relation to the facts. The individual defendants are charged with distinct acts performed by each and, in addition, with a joint and general effort to drive Rosario-Urdaz from her post.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosario-Urdaz was deprived of her position by a single act&#8212;Rivera-Hernandez' decision to terminate her employment on the professed ground that her original career appointment as Information Representative was flawed in its inception. Rosario-Urdaz asserts that Rivera-Hernandez was wrongfully motivated by her party affiliation; if so, he would presumptively be liable, <i>Padilla-Garcia,</i> 212 F.3d at 74&#8212;subject to qualified immunity or other possible defenses, <i>see, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that Rivera-Hernandez' action was politically motivated. He received a report, resulting from Gladys Rivera's audit, colorably asserting that Rosario-Urdaz was holding a career position to which she was not entitled. He has denied a political motive; in his deposition, he identified others who were terminated as a result of the audit. Rosario-Urdaz has pointed to nothing to show political motivation on Rivera-Hernandez' part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If anything, Rosario-Urdaz' brief on this issue tends more to undercut her position than to support it. In a short mustering of \"evidence\" against Rivera-Hernandez, the brief says he \"admitted\" considering Rosario-Urdaz' party membership; so he did, saying that it made him hesitate (<i>i.e.,</i> in her favor) when confronted with the recommendation against her. The brief also conjures up an imaginary conflict between Rivera-Hernandez' statements that he questioned Gladys Rivera actively as to the recommendation and his eventual reliance on the audit recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are four charges against Rosario-Morales: that she deprived Rosario-Urdaz of prior duties, assigned Gonzalez to the same office with some of those duties, transferred all of the personnel of Rosario-Urdaz' then-existing office incident to its closing, and ordered an <i>earlier</i> audit of personnel transactions occurring in August 2000&#8212;just before the pre-election freeze became effective. The earlier audit had no effect on Rosario-Urdaz;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the other three charges pose the only issue of general importance in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosario-Urdaz does not claim that Rosario-Morales is responsible for her termination; this occurred as a result of actions taken by Gladys Rivera and Rivera-Hernandez <i>after</i> Rosario-Morales left the department at the end of 2001. Instead, the three incidents involve reassignments of duties and of personnel to different offices. None of these changes resulted in Rosario-Urdaz' discharge or reduction in salary. Two of them, perhaps all three depending on what duties Rosario-Urdaz retained, are commonplace personnel decisions likely to be shielded by qualified immunity <i>if</i> objective reasonableness overcomes imputed motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the rub. Traditionally&#8212;search and seizure is the best example&#8212;the Supreme Court has said that private motive is irrelevant if the defendant had objective probable cause or, for qualified immunity purposes, a reasonable officer might have so believed, even if wrongly. <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> 457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). By contrast, in cases involving first amendment rights, some of our decisions have left open the possibility that an objectively reasonable action could still be denied qualified immunity if improperly motivated. <i>See Mihos v. Swift,</i> 358 F.3d 91, 103-07 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Tang v. Rhode Island,</i> 120 F.3d 325, 327 (1st Cir.1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, even if the existence of a political motivation underlying an objectively reasonable employment decision were enough to preclude qualified immunity, Rosario-Urdaz must make a threshold showing that she was adversely affected by these personnel decisions. <i>Padilla-Garcia,</i> 212 F.3d at 74. Employment actions short of outright dismissal or demotion are redressable if improperly motivated, <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 75-76, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990), but only if the employment action resulted in conditions \"unreasonably inferior\" to the norm for that position, <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 889 F.2d 1209, 1218-19 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The personnel decisions of which Rosario-Urdaz complains do not rise to this level. Gonzalez once had an altercation with Rosario-Urdaz; allegedly Gonzalez had thrown food at Rosario-Urdaz when the latter, then Gonzalez' supervisor, reprimanded Gonzalez for eating outside of the lunch hour. Gonzalez was reprimanded and transferred. Nor can one make a federal law suit out of Gonzalez' transfer back by Rosario-Morales several years later, whatever private motive Rosario-Morales may have had (Gonzalez was a PDP supporter) and even though this was distasteful to Rosario-Urdaz. <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1217.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosario-Urdaz says that the office in which she was operating was regarded by the new administration as a nest of NPP supporters; Rosario-Morales says in her deposition that the office had been performing poorly and that the decision to close the office and transfer employees elsewhere (some of whom were PDP members) was made for operational reasons which she described in her deposition. Whether or not political differences played some part in the decision to close the office and reassign employees, the fact remains that Rosario-Urdaz was reassigned to a position of the same rank and salary and has not shown \"unreasonably inferior\" conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only charge that gives us any pause is Rosario-Urdaz' brief statement that she lost duties after the new administration took over. In certain circumstances&#8212;say, utterly depriving an employee of work indefinitely for political reasons&#8212;this might make out a claim. <i>See Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1219-20. But Rosario-Urdaz' brief provides no detail whatsoever as to why her change of duties was so reprehensible or even what the change in duties entailed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Gonzalez and Agosto, they were not supervisors but co-workers. Unless they carried on a substantial campaign of harassment, instigated or knowingly tolerated by superiors, their acts would not constitute the mis-exercise of government power at which section 1983 is aimed. <i>Guzman v. City of Cranston,</i> 812 F.2d 24, 26 (1st Cir.1987); <i>see also Woodward v. City of Worland,</i> 977 F.2d 1392, 1400 (10th Cir.1992), <i>cert. denied,</i> 509 U.S. 923, 113 S.Ct. 3038, 125 L.Ed.2d 724 (1993). There is no evidence that what they did was either instigated or tolerated by Rivera-Hernandez, Rosario-Morales, or anyone else in authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez criticized Rosario-Urdaz in a letter to Rivera-Hernandez, implying that she was not cooperating with the new administration and saying that a restructuring was needed; the letter had strong political coloration but Gonzalez was entitled to her opinion, and this was not an adverse employment decision. As for Agosto, on one occasion he told Rosario-Urdaz that the prior administration was a bunch of crooks; for this he was reprimanded by Rivera-Hernandez, who wrote Agosto a letter \"emphatically reject[ing]\" this behavior and warning that it could not be repeated \"under any circumstances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A single insult by a co-worker with no supervisory power is not political discrimination by one exercising official authority. <i>Cf. Webber v. Int'l Paper Co.,</i> 417 F.3d 229, 236-37 (1st Cir.2005). Rosario-Urdaz says that the incidents must be considered as a whole and the joint action of the defendants comprised a \"witch hunt\" directed against her. Incidents can take color from, and cumulate with, other incidents, and conspiracy can sometimes be inferred from parallel or interrelated actions. Nothing in the disparate incidents before us suggests any such conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the cross-appeal by the DLHR secretary, objecting to the district court's bench-trial finding of a due process violation in Rosario-Urdaz' termination and the court's resultant reinstatement order. The reinstatement calls for official action, but the secretary does not challenge the district court's authority to order it. The secretary asserts only that there was no due process violation because Rosario-Urdaz was not properly appointed as a career employee and therefore never had a property interest in her job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that <i>if</i> Rosario-Urdaz was a career employee under Puerto Rico law, then she had a right in the present circumstances to a due process hearing from the state before termination. <i>Cf. Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 841 F.2d 1169, 1173 (1st Cir.1988). The parties also assume that under Puerto Rico law, a serious flaw in the process of Rosario-Urdaz' original appointment, however many years earlier, permits the secretary to discharge her summarily. Finally, they assume that if the flaw is established in the federal court proceeding, this nullifies the appointment both under state law and for purposes of due process protection, although the secretary concedes that the burden is upon the secretary to show the nullifying flaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this is a good way to operate a civil service system or to frame federal due process protections might be debated. However, the Supreme Court, <i>e.g., Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 2803, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005), makes the issue whether there is a protectible property right turn on state law, and the parties' view of Puerto Rico law is supported by precedent. <i>Col&#243;n-P&#233;rez v. Mayor of the Municipality of Ceiba,</i> 112 P.R. Dec. 740, 12 P.R. Offic. Trans. 934, 940 (P.R.1982) (flawed appointment \"void\" under Puerto Rico law); <i>Kauffman,</i> 841 F.2d at 1173 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the bench trial on reinstatement, Rosario-Urdaz' counsel presented evidence of her appointment to a career position and her termination from this position without a hearing, and counsel then rested Rosario-Urdaz' case in chief. The DLHR then presented Rosario-Urdaz' personnel file and one witness, Gladys Rivera, who described the audit of Rosario-Urdaz' appointment which underpinned the discharge. The first reason offered for finding the original appointment void was Rosario-Urdaz' alleged lack of the required experience to qualify for the appointment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence is that the position of Information Representative requires a bachelor's degree and \"one year of experience in functions of similar nature and complexity to those carried out by a Writer of Information\"&#8212;a term that the parties treat as equivalent to Information Representative. Rosario-Urdaz had the degree; as to the required experience, Rosario-Urdaz' personnel file contained a verification that she met the requirement because she had \"two (2) years and four (4) months of experience in functions of a nature and complexity similar to those held by an Information Writer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gladys Rivera asserted that the verification was not supported by anything in the file and that an \"equivalency study\" revealed that Rosario-Urdaz' prior position overlapped in some respects with the position of Information Representative but that overlap was not enough to establish equivalency. It followed (Gladys Rivera argued) that lacking equivalency, Rosario-Urdaz did not have the specified experience for her career position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surprisingly, Gladys Rivera also testified at the bench trial that she had never examined the requirements or duties of an Information Writer. This, from the district court's point of view, undermined her testimony as to Rosario-Urdaz' lack of equivalent experience and also contradicted, at least implicitly, the letter that Gladys Rivera had drafted for Rivera-Hernandez explaining why Rosario-Urdaz was being terminated. The district court's refusal to credit Gladys Rivera's opinion as sufficient to establish Rosario-Urdaz' lack of the experience qualifications was within its discretion. <i>EIMSKIP v. Atl. Fish Mkt., Inc.,</i> 417 F.3d 72, 76 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The termination letter and Gladys Rivera's testimony gave an alternative ground for treating the appointment as a nullity, namely, the inference that Rosario-Urdaz short-circuited the requisite merit process to receive the position. The inference rested on the facts that in 1995 the DLHR had begun the process of determining Rosario-Urdaz' qualifications a month before the job announcement was publicly posted and that Rosario-Urdaz resigned from her former position three days <i>before</i> she was to be interviewed for the Information Representative position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not discuss this alternative ground, but the inference is not very compelling and the district court was not obliged to accept it. The timing of the equivalency study could indicate that Rosario-Urdaz anticipated applying for a job she expected to become available; her early resignation could have reflected confidence that she would succeed in her application. Just what happened is quite obscure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DLHR accepted that it had the burden of proof to show that a decade-old appointment, valid on its face, was instead a nullity. Conceivably, Rosario-Urdaz might have shed light on the matter; but the defense deposed her and apparently adduced nothing to support its position. Had it given Rosario-Urdaz a pre-termination hearing, the DLHR's own fact-finding might have resolved the issue; as it is, the matter was left to the district judge to resolve and we cannot say that his decision was wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we <i>affirm</i> both the dismissal of Rosario-Urdaz' damage claims for political discrimination and the grant of injunctive relief restoring her to her career position.

In 1996, Dorcas Rosario-Urdaz (\"Rosario-Urdaz\") began work as an employee with the rank of Employee I in the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources (\"DLHR\"). She earned career status as an Information Representative and was rather quickly promoted to a \"trust\" (<i>i.e.,</i> political) position in 1997. At that time, the governorship was held by the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") with which Rosario-Urdaz is associated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2000, a new governor was elected representing the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"). As permitted by Puerto Rico law, 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1350(8)(a) (2000), Rosario-Urdaz then exercised her option to resume her earlier status as a career employee effective December 29, 2000, shortly before the new administration took power in January 2001. When the new governor took office, she appointed, as Secretary of the DLHR, Victor Rivera-Hernandez, who was later succeeded by Roman Velazco. In the new administration, Carmen Rosario-Morales was Assistant Secretary for Human Resources; she was later replaced by Gladys Rivera.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Rosario-Urdaz, she was made a target of harassment after the new PDP administration came to power. She said that her duties were reduced and given at least in part to a former subordinate, Maira Gonzalez, a member of the PDP; that she was harassed by Gonzalez and by another co-worker, Angel Agosto; and that her entire office was abolished in October 2001. Although Rosario-Urdaz was initially given an equivalent job in another part of the DLHR, she was discharged in March 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The discharge, which is a central issue in the present appeal, occurred after an audit in 2001 studied transfers within the department that had occurred during a so-called freeze period surrounding the 2000 election. The audit was conducted under the supervision of Gladys Rivera and it concluded, as to Rosario-Urdaz, that there were irregularities in her original 1996 appointment to the career position of Information Representative that rendered the appointment a nullity. Gladys Rivera's report led to Rosario-Urdaz' discharge by Rivera-Hernandez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the discharge, Rosario-Urdaz brought the present suit in April 2002. Along with claims under Puerto Rico law, the complaint asserted a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (2000), based on two different theories: first, that the alleged harassment and the discharge were politically motivated in violation of Rosario-Urdaz' first amendment rights, and second, that her discharge without a prior hearing violated fifth amendment due process rights, given that her career position is a protected property right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants named in the suit were Rivera-Hernandez, Rosario-Morales, Gonzalez and Agosto; Velazco, who succeeded Rivera-Hernandez as secretary of the DLHR, was later added for purposes of reinstatement relief. Gladys Rivera was not named as a defendant. Rosario-Urdaz sought huge damages against all four in their personal capacity (official-capacity damage claims were made but are barred) and reinstatement as Information Representative. She requested a preliminary injunction to restore her to her position <i>pendente lite;</i> this was denied by the district court but this court vacated and remanded the matter for further proceedings. <i>Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200743\"><a href=\"/opinion/200743/rosario-urdaz-v-rivera-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2004, the district court granted pending motions to dismiss the personal capacity damage claims against all defendants based on qualified immunity. On June 21, 2004, the court held a bench trial on the request for reinstatement, which it granted on the ground that termination without a prior hearing was impermissible because the department had not shown that Rosario-Urdaz' career appointment was void. In August 2004, the district court issued a final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cross appeals followed: Rosario-Urdaz to contest the dismissal of her damage claims and the secretary to contest her reinstatement. On the former, resolved on summary judgment, our review is plenary, <i>Carmona v. Toledo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198967\"><a href=\"/opinion/198967/carmona-v-toledo/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 131 (1st Cir.2000); on the latter, which followed a bench trial, fact-findings are reviewed for clear error and legal determinations <i>de novo</i> save that some deference may be shown to rulings that effectively apply abstract rules to specific events. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); 9A Wright &amp; Miller, <i>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil 2d</i> &#167; 2588 at 600-08 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Rosario-Urdaz' damage claims against the defendants, which the district court dismissed based on qualified immunity. The underlying substantive law protects government employees from adverse action or harassment against them motivated by hostility to their political views or affiliation. <i>Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198926\"><a href=\"/opinion/198926/padilla-garcia-v-guillermo-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2000). Defendants did not assert that Rosario-Urdaz held a position for which her political opinions could be treated as pertinent; instead, they denied any violation and, in the alternative, said that qualified immunity protected them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We may affirm the district court's dismissal if the claims fail on their merits at the summary judgment stage or if, on this record, qualified immunity has been made out. Indeed, the two inquiries now overlap in part due to the Supreme Court's direction in <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span>, 201, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span> (2001), that qualified immunity determinations begin with an inquiry into whether the right asserted exists at all in relation to the facts. The individual defendants are charged with distinct acts performed by each and, in addition, with a joint and general effort to drive Rosario-Urdaz from her post.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosario-Urdaz was deprived of her position by a single act&#8212;Rivera-Hernandez' decision to terminate her employment on the professed ground that her original career appointment as Information Representative was flawed in its inception. Rosario-Urdaz asserts that Rivera-Hernandez was wrongfully motivated by her party affiliation; if so, he would presumptively be liable, <i>Padilla-Garcia,</i> 212 F.3d at 74&#8212;subject to qualified immunity or other possible defenses, <i>see, e.g., Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span> (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidence that Rivera-Hernandez' action was politically motivated. He received a report, resulting from Gladys Rivera's audit, colorably asserting that Rosario-Urdaz was holding a career position to which she was not entitled. He has denied a political motive; in his deposition, he identified others who were terminated as a result of the audit. Rosario-Urdaz has pointed to nothing to show political motivation on Rivera-Hernandez' part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If anything, Rosario-Urdaz' brief on this issue tends more to undercut her position than to support it. In a short mustering of \"evidence\" against Rivera-Hernandez, the brief says he \"admitted\" considering Rosario-Urdaz' party membership; so he did, saying that it made him hesitate (<i>i.e.,</i> in her favor) when confronted with the recommendation against her. The brief also conjures up an imaginary conflict between Rivera-Hernandez' statements that he questioned Gladys Rivera actively as to the recommendation and his eventual reliance on the audit recommendation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are four charges against Rosario-Morales: that she deprived Rosario-Urdaz of prior duties, assigned Gonzalez to the same office with some of those duties, transferred all of the personnel of Rosario-Urdaz' then-existing office incident to its closing, and ordered an <i>earlier</i> audit of personnel transactions occurring in August 2000&#8212;just before the pre-election freeze became effective. The earlier audit had no effect on Rosario-Urdaz;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the other three charges pose the only issue of general importance in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosario-Urdaz does not claim that Rosario-Morales is responsible for her termination; this occurred as a result of actions taken by Gladys Rivera and Rivera-Hernandez <i>after</i> Rosario-Morales left the department at the end of 2001. Instead, the three incidents involve reassignments of duties and of personnel to different offices. None of these changes resulted in Rosario-Urdaz' discharge or reduction in salary. Two of them, perhaps all three depending on what duties Rosario-Urdaz retained, are commonplace personnel decisions likely to be shielded by qualified immunity <i>if</i> objective reasonableness overcomes imputed motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the rub. Traditionally&#8212;search and seizure is the best example&#8212;the Supreme Court has said that private motive is irrelevant if the defendant had objective probable cause or, for qualified immunity purposes, a reasonable officer might have so believed, even if wrongly. <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 818-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span> (1982). By contrast, in cases involving first amendment rights, some of our decisions have left open the possibility that an objectively reasonable action could still be denied qualified immunity if improperly motivated. <i>See Mihos v.

Gonzalez once had an altercation with Rosario-Urdaz; allegedly Gonzalez had thrown food at Rosario-Urdaz when the latter, then Gonzalez' supervisor, reprimanded Gonzalez for eating outside of the lunch hour. Gonzalez was reprimanded and transferred. Nor can one make a federal law suit out of Gonzalez' transfer back by Rosario-Morales several years later, whatever private motive Rosario-Morales may have had (Gonzalez was a PDP supporter) and even though this was distasteful to Rosario-Urdaz. <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1217.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosario-Urdaz says that the office in which she was operating was regarded by the new administration as a nest of NPP supporters; Rosario-Morales says in her deposition that the office had been performing poorly and that the decision to close the office and transfer employees elsewhere (some of whom were PDP members) was made for operational reasons which she described in her deposition. Whether or not political differences played some part in the decision to close the office and reassign employees, the fact remains that Rosario-Urdaz was reassigned to a position of the same rank and salary and has not shown \"unreasonably inferior\" conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only charge that gives us any pause is Rosario-Urdaz' brief statement that she lost duties after the new administration took over.

As for Agosto, on one occasion he told Rosario-Urdaz that the prior administration was a bunch of crooks; for this he was reprimanded by Rivera-Hernandez, who wrote Agosto a letter \"emphatically reject[ing]\" this behavior and warning that it could not be repeated \"under any circumstances.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A single insult by a co-worker with no supervisory power is not political discrimination by one exercising official authority. <i>Cf. Webber v. Int'l Paper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201753\"><a href=\"/opinion/201753/webber-v-international-paper/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 236-37 (1st Cir.2005). Rosario-Urdaz says that the incidents must be considered as a whole and the joint action of the defendants comprised a \"witch hunt\" directed against her. Incidents can take color from, and cumulate with, other incidents, and conspiracy can sometimes be inferred from parallel or interrelated actions. Nothing in the disparate incidents before us suggests any such conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the cross-appeal by the DLHR secretary, objecting to the district court's bench-trial finding of a due process violation in Rosario-Urdaz' termination and the court's resultant reinstatement order. The reinstatement calls for official action, but the secretary does not challenge the district court's authority to order it. The secretary asserts only that there was no due process violation because Rosario-Urdaz was not properly appointed as a career employee and therefore never had a property interest in her job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that <i>if</i> Rosario-Urdaz was a career employee under Puerto Rico law, then she had a right in the present circumstances to a due process hearing from the state before termination. <i>Cf. Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503066\"><a href=\"/opinion/503066/bessie-a-kauffman-v-puerto-rico-telephone-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span>, 1173 (1st Cir.1988). The parties also assume that under Puerto Rico law, a serious flaw in the process of Rosario-Urdaz' original appointment, however many years earlier, permits the secretary to discharge her summarily. Finally, they assume that if the flaw is established in the federal court proceeding, this nullifies the appointment both under state law and for purposes of due process protection, although the secretary concedes that the burden is upon the secretary to show the nullifying flaw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether this is a good way to operate a civil service system or to frame federal due process protections might be debated. However, the Supreme Court, <i>e.g., Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799991\"><a href=\"/opinion/799991/castle-rock-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span> (2005), makes the issue whether there is a protectible property right turn on state law, and the parties' view of Puerto Rico law is supported by precedent. <i>Col&#243;n-P&#233;rez v. Mayor of the Municipality of Ceiba,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.

Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></span>, 940 (P.R.1982) (flawed appointment \"void\" under Puerto Rico law); <i>Kauffman,</i> 841 F.2d at 1173 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the bench trial on reinstatement, Rosario-Urdaz' counsel presented evidence of her appointment to a career position and her termination from this position without a hearing, and counsel then rested Rosario-Urdaz' case in chief. The DLHR then presented Rosario-Urdaz' personnel file and one witness, Gladys Rivera, who described the audit of Rosario-Urdaz' appointment which underpinned the discharge. The first reason offered for finding the original appointment void was Rosario-Urdaz' alleged lack of the required experience to qualify for the appointment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence is that the position of Information Representative requires a bachelor's degree and \"one year of experience in functions of similar nature and complexity to those carried out by a Writer of Information\"&#8212;a term that the parties treat as equivalent to Information Representative. Rosario-Urdaz had the degree; as to the required experience, Rosario-Urdaz' personnel file contained a verification that she met the requirement because she had \"two (2) years and four (4) months of experience in functions of a nature and complexity similar to those held by an Information Writer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gladys Rivera asserted that the verification was not supported by anything in the file and that an \"equivalency study\" revealed that Rosario-Urdaz' prior position overlapped in some respects with the position of Information Representative but that overlap was not enough to establish equivalency. It followed (Gladys Rivera argued) that lacking equivalency, Rosario-Urdaz did not have the specified experience for her career position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surprisingly, Gladys Rivera also testified at the bench trial that she had never examined the requirements or duties of an Information Writer. This, from the district court's point of view, undermined her testimony as to Rosario-Urdaz' lack of equivalent experience and also contradicted, at least implicitly, the letter that Gladys Rivera had drafted for Rivera-Hernandez explaining why Rosario-Urdaz was being terminated. The district court's refusal to credit Gladys Rivera's opinion as sufficient to establish Rosario-Urdaz' lack of the experience qualifications was within its discretion. <i>EIMSKIP v. Atl. Fish Mkt., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The termination letter and Gladys Rivera's testimony gave an alternative ground for treating the appointment as a nullity, namely, the inference that Rosario-Urdaz short-circuited the requisite merit process to receive the position. The inference rested on the facts that in 1995 the DLHR had begun the process of determining Rosario-Urdaz' qualifications a month before the job announcement was publicly posted and that Rosario-Urdaz resigned from her former position three days <i>before</i> she was to be interviewed for the Information Representative position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not discuss this alternative ground, but the inference is not very compelling and the district court was not obliged to accept it. The timing of the equivalency study could indicate that Rosario-Urdaz anticipated applying for a job she expected to become available; her early resignation could have reflected confidence that she would succeed in her application. Just what happened is quite obscure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DLHR accepted that it had the burden of proof to show that a decade-old appointment, valid on its face, was instead a nullity. Conceivably, Rosario-Urdaz might have shed light on the matter; but the defense deposed her and apparently adduced nothing to support its position. Had it given Rosario-Urdaz a pre-termination hearing, the DLHR's own fact-finding might have resolved the issue; as it is, the matter was left to the district judge to resolve and we cannot say that his decision was wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we <i>affirm</i> both the dismissal of Rosario-Urdaz' damage claims for political discrimination and the grant of injunctive relief restoring her to her career position. Each side shall bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rosario-Urdaz was apparently transferred back to career status during the freeze period itself&#8212;how is unexplained&#8212;and the audit in question is not the one later conducted by Gladys Rivera that led to Rosario-Urdaz' ultimate termination for reasons having nothing to do with the freeze</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> These cases note, without resolving, the tension between specific-intent constitutional violations and the requirement that qualified immunity be decided on a purely objective basis<i>Tang</i> expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would shed light on this question, 120 F.3d at 328; in the event, it did not. <i>See Crawford-El v.
