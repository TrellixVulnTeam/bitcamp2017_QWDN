After our decision in this case,\n\nNLRB v. Pan American Grain Co., 432 F.3d 69 (1st Cir. 2005), a\n\ncontroversy developed between the parties concerning the scope and\n\nphrasing of the order to be issued to enforce those portions of the\n\nNational Labor Relations Board's original order that we did not\n\nvacate on review.    The controversy is a narrow but important one.\n\n            The   original    dispute    in    this   petition   for   review\n\nconcerned the scope of obligations owed by the employer, Pan\n\nAmerican Grain Company, Inc. (\"Pan American\"), in relation to 15\n\nemployees who were laid off in February 2002 while they were on\n\nstrike.   Pan American, 432 F.3d at 70-71.        The Board found that Pan\n\nAmerican had a duty to bargain with the Union over the decision to\n\nlay these 15 employees off and, as Pan American concededly did not\n\nfulfill this duty, the Board ordered Pan American to reinstate\n\nthese employees to their former positions and to provide them full\n\nback pay--its customary remedy in cases where an employer has a\n\nduty to bargain over an employment termination decision but fails\n\nto do so.    Id. at 71, 73.\n\n            For its part, Pan American argued that its decision to\n\nlay off the employees was not the sort of decision covered by the\n\nmandatory bargaining requirements of the National Labor Relations\n\nAct.   Pan American, 432 F.3d at 71.          Pan American has conceded it\n\nhad a duty to bargain with the employees over the effects of the\n\nlayoff, but argued that the proper remedy for its failure to do so\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fwas to award the employees limited back pay (and no reinstatement)\n\nunder   the    Board's     rule    in   Transmarine   Navigation   Corp.,   170\n\nN.L.R.B. 389 (1968).        Pan American, 432 F.3d at 71.\n\n              On the record before us, we held that the Board had not\n\nsufficiently explained its decision that Pan American had a duty to\n\nbargain over the layoff decision itself as opposed to only the\n\neffects.      Id. at 74.    In concluding our decision, we vacated those\n\nportions of the Board's order that imposed obligations on Pan\n\nAmerican with respect to the 15 employees, remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with our opinion, and granted enforcement of\n\nthe remaining, uncontested portions of the order pursuant to E.C.\n\nWaste, Inc. v. NLRB, 359 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 2004).                       Pan\n\nAmerican, 432 F.3d at 71 n.2, 74-75.\n\n              Our original decision issued on December 22, 2005.             On\n\nFebruary 6, 2006, the Board filed a motion under Fed. R. App. P. 19\n\nsubmitting a proposed judgment that the Board stated conformed to\n\nour December opinion.        In that motion, the Board asked this court\n\nto vacate our December judgment and substitute the Board's proposed\n\njudgment in its place.            On March 21, 2006, this court issued an\n\norder explaining that parts of the Board's suggested substitute\n\njudgment appeared to be inconsistent with our disposition of the\n\ncase, and we gave the Board 14 days to respond to our concerns and\n\nPan American then 14 days to reply.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f          The   Board   then   filed    a   second   proposed   substitute\n\njudgment, on April 4, 2006, and Pan American filed a reply opposing\n\nthis latest proposed substitute judgment.        The controversy in this\n\nlatest round of filings concerns what obligations, if any, Pan\n\nAmerican has towards the 15 employees laid off in February 2002\n\nindependent of and prior to the resolution on remand of the \"duty\n\nto bargain\" issue.\n\n          Specifically, the Board asserts that Pan American is\n\nrequired to provide these same 15 employees \"with reinstatement to\n\ntheir previous positions, or substantially equivalent positions,\n\nthat have or will become available subsequent to the unconditional\n\noffer to return to work\" made by the employees in August 2002, and\n\nmust further \"[m]ake the former strikers whole for any loss of\n\nearnings and/or other benefits that they suffered as a result of\n\nthe discriminatory reduction in their wages and their denial of\n\nreinstatement\" as positions became available.\n\n          The Board's claim turns upon a set of issues that were\n\nnever presented, or at least never clearly discussed, by either\n\nside on the original petition for review. The pertinent background\n\nfacts are that after abolishing their positions in February 2002,\n\nPan American voluntarily rehired the same 15 employees in October\n\nand November 2002, although into different positions than they held\n\nprior to their strike and at entry-level wages.         The company also\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\frehired 25 or 26 other employees who had been on strike and whose\n\npositions had never been abolished.\n\n           Then, in the administrative proceeding that led to the\n\noriginal petition for review, the Board (in addition to ruling on\n\nthe \"duty to bargain\" issue as to the 15 employees) found that Pan\n\nAmerican had unlawfully reduced the wages of former strikers who\n\nreturned to work after the strike, and had unlawfully denied these\n\nformer   strikers   reinstatement    to   their   former   positions,   or\n\nsubstantially   equivalent   positions,     as    they   became   available\n\nsubsequent to the strikers' unconditional offer to return to work.\n\nThis, the Board said, contravened its rule in Laidlaw Corp., 171\n\nN.L.R.B. 1366, 1369-70 (1968), enforced, 414 F.2d 99 (7th Cir.\n\n1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 920 (1970):\n\n           [E]conomic strikers who unconditionally apply\n           for reinstatement at a time when their\n           positions     are   filled     by    permanent\n           replacements: (1) remain employees; and (2)\n           are entitled to full reinstatement upon the\n           departure of replacements unless they have in\n           the     meantime   acquired     regular    and\n           substantially equivalent employment, or the\n           employer can sustain his burden of proof that\n           the failure to offer full reinstatement was\n           for   legitimate  and   substantial   business\n           reasons.\n\n           Pan American has not disputed the application of the\n\nLaidlaw rule to the other 25 or 26 strikers whose positions were\n\nfilled by replacement workers rather than permanently eliminated.\n\nWhat is at issue is whether the 15 employees laid off in February\n\n2002 were covered, or in any event could properly be covered, by\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe Board's Laidlaw holding.      Pan American points to findings of\n\nthe administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") that suggest that those 15\n\nemployees' positions were not filled by permanent replacements but\n\nwere permanently eliminated.   Pan American Grain Co., 343 N.L.R.B.\n\nNo. 47, at 18-19 (2004).\n\n          The Board insists that regardless of whether these 15\n\nemployees were entitled to bargain over their layoffs, they are\n\nentitled to the Laidlaw relief \"because they participated in the\n\nstrike to the same extent as other employees, were included in the\n\nUnion's unconditional offer to return to work, and were reinstated\n\nby the Company under the same discriminatory terms and conditions\n\nof employment as other former strikers.\"      Pan American responds\n\nthat providing the 15 laid-off employees with Laidlaw relief would\n\ncause this court's decision to remand to \"lose any practical\n\neffect\" by giving the employees quite similar relief regardless of\n\nthe outcome on remand.\n\n          Each side has something to be said in its favor.    In the\n\nALJ's original order, approved largely intact by the Board, the ALJ\n\ndid suggest (in a footnote) that the Laidlaw remedy was to apply to\n\nall the strikers who had been rehired, including the 15 who had\n\nbeen laid off in February 2002.    Pan American, 343 N.L.R.B. No. 47,\n\nat 26 n.53.   But there was no explanation as to why and how the\n\nBoard could apply the Laidlaw doctrine, targeted at economic\n\nstrikers who are permanently replaced, to people whose jobs were\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fproperly abolished (if that is what happened in this case).   And,\n\nperhaps only by happenstance, the Board on appeal took out the\n\nALJ's footnote clarifying that the Laidlaw remedy applied to all\n\nstrikers, including the 15 laid off in February 2002, rather than\n\njust to those 25 or 26 strikers whose positions Pan American did\n\nnot claim to have eliminated.\n\n          Nowhere in the Board's arguments to this court did the\n\nBoard say squarely that most of what was being argued on this\n\npetition for review as to the 15 employees was moot because of the\n\nBoard's alternative Laidlaw theory. Yet, to the extent the Board's\n\noriginal order is properly read as applying the Laidlaw theory to\n\nthe 15 strikers, perhaps Pan American was obliged to attack this\n\nalternative theory on the original petition for review.   In turn,\n\nPan American can argue with some basis in the record that the Board\n\nitself never clearly told the court prior to our decision that it\n\nso read its own order.\n\n          Our present understanding of the entire Laidlaw matter is\n\npieced together from comments made in the Board's latest filing and\n\nin Pan American's reply.   The controversy was not briefed on the\n\noriginal petition for review and was never decided by us.     Nor,\n\nbased on the fragments of argument presented post-decision, are we\n\nnow in a position to decide those issues.     Accordingly, we are\n\nunwilling at this time to enforce the Board's proposed substitute\n\norder on the Laidlaw theory as to these 15 strikers.\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f            At the same time, we conclude that the Board should be\n\nfree in the remanded proceeding expressly to order Laidlaw relief\n\nfor the 15 employees if it views that as appropriate and consistent\n\nwith its prior intentions.      Assuming the Board does so and that the\n\nissue is not mooted by the Board's \"duty to bargain\" determinations\n\non remand, the Laidlaw relief including any objections to it that\n\nPan American chooses to make will be available for appellate\n\nconsideration on future appellate review directed to whatever order\n\nis entered in the remanded proceeding.      We express no view on this\n\nor any other issue that may be considered by the Board on remand.\n\n            The Board's motion to vacate our December 2005 judgment\n\nand substitute its own version is denied without prejudice to the\n\nBoard's ability to determine in the remanded proceeding that the\n\nLaidlaw remedy should apply to the 15 laid-off employees.       Review\n\nof any new order entered on remand may be sought in the usual\n\ncourse.    But, as review would effectively be a continuation of the\n\npresent case, our Clerk's Office should assign any new review\n\npetition pertaining to the remanded proceeding to the present\n\npanel.    We vacate our original judgment and reenter it as of today\n\nso that each side has an opportunity to seek rehearing and/or\n\nrehearing en banc from that judgment as reaffirmed and clarified by\n\ntoday's decision.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

Pan American Grain Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></span> (1st Cir.2005), a controversy developed between the parties concerning the scope and phrasing of the order to be issued to enforce those portions of the National Labor Relations Board's original order that we did not vacate on review. The controversy is a narrow but important one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original dispute in this petition for review concerned the scope of obligations owed by the employer, Pan American Grain Company, Inc. (\"Pan American\"), in relation to 15 employees who were laid off in February 2002 while they were on strike. <i>Pan American,</i> 432 F.3d at 70-71. The Board found that Pan American had a duty to bargain with the Union over the decision to lay these 15 employees off and, as Pan American concededly did not fulfill this duty, the Board ordered Pan American to reinstate these employees to their former positions and to provide them full back pay&#8212;its customary remedy in cases where an employer has a duty to bargain over an employment termination decision but fails to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 71, 73.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For its part, Pan American argued that its decision to lay off the employees was not the sort of decision covered by the mandatory bargaining requirements of the National Labor Relations Act. <i>Pan American,</i> 432 F.3d at 71. Pan American has conceded it had a duty to bargain with the employees over the <i>effects</i> of the layoff, but argued that the proper remedy for its failure to do so was to award the employees <i>limited</i> back pay (and no reinstatement) under the Board's rule in <i>Transmarine Navigation Corp.,</i> 170 N.L.R.B. 389 (1968). <i>Pan American,</i> 432 F.3d at 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the record before us, we held that the Board had not sufficiently explained its decision that Pan American had a duty to bargain over the layoff decision itself as opposed to only the effects. <i>Id.</i> at 74. In concluding our decision, we vacated those portions of the Board's order that imposed obligations on Pan American with respect to the 15 employees, remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion, and granted enforcement of the remaining, uncontested portions of the order pursuant to <i>E.C. Waste, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200878\"><a href=\"/opinion/200878/ec-waste-inc-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.2004). <i>Pan American,</i> 432 F.3d at 71 n. 2, 74-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our original decision issued on December 22, 2005. On February 6, 2006, the Board filed a motion under Fed. R.App. P. 19 submitting a proposed judgment that the Board stated conformed to our December opinion. In that motion, the Board asked this court to vacate our December judgment and substitute the Board's proposed judgment in its place. On March 21, 2006, this court issued an order explaining that parts of the Board's suggested substitute judgment appeared to be inconsistent with our disposition of the case, and we gave the Board 14 days to respond to our concerns and Pan American then 14 days to reply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board then filed a second proposed substitute judgment, on April 4, 2006, and Pan American filed a reply opposing this latest proposed substitute judgment. The controversy in this latest round of filings concerns what obligations, if any, Pan American has towards the 15 employees laid off in February 2002 <i>independent of and prior to</i> the resolution on remand of the \"duty to bargain\" issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, the Board asserts that Pan American is required to provide these same 15 employees \"with reinstatement to their previous positions, or substantially equivalent positions, that have or will become available subsequent to the unconditional offer to return to work\" made by the employees in August 2002, and must further \"[m]ake the former strikers whole for any loss of earnings and/or other benefits that they suffered as a result of the discriminatory reduction in their wages and their denial of reinstatement\" as positions became available.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's claim turns upon a set of issues that were never presented, or at least never clearly discussed, by either side on the original petition for review. The pertinent background facts are that after abolishing their positions in February 2002, Pan American voluntarily rehired the same 15 employees in October and November 2002, although into different positions than they held prior to their strike and at entry-level wages. The company also rehired 25 or 26 other employees who had been on strike and whose positions had never been abolished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, in the administrative proceeding that led to the original petition for review, the Board (in addition to ruling on the \"duty to bargain\" issue as to the 15 employees) found that Pan American had unlawfully reduced the wages of former strikers who returned to work after the strike, and had unlawfully denied these former strikers reinstatement to their former positions, or substantially equivalent positions, as they became available subsequent to the strikers' unconditional offer to return to work. This, the Board said, contravened its rule in <i>Laidlaw Corp.,</i> 171 N.L.R.B. 1366, 1369-70 (1968), <i>enforced,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"285917\"><a href=\"/opinion/285917/the-laidlaw-corporation-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1969), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></span> (1970):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[E]conomic strikers who unconditionally apply for reinstatement at a time when their positions are filled by permanent replacements: (1) remain employees; and (2) are entitled to full reinstatement upon the departure of replacements unless they have in the meantime acquired regular and substantially equivalent employment, or the employer can sustain his burden of proof that the failure to offer full reinstatement was for legitimate and substantial business reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pan American has not disputed the application of the <i>Laidlaw</i> rule to the other 25 or 26 strikers whose positions were filled by replacement workers rather than permanently eliminated. What is at issue is whether the 15 employees laid off in February 2002 were covered, or in any event could properly be covered, by the Board's <i>Laidlaw</i> holding. Pan American points to findings of the administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") that suggest that those 15 employees' positions were not filled by permanent replacements but were permanently eliminated. <i>PAN AMERICAN GRAIN CO.,</i> 343 N.L.R.B. No. 47, at 18-19, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2418787</span></span> (2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board insists that regardless of whether these 15 employees were entitled to bargain over their layoffs, they are entitled to the <i>Laidlaw</i> relief \"because they participated in the strike to the same extent as other employees, were included in the Union's unconditional offer to return to work, and were reinstated by the Company under the same discriminatory terms and conditions of employment as other former strikers.\" Pan American responds that providing the 15 laid-off employees with <i>Laidlaw</i> relief would cause this court's decision to remand to \"lose any practical effect\" by giving the employees quite similar relief regardless of the outcome on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each side has something to be said in its favor. In the ALJ's original order, approved largely intact by the Board, the ALJ did suggest (in a footnote) that the <i>Laidlaw</i> remedy was to apply to <i>all</i> the strikers who had been rehired, including the 15 who had been laid off in February 2002. <i>PAN AMERICAN,</i> 343 N.L.R.B. No. 47, at 26 n. 53, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2418787</span></span>. But there was no explanation as to why and how the Board could apply the <i>Laidlaw</i> doctrine, targeted at economic strikers who are permanently replaced, to people whose jobs were properly abolished (if that is what happened in this case). And, perhaps only by happenstance, the Board on appeal took out the ALJ's footnote clarifying that the <i>Laidlaw</i> remedy applied to all strikers, including the 15 laid off in February 2002, rather than just to those 25 or 26 strikers whose positions Pan American did not claim to have eliminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nowhere in the Board's arguments to this court did the Board say squarely that most of what was being argued on this petition for review as to the 15 employees was moot because of the Board's alternative <i>Laidlaw</i> theory. Yet, to the extent the Board's original order is properly read as applying the <i>Laidlaw</i> theory to the 15 strikers, perhaps Pan American was obliged to attack this alternative theory on the original petition for review. In turn, Pan American can argue with some basis in the record that the Board itself never clearly told the court prior to our decision that it so read its own order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our present understanding of the entire <i>Laidlaw</i> matter is pieced together from comments made in the Board's latest filing and in Pan American's reply. The controversy was not briefed on the original petition for review and was never decided by us. Nor, based on the fragments of argument presented post-decision, are we now in a position to decide those issues. Accordingly, we are unwilling at this time to enforce the Board's proposed substitute order on the <i>Laidlaw</i> theory as to these 15 strikers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, we conclude that the Board should be free in the remanded proceeding expressly to order <i>Laidlaw</i> relief for the 15 employees if it views that as appropriate and consistent with its prior intentions. Assuming the Board does so and that the issue is not mooted by the Board's \"duty to bargain\" determinations on remand, the <i>Laidlaw</i> relief including any objections to it that Pan American chooses to make will be available for appellate consideration on future appellate review directed to whatever order is entered in the remanded proceeding. We express no view on this or any other issue that may be considered by the Board on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's motion to vacate our December 2005 judgment and substitute its own version is <i>denied</i> without prejudice to the Board's ability to determine in the remanded proceeding that the <i>Laidlaw</i> remedy should apply to the 15 laid-off employees.
