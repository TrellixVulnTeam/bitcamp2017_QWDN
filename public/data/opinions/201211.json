Perez, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nCivil Division, Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil\nDivision, and Linda S.

Petitioner    Mohammed   Mozammel\n\nHossain is a native and citizen of Bangladesh who attempted to\n\nenter the United States through Newark airport on October 9, 1991.\n\nExclusion proceedings were brought against him on that date, and he\n\nin turn sought asylum and withholding of deportation. After a long\n\nseries   of    hearings,   both    forms    of   relief   were   denied   by   an\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) on May 8, 1998.\n\n              Hossain filed a timely appeal from these decisions with\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) on June 5, 1998, and his\n\nattorney requested an opportunity to file a brief on his behalf.\n\nThe BIA mailed the briefing schedule to the wrong address, and\n\nHossain's counsel says as a result he never filed such a brief.\n\nThe BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion on January 17,\n\n2003, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.1(e)(4), although it had no brief\n\nfrom Hossain. Hossain never petitioned for review of that decision\n\nto this court. Instead, he filed a motion for reconsideration with\n\nthe BIA on the ground that he was never given a proper opportunity\n\nto have his case briefed, and seeking leave to file the brief.\n\nThis motion was denied by the BIA on October 24, 2003; Hossain now\n\npetitions for review of that denial in this court.               We vacate the\n\nBIA's denial of the motion for reconsideration and remand to the\n\nBIA.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                 I.\n\n            Hossain's hearings before the IJ began in 1991; a final\n\ndecision was rendered only in 1998. Hossain's claim was based on\n\npast persecution, including arrests and torture, that he claimed to\n\nhave suffered as a member of the student wing of an opposition\n\npolitical party in Bangladesh.   Hossain further claimed that there\n\nwas an outstanding warrant for his arrest on charges that he\n\nstabbed a fellow student during a riot in May 1991; he claimed that\n\nthe stabbing was in self-defense but that he would not receive a\n\nfair trial, and would be likely to face violent extra-judicial\n\nretaliation, because of political persecution.         The IJ denied\n\nHossain's applications for asylum and withholding of deportation,\n\nemphasizing   Hossain's   \"inconsistent   testimony\"   and   inadequate\n\ndocumentation for his claims.\n\n            Hossain's notice of appeal to the BIA listed sixteen\n\ngrounds for overturning the IJ's opinion, all of which were fairly\n\nbroad and unspecific.     As noted in Hossain's notice of appeal to\n\nthe BIA, a copy of the voluminous transcript of the many hearings\n\nheld by the IJ had not yet been prepared for Hossain and his\n\ncounsel, and Hossain \"demand[ed] the right to file a brief\" in\n\norder to \"identify specific factual and legal issues\" involved in\n\nthe case.\n\n            On the required Entry of Appearance as Attorney or\n\nRepresentative form sent to the BIA along with the Notice of\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fAppeal, Hossain's attorney, John Traficonte, listed as his complete\n\naddress:\n\n            Cabot Corporation\n            75 State Street\n            Boston, MA 02109\n\nOn January 25, 1999, the BIA sent a briefing schedule, along with\n\na transcript of the IJ's hearings, to the following address, with\n\nthe company name omitted:\n\n            John Traficonte\n            75 State Street\n            Boston, MA 02109\n\nHossain's lawyer states that because of the faulty address and\n\nbecause there are many tenants in the 75 State Street skyscraper,\n\nhe never received the briefing schedule (nor the transcript) that\n\nwas sent.      The government on this appeal does not dispute his\n\nassertion.    As a result of not receiving that schedule, Traficonte\n\nsaid, he never filed a brief with the BIA, even though the BIA did\n\nnot reach a decision until January 17, 2003, nearly four years\n\nafter the briefing schedule was mis-mailed.1\n\n             Hossain's motion for reconsideration was based solely on\n\nhis lawyer's failure to have received a briefing schedule and his\n\nattorney's consequent failure to have filed a brief.     The Justice\n\n\n     1\n      The same basic bureaucratic mistake had occurred much earlier\nin this case, in 1993.        A hearing date before the IJ was\nerroneously mailed without the \"Cabot Corporation\" piece of the\naddress, and was never delivered to Hossain's lawyer. Hossain thus\ndid not appear at the specified hearing date, and the judge held\nthe asylum claim abandoned.     However, after an explanation was\ngiven, the IJ reopened the proceedings.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fDepartment did not oppose the motion. The BIA rejected this motion\n\non October 24, 2003, stating both that in its opinion the briefing\n\nschedule (and transcript) were sent to the \"correct address,\" and\n\nthat Hossain's motion \"fail[ed] to present any significant new\n\nevidence, specify any errors of fact or law, or include a brief\n\nthat would justify granting relief or remanding.\" The BIA decision\n\ncited to Matter of Lei, 22 I&N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998), regarding the\n\npresumption of notice based on regularity of the mail.\n\n                                II.\n\n          We review BIA decisions on motions to reconsider only for\n\nabuse of discretion.   INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323-24 (1992).\n\n          The BIA erred by not sending a briefing schedule and\n\ntranscript to the proper address.     See 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.3(c)(1)\n\n(noting alien's right to file a brief with the BIA and stating that\n\nin transcribed cases, \"briefing schedule shall be set by the Board\n\nafter the transcript is available\").    The government now admits\n\nthat the wrong address was used.       Hossain's attorney clearly\n\nentered his full address on the Entry of Appearance form, and yet\n\nthe BIA sent the transcript and briefing schedule to an incomplete\n\nand therefore erroneous address. Thus, the first ground offered by\n\nthe BIA -- that the information was sent to the correct address --\n\ncannot stand.   Further, the citation by the BIA to Matter of Lei\n\ndemonstrates that the BIA misunderstood the nature of the claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fThe doctrine of regularity of the mail presumes the address used is\n\nthe correct one.\n\n            The mailing error constituted the type of error of law\n\nwhich is the proper subject of a motion for reconsideration.      8\n\nC.F.R. ยง 1003.2(b)(1); see also Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 293\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (\"The purpose of a motion to reconsider [as opposed\n\nto a motion to reopen] is...to demonstrate that the BIA erred as a\n\nmatter of law or fact.\").\n\n            The government argues that despite the BIA's mailing\n\nerror and violation of the BIA rules, its decision ought to be\n\naffirmed because there is no denial of due process as Hossain has\n\nbeen unable to show that he suffered any prejudice from the error.2\n\nWe agree that a due process claim cannot succeed if there is no\n\nprejudice; without prejudice, any error that occurred would be\n\nharmless.    See Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (\"[T]he applicant claiming a denial of due process must\n\ngenerally show prejudice.\").\n\n            Prejudice could easily (but not inevitably) be found in\n\na case where an alien's appeal was dismissed merely because of his\n\nfailure to file a brief.   See, e.g., Amarjit Singh v. Ashcroft, 367\n\nF.3d 1182, 1189 (9th Cir. 2004) (presuming prejudice where alien's\n\n\n     2\n      Because the government filed no opposition to Hossain's\nmotion for reconsideration before the BIA, the argument about\nprejudice has been raised by the government for the first time\nbefore this court.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fclaim was summarily dismissed because his lawyer did not file a\n\nbrief).   That is not our case.               The BIA appears to have at least\n\nnominally considered Hossain's case on the merits despite the\n\nabsence of a brief from him.\n\n              Here,       the    IJ's   rulings    hinged    largely   on   Hossain's\n\nalleged   lack       of    credibility,      and    the   BIA   overturns    an   IJ's\n\ncredibility findings, like other findings of fact, only if they are\n\nclearly erroneous.              8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.1(d)(3)(i).      From that lack of\n\ncredibility determination, it might be supposed there could be no\n\nprejudice.      Still, a brief to the BIA might have shown that the\n\nIJ's credibility ruling lacked support in the record or did not\n\nhave a rational explanation.                See Malkit Singh v. Ashcroft, 362\n\nF.3d 1164, 1168 (9th Cir. 2004).                  As well, the brief could have\n\nprovided more specificity to the claims broadly asserted in the\n\nnotice of appeal to the BIA.\n\n              The government's lack of prejudice argument founders on\n\nthe point that Hossain never had a chance to show prejudice due to\n\nthe   BIA's    own    error.3           Because   of   the   BIA's   mailing   error,\n\n\n\n      3\n      Hossain's counsel, who represents him pro bono, shares some\nresponsibility for this imbroglio. He let the matter lie for over\nfour years without making any inquiry to the BIA. He says that\nbecause the series of hearings before the IJ took place over\nseveral years, he understood it would take some time for the record\nto be assembled and a briefing schedule set. It appears that it\ntook from June 15, 1998 to January 25, 1999 to assemble the record\nand for the BIA to set a briefing schedule, a great deal less than\nfour years.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fHossain's counsel still had not received a copy of the hearing\n\ntranscript when he filed the motion for reconsideration.    Like the\n\ncourt in Singh, \"[w]e are at a loss as to how\" an alien could make\n\narguments on the merits of his case, for example \"clarifying the\n\ntestimony that the IJ deemed inconsistent[,] without having access\n\nto the transcript of that very testimony.\"   Malkit Singh, 362 F.3d\n\nat 1169.    Basic fairness requires that Hossain, now that he\n\napparently has a copy of the transcript, be given the opportunity\n\nto argue in a renewed motion for reconsideration that he was\n\nprejudiced by his inability to file a brief with the BIA.      The BIA\n\nis free to decide whether Hossain was prejudiced by his inability\n\nto file a brief or otherwise should be permitted reconsideration.\n\n\n\n                                III.\n\n           The order of the BIA on the motion for reconsideration is\n\nvacated, and the case is remanded to the BIA.    So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

Exclusion proceedings were brought against him on that date, and he in turn sought asylum and withholding of deportation. After a long series of hearings, both forms of relief were denied by an Immigration Judge (IJ) on May 8, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hossain filed a timely appeal from these decisions with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) on June 5, 1998, and his attorney requested an opportunity to file a brief on his behalf. The BIA mailed the briefing schedule to the wrong address, and Hossain's counsel says as a result he never filed such a brief. The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision without opinion on January 17, 2003, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(e)(4), although it had no brief from Hossain. Hossain never petitioned for review of that decision to this court. Instead, he filed a motion for reconsideration with the BIA on the ground that he was never given a proper opportunity to have his case briefed, and seeking leave to file the brief. This motion was denied by the BIA on October 24, 2003; Hossain now petitions for review of that denial in this court. We vacate the BIA's denial of the motion for reconsideration and remand to the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hossain's hearings before the IJ began in 1991; a final decision was rendered only in 1998. Hossain's claim was based on past persecution, including arrests and torture, that he claimed to have suffered as a member of the student wing of an opposition political party in Bangladesh. Hossain further claimed that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest on charges that he stabbed a fellow student during a riot in May 1991; he claimed that the stabbing was in self-defense but that he would not receive a fair trial, and would be likely to face violent extra-judicial retaliation, because of political persecution. The IJ denied Hossain's applications for asylum and withholding of deportation, emphasizing Hossain's \"inconsistent testimony\" and inadequate documentation for his claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hossain's notice of appeal to the BIA listed sixteen grounds for overturning the IJ's opinion, all of which were fairly broad and unspecific. As noted in Hossain's notice of appeal to the BIA, a copy of the voluminous transcript of the many hearings held by the IJ had not yet been prepared for Hossain and his counsel, and Hossain \"demand[ed] the right to file a brief\" in order to \"identify specific factual and legal issues\" involved in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the required Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative form sent to the BIA along with the Notice of Appeal, Hossain's attorney, John Traficonte, listed as his complete address:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <pre>  Cabot Corporation\n  75 State Street\n  Boston, MA 02109</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1999, the BIA sent a briefing schedule, along with a transcript of the IJ's hearings, to the following address, with the company name omitted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <pre>  John Traficonte\n  75 State Street\n  Boston, MA 02109</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hossain's lawyer states that because of the faulty address and because there are many tenants in the 75 State Street skyscraper, he never received the briefing schedule (nor the transcript) that was sent. The government on this appeal does not dispute his assertion. As a result of not receiving that schedule, Traficonte said, he never filed a brief with the BIA, even though the BIA did not reach a decision until January 17, 2003, nearly four years after the briefing schedule was mismailed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hossain's motion for reconsideration was based solely on his lawyer's failure to have received a briefing schedule and his attorney's consequent failure to have filed a brief. The Justice Department did not oppose the motion, The BIA rejected this motion on October 24, 2003, stating both that in its opinion the briefing schedule (and transcript) were sent to the \"correct address,\" and that Hossain's motion \"fail[ed] to present any significant new evidence, specify any errors of fact or law, or include a brief that would justify granting relief or remanding.\" The BIA decision cited to <i>Matter of Lei,</i> 22 I &amp; N Dec. 113 (BIA 1998), regarding the presumption of notice based on regularity of the mail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review BIA decisions on motions to reconsider only for abuse of discretion. <i>INS v.

The government now admits that the wrong address was used. Hossain's attorney clearly entered his full address on the Entry of Appearance form, and yet the BIA sent the transcript and briefing schedule to an incomplete and therefore erroneous address. Thus, the first ground offered by the BIA&#8212;that the information was sent to the correct address&#8212;cannot stand. Further, the citation by the BIA to <i>Matter of Lei</i> demonstrates that the BIA misunderstood the nature of the claim. The doctrine of regularity of the mail presumes the address used is the correct one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mailing error constituted the type of error of law which is the proper subject of a motion for reconsideration. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(b)(1); <i>see also Zhang v.

That is not our case. The BIA appears to have at least nominally considered Hossain's case on the merits despite the absence of a brief from him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the IJ's rulings hinged largely on Hossain's alleged lack of credibility, and the BIA overturns an IJ's credibility findings, like other findings of fact, only if they are clearly erroneous. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(d)(3)(i). From that lack of credibility determination, it might be supposed there could be no prejudice. Still, a brief to the BIA might have shown that the IJ's credibility ruling lacked support in the record or did not have a rational explanation. <i>See Malkit Singh v.
