The issue before us is whether the parties\n\nin this case reached an enforceable settlement agreement.       The\n\nunderlying case concerns claims brought by a student, now a sixth\n\ngrader, and his father against the student's former school.   It is\n\nnot necessary to describe those claims to decide this appeal.\n\n          On September 22, 2008, the day trial was to start (over\n\na year after the case was filed), the experienced trial judge asked\n\nthe parties if they wanted to make a last effort to settle the\n\ncase.   They said yes.    Counsel for the plaintiffs reported the\n\nparties had begun negotiations shortly before and they believed\n\nthey had achieved an agreement in principle on a noneconomic term\n\nbut were far apart on any economic terms.       In response to the\n\ncourt's question as to whether the only issue remaining unresolved\n\nwas the amount of a monetary settlement, counsel for the school\n\nsaid,\n\n          Well, we have a lot of issues to work out on\n          that noneconomic issue . . . so if we got\n          there, we're certainly going to request\n          assistance, perhaps assistance from The Court;\n          but in principle we had a deal on that as of\n          the week before the pretrial.\n\n          The parties then spent some time trying to negotiate the\n\neconomic terms.   The court, wisely, did not participate in those\n\nnegotiations. Ultimately, the parties reported they had reached an\n\nagreement on the economic terms that was \"subject to finalization\n\nof the noneconomic issues\" and there was work they \"still ha[d] to\n\ndo\" on one of those issues.   The court replied that \"we will report\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe case closed, as having been settled, and give you two months to\n\nmove to reopen it if for some reason or other, you're unable to\n\nfinish the paperwork.\"\n\n             Perhaps in a sense of optimism, the parties told the\n\ncourt that it could enter a settlement order but asked the court to\n\nretain jurisdiction over enforcement.      The court asked, \"Well in\n\nwhat way?     How am I going to enforce it?\"      Plaintiffs' counsel\n\nreplied that there could be a dispute over \"it.\"     He suggested one\n\nreason for the retention of jurisdiction was that the parties could\n\nneed the assistance of the court to work out the noneconomic terms.\n\nThere was no written agreement at this or any later point.1\n\n             The court then entered a settlement order dated September\n\n22, 2008.2     However, the optimism of the parties that they had\n\nreached agreement on the noneconomic terms was misplaced.      One of\n\nthe noneconomic terms concerned what the parties referred to as a\n\n\n     1\n          Because of the sensitive nature of the information, the\nparties asked the court to extend a sealing order and it did so.\nFor that reason as well, we do not go into details.\n     2\n             The settlement order said,\n\n                  The   court   having  been   advised   on\n             September 22, 2008 by counsel for the parties\n             that the above action has been settled:\n                  IT IS ORDERED that this action is hereby\n             dismissed without prejudice to reconsideration\n             and possible re-opening if within 60 days of\n             this order a motion is filed which represents\n             that the terms of the settlement agreement\n             have not been performed and there is good\n             cause for the non-performing party or parties\n             to have failed to perform.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f\"reenrollment contract,\" by which the parties meant very different\n\nthings.\n\n               On November 12, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a \"motion to\n\nenforce the September 22, 2008 settlement or, in the alternative,\n\nto reopen the case and proceed to trial.\"                The defendants filed an\n\nopposition to the plaintiffs' motion, which took the position that\n\na settlement agreement had been reached in September but the\n\nplaintiffs were departing from that agreed \"reenrollment contract\"\n\nin    two   material   respects.        They    also    joined    the   plaintiffs'\n\nalternative request that the court reopen the case for trial.                    It\n\nwas    clear    from   the   parties'    filings       that    they   fundamentally\n\ndisagreed      about   the   substantive       content    of    any   \"reenrollment\n\ncontract,\" which standard form of competing contracts was involved,\n\nwhat consequences flowed from it, and how the contract could be\n\nused.\n\n               The court convened a nonevidentiary hearing on January 5,\n\n2009, and asked what matters were in dispute, including the dispute\n\nabout the reenrollment contract.           Saying this was the last help it\n\ncould give the parties, the court then offered its own version of\n\nwhat the reenrollment contract was and told plaintiffs' counsel to\n\nsubmit to the court a draft order embodying that version.                       The\n\nparties spent the hearing jockeying for position to get the court\n\nto endorse and enforce each party's version of the reenrollment\n\ncontract.       No one explicitly discussed the alternate relief of\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fsending the case back for trial because there was no agreed\n\nsettlement. With no settlement to enforce, however, the only thing\n\nthe court could do was order the case to trial.               Indeed, the court\n\nsaid that if there were further proceedings, they would be before\n\na different judge.\n\n           Plaintiffs'      counsel,    as     the    court    had    requested,\n\nsubmitted a draft order.         In our view it went well beyond the\n\ncourt's offered resolution of the disputed term \"reenrollment\n\ncontract;\" it also sanctioned counsel for the school, ordering\n\ncounsel   to   pay   the   attorneys'   fees    and   costs     the   plaintiffs\n\nincurred bringing the motion to enforce. The defendants protested,\n\nbut the court, on January 22, 2009, entered the plaintiffs' five-\n\npage proposed order as an \"Order of Settlement and Judgement.\"                As\n\nto the sanctions, the court held no hearing, and it made no\n\nseparate findings why sanctions were appropriate or that defense\n\ncounsel had acted in bad faith or in violation of any order.                The\n\ncourt also did not respond to the arguments of the law firm that\n\nwas the school's general counsel, but not the school's litigation\n\ncounsel, that the firm had no notice it might be sanctioned and\n\nthat there was no basis to sanction it.         Final judgment was entered\n\non April 6, 2009, on the basis of the January 22 order.               The school\n\nand the sanctioned counsel have appealed from that judgment, which\n\nembodies the January 22 order.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           We have carefully reviewed the record in this case and\n\nconclude that the parties never had an enforceable settlement\n\nagreement because they never agreed on the content, consequences,\n\nor use of the so-called reenrollment contract.        There is no doubt\n\nthat these disputes over the \"reenrollment contract\" were about a\n\nmaterial term of the contract; indeed, the disagreement may have\n\ngone to the most material issues in the underlying litigation.         To\n\nthe extent the trial court thought there was no ambiguity in the\n\nparties' previous use of the term \"reenrollment contract\" and so\n\nthere was no material disagreement, that was plain error, whether\n\nviewed as an issue of law or of fact.     See, e.g., Fid. & Guar. Ins.\n\nCo. v. Star Equip. Corp., 541 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008) (district\n\ncourts may not summarily enforce settlement agreements when a\n\ngenuine   dispute   over   the   agreement's   material   terms   exists);\n\nMalave v. Carney Hosp., 170 F.3d 217, 220 (1st Cir. 1999) (same);\n\nWarner v. Rossignol, 513 F.2d 678, 683 (1st Cir. 1975) (same); see\n\nalso Magallanes v. SBC, 472 F.3d 923, 924 (7th Cir. 2006) (\"A valid\n\nand enforceable settlement agreement requires a meeting of the\n\nminds on all material terms.\").       Both the September 22 statements\n\nand the later filings established that there was only an ongoing\n\ndispute and no agreement.\n\n           It is so clear there was no settlement the court could\n\nenforce that there is no point in remanding this case for an\n\nevidentiary hearing. See F.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fVida de P.R. (F.A.C. I), 449 F.3d 185, 194 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(considering whether the parties \"had testimony worth presenting\"\n\nabout a settlement's terms when deciding not to remand for an\n\nevidentiary hearing); see also Quint v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co., 246\n\nF.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"There are certainly instances in\n\nwhich no oral contract is formed where material terms are not yet\n\nagreed upon, and no agreement is reached until there is a written\n\nagreement embodying those material terms.\") (citing Salem Laundry\n\nCo. v. New England Teamsters and Trucking Indus. Pension Fund, 829\n\nF.2d 278, 280-81 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n              It is true that sometimes courts may construe the terms\n\nof a settlement, particularly when the judge has personal knowledge\n\nof the negotiations.         E.g., F.A.C. I, 449 F.3d at 192, 194.        Here\n\nthe   judge    did     not   have   personal   knowledge   of   the   parties'\n\nnegotiations, so that could not have been the basis for the court's\n\ndecision.      See, e.g., Malave, 170 F.3d at 220-21 (holding that a\n\ndistrict court could not summarily enforce a settlement when it was\n\nobvious from the pleadings that a dispute existed and when the\n\ncourt had no personal knowledge of the settlement negotiations).\n\n              It is permissible but often unwise for counsel to inform\n\nthe court a case is settled when they have no more than an oral\n\nsettlement agreement.         F.A.C. I, 449 F.3d at 187; see also, e.g.,\n\nQuint,   246    F.3d    at   15.    That   situation   frequently     leads   to\n\nproceedings to \"clarify\" what the \"agreement\" was.                  See, e.g.,\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fF.A.C., Inc. v. Cooperativa de Seguros de Vida de P.R. (F.A.C. II),\n\n563 F.3d 1, 3-6 (1st Cir. 2009) (describing the long history of\n\ndisputes over the meaning of an oral settlement that forced the\n\ndistrict court and this court to interpret its terms and that\n\nculminated in sanctions that this court vacated).\n\n           The district court was attempting to be helpful and had\n\nbeen patient and shown restraint throughout a contentious case.\n\nBut in the absence of a trial and a liability finding, it was\n\nbeyond the power of the district court to impose its own resolution\n\nof material disputed issues that the parties did not agree to, and\n\nit could not do so under the rubric of a settlement order.                      As\n\nthere was no enforceable settlement, there was no possible basis\n\nfor   sanctions    orders   against   the   defendants     or   any   of   their\n\ncounsel. We need not address the other objections to the sanctions\n\norder.   See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 45-46 (1991)\n\n(\"[A] court may assess attorney's fees when a party has 'acted in\n\nbad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.'\"\n\n(quoting Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc., 421 U.S.\n\n240, 258-59 (1975))).\n\n           We     reverse   and   vacate.    We   remand   this   case     to    a\n\ndifferent judge for trial.        Perhaps the considerable legal talent\n\nwhich counsel has brought to this appeal can still resolve this\n\nmatter short of trial.\n\n           No costs are awarded.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

Saying this was the last help it\n\ncould give the parties, the court then offered its own version of\n\nwhat the reenrollment contract was and told plaintiffs' counsel to\n\nsubmit to the court a draft order embodying that version.                       The\n\nparties spent the hearing jockeying for position to get the court\n\nto endorse and enforce each party's version of the reenrollment\n\ncontract.       No one explicitly discussed the alternate relief of\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fsending the case back for trial because there was no agreed\n\nsettlement. With no settlement to enforce, however, the only thing\n\nthe court could do was order the case to trial.               Indeed, the court\n\nsaid that if there were further proceedings, they would be before\n\na different judge.\n\n           Plaintiffs'      counsel,    as     the    court    had    requested,\n\nsubmitted a draft order.         In our view it went well beyond the\n\ncourt's offered resolution of the disputed term \"reenrollment\n\ncontract;\" it also sanctioned counsel for the school, ordering\n\ncounsel   to   pay   the   attorneys'   fees    and   costs     the   plaintiffs\n\nincurred bringing the motion to enforce. The defendants protested,\n\nbut the court, on January 22, 2009, entered the plaintiffs' five-\n\npage proposed order as an \"Order of Settlement and Judgement.\"                As\n\nto the sanctions, the court held no hearing, and it made no\n\nseparate findings why sanctions were appropriate or that defense\n\ncounsel had acted in bad faith or in violation of any order.                The\n\ncourt also did not respond to the arguments of the law firm that\n\nwas the school's general counsel, but not the school's litigation\n\ncounsel, that the firm had no notice it might be sanctioned and\n\nthat there was no basis to sanction it.         Final judgment was entered\n\non April 6, 2009, on the basis of the January 22 order.               The school\n\nand the sanctioned counsel have appealed from that judgment, which\n\nembodies the January 22 order.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           We have carefully reviewed the record in this case and\n\nconclude that the parties never had an enforceable settlement\n\nagreement because they never agreed on the content, consequences,\n\nor use of the so-called reenrollment contract.        There is no doubt\n\nthat these disputes over the \"reenrollment contract\" were about a\n\nmaterial term of the contract; indeed, the disagreement may have\n\ngone to the most material issues in the underlying litigation.         To\n\nthe extent the trial court thought there was no ambiguity in the\n\nparties' previous use of the term \"reenrollment contract\" and so\n\nthere was no material disagreement, that was plain error, whether\n\nviewed as an issue of law or of fact.

E.g., F.A.C. I, 449 F.3d at 192, 194.        Here\n\nthe   judge    did     not   have   personal   knowledge   of   the   parties'\n\nnegotiations, so that could not have been the basis for the court's\n\ndecision.      See, e.g., Malave, 170 F.3d at 220-21 (holding that a\n\ndistrict court could not summarily enforce a settlement when it was\n\nobvious from the pleadings that a dispute existed and when the\n\ncourt had no personal knowledge of the settlement negotiations).\n\n              It is permissible but often unwise for counsel to inform\n\nthe court a case is settled when they have no more than an oral\n\nsettlement agreement.         F.A.C. I, 449 F.3d at 187; see also, e.g.,\n\nQuint,   246    F.3d    at   15.    That   situation   frequently     leads   to\n\nproceedings to \"clarify\" what the \"agreement\" was.                  See, e.g.,\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fF.A.C., Inc. v.
