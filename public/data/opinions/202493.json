Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Stephen E. Borofsky, Erica Bodwell and Borofsky, Amodeo-\nVickery & Bandazian, P.A., on brief for appellants.\n\n\n\n                          November 13, 2006\n\f              Per Curiam. Governor Wentworth Regional School District,\n\nAssistant Principal Guy Donnelly, Principal Paul Macmillan, and\n\nSuperintendent John Robertson (hereinafter collectively referred to\n\nas \"appellees\") have moved to dismiss                on the ground of mootness\n\nthe appeal of appellants, Paul and Deborah Hendrickson.                 We grant\n\nthe motion.\n\n              The legal proceedings began when appellees sought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict      of   New    Hampshire   stating   that     their   suspension     of\n\nappellants' son, Paul, in the Spring of 2005 due to his continued\n\nwearing of a provocative anti-Nazi patch on his sleeve was lawful.\n\nAppellants, who are Paul's parents, responded by, inter alia,\n\nfiling a counterclaim requesting injunctive relief, damages, fees,\n\nand a declaration that appellees' actions were unconstitutional.1\n\nBoth       appellees     and   appellants    moved     for   summary   judgment.\n\nAppellees prevailed on March 15, 2006, and an appeal followed.\n\n              In their motion to dismiss, appellees contend that,\n\nbecause there are no monetary claims left, Paul's graduation during\n\nthe pendency of the appeal has made it impossible for this Court to\n\nredress effectively appellants' remaining claims for relief.                  The\n\nmotion set off a back-and-forth between the parties that bottomed\n\nout in a factual disagreement over the contents of Paul's permanent\n\n\n\n       1\n      Eventually, appellants withdrew                their   claims    for   money\ndamages and for a jury trial.\n\n                                       -2-\n\frecord at the high school: appellees contend that the absences\n\ncaused by suspension are not a part of the permanent record and\n\nappellants disagree.      Accordingly, we ordered appellees to file\n\nunder seal with this court, among other things, a copy of Paul's\n\npermanent record.   Appellees complied with the order, and we have\n\ndetermined that Paul's permanent record does not contain any\n\ninformation pertaining to his suspension or absences.\n\n            Because    they   were   advanced   prior   to   appellees'\n\nsubmission of the contents of Paul's permanent record, certain of\n\nappellants' defenses to mootness rely on the proposition that the\n\nrecord is a source of adverse collateral consequences to Paul. The\n\nrecord gives no indication that Paul was suspended, however, so we\n\nconclude that these defenses are unpersuasive.           Two defenses\n\nremain: (1) that \"this case has been widely reported . . . [so]\n\n[a]ny employer checking Paul's background will easily access his\n\nhistory of suspensions from Kingswood Regional High School\" and\n\nwill, thereafter, be less inclined to hire Paul unless we declare\n\nthat the suspension was unconstitutional and (2) that \"the School\n\nDistrict has defamed Paul, both at his school and in the press [so]\n\nPaul is entitled to appellate review of the District Court's\n\ndecision to redress the negative statements made about him.\"         We\n\naddress these seriatim.\n\n          A case becomes moot \"when the issues presented are no\n\nlonger 'live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe outcome, or alternatively, when the party invoking federal\n\ncourt jurisdiction no longer has a personal stake in the outcome of\n\nthe   controversy.\"       Boston       and    Maine   Corp.   v.   Brotherhood   of\n\nMaintenance of Way Employees, 94 F.3d 15, 20 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(internal citations omitted).            A claim for declaratory relief may\n\nonly be addressed by this Court if \"the question in each case is\n\nwhether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that\n\nthere is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse\n\nlegal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the\n\nissuance of a declaratory judgment.\"              Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S.\n\n395, 402 (1975).        Appellants contend that they have a legally\n\ncognizable interest in the outcome of their request for declaratory\n\nrelief   because   it    will    have    a     bearing   on   Paul's   prospective\n\nemployment possibilities.            Courts have found in such circumstances\n\nthat the collateral consequences of the disputed act are too\n\nspeculative to support a claim.               See Blanciak v. Allegheny Ludlum\n\nCorp., 77 F.3d 690, 699-700 (3d Cir. 1996); Beattie v. United\n\nStates, 949 F.2d 1092, 1095 (10th Cir. 1991); Westmoreland v.\n\nNational Transp. Safety Bd., 833 F.2d 1461, 1463 (11th Cir. 1987);\n\nSandidge v. State of Washington, 813 F.2d 1025, 1025-26 (9th Cir.\n\n1987); cf. Phelps v. Wichita Eagle-Beacon, 886 F.2d 1262, 1268-69\n\n(10th    Cir.   1989).          We     find     their    decisions     persuasive.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the consequences of the suspension do\n\nnot give rise to a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fand reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment. See\n\nPreiser, 422 U.S. at 402.\n\n          Appellants' second defense to mootness fares no better.\n\nNowhere in appellants' pleadings is there anything resembling an\n\nexpress defamation cause of action.             Perhaps realizing this,\n\nappellants note that \"[t]his relief is equitable in nature and is\n\nencompassed in Paul's request for relief in his complaint.\"              In\n\nparticular, appellants refer to the portion of their counterclaim\n\nin which they request for \"all such further relief as the Court may\n\ndeem just and proper.\"       Elsewhere, however, we have concluded that\n\nsuch language does not operate to preserve a request for damages in\n\norder to avoid mootness.          See, e.g., Thomas R.W. by & Through\n\nPamela R. v. Massachusetts Dep't of Educ., 130 F.3d 477, 480-481\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (claim for damages raised on appeal in order to\n\navoid mootness waived when based on \"such further relief a this\n\ncourt deems just and proper\" provision in complaint); see also Fox\n\nv. Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N.Y., 42 F.3d 135, 141-2 (2d\n\nCir. 1994) (appellate courts \"are especially reluctant in these\n\ncircumstances   to    read    a   damages   claim   into   the   Complaint's\n\nboilerplate prayer for 'such other relief as the Court deems just\n\nand proper.'\").      Consequently, the defamation claim is waived.\n\n          For these reasons, we conclude that Paul's graduation has\n\nmooted this appeal.      Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court and remand the case with direction to dismiss both\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fthe complaint and the counterclaim as moot.     See   Medical Prof'l\n\nMut. Ins. Co. v. Breon Lab., Inc., 141 F.3d 372, 376 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (if \"a judgment is rendered moot during an appeal, either\n\nthrough happenstance or unilateral action by the prevailing party,\n\nnormally the court dismisses the appeal and orders the judgment\n\nvacated\").   Vacated and remanded.    No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
