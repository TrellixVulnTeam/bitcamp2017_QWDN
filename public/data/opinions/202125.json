Montgomery, with whom Mark D. Meredith, Sara M.\nBeauvalot, and Ropes & Gray LLP were on brief, for appellees,\ncross-appellants Charlesbank Equity Fund II, Limited Partnership\nand Harvard Private Capital Holdings, Inc.\n\n\n\n                          March 22, 2006\n\f            SELYA,       Circuit    Judge.      This    case   poses   a   puzzling\n\nquestion about when an affiliate is not an affiliate.                  Cf. William\n\nShakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, act II, sc. ii (1595) (\"What's in a\n\nname?    [T]hat which we call a rose [b]y any other name would smell\n\nas sweet[.]\").      The district court agreed with Blinds to Go, Inc.\n\n(BTG) and its shareholders that Harvard Private Capital Holdings,\n\nInc. (Holdings) violated their right of first refusal when it\n\ntransferred       all    of   BTG's    preferred   shares      to   the    putative\n\naffiliate, Charlesbank Equity Fund II, Limited Partnership (the\n\nFund).    Accordingly, the court rescinded the transaction.\n\n            The district court's decision pleased no one.                  Holdings\n\nand the Fund argue that they are in fact affiliates and assail the\n\ndistrict court's finding that the transfer inter sese violated the\n\nright of first refusal.            For their part, BTG and its shareholders\n\nexcoriate the district court's choice of remedy.                 Reexamining the\n\nmatter afresh, we conclude, as did the lower court, that a breach\n\nof the right of first refusal occurred.                 We therefore reject the\n\nappeal brought by Holdings and the Fund.               We also conclude that the\n\ndistrict court's choice of remedy for that breach (voiding the\n\ntransfer rather than decreeing specific performance) was consistent\n\nwith the contract and with equitable remedial principles.                        We\n\ntherefore reject the appeal taken by BTG and its shareholders.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            BTG     is    a   closely    held    Canadian      corporation     that\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fmanufactures, sells, and installs custom-made window treatments.\n\nIts seven shareholders include six Canadian corporations and Nkere\n\nUdofia, BTG's vice-chairman.1\n\n               Holdings is a not-for-profit Massachusetts corporation.\n\nIts sole member is the designee of the President and Fellows of\n\nHarvard College (Harvard).            The Fund is a limited partnership\n\norganized      under   Massachusetts       law.      Its    general     partner   is\n\nCharlesbank Equity Fund II GP, Limited Partnership (the General\n\nPartner); its limited partners are three charitable corporations\n\nwholly owned by Harvard, namely, Holdings, Phemus Corp., and\n\nShipping Venture Corp. Structurally, the General Partner is itself\n\na   Massachusetts      limited     partnership;      its    general     partner    is\n\nCharlesbank      Capital     Partners,     LLC    (the   LLC),    a   Massachusetts\n\nlimited liability company owned by its individual members.                        The\n\nGeneral Partner has one Class C limited partner, namely, Harvard\n\nPrivate Capital Properties, Inc. (Harprop), a Delaware corporation\n\nwholly owned by Harvard.\n\n               A venture capital transaction set in motion the events\n\nleading to this litigation. In 1995, pursuant to the BTG Preferred\n\nShare       Purchase   Agreement    (the    Purchase       Agreement),     Holdings\n\ninjected       $15,000,000    in   capital       into    BTG     in   exchange    for\n\n\n        1\n      The corporate shareholders are S. & D. Shillgroup Inc.,\nDavler Investments Inc., Stevler Investments Inc., Au Bon Marché,\nDavjosh Holdings Inc., and Zakbran Holdings Inc. All of them are\nowned, directly or indirectly, by BTG's chief executive officer\n(Stephen Shiller) or its board chairman (David Shiller).\n\n                                         -3-\n\fapproximately 20,000,000 shares of BTG's preferred stock.               On\n\nDecember 31, 1997, the parties executed an amended and restated\n\nshareholders' agreement (the Shareholders' Agreement) which, along\n\nwith the Purchase Agreement, governs their relationship.              Among\n\nother    things,   the   Shareholders'   Agreement   provides   the    BTG\n\nshareholders with a right of first refusal vis-à-vis the stock\n\nowned by Holdings.       The right of first refusal attaches to any\n\ntransaction other than one involving an affiliate.2\n\n            In or around 1998, Harvard began to restructure its\n\ninvestment portfolio for purposes of tax advantage and business\n\nconvenience. In 2001, as part of this restructuring, Holdings' in-\n\nhouse counsel, without troubling to read the relevant document,\n\n\n     2\n      Section 3.1 of the Shareholders' Agreement memorializes the\nright of first refusal. It provides:\n\n            [Holdings] . . . shall not sell, assign,\n            transfer,   grant   a    participation    in   or\n            otherwise dispose of any or all [BTG] Shares\n            owned by [it], other than to an Affiliate . .\n            . , unless (i) [Holdings] shall have received\n            a bona-fide offer to purchase such Shares . .\n            . from a third party . . . , (ii) such third\n            party   is  acting    at    arm's   length   from\n            [Holdings] and (iii) [Holdings] first submits\n            a   written  offer    .   .    .  to   [the   BTG\n            Shareholders] . . . , together with a copy of\n            the . . . Third Party Offer identifying the\n            third party to whom [Holdings'] Shares are\n            proposed to be sold and the terms of the\n            proposed sale and offering, [to the BTG\n            Shareholders], the opportunity to purchase\n            such Shares on terms and conditions, including\n            price, not less favorable than those on which\n            [Holdings] proposes to sell such Shares to\n            such third party . . . .\n\n                                   -4-\n\finformed BTG that Holdings planned to make a permitted transfer of\n\nits BTG shares to an affiliate. Holdings proceeded to convey those\n\nshares to the Fund.     The parties recorded the transfer at book\n\nvalue (i.e., $15,000,000).   In exchange, Holdings received a 12.4%\n\nownership interest in the Fund.       Because it transferred other\n\nassets as well, Holdings' total ownership interest in the Fund\n\nreached 52.9%.\n\n          On January 14, 2002, Holdings and the Fund sought to\n\nexercise a \"put\" right contained in the Purchase Agreement.    That\n\nright allowed Holdings or its lawful successor in interest to\n\ndemand, at either of two specified times, that BTG redeem all of the\n\npreferred shares.     Under the Purchase Agreement, the redemption\n\nprice was to be established through a formula emphasizing BTG's\n\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\n\n(EBITDA) for the preceding twelve months.\n\n          Storm clouds began to gather when the redemption price,\n\nas tentatively calculated by BTG, proved to be far less munificent\n\nthan Holdings and the Fund expected.    See Charlesbank Equity Fund\n\nII v. Blinds to Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151, 154-55 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(explicating more completely the factual background of the put and\n\nthe attempted redemption).   The storm broke when the Fund, invoking\n\ndiversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), filed suit against\n\nBTG in the United States District       Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts.   The Fund asserted common law claims arising out of\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fan alleged manipulation of BTG's finances with a view toward\n\nreducing the value of the put.   Holdings soon joined the fray as an\n\nadditional plaintiff.   BTG denied the essential allegations of the\n\ncomplaint and posited, as an affirmative defense, that it owed\n\nnothing on the put because Holdings had breached the Shareholders'\n\nAgreement when it transferred the shares to the Fund without\n\nhonoring the right of first refusal.3\n\n          On July 23, 2003, the BTG shareholders filed a separate\n\naction in the district court seeking (i) a declaration as to whether\n\nthe transfer between Holdings and the Fund was a transfer to an\n\naffiliate as that term is defined in the Shareholders' Agreement and\n\n(ii) relief for Holdings' purported breach of the Shareholders'\n\nAgreement.   On October 15, 2003, the district court consolidated\n\nthat action with the original action.\n\n          After much procedural maneuvering, see, e.g., Charlesbank,\n\n370 F.3d at 153, BTG and its shareholders moved for summary judgment\n\non all claims and counterclaims.       Not to be outdone, Holdings and\n\nthe Fund cross-filed for partial summary judgment on the right of\n\nfirst refusal claim.    Following a hearing, the district court, in\n\na bench decision, granted summary judgment in favor of the BTG\n\nshareholders on the right of first refusal claim, denied the cross-\n\n\n     3\n      BTG and its shareholders also countersued in a Canadian court\nto enforce the right of first refusal. That action has been stayed\npending resolution of the Massachusetts proceedings. See Blinds to\nGo Inc. v. Harvard Private Capital Holdings Inc., 261 N.B.R.2d 365\n(2003).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fmotion for partial summary judgment, and reserved decision on the\n\nremaining issues in the case. The court concluded (i) that the Fund\n\nwas not an affiliate of Holdings within the contemplation of the\n\nShareholders' Agreement; (ii) that compliance with the right of\n\nfirst refusal constituted a condition precedent to the proposed\n\ntransfer; (iii) that because Holdings did not abide by the right of\n\nfirst refusal provision, the transfer was void ab initio; and (iv)\n\nthat the appropriate remedy was to unravel the transaction and\n\nrequire the Fund to return the stock to Holdings.            The district\n\ncourt later entered a partial final judgment to this effect.           See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).      These timely appeals ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           Given the district court's detailed findings, we do not\n\ndoubt our appellate jurisdiction over these interlocutory appeals.\n\nSee Spiegel v. Trs. of Tufts Coll., 843 F.2d 38, 42-44 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (delineating the requirements for invocation of Rule 54(b)).\n\nWe therefore proceed to assess the district court's conclusions.        We\n\ndivide our discussion into two segments.\n\n           A.    Operation of the Right of First Refusal.\n\n           Holdings   and   the   Fund   contest   the   district   court's\n\nconstruction of the right of first refusal provision.        They contend\n\nthat they are in fact affiliates as that term is defined in the\n\nShareholders' Agreement and that, therefore, the transaction between\n\nthem never triggered, much less violated, the right of first refusal.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fThis contention is the logical starting point for our analysis; after\n\nall, if Holdings and the Fund are correct, then the share transfer\n\nwas valid, the right of first refusal was not implicated, and there\n\nwould be no need for us to address the remedial aspect of the\n\ndistrict court's decision.\n\n            In   approaching   this    question,   we    replay    a   familiar\n\nstandard of review.     \"A district court may enter summary judgment\n\nupon a showing 'that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter\n\nof law.'\"   Houlton Citizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178,\n\n183 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).              We review an\n\nentry of summary judgment de novo and, therefore, apply the same\n\nanalytic framework here.       See id. at 184.       That framework is not\n\naffected by the existence of a cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\nSee Blackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716, 721 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            On this issue, we are faced with a question of contract\n\ninterpretation: do Holdings and the Fund qualify as affiliates under\n\nthe Shareholders' Agreement?      Section 2.4 of that agreement creates\n\nthe benchmark.    It provides:\n\n            An \"Affiliate\" of a person or entity shall mean\n            another person or entity that is directly or\n            indirectly controlling, controlled by or under\n            common control with such person or entity.\n            \"Control\" shall mean the right to cast,\n            directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the\n            voting interests in a person or entity.\n\nThe   Shareholders'   Agreement    recites    that      it   is   governed   by\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fMassachusetts law and, thus, we look there for the substantive rules\n\nof decision.\n\n             Under Massachusetts law, an unambiguous contract must be\n\ninterpreted according to its terms. See Freelander v. G. & K. Realty\n\nCorp., 258 N.E.2d 786, 788 (Mass. 1970); see also Fairfield 274-278\n\nClarendon Trust v. Dwek, 970 F.2d 990, 993 (1st Cir. 1992) (applying\n\nMassachusetts law).          In such a situation, contract construction\n\npresents an unadulterated question of law.            See Daley v. J. F. White\n\nContracting Co., 197 N.E.2d 699, 702 (Mass. 1964).\n\n             A    contract    is   ambiguous   only    when   its   terms   \"are\n\ninconsistent on their face\" or when \"the phraseology can support\n\nreasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words\n\nemployed.\"       Suffolk Constr. Co. v. Lanco Scaffolding Co., 716 N.E.2d\n\n130, 133 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999) (quoting Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart\n\nCorp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir. 1989)).            There is no ambiguity\n\nsimply because a dispute exists between the contracting parties, each\n\nlobbying for its own preferred interpretation.            Id.\n\n             We discern no ambiguity in the relevant text of section\n\n2.4.   That section defines the term \"[a]ffiliate\" with considerable\n\nprecision and, in doing so, not only endows the word \"control\" with\n\ndecretory significance but also assigns that word a specific meaning.\n\nWe therefore rely on the plain language of the provision to resolve\n\nthe legitimacy of the transfer.\n\n             Holdings is fully controlled (under any definition of the\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fword) by Harvard.     In determining who \"controls\" the Fund, however,\n\nwe cannot rely on general usage but, rather, must apply the specific\n\ndefinition agreed upon by BTG and Holdings.             See Rogaris v. Albert,\n\n730 N.E.2d 869, 871 (Mass. 2000) (stating that a contract's terms\n\nwill not \"be taken in their plain and ordinary sense\" if \"otherwise\n\nindicated by the contract\"); see also Charles I. Hosmer, Inc. v.\n\nCommonwealth, 19 N.E.2d 800, 804 (Mass. 1939) (explaining that \"every\n\nphrase    and   clause    must     be   presumed   to   have    been    designedly\n\nemployed\").     Because that definition turns on voting rights, we\n\nconclude,   without      serious    question,   that    the    Fund    is   directly\n\ncontrolled by the General Partner (after all, pursuant to the Fund's\n\norganic document — its limited partnership agreement — only the\n\nGeneral Partner has the power to \"vote, give assent and otherwise .\n\n. . exercise all rights, powers, privileges and other incidents of\n\nownership or possession with respect to\" the Fund's assets).                   While\n\nHoldings is a limited partner, the limited partnership agreement\n\nspecifically declares that it \"shall take no part in the conduct or\n\ncontrol of the Partnership business.\"\n\n            The General Partner itself is, of course, a limited\n\npartnership. This is scant solace to Holdings and the Fund, however,\n\nas its limited partnership agreement states unequivocally that \"[t]he\n\nPartnership shall be managed exclusively\" by its general partner (the\n\nLLC).    Thus, the LLC controls the General Partner.            In turn, the LLC\n\nis controlled by a manager and various individual members (a group\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthat excludes both Harvard and Holdings).\n\n            Given this hierarchy, it is readily evident that neither\n\nHarvard nor Holdings occupies a place in the Fund's chain of voting\n\ncontrol.   Neither Harvard nor Holdings controls the Fund \"directly\"\n\n(a status reserved to the General Partner).                By the same token,\n\nneither Harvard nor Holdings controls the Fund \"indirectly\" (a status\n\nreserved to the LLC and its members).              Holdings and the Fund are,\n\ntherefore, not affiliates within the narrow compass of the definition\n\ncontained in the Shareholders' Agreement.\n\n            In   an   effort   to   blunt    the   force   of   this   reasoning,\n\nHoldings and the Fund make three points.              First, they argue that\n\nbecause Harvard (through Holdings, Phemus, and Shipping Venture)\n\ncontinues to own virtually all of the beneficial interest in the Fund\n\n— 99.92% — it, in effect, \"controls\" the Fund.              Second, they posit\n\nthat because Holdings itself owns a majority interest in the Fund —\n\n52.9% — it has the power under the partnership agreement to require\n\nthe Fund to reconvey its assets to the limited partners; this power\n\nof reconveyance, they say, amounts to \"control.\"                Third, Harvard,\n\nthrough Harprop (the only Class C limited partner of the General\n\nPartner), can direct the LLC (the general partner of the General\n\nPartner) to distribute the Fund's assets to its limited partners, so\n\nit \"controls\" the Fund in that sense as well.\n\n            To be sure, these scenarios suggest \"control\" in a lay\n\nsense.     This case, however, is not concerned with the ordinary\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fmeaning of \"control.\"        Where the parties to a contract take pains to\n\ndefine a key term specially, their dealings under the contract are\n\ngoverned      by   that   definition.        See   J.   A.    Sullivan     Corp.    v.\n\nCommonwealth, 494 N.E.2d 374, 378 (Mass. 1986) (recognizing that \"[a]\n\ncontract is to be construed to give reasonable effect to each of its\n\nprovisions\").       So it is here.          The parties to the Shareholders'\n\nAgreement crafted a specific definition of the word \"control.\"\n\nHoldings and the Fund cannot now gloss over that definition — nor can\n\nwe.   See Charles I. Hosmer, Inc., 19 N.E.2d at 804 (explaining that\n\nall phraseology in a contract \"must be given meaning and effect,\n\nwhenever practicable\").          The mere fact that the transaction, viewed\n\nwithout regard to the Shareholders' Agreement, represented a transfer\n\nfrom one Harvard pocket to another is not enough to override the\n\nexplicit      language    that   the   parties     chose     to   insert   into    the\n\ninstrument.\n\n              Holdings and the Fund insist that the word \"indirect,\"\n\nused twice in section 2.4, expands voting control to include\n\npractical control of any kind.              That word, however, cannot carry\n\nthe weight that Holdings and the Fund place upon it.                  In context,\n\nthe    word    refers     only   to   corporate    structure      (e.g.,   the    LLC\n\n\"indirectly controls\" the Fund because it \"directly controls\" the\n\nGeneral Partner, which, in turn, \"directly controls\" the Fund). It\n\nwould be unreasonable to read the word as a fundamental alteration\n\nof    the   precise     definition     of   \"control\"   that      accompanies     it.\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f           At bottom, then, the arguments mounted by Holdings and\n\nthe Fund represent thinly veiled attempts to redefine \"control\" to\n\ncomport with economic realities rather than with voting rights.\n\nWhatever the merits of this perspective in the abstract, we cannot\n\ncountenance so blatant an attempt to rewrite a clearly defined\n\ncontract term.     See Freelander, 258 N.E.2d at 788 (observing that\n\nwhen \"[t]here is nothing ambiguous in [a contract's] language . .\n\n. [a] court cannot subvert its plain meaning\").              Consequently, we\n\nconclude, as did the court below, that Holdings and the Fund are\n\nnot   affiliates   as   that   term   is     defined   in   the   Shareholders'\n\nAgreement.\n\n           That ends this aspect of the matter.                   Since it is\n\nundisputed that Holdings did not afford the BTG shareholders the\n\nspecified opportunity to exercise their right of first refusal, the\n\ntransfer violated the Shareholders' Agreement.4\n\n                          B.   Choice of Remedy.\n\n           The focus of the appeal taken by BTG and its shareholders\n\nis the district court's choice of remedy.              Citing Town of Sudbury\n\nv. Scott, 787 N.E.2d 536 (Mass. 2003), they insist that specific\n\n\n      4\n      Holdings and the Fund have a fallback position to the effect\nthat the BTG shareholders forfeited their right of first refusal by\nnot acting on that right within the thirty days allotted under\nsection 3.2 of the Shareholders' Agreement. That argument need not\ndetain us. Under the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, the\nthirty-day window is not opened by notice of a non-affiliate\ntransfer but, rather, by receipt of an offer to exercise the first\nrefusal right.    Neither Holdings nor the Fund tendered such an\noffer to the BTG shareholders.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fenforcement   of   a   disregarded    right   of   first   refusal    is   the\n\nexclusive remedy permitted under Massachusetts law.           Accordingly,\n\ntheir thesis runs, the district court should have ordered Holdings\n\nto offer the preferred shares to the BTG shareholders on the same\n\nterms as were made available to the Fund.             We think that this\n\nthesis takes too crabbed a view of a trial court's equitable powers\n\nunder Massachusetts law.\n\n          To facilitate this phase of our inquiry, we assume for\n\nargument's sake that the Fund's acquisition of the shares met the\n\ninitial requirements set forth in section 3.1 of the Shareholders'\n\nAgreement (i.e., that there was an offer, which was bona fide and\n\nled to an arm's length transaction).          See supra note 2.      This set\n\nof assumptions primes the pump and brings us directly to the\n\nquestion of remediation.\n\n          The anodyne that the BTG shareholders seek (specific\n\nperformance) and the anodyne that the district court decreed\n\n(rescission) are both equitable remedies.          See, e.g., Kenda Corp.\n\nv. Pot O'Gold Money Leagues, Inc., 329 F.3d 216, 224 (1st Cir.\n\n2003); Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 72 (1st Cir. 1994).                   Two\n\nabiding truths about equitable remedies are pertinent here. First,\n\nin choosing among equitable remedies, a nisi prius court has the\n\nability — indeed, the duty — to weigh all the relevant facts and\n\ncircumstances and to craft appropriate relief on a case-by-case\n\nbasis.   See Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon, 889 F.2d 314, 321\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f(1st Cir. 1989) (en banc). Second, in shaping an equitable remedy,\n\na nisi prius court typically has a range of appropriate options.\n\nAs long as the court's ultimate choice falls within this range, it\n\nwill withstand review even if it is not, in the appellate court's\n\nopinion, the best option within the range.          See id. at 324\n\n(describing a district court's choice of equitable remedies as\n\n\"quintessentially a judgment call\" and noting that, absent clear\n\nerror, it does not matter whether the court of appeals might have\n\nmade some other choice).\n\n          Viewed against this backdrop, it should come as no\n\nsurprise that the standard of review applicable to a district\n\ncourt's choice among available equitable remedies is deferential.\n\nA deferential standard is particularly appropriate where, as here,\n\nthe trial court must balance conflicting factors and deal with\n\nissues of judgment.   See Charlesbank, 370 F.3d at 158.   Therefore,\n\nwe review the trial court's choice among available equitable\n\nremedies for abuse of discretion.     See Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Dep't\n\nof Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 875 (1st Cir. 1995); Rosario-\n\nTorres, 889 F.2d at 323.     Because the district court \"is in a\n\nconsiderably better position to bring the scales into balance than\n\nan appellate tribunal,\" we will not normally find an abuse of\n\ndiscretion unless, upon whole-record review, we are convinced that\n\nthe district court committed a significant error in judgment.\n\nRosario-Torres, 889 F.2d at 323.\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f              Of course, a material error of law constitutes an abuse\n\nof discretion.       Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernandez, 350 F.3d 219,\n\n221   (1st    Cir.   2003).     Invoking    this   principle,   BTG   and    its\n\nshareholders      cite   Town   of   Sudbury   for   the   proposition      that\n\nMassachusetts law limits the range of remedies available in this\n\ninstance to one: specific performance.               But the Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (the SJC) has emphasized that \"[e]quitable\n\nremedies are flexible tools,\" Demoulas v. Demoulas, 703 N.E.2d\n\n1149, 1169 (Mass. 1998), and we do not believe that it has\n\nconstrained the inherently flexible nature of equity as severely as\n\nBTG suggests.\n\n              In Town of Sudbury, the SJC addressed a municipality's\n\nclaim against a purchaser of agrarian land. The purchaser had paid\n\na reduced price to the original owner on the understanding that he\n\nwould maintain the land for agricultural use. See Town of Sudbury,\n\n787 N.E.2d at 538.       Had he bought it for any other use, the town\n\nwould have been entitled to a statutory right of first refusal.5\n\n\n      5\n          The relevant statute provides:\n\n              Land which is valued, assessed and taxed on\n              the basis of its agricultural or horticultural\n              use . . . shall not be sold for or converted\n              to residential, industrial or commercial use\n              while so valued, assessed and taxed unless the\n              city or town in which such land is located has\n              been notified of intent to sell for or convert\n              to such other use . . . . [S]aid city or town\n              shall have, in the case of an intended sale, a\n              first refusal option to meet a bona fide offer\n              to purchase said land, or in the case of an\n\n                                     -16-\n\fSee id. at 541.\n\n            Only months after the acquisition, the purchaser began to\n\nprepare the site for non-agricultural use and soon entered into a\n\npurchase-and-sale agreement with a third party who intended to\n\ncarry out the non-agricultural use.            See id. at 538-40.   When the\n\ntown learned of the impending sale, it sought to exercise its right\n\nof first refusal as to the transaction between the original owner\n\nand the purchaser.       Receiving a cold shoulder, the town filed suit\n\nin state court.     See id. at 540.\n\n            On   those    facts,   the   SJC    remanded   the   case   for   a\n\ndetermination of the purchaser's intent at the time he took title.\n\nId. at 546.      In language celebrated by BTG and its shareholders,\n\nthe court concluded that \"[a]t common law, a right of first refusal\n\nripens into an option to purchase when the condition set forth in\n\nthe instrument creating the right is met. . . . The holder is\n\nentitled to specific performance of the option as to a subsequent\n\nowner who purchased with notice of the holder's right of first\n\nrefusal.\"     Id. at 543 (footnote omitted).            Although the SJC's\n\ncommentary in Town of Sudbury is relatively broad, the case is\n\nreadily distinguishable from the case at hand on at least two\n\n\n\n            intended conversion not involving sale, an\n            option to purchase said land at full and fair\n            market value . . . .\n\nTown of Sudbury, 787 N.E.2d at 541 n.10 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws\nch. 61A, § 14).\n\n                                    -17-\n\flevels: the purpose underlying the right of first refusal and the\n\ncentrality of the remedy to the litigation.\n\n           As to the first, the Massachusetts statute granting the\n\nright of first refusal in Town of Sudbury was passed under the\n\naegis of the legislature's power to regulate \"for the purpose of\n\ndeveloping and conserving agricultural or horticultural lands.\"\n\nMass. Const. amend. art. 99; see Town of Sudbury, 787 N.E.2d at\n\n544-46.   Thus, specific performance embodied the only remedy that\n\nwould comport with the right's purpose: only by acquiring the land\n\ncould the town maintain it for agricultural use.               In contrast,\n\nBTG's right of first refusal was negotiated by the parties to the\n\nShareholders' Agreement in order to ensure that Harvard (and not\n\nsome stranger who did not have BTG's blessing) would retain control\n\nof BTG's preferred shares. Rescission of the unauthorized transfer\n\nreturns the shares to a Harvard entity (Holdings) and, thus,\n\nadequately serves the original purpose of the right.                 Specific\n\nperformance, however, would return the shares to BTG, negating any\n\nopportunity for a further relationship between Harvard and the\n\ncompany — a relationship clearly valued at the time of contracting.\n\n           The second distinction is equally compelling. In Town of\n\nSudbury, the trial court's remedial choice was hardly central to\n\nthe   litigation;   in   fact,   the   language   to   which   BTG   and   its\n\nshareholders cling so tightly is dictum, pure and simple.             That is\n\nunderstandable; the issue actually litigated in Town of Sudbury was\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fwhether notice of an intended change of use as opposed to actual\n\nchange of use triggered the town's statutory first refusal right.6\n\nSee Town of Sudbury, 787 N.E.2d at 544.     The court's choice of\n\nremedy was seemingly uncontroversial.   No matter whether the court\n\nrescinded the transaction (and, thus, returned the land to the\n\noriginal owner) or specifically enforced the right of first refusal\n\n(and, thus, required the land to be offered to the town), the\n\npurchaser would lose the opportunity to develop it for a non-\n\nagricultural purpose.\n\n          Here, however, the consequences of the remedial choice\n\nare quite different.    Although Holdings and the Fund are not\n\naffiliates as that term is defined in the Shareholders' Agreement,\n\nthey nonetheless are related entities.    As such, their interests\n\nare much more closely aligned than those of the original owner and\n\npurchaser in Town of Sudbury.     Holdings and the Fund are not\n\nindifferent to the choice of remedy — nor should they be.       If\n\nrescission stands, the BTG shares will remain in a Harvard pocket,\n\nbut if specific performance is ordered, the shares (and their\n\napparently enhanced value) will escape completely from the fold.\n\n          On the basis of these distinctions, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court committed no error of law when it declined to order\n\nspecific performance in this instance.      Even so, BTG and its\n\n\n     6\n      We already have dispatched the analogous question here —\nwhether Holdings and the Fund were affiliates and, thus, whether\nthe first refusal right came into play.\n\n                               -19-\n\fshareholders have a fallback position.          They asseverate that the\n\ndistrict court misapplied Massachusetts law in two other respects.\n\nAccordingly, we examine those asseverations.\n\n           First, BTG and its shareholders assert that the court's\n\nremedial decision offends basic canons of contract interpretation\n\nby transforming a right of first refusal into a mere veto right.\n\nThis assertion lacks force.      Although we agree that courts must\n\nenforce contracts as written, see, e.g., Hakim v. Mass. Insurers'\n\nInsolvency    Fund,   675   N.E.2d     1161,   1164   (Mass.   1997),   the\n\nshareholders' characterization of the district court's actions is\n\nunfair.    By ordering rescission, the district court did not alter\n\nthe underlying contract — if Holdings were to attempt to retransfer\n\nthe shares to the Fund (or any other non-affiliate, for that\n\nmatter), it would still need to abide by the right of first\n\nrefusal.\n\n           Second, BTG and its shareholders hypothesize that the\n\ndistrict court selected an incorrect remedy.             They find fault\n\nbecause the remedy imposed does not place them in the same position\n\nthat they would have occupied had Holdings performed as required by\n\nthe right of first refusal.     That argument assumes too much.\n\n           While it is the goal of specific performance to place\n\nparties in the same position as they would occupy had the contract\n\nbeen carried out, that is not the goal of all contract remedies.\n\nCf. VMark Software, Inc. v. EMC Corp., 642 N.E.2d 587, 590 n.2\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f(Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (contrasting \"[t]he long-established general\n\nrule for breach of contract recovery in Massachusetts . . . that\n\nthe wronged party should . . . be placed in the same position as if\n\nthe contract had been performed\" with an \"alternative\" remedy\n\ndesigned to place a plaintiff in as good a position as he would\n\nhave occupied had no transaction occurred). Rescission is a remedy\n\nof a different kind — a remedy that, in this case, aims to place\n\nBTG and its shareholders in as good a position as they would have\n\nenjoyed had the offending transaction not occurred at all.           Given\n\nthe   district   court's   superior   coign   of   vantage,   we   are   not\n\npersuaded that the court committed legal error in weighing the\n\nequities,   favoring   some   remedial   interests    over    others,    and\n\nconcluding that rescission was the remedy of choice.\n\n            An additional circumstance buttresses our view that the\n\ndistrict court exercised its judgment reasonably.             Even without\n\nspecific performance, BTG likely will end up with the entirety of\n\nits preferred shares through the put, which Holdings has already\n\ntried to exercise. Given the incestuous nature of the relationship\n\nbetween Holdings and the Fund — while they are not affiliates\n\nwithin the isthmian confines of the definition embedded in the\n\nShareholders' Agreement, they are, as we have said, plainly related\n\nparties — the put price may well represent a fairer approximation\n\nof the worth of the stock at or near the time of the attempted\n\ntransfer than would the terms agreed upon by Holdings and the\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fFund.7\n\n           The   BTG   shareholders      most       bruited   response    to     this\n\nreasoning is that a weighing of the equities rewrites the district\n\ncourt's remedial rationale.         This position relies heavily on the\n\ndistrict judge's casual statement that he was \"not doing equity.\"\n\nYet, the judge retreated from that remark almost immediately\n\nthereafter, saying \"I guess maybe I am specifically enforcing it in\n\nthe   sense   that     I'm    saying    that        the   shares   have     to     be\n\nretransferred.\" Given that these comments were made from the bench\n\nand were not repeated in the Rule 54(b) findings, we deem it wise\n\nto embrace substance over form.               See, e.g., United States v.\n\nHilton, 946 F.2d 955, 958 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"We think it is\n\nunrealistic to expect that busy trial judges, ruling from the\n\nbench, will be infinitely precise in their choice of language.\").\n\nTo cinch matters, the judge characterized the transaction as \"void\n\nab inito\" — a characterization more consistent with rescission than\n\nwith specific performance.\n\n           We need go no further.             Finding, as we do, that the\n\ndistrict   court     was     not   limited     to    a    single   remedy      under\n\nMassachusetts law, that rescission of the transfer was within the\n\narmamentarium of permissible choices available to the court, and\n\n\n\n      7\n      The put option calls for calculation of the value of the\nshares as of January 14, 2002, only a matter of weeks after the\ndate of the transaction between Holdings and the Fund (November 1,\n2001).\n\n                                       -22-\n\fthat rescission was reasonable under the circumstances, we conclude\n\nthat the court acted within the encincture of its discretion in\n\nsimply voiding the transfer.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We summarize succinctly.   Holdings and the Fund are not\n\naffiliates within the purview of the Shareholders' Agreement.\n\nThus, Holdings breached that agreement when it did not offer the\n\nBTG shareholders an opportunity to exercise their right of first\n\nrefusal prior to effecting the challenged transfer.    Considering\n\nall the circumstances of this case, however, the lower court was\n\nnot obliged to order specific performance of the first refusal\n\nright.   Rather, the court acted within its equitable discretion\n\nwhen, after mulling both specific performance and rescission, it\n\nchose the latter.\n\n           The decision of the district court is affirmed in all\n\nrespects and the case is remanded for further proceedings.     All\n\nparties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f",

This    case   poses   a   puzzling\n\nquestion about when an affiliate is not an affiliate.                  Cf. William\n\nShakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, act II, sc. ii (1595) (\"What's in a\n\nname?    [T]hat which we call a rose [b]y any other name would smell\n\nas sweet[.]\").      The district court agreed with Blinds to Go, Inc.\n\n(BTG) and its shareholders that Harvard Private Capital Holdings,\n\nInc. (Holdings) violated their right of first refusal when it\n\ntransferred       all    of   BTG's    preferred   shares      to   the    putative\n\naffiliate, Charlesbank Equity Fund II, Limited Partnership (the\n\nFund).    Accordingly, the court rescinded the transaction.\n\n            The district court's decision pleased no one.                  Holdings\n\nand the Fund argue that they are in fact affiliates and assail the\n\ndistrict court's finding that the transfer inter sese violated the\n\nright of first refusal.            For their part, BTG and its shareholders\n\nexcoriate the district court's choice of remedy.                 Reexamining the\n\nmatter afresh, we conclude, as did the lower court, that a breach\n\nof the right of first refusal occurred.                 We therefore reject the\n\nappeal brought by Holdings and the Fund.               We also conclude that the\n\ndistrict court's choice of remedy for that breach (voiding the\n\ntransfer rather than decreeing specific performance) was consistent\n\nwith the contract and with equitable remedial principles.                        We\n\ntherefore reject the appeal taken by BTG and its shareholders.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            BTG     is    a   closely    held    Canadian      corporation     that\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fmanufactures, sells, and installs custom-made window treatments.\n\nIts seven shareholders include six Canadian corporations and Nkere\n\nUdofia, BTG's vice-chairman.1\n\n               Holdings is a not-for-profit Massachusetts corporation.\n\nIts sole member is the designee of the President and Fellows of\n\nHarvard College (Harvard).            The Fund is a limited partnership\n\norganized      under   Massachusetts       law.      Its    general     partner   is\n\nCharlesbank Equity Fund II GP, Limited Partnership (the General\n\nPartner); its limited partners are three charitable corporations\n\nwholly owned by Harvard, namely, Holdings, Phemus Corp., and\n\nShipping Venture Corp. Structurally, the General Partner is itself\n\na   Massachusetts      limited     partnership;      its    general     partner    is\n\nCharlesbank      Capital     Partners,     LLC    (the   LLC),    a   Massachusetts\n\nlimited liability company owned by its individual members.                        The\n\nGeneral Partner has one Class C limited partner, namely, Harvard\n\nPrivate Capital Properties, Inc. (Harprop), a Delaware corporation\n\nwholly owned by Harvard.\n\n               A venture capital transaction set in motion the events\n\nleading to this litigation. In 1995, pursuant to the BTG Preferred\n\nShare       Purchase   Agreement    (the    Purchase       Agreement),     Holdings\n\ninjected       $15,000,000    in   capital       into    BTG     in   exchange    for\n\n\n        1\n      The corporate shareholders are S. & D. Shillgroup Inc.,\nDavler Investments Inc., Stevler Investments Inc., Au Bon Marché,\nDavjosh Holdings Inc., and Zakbran Holdings Inc.

On\n\nDecember 31, 1997, the parties executed an amended and restated\n\nshareholders' agreement (the Shareholders' Agreement) which, along\n\nwith the Purchase Agreement, governs their relationship.              Among\n\nother    things,   the   Shareholders'   Agreement   provides   the    BTG\n\nshareholders with a right of first refusal vis-à-vis the stock\n\nowned by Holdings.       The right of first refusal attaches to any\n\ntransaction other than one involving an affiliate.2\n\n            In or around 1998, Harvard began to restructure its\n\ninvestment portfolio for purposes of tax advantage and business\n\nconvenience. In 2001, as part of this restructuring, Holdings' in-\n\nhouse counsel, without troubling to read the relevant document,\n\n\n     2\n      Section 3.1 of the Shareholders' Agreement memorializes the\nright of first refusal. It provides:\n\n            [Holdings] . . . shall not sell, assign,\n            transfer,   grant   a    participation    in   or\n            otherwise dispose of any or all [BTG] Shares\n            owned by [it], other than to an Affiliate . .\n            . , unless (i) [Holdings] shall have received\n            a bona-fide offer to purchase such Shares . .\n            . from a third party . . . , (ii) such third\n            party   is  acting    at    arm's   length   from\n            [Holdings] and (iii) [Holdings] first submits\n            a   written  offer    .   .    .  to   [the   BTG\n            Shareholders] . . . , together with a copy of\n            the . . . Third Party Offer identifying the\n            third party to whom [Holdings'] Shares are\n            proposed to be sold and the terms of the\n            proposed sale and offering, [to the BTG\n            Shareholders], the opportunity to purchase\n            such Shares on terms and conditions, including\n            price, not less favorable than those on which\n            [Holdings] proposes to sell such Shares to\n            such third party . . . .\n\n                                   -4-\n\finformed BTG that Holdings planned to make a permitted transfer of\n\nits BTG shares to an affiliate. Holdings proceeded to convey those\n\nshares to the Fund.     The parties recorded the transfer at book\n\nvalue (i.e., $15,000,000).   In exchange, Holdings received a 12.4%\n\nownership interest in the Fund.       Because it transferred other\n\nassets as well, Holdings' total ownership interest in the Fund\n\nreached 52.9%.\n\n          On January 14, 2002, Holdings and the Fund sought to\n\nexercise a \"put\" right contained in the Purchase Agreement.    That\n\nright allowed Holdings or its lawful successor in interest to\n\ndemand, at either of two specified times, that BTG redeem all of the\n\npreferred shares.     Under the Purchase Agreement, the redemption\n\nprice was to be established through a formula emphasizing BTG's\n\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\n\n(EBITDA) for the preceding twelve months.\n\n          Storm clouds began to gather when the redemption price,\n\nas tentatively calculated by BTG, proved to be far less munificent\n\nthan Holdings and the Fund expected.    See Charlesbank Equity Fund\n\nII v. Blinds to Go, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201049\"><a href=\"/opinion/201049/charlesbank-v-blinds-to-go-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154-55 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(explicating more completely the factual background of the put and\n\nthe attempted redemption).   The storm broke when the Fund, invoking\n\ndiversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), filed suit against\n\nBTG in the United States District       Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts.   The Fund asserted common law claims arising out of\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fan alleged manipulation of BTG's finances with a view toward\n\nreducing the value of the put.   Holdings soon joined the fray as an\n\nadditional plaintiff.   BTG denied the essential allegations of the\n\ncomplaint and posited, as an affirmative defense, that it owed\n\nnothing on the put because Holdings had breached the Shareholders'\n\nAgreement when it transferred the shares to the Fund without\n\nhonoring the right of first refusal.3\n\n          On July 23, 2003, the BTG shareholders filed a separate\n\naction in the district court seeking (i) a declaration as to whether\n\nthe transfer between Holdings and the Fund was a transfer to an\n\naffiliate as that term is defined in the Shareholders' Agreement and\n\n(ii) relief for Holdings' purported breach of the Shareholders'\n\nAgreement.   On October 15, 2003, the district court consolidated\n\nthat action with the original action.\n\n          After much procedural maneuvering, see, e.g., Charlesbank,\n\n370 F.3d at 153, BTG and its shareholders moved for summary judgment\n\non all claims and counterclaims.       Not to be outdone, Holdings and\n\nthe Fund cross-filed for partial summary judgment on the right of\n\nfirst refusal claim.    Following a hearing, the district court, in\n\na bench decision, granted summary judgment in favor of the BTG\n\nshareholders on the right of first refusal claim, denied the cross-\n\n\n     3\n      BTG and its shareholders also countersued in a Canadian court\nto enforce the right of first refusal. That action has been stayed\npending resolution of the Massachusetts proceedings. See Blinds to\nGo Inc. v. Harvard Private Capital Holdings Inc., 261 N.B.R.2d 365\n(2003).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fmotion for partial summary judgment, and reserved decision on the\n\nremaining issues in the case. The court concluded (i) that the Fund\n\nwas not an affiliate of Holdings within the contemplation of the\n\nShareholders' Agreement; (ii) that compliance with the right of\n\nfirst refusal constituted a condition precedent to the proposed\n\ntransfer; (iii) that because Holdings did not abide by the right of\n\nfirst refusal provision, the transfer was void ab initio; and (iv)\n\nthat the appropriate remedy was to unravel the transaction and\n\nrequire the Fund to return the stock to Holdings.            The district\n\ncourt later entered a partial final judgment to this effect.           See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).      These timely appeals ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           Given the district court's detailed findings, we do not\n\ndoubt our appellate jurisdiction over these interlocutory appeals.\n\nSee Spiegel v.

We\n\ndivide our discussion into two segments.\n\n           A.    Operation of the Right of First Refusal.\n\n           Holdings   and   the   Fund   contest   the   district   court's\n\nconstruction of the right of first refusal provision.        They contend\n\nthat they are in fact affiliates as that term is defined in the\n\nShareholders' Agreement and that, therefore, the transaction between\n\nthem never triggered, much less violated, the right of first refusal.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fThis contention is the logical starting point for our analysis; after\n\nall, if Holdings and the Fund are correct, then the share transfer\n\nwas valid, the right of first refusal was not implicated, and there\n\nwould be no need for us to address the remedial aspect of the\n\ndistrict court's decision.\n\n            In   approaching   this    question,   we    replay    a   familiar\n\nstandard of review.     \"A district court may enter summary judgment\n\nupon a showing 'that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter\n\nof law.'\"   Houlton Citizens' Coal. v.

That framework is not\n\naffected by the existence of a cross-motion for summary judgment.\n\nSee Blackie v.

Section 2.4 of that agreement creates\n\nthe benchmark.    It provides:\n\n            An \"Affiliate\" of a person or entity shall mean\n            another person or entity that is directly or\n            indirectly controlling, controlled by or under\n            common control with such person or entity.\n            \"Control\" shall mean the right to cast,\n            directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the\n            voting interests in a person or entity.\n\nThe   Shareholders'   Agreement    recites    that      it   is   governed   by\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fMassachusetts law and, thus, we look there for the substantive rules\n\nof decision.\n\n             Under Massachusetts law, an unambiguous contract must be\n\ninterpreted according to its terms.

Id.\n\n             We discern no ambiguity in the relevant text of section\n\n2.4.   That section defines the term \"[a]ffiliate\" with considerable\n\nprecision and, in doing so, not only endows the word \"control\" with\n\ndecretory significance but also assigns that word a specific meaning.\n\nWe therefore rely on the plain language of the provision to resolve\n\nthe legitimacy of the transfer.\n\n             Holdings is fully controlled (under any definition of the\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fword) by Harvard.     In determining who \"controls\" the Fund, however,\n\nwe cannot rely on general usage but, rather, must apply the specific\n\ndefinition agreed upon by BTG and Holdings.             See Rogaris v. Albert,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871 (Mass. 2000) (stating that a contract's terms\n\nwill not \"be taken in their plain and ordinary sense\" if \"otherwise\n\nindicated by the contract\"); see also Charles I.

Because that definition turns on voting rights, we\n\nconclude,   without      serious    question,   that    the    Fund    is   directly\n\ncontrolled by the General Partner (after all, pursuant to the Fund's\n\norganic document — its limited partnership agreement — only the\n\nGeneral Partner has the power to \"vote, give assent and otherwise .\n\n. . exercise all rights, powers, privileges and other incidents of\n\nownership or possession with respect to\" the Fund's assets).                   While\n\nHoldings is a limited partner, the limited partnership agreement\n\nspecifically declares that it \"shall take no part in the conduct or\n\ncontrol of the Partnership business.\"\n\n            The General Partner itself is, of course, a limited\n\npartnership. This is scant solace to Holdings and the Fund, however,\n\nas its limited partnership agreement states unequivocally that \"[t]he\n\nPartnership shall be managed exclusively\" by its general partner (the\n\nLLC).    Thus, the LLC controls the General Partner.            In turn, the LLC\n\nis controlled by a manager and various individual members (a group\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fthat excludes both Harvard and Holdings).\n\n            Given this hierarchy, it is readily evident that neither\n\nHarvard nor Holdings occupies a place in the Fund's chain of voting\n\ncontrol.   Neither Harvard nor Holdings controls the Fund \"directly\"\n\n(a status reserved to the General Partner).                By the same token,\n\nneither Harvard nor Holdings controls the Fund \"indirectly\" (a status\n\nreserved to the LLC and its members).              Holdings and the Fund are,\n\ntherefore, not affiliates within the narrow compass of the definition\n\ncontained in the Shareholders' Agreement.\n\n            In   an   effort   to   blunt    the   force   of   this   reasoning,\n\nHoldings and the Fund make three points.              First, they argue that\n\nbecause Harvard (through Holdings, Phemus, and Shipping Venture)\n\ncontinues to own virtually all of the beneficial interest in the Fund\n\n— 99.92% — it, in effect, \"controls\" the Fund.              Second, they posit\n\nthat because Holdings itself owns a majority interest in the Fund —\n\n52.9% — it has the power under the partnership agreement to require\n\nthe Fund to reconvey its assets to the limited partners; this power\n\nof reconveyance, they say, amounts to \"control.\"                Third, Harvard,\n\nthrough Harprop (the only Class C limited partner of the General\n\nPartner), can direct the LLC (the general partner of the General\n\nPartner) to distribute the Fund's assets to its limited partners, so\n\nit \"controls\" the Fund in that sense as well.\n\n            To be sure, these scenarios suggest \"control\" in a lay\n\nsense.     This case, however, is not concerned with the ordinary\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fmeaning of \"control.\"        Where the parties to a contract take pains to\n\ndefine a key term specially, their dealings under the contract are\n\ngoverned      by   that   definition.        See   J.   A.    Sullivan     Corp.    v.\n\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378 (Mass. 1986) (recognizing that \"[a]\n\ncontract is to be construed to give reasonable effect to each of its\n\nprovisions\").       So it is here.          The parties to the Shareholders'\n\nAgreement crafted a specific definition of the word \"control.\"\n\nHoldings and the Fund cannot now gloss over that definition — nor can\n\nwe.   See Charles I. Hosmer, Inc., 19 N.E.2d at 804 (explaining that\n\nall phraseology in a contract \"must be given meaning and effect,\n\nwhenever practicable\").          The mere fact that the transaction, viewed\n\nwithout regard to the Shareholders' Agreement, represented a transfer\n\nfrom one Harvard pocket to another is not enough to override the\n\nexplicit      language    that   the   parties     chose     to   insert   into    the\n\ninstrument.\n\n              Holdings and the Fund insist that the word \"indirect,\"\n\nused twice in section 2.4, expands voting control to include\n\npractical control of any kind.              That word, however, cannot carry\n\nthe weight that Holdings and the Fund place upon it.                  In context,\n\nthe    word    refers     only   to   corporate    structure      (e.g.,   the    LLC\n\n\"indirectly controls\" the Fund because it \"directly controls\" the\n\nGeneral Partner, which, in turn, \"directly controls\" the Fund). It\n\nwould be unreasonable to read the word as a fundamental alteration\n\nof    the   precise     definition     of   \"control\"   that      accompanies     it.\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f           At bottom, then, the arguments mounted by Holdings and\n\nthe Fund represent thinly veiled attempts to redefine \"control\" to\n\ncomport with economic realities rather than with voting rights.\n\nWhatever the merits of this perspective in the abstract, we cannot\n\ncountenance so blatant an attempt to rewrite a clearly defined\n\ncontract term.     See Freelander, 258 N.E.2d at 788 (observing that\n\nwhen \"[t]here is nothing ambiguous in [a contract's] language . .\n\n. [a] court cannot subvert its plain meaning\").              Consequently, we\n\nconclude, as did the court below, that Holdings and the Fund are\n\nnot   affiliates   as   that   term   is     defined   in   the   Shareholders'\n\nAgreement.\n\n           That ends this aspect of the matter.                   Since it is\n\nundisputed that Holdings did not afford the BTG shareholders the\n\nspecified opportunity to exercise their right of first refusal, the\n\ntransfer violated the Shareholders' Agreement.4\n\n                          B.   Choice of Remedy.\n\n           The focus of the appeal taken by BTG and its shareholders\n\nis the district court's choice of remedy.              Citing Town of Sudbury\n\nv. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 2003), they insist that specific\n\n\n      4\n      Holdings and the Fund have a fallback position to the effect\nthat the BTG shareholders forfeited their right of first refusal by\nnot acting on that right within the thirty days allotted under\nsection 3.2 of the Shareholders' Agreement. That argument need not\ndetain us. Under the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, the\nthirty-day window is not opened by notice of a non-affiliate\ntransfer but, rather, by receipt of an offer to exercise the first\nrefusal right.    Neither Holdings nor the Fund tendered such an\noffer to the BTG shareholders.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fenforcement   of   a   disregarded    right   of   first   refusal    is   the\n\nexclusive remedy permitted under Massachusetts law.           Accordingly,\n\ntheir thesis runs, the district court should have ordered Holdings\n\nto offer the preferred shares to the BTG shareholders on the same\n\nterms as were made available to the Fund.             We think that this\n\nthesis takes too crabbed a view of a trial court's equitable powers\n\nunder Massachusetts law.\n\n          To facilitate this phase of our inquiry, we assume for\n\nargument's sake that the Fund's acquisition of the shares met the\n\ninitial requirements set forth in section 3.1 of the Shareholders'\n\nAgreement (i.e., that there was an offer, which was bona fide and\n\nled to an arm's length transaction).          See supra note 2.      This set\n\nof assumptions primes the pump and brings us directly to the\n\nquestion of remediation.\n\n          The anodyne that the BTG shareholders seek (specific\n\nperformance) and the anodyne that the district court decreed\n\n(rescission) are both equitable remedies.

Hernandez-Colon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532023\"><a href=\"/opinion/532023/miguel-a-rosario-torres-v-rafael-hernandez-colon-etc-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f(1st Cir. 1989) (en banc). Second, in shaping an equitable remedy,\n\na nisi prius court typically has a range of appropriate options.\n\nAs long as the court's ultimate choice falls within this range, it\n\nwill withstand review even if it is not, in the appellate court's\n\nopinion, the best option within the range.          See id. at 324\n\n(describing a district court's choice of equitable remedies as\n\n\"quintessentially a judgment call\" and noting that, absent clear\n\nerror, it does not matter whether the court of appeals might have\n\nmade some other choice).\n\n          Viewed against this backdrop, it should come as no\n\nsurprise that the standard of review applicable to a district\n\ncourt's choice among available equitable remedies is deferential.\n\nA deferential standard is particularly appropriate where, as here,\n\nthe trial court must balance conflicting factors and deal with\n\nissues of judgment.   See Charlesbank, 370 F.3d at 158.   Therefore,\n\nwe review the trial court's choice among available equitable\n\nremedies for abuse of discretion.     See Texaco P.R., Inc. v.

The purchaser had paid\n\na reduced price to the original owner on the understanding that he\n\nwould maintain the land for agricultural use. See Town of Sudbury,\n\n787 N.E.2d at 538.       Had he bought it for any other use, the town\n\nwould have been entitled to a statutory right of first refusal.5\n\n\n      5\n          The relevant statute provides:\n\n              Land which is valued, assessed and taxed on\n              the basis of its agricultural or horticultural\n              use . . . shall not be sold for or converted\n              to residential, industrial or commercial use\n              while so valued, assessed and taxed unless the\n              city or town in which such land is located has\n              been notified of intent to sell for or convert\n              to such other use . . . . [S]aid city or town\n              shall have, in the case of an intended sale, a\n              first refusal option to meet a bona fide offer\n              to purchase said land, or in the case of an\n\n                                     -16-\n\fSee id. at 541.\n\n            Only months after the acquisition, the purchaser began to\n\nprepare the site for non-agricultural use and soon entered into a\n\npurchase-and-sale agreement with a third party who intended to\n\ncarry out the non-agricultural use.            See id. at 538-40.   When the\n\ntown learned of the impending sale, it sought to exercise its right\n\nof first refusal as to the transaction between the original owner\n\nand the purchaser.       Receiving a cold shoulder, the town filed suit\n\nin state court.     See id. at 540.\n\n            On   those    facts,   the   SJC    remanded   the   case   for   a\n\ndetermination of the purchaser's intent at the time he took title.\n\nId. at 546.      In language celebrated by BTG and its shareholders,\n\nthe court concluded that \"[a]t common law, a right of first refusal\n\nripens into an option to purchase when the condition set forth in\n\nthe instrument creating the right is met. . . . The holder is\n\nentitled to specific performance of the option as to a subsequent\n\nowner who purchased with notice of the holder's right of first\n\nrefusal.\"     Id. at 543 (footnote omitted).            Although the SJC's\n\ncommentary in Town of Sudbury is relatively broad, the case is\n\nreadily distinguishable from the case at hand on at least two\n\n\n\n            intended conversion not involving sale, an\n            option to purchase said land at full and fair\n            market value . . . .\n\nTown of Sudbury, 787 N.E.2d at 541 n.10 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws\nch. 61A, § 14).\n\n                                    -17-\n\flevels: the purpose underlying the right of first refusal and the\n\ncentrality of the remedy to the litigation.\n\n           As to the first, the Massachusetts statute granting the\n\nright of first refusal in Town of Sudbury was passed under the\n\naegis of the legislature's power to regulate \"for the purpose of\n\ndeveloping and conserving agricultural or horticultural lands.\"\n\nMass. Const. amend. art. 99; see Town of Sudbury, 787 N.E.2d at\n\n544-46.   Thus, specific performance embodied the only remedy that\n\nwould comport with the right's purpose: only by acquiring the land\n\ncould the town maintain it for agricultural use.               In contrast,\n\nBTG's right of first refusal was negotiated by the parties to the\n\nShareholders' Agreement in order to ensure that Harvard (and not\n\nsome stranger who did not have BTG's blessing) would retain control\n\nof BTG's preferred shares. Rescission of the unauthorized transfer\n\nreturns the shares to a Harvard entity (Holdings) and, thus,\n\nadequately serves the original purpose of the right.                 Specific\n\nperformance, however, would return the shares to BTG, negating any\n\nopportunity for a further relationship between Harvard and the\n\ncompany — a relationship clearly valued at the time of contracting.\n\n           The second distinction is equally compelling. In Town of\n\nSudbury, the trial court's remedial choice was hardly central to\n\nthe   litigation;   in   fact,   the   language   to   which   BTG   and   its\n\nshareholders cling so tightly is dictum, pure and simple.             That is\n\nunderstandable; the issue actually litigated in Town of Sudbury was\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fwhether notice of an intended change of use as opposed to actual\n\nchange of use triggered the town's statutory first refusal right.6\n\nSee Town of Sudbury, 787 N.E.2d at 544.     The court's choice of\n\nremedy was seemingly uncontroversial.   No matter whether the court\n\nrescinded the transaction (and, thus, returned the land to the\n\noriginal owner) or specifically enforced the right of first refusal\n\n(and, thus, required the land to be offered to the town), the\n\npurchaser would lose the opportunity to develop it for a non-\n\nagricultural purpose.\n\n          Here, however, the consequences of the remedial choice\n\nare quite different.    Although Holdings and the Fund are not\n\naffiliates as that term is defined in the Shareholders' Agreement,\n\nthey nonetheless are related entities.    As such, their interests\n\nare much more closely aligned than those of the original owner and\n\npurchaser in Town of Sudbury.     Holdings and the Fund are not\n\nindifferent to the choice of remedy — nor should they be.       If\n\nrescission stands, the BTG shares will remain in a Harvard pocket,\n\nbut if specific performance is ordered, the shares (and their\n\napparently enhanced value) will escape completely from the fold.\n\n          On the basis of these distinctions, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court committed no error of law when it declined to order\n\nspecific performance in this instance.      Even so, BTG and its\n\n\n     6\n      We already have dispatched the analogous question here —\nwhether Holdings and the Fund were affiliates and, thus, whether\nthe first refusal right came into play.\n\n                               -19-\n\fshareholders have a fallback position.          They asseverate that the\n\ndistrict court misapplied Massachusetts law in two other respects.\n\nAccordingly, we examine those asseverations.\n\n           First, BTG and its shareholders assert that the court's\n\nremedial decision offends basic canons of contract interpretation\n\nby transforming a right of first refusal into a mere veto right.\n\nThis assertion lacks force.      Although we agree that courts must\n\nenforce contracts as written, see, e.g., Hakim v. Mass. Insurers'\n\nInsolvency    Fund,   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>     <span class=\"page\">1161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   1164   (Mass.   1997),   the\n\nshareholders' characterization of the district court's actions is\n\nunfair.    By ordering rescission, the district court did not alter\n\nthe underlying contract — if Holdings were to attempt to retransfer\n\nthe shares to the Fund (or any other non-affiliate, for that\n\nmatter), it would still need to abide by the right of first\n\nrefusal.\n\n           Second, BTG and its shareholders hypothesize that the\n\ndistrict court selected an incorrect remedy.             They find fault\n\nbecause the remedy imposed does not place them in the same position\n\nthat they would have occupied had Holdings performed as required by\n\nthe right of first refusal.     That argument assumes too much.\n\n           While it is the goal of specific performance to place\n\nparties in the same position as they would occupy had the contract\n\nbeen carried out, that is not the goal of all contract remedies.\n\nCf. VMark Software, Inc. v. EMC Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2103642\"><a href=\"/opinion/2103642/vmark-software-inc-v-emc-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 590 n.2\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f(Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (contrasting \"[t]he long-established general\n\nrule for breach of contract recovery in Massachusetts . . . that\n\nthe wronged party should . . . be placed in the same position as if\n\nthe contract had been performed\" with an \"alternative\" remedy\n\ndesigned to place a plaintiff in as good a position as he would\n\nhave occupied had no transaction occurred). Rescission is a remedy\n\nof a different kind — a remedy that, in this case, aims to place\n\nBTG and its shareholders in as good a position as they would have\n\nenjoyed had the offending transaction not occurred at all.           Given\n\nthe   district   court's   superior   coign   of   vantage,   we   are   not\n\npersuaded that the court committed legal error in weighing the\n\nequities,   favoring   some   remedial   interests    over    others,    and\n\nconcluding that rescission was the remedy of choice.\n\n            An additional circumstance buttresses our view that the\n\ndistrict court exercised its judgment reasonably.             Even without\n\nspecific performance, BTG likely will end up with the entirety of\n\nits preferred shares through the put, which Holdings has already\n\ntried to exercise. Given the incestuous nature of the relationship\n\nbetween Holdings and the Fund — while they are not affiliates\n\nwithin the isthmian confines of the definition embedded in the\n\nShareholders' Agreement, they are, as we have said, plainly related\n\nparties — the put price may well represent a fairer approximation\n\nof the worth of the stock at or near the time of the attempted\n\ntransfer than would the terms agreed upon by Holdings and the\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fFund.7\n\n           The   BTG   shareholders      most       bruited   response    to     this\n\nreasoning is that a weighing of the equities rewrites the district\n\ncourt's remedial rationale.         This position relies heavily on the\n\ndistrict judge's casual statement that he was \"not doing equity.\"\n\nYet, the judge retreated from that remark almost immediately\n\nthereafter, saying \"I guess maybe I am specifically enforcing it in\n\nthe   sense   that     I'm    saying    that        the   shares   have     to     be\n\nretransferred.\" Given that these comments were made from the bench\n\nand were not repeated in the Rule 54(b) findings, we deem it wise\n\nto embrace substance over form.               See, e.g., United States v.\n\nHilton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570022\"><a href=\"/opinion/570022/united-states-v-barbara-hilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 958 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"We think it is\n\nunrealistic to expect that busy trial judges, ruling from the\n\nbench, will be infinitely precise in their choice of language.\").\n\nTo cinch matters, the judge characterized the transaction as \"void\n\nab inito\" — a characterization more consistent with rescission than\n\nwith specific performance.\n\n           We need go no further.             Finding, as we do, that the\n\ndistrict   court     was     not   limited     to    a    single   remedy      under\n\nMassachusetts law, that rescission of the transfer was within the\n\narmamentarium of permissible choices available to the court, and\n\n\n\n      7\n      The put option calls for calculation of the value of the\nshares as of January 14, 2002, only a matter of weeks after the\ndate of the transaction between Holdings and the Fund (November 1,\n2001).\n\n                                       -22-\n\fthat rescission was reasonable under the circumstances, we conclude\n\nthat the court acted within the encincture of its discretion in\n\nsimply voiding the transfer.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We summarize succinctly.   Holdings and the Fund are not\n\naffiliates within the purview of the Shareholders' Agreement.\n\nThus, Holdings breached that agreement when it did not offer the\n\nBTG shareholders an opportunity to exercise their right of first\n\nrefusal prior to effecting the challenged transfer.    Considering\n\nall the circumstances of this case, however, the lower court was\n\nnot obliged to order specific performance of the first refusal\n\nright.   Rather, the court acted within its equitable discretion\n\nwhen, after mulling both specific performance and rescission, it\n\nchose the latter.\n\n           The decision of the district court is affirmed in all\n\nrespects and the case is remanded for further proceedings.     All\n\nparties shall bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f</pre>",
