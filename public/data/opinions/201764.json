This appeal arises out of an action for\n\ncondemnation of land pursuant to the Natural Gas Act (\"NGA\"),                   15\n\nU.S.C. ยง 717f(h). The NGA grants private natural gas companies the\n\nfederal power of eminent domain in the event that they hold a\n\nCertificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (\"CPCN\") from the\n\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") and either cannot\n\nacquire property by contract, or are unable to agree with the owner\n\nof the property on the amount of compensation to be paid for a\n\nnecessary right of way for the transportation of gas.                  Id.\n\n            Appellee      Maritimes     &     Northeast     Pipeline,        L.L.C.\n\n(\"Maritimes\"), a natural gas company as defined in the NGA, 15\n\nU.S.C. ยง 717a(6), and the holder of a CPCN authorizing the building\n\nand operation of a 25-mile, 30-inch gas pipeline from Methuen to\n\nSalem, Massachusetts, filed the present action to take temporary\n\nand permanent easements on 1.55 acres of land located in Peabody,\n\nMassachusetts.      The purpose of the easements is to construct and\n\noperate an underground natural gas pipeline along the approved\n\nalignment    of     the   CPCN.        The    temporary     easement     requires\n\napproximately 0.14 acres of the property, while the permanent\n\neasement needs 0.25 acres.         The land is owned by Willowdale Realty\n\nTrust, of which appellant Nicholas J. Decoulos is the trustee.                   A\n\nbuilding    on    the   trust   land   is    leased   to   the   Mattress     Giant\n\nCorporation and Celico Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            Maritimes attempted to purchase the easement rights over\n\nthe course of several months of negotiations and discussions,\n\nduring which time an agent of Maritimes met with or attempted to\n\nmeet with Decoulos on several occasions. Having failed to reach an\n\nagreement, Maritimes dispatched a \"final offer letter\" on May 20,\n\n2002, in which Maritimes made its final bid based on an appraisal\n\nperformed by an independent, licenced Massachusetts real estate\n\nappraiser.     According to this communication, the easement was\n\nappraised at $93,894.       Nevertheless, Maritimes made a final offer\n\nof $237,400.    Upon rejection of this offer by Decoulos, Maritimes\n\nproceeded to file this suit.\n\n            Thereafter, Maritimes filed a motion for partial summary\n\njudgment and/or immediate entry, seeking an order from the district\n\ncourt to gain easement title to the required property by eminent\n\ndomain.      Notwithstanding Decoulos' opposition, the motion was\n\ngranted, allowing Maritimes to enter the property to install the\n\npipeline.      On   April   9,   2003,   the   district   court      entered   an\n\nadditional    order   authorizing    Maritimes     to   take   the    requested\n\npermanent right of way and easement.           The matter then proceeded to\n\ntrial for the purpose of determining the damages to be paid by\n\nMaritimes for the takings in question.\n\n            The case was tried before a jury, which entered a verdict\n\ndetermining the value of the permanent easement to be the amount of\n\n$68,063.     This appeal followed, in which Decoulos raises four\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fissues: (1) whether the district court erred in allowing Maritimes\n\nto proceed based on a complaint which allegedly failed to identify\n\n\"the   interest   to   be   taken\"   as    required   by   Fed.   R.   Civ.   P.\n\n71A(c)(2), (2) whether Maritimes was required to conduct its\n\nnegotiations with Decoulos in \"good faith,\" (3) whether Maritimes'\n\nactions deprive appellant of due process under the Fifth Amendment,\n\nand (4) whether the district court erred in refusing to give an\n\ninstruction requested by Decoulos regarding an alleged element of\n\ndamages.   We discuss these seriatim and find them without legal\n\nmerit.\n\n           Decoulos argues that Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A(c)(2)'s language\n\nto the effect that \"[t]he complaint shall contain a short and plain\n\nstatement . . . [of] the interests to be acquired,\" made defective\n\nMaritimes' complaint because it was \"devoid of any statement as to\n\nthe interest to be acquired,\" and thus appellant \"was subjected to\n\nthe conundrum of speculating the extent of the servitude.\"\n\n           This court has held that Rule 71A(c)(2) \"is consistent\n\nwith the notice theory of pleading embodied in the Federal Rules,\"\n\nid., under which we \"do not require a claimant to set out in detail\n\nthe facts upon which he bases his claim . . . [because of] the\n\nliberal opportunity for discovery and the other pretrial procedures\n\n. . . to disclose more precisely the basis of both claim and\n\ndefense and to define more narrowly the disputed facts and issues,\"\n\nid. (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47-48 (1957)).                    The\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fcomplaint at issue more than sufficiently notified Decoulos of the\n\nsubstance of the action sought by Maritimes.       See Southern Natural\n\nGas Co. v. Land, Cullman County, 197 F.3d 1368, 1375 (11th Cir.\n\n1999); East Tenn. Natural Gas Co. v. Sage, 361 F.3d 808, 830 (4th\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n             After deciding the partial summary judgment in favor of\n\nMaritimes, and before trial, the district court also decided\n\nMaritimes' motion in limine to the effect that Decoulos would not\n\nbe allowed to introduce any evidence of Maritimes' alleged bad\n\nfaith negotiations because, as ruled upon by the court, bad faith\n\nwas irrelevant to the issue of just compensation.\n\n             It is unclear to what Decoulos anchors his claim that\n\ngood faith negotiations must precede the filing of the condemnation\n\naction, as the NGA contains no specific language to this effect.\n\nSee Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 534-35 (2004)\n\n(inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there as well if\n\nthe   text   is   unambiguous).   The   relevant   section   of   the   NGA\n\nprovides:\n\n             When any holder of a certificate of public\n             convenience and necessity cannot acquire by\n             contract, or is unable to agree with the owner\n             of property to the compensation to be paid\n             for, the necessary right-of-way to construct,\n             operate, and maintain a pipe line or pipe\n             lines for the transportation of natural gas,\n             and the necessary land or other property, in\n             addition to right-of-way, . . .        it may\n             acquire the same by the exercise of the right\n             of eminent domain in the district court of the\n             United States for the district in which such\n\n                                  -5-\n\f          property   may   be   located,   or   in   the   State\n          courts.\n\n15 U.S.C. ยง 717f(h).\n\n          Once a CPCN is issued by the FERC, and the gas company is\n\nunable to acquire the needed land by contract or agreement with the\n\nowner, the only issue before the district court in the ensuing\n\neminent domain proceeding is the amount to be paid to the property\n\nowner as just compensation for the taking.       See Guardian Pipeline,\n\nL.L.C. v. 329.42 Acres of Land, 210 F. Supp. 2d 971, 974 (N.D. Ill.\n\n2002); Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 2 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 106, 110 (D. Mass. 1998).      Absent any credible authority\n\nmaking good faith negotiation a requirement precedent to the\n\ncondemnation action, see Kansas Pipeline Co. v. 200 Foot by 250\n\nFoot Piece of Land, 210 F. Supp. 2d 1253, 1257 (D. Kan. 2002) (\"The\n\nplain language of the NGA does not impose an obligation on a holder\n\nof a FERC certificate to negotiate in good faith before acquiring\n\nland by exercise of eminent domain . . . .\"), cf. National R.R.\n\nPassenger Corp, v. Boston and Maine Corp., 503 U.S. 407, 423 (1992)\n\n(refusing to interpret statutory language referring to parties\n\nbeing \"unable to agree\" to require Amtrak to engage in good faith\n\nnegotiations before it could invoke its condemnation powers under\n\nthe Rail Passenger Service Act), but see USG Pipeline Co. v. 174\n\nAcres, 1 F. Supp. 2d 816, 822 (E.D. Tenn. 1998) (noting that\n\n\"[c]ourts . . . have imposed a requirement that the holder of the\n\nFERC Certificate negotiate in good faith with the owners to acquire\n\n                                  -6-\n\fthe property\"), we decline the invitation to create one in this\n\ncase.   Furthermore, we do not imply that the negotiations at issue\n\nhere were not in good faith.\n\n           Appellant's due process argument is intermingled with his\n\n\"good faith\" issue, and results in a similar outcome.       Decoulos\n\nclaims that \"Maritimes, by acting in bad faith and arbitrarily\n\n. . . deprived The Trust of its property rights.\"       The district\n\ncourt rejected an offer of proof by appellant to the effect that\n\nthere was lack of uniformity in Maritimes' exercise of the power of\n\ncondemnation as between the various property owners.    The district\n\ncourt was undoubtedly correct in ruling that this matter was\n\noutside the scope of the only triable issue: the value of the\n\nproperty condemned.\n\n           The last question raised by appellant regards a claimed\n\nerror by the district court in its failure to give a requested\n\ninstruction dealing with severance and stigma damages.     There are\n\nseveral reasons why this contention should not prosper.       First,\n\nDecoulos failed to properly preserve this claim in accordance with\n\nRule 51(c).   Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c).      A party who objects to the\n\ncourt's failure to give a requested instruction must do so on the\n\nrecord before the jury retires to deliberate. See, e.g., Faigin v.\n\nKelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir. 1999).    Second, Decoulos points to\n\nnothing in the record that justifies an instruction for severance\n\nor stigma damages.    See, e.g., United States v. 760.807 Acres of\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fLand, 731 F. 2d 1443, 1448 (9th Cir. 1984) (\"Severance damages are\n\ncompensable only if the landowner incurs a direct loss reflected in\n\nthe marketplace that results from the taking.   Since the landowner\n\nhas the burden of proof in establishing severance damages, the\n\nlandowner must demonstrate that the taking caused the severance\n\ndamages.\")   (internal    quotations   and   citations    omitted).\n\nNevertheless, the district court gave an appropriate instruction\n\n(\"you may add any damages, including stigma damages, as to the\n\nremainder of the property, the part that was not taken, but which\n\nmay have been damaged by the taking and that is called severance\n\ndamages\"), and Decoulos fails to explain why this instruction was\n\ninappropriate.\n\n          We have considered all other arguments and issues raised\n\nby appellant and find them as frivolous and lacking in merit as the\n\nrest of this appeal.\n\n          Affirmed.    Appellant is granted 10 days within which to\n\nshow cause why double costs should not be imposed against him.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

The   relevant   section   of   the   NGA\n\nprovides:\n\n             When any holder of a certificate of public\n             convenience and necessity cannot acquire by\n             contract, or is unable to agree with the owner\n             of property to the compensation to be paid\n             for, the necessary right-of-way to construct,\n             operate, and maintain a pipe line or pipe\n             lines for the transportation of natural gas,\n             and the necessary land or other property, in\n             addition to right-of-way, . . .        it may\n             acquire the same by the exercise of the right\n             of eminent domain in the district court of the\n             United States for the district in which such\n\n                                  -5-\n\f          property   may   be   located,   or   in   the   State\n          courts.\n\n15 U.S.C. ยง 717f(h).\n\n          Once a CPCN is issued by the FERC, and the gas company is\n\nunable to acquire the needed land by contract or agreement with the\n\nowner, the only issue before the district court in the ensuing\n\neminent domain proceeding is the amount to be paid to the property\n\nowner as just compensation for the taking.

Furthermore, we do not imply that the negotiations at issue\n\nhere were not in good faith.\n\n           Appellant's due process argument is intermingled with his\n\n\"good faith\" issue, and results in a similar outcome.       Decoulos\n\nclaims that \"Maritimes, by acting in bad faith and arbitrarily\n\n. . . deprived The Trust of its property rights.\"       The district\n\ncourt rejected an offer of proof by appellant to the effect that\n\nthere was lack of uniformity in Maritimes' exercise of the power of\n\ncondemnation as between the various property owners.    The district\n\ncourt was undoubtedly correct in ruling that this matter was\n\noutside the scope of the only triable issue: the value of the\n\nproperty condemned.\n\n           The last question raised by appellant regards a claimed\n\nerror by the district court in its failure to give a requested\n\ninstruction dealing with severance and stigma damages.     There are\n\nseveral reasons why this contention should not prosper.       First,\n\nDecoulos failed to properly preserve this claim in accordance with\n\nRule 51(c).   Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c).      A party who objects to the\n\ncourt's failure to give a requested instruction must do so on the\n\nrecord before the jury retires to deliberate. See, e.g., Faigin v.\n\nKelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198558\"><a href=\"/opinion/198558/faigin-v-kelly-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (1st Cir. 1999).    Second, Decoulos points to\n\nnothing in the record that justifies an instruction for severance\n\nor stigma damages.    See, e.g., United States v. 760.807 Acres of\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fLand, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433853\"><a href=\"/opinion/433853/united-states-v-760807-acres-of-land-more-or-less-situate-in-the-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1448 (9th Cir. 1984) (\"Severance damages are\n\ncompensable only if the landowner incurs a direct loss reflected in\n\nthe marketplace that results from the taking.   Since the landowner\n\nhas the burden of proof in establishing severance damages, the\n\nlandowner must demonstrate that the taking caused the severance\n\ndamages.\")   (internal    quotations   and   citations    omitted).\n\nNevertheless, the district court gave an appropriate instruction\n\n(\"you may add any damages, including stigma damages, as to the\n\nremainder of the property, the part that was not taken, but which\n\nmay have been damaged by the taking and that is called severance\n\ndamages\"), and Decoulos fails to explain why this instruction was\n\ninappropriate.\n\n          We have considered all other arguments and issues raised\n\nby appellant and find them as frivolous and lacking in merit as the\n\nrest of this appeal.\n\n          Affirmed.    Appellant is granted 10 days within which to\n\nshow cause why double costs should not be imposed against him.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f</pre>",
