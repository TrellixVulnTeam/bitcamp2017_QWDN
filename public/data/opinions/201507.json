This appeal arises from a tort\n\naction brought by Dr. Iris Beth Rodríguez-Quiñones (\"Rodríguez\") in\n\ndiversity in the Puerto Rico federal district court.       The case\n\narises from the rape and robbery of Rodríguez on April 28, 2000, at\n\nClínica Las Américas (\"Clínica\")--a multi-condominium-unit medical\n\nclinic where she worked as a clinical psychologist--in Hato Rey,\n\nPuerto Rico.   The defendants were Clínica itself and a group--the\n\n\"office 410 defendants\"--composed of the owners of the office in\n\nwhich Rodríguez worked:   Dr. Jorge L. Jiménez Rivera (\"Jiménez\"),\n\nDr. Oscar A. Ruiz Locomba (\"Ruiz\"), and a partnership named Jiménez\n\n& Ruiz, S.E.\n\n          Clínica operates a five-story office building containing\n\nabout 40 health-care-related offices.      The health-care providers\n\ninclude doctors who own condominium office units in the building as\n\nwell as doctors who rent office space from the owners.       Clínica\n\nalso has multi-story parking garage next to the medical building,\n\na ground-level parking lot, and grounds.    The building is governed\n\nby a board of directors, whose members are condominium unit owners,\n\nas well as by an Executive Committee.\n\n          Jiménez and Ruiz (through their partnership) were the\n\nowners of office 410 on the fourth floor of Clínica in which they\n\nran a psychiatry and psychology practice.      Several other doctors\n\npaid to use space in the office for certain hours.     Within office\n\n410, a main door (used by patients) led from the Clínica fourth-\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\ffloor hallway into the waiting area.         In the waiting area, an\n\nintermediate door gave access to the \"back office\" area containing\n\nindividual rooms for the doctors and a receptionist’s area; a\n\nwindow in the waiting area looked through to the receptionist's\n\narea.\n\n           Rodríguez had a lease with Jiménez and Ruiz allowing her\n\nto use one of the doctors' offices in office 410 for 20 hours per\n\nweek--including 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Fridays--for her clinical\n\ntherapy practice.   On Friday afternoon, April 28, 2000, Rodríguez\n\nwas working alone in office 410; no other doctors were present and\n\nthe secretary had already left.     Between 5:00 and 5:15 p.m., two\n\nyoung men (one with a glassy-eyed look) entered the office 410\n\nwaiting area in search of a physician.       Rodríguez told them that\n\nthere were no doctors available and, after a few minutes, they\n\nleft.   Concerned, Rodríguez attempted (without success) to contact\n\nClínica security by calling the building's administrative office.\n\n           After 5:30 p.m., while Rodríguez was occupied with a\n\nyoung patient, the two men returned twice. On the second occasion,\n\nshortly after 6:00 p.m., the two men entered the waiting area and\n\nrobbed the patient’s mother.      They then proceeded into the back\n\narea where Rodríguez and the patient were in Rodríguez’ office,\n\nunsuccessfully   searched   the   back   office   area   for   cash,   and\n\neventually raped and robbed Rodríguez. The attack caused Rodríguez\n\nto suffer such trauma that she was unable to continue as a clinical\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fpsychologist in Puerto Rico and moved to New York where she found\n\nmore modest employment.\n\n          Rodríguez filed suit in the district court in Puerto\n\nRico, claiming that Clínica and the office 410 defendants were\n\nnegligent in providing security in the Clínica building and office\n\n410, respectively.   After a seven-day trial the jury found the\n\ndefendants negligent and found also that there was no \"comparative\n\nnegligence\" by Rodríguez. The jury awarded Rodríguez $2 million in\n\neconomic damages and $1.5 million for emotional and physical\n\ninjury, assigning 60 percent responsibility to Clínica and 40\n\npercent responsibility to the office 410 defendants.\n\n          The defendants filed motions for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw and for a new trial or remittitur.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, 59.\n\nThey claimed (among other things) that there was insufficient\n\nevidence of their negligence, that the jury's refusal to find\n\ncomparative negligence was mistaken, and that the award of economic\n\ndamages was excessive.    The trial court denied all motions save\n\nthat, by remittitur, it reduced economic damages to $877,481.\n\n          The office 410 defendants (but not Clínica) now appeal.\n\nDenials of motions for judgment as a matter of law are reviewed de\n\nnovo.   The evidence and credibility issues are considered in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict and we may reverse only if a\n\nreasonable jury could not have reached such a verdict. Tapalian v.\n\nTusino, 377 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2004); Trull v. Volkswagen of Am.,\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fInc., 320 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2002).      Denial of a motion for a\n\nnew trial is ordinarily overturned only to prevent \"a miscarriage\n\nof justice.\"   Trull, 320 F.3d at 8.\n\n           The appellants’ main attack is based on a supposed lack\n\nof a duty of care and insufficient evidence of negligence on their\n\npart. The pertinent evidence showed Clínica was located in a high-\n\ncrime area within San Juan and that there were a good number of\n\ncash transactions in the offices.      The evidence also showed that\n\nnumerous entrances led into the building and that security-guard\n\ncoverage was limited.   No security cameras were used as of April\n\n28, 2000, and Clínica had not implemented a number of security\n\nrecommendations that had been made to its board.\n\n           Office 410 was the last office at the end of one of the\n\nwings; its entrance was about 15 to 20 feet from an exit to a\n\nstairwell and freight elevator that led down to a lateral door\n\n(open until late at night) that let out near the external parking\n\nlot.   About 10 percent of the patients in the office paid cash\n\nwhich was given to the office secretary and placed in envelopes in\n\na drawer in the receptionist area.     Office 410 also had samples of\n\npharmaceuticals in an unlocked cabinet in one of the interior\n\noffices.\n\n           The only security in place in office 410 consisted of the\n\nlocks on the main door and the door between the waiting room and\n\nthe back office area.     There was no electronic locking system,\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f\"buzzer\" entry system, or security camera.                       The regular practice\n\nwas to leave the door to the hallway open at all times when there\n\nwere people in the office.             The secretaries regularly left the\n\noffice at 5:00 or 5:30 p.m., frequently leaving one or more doctors\n\nalone in the evening.         No instructions were given to the employees\n\nor tenants about locking the door.\n\n            There     was    mixed    evidence        as    to   Jiménez'    and   Ruiz'\n\nawareness of prior incidents of criminal conduct at Clínica within\n\nthe two years preceding the rape.                     These incidents included a\n\nbreak-in during July 1998 at the building administration offices\n\nduring which petty cash was stolen; an armed robbery in March 1999\n\nin the parking garage; and an incident in November 1999 during\n\nwhich five offices on the third, fourth, and fifth floors were\n\nburglarized.\n\n            Jiménez and Ruiz denied knowing about any of these\n\nincidents     prior   to     the   litigation.             Nevertheless,     there   was\n\ndocumentary evidence that Ruiz was on the Clínica board when the\n\nbreak-in occurred in Clínica’s administrative office.                       Jiménez was\n\na member of the board in 1998-1999, and was secretary from 1999 to\n\n2002   (and     was   part    of     the    executive        committee),     a     period\n\nencompassing both the garage robbery and the burglary of five\n\noffices.\n\n              Puerto Rico's Civil Code imposes liability for an \"act or\n\nomission\"     that    “causes      damages       to   another      through   fault    or\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fnegligence,\" article 1802, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5141 (1990); and\n\n\"fault or negligence\" may be based on \"the omission of the steps\n\nwhich may be required by the character of the obligation and which\n\nmay pertain to the circumstances of the persons, time, and place,\"\n\narticle 1057, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3021 (1990).    See Coyne v. Taber\n\nPartners I, 53 F.3d 454, 458 (1st Cir. 1995); Rivera Perez v. Cruz\n\nCorchado, 19 P.R. Offic. Trans. 10, 21 (1987).    In the case of an\n\nomission, the defendant must have been under a duty to act--here,\n\na duty to \"provide security commensurate with the circumstances\n\nattendant to their operations.\"     Coyne, 53 F.3d at 458.\n\n          Jiménez and Ruiz argue that Puerto Rico law \"does not\n\nrecognize or impose upon owners and lessors of office buildings a\n\ngeneral legal obligation to provide heightened security.\"      They\n\nrely upon cases like Jacob v. Eagle Star Insurance Co., 640 F.\n\nSupp. 117, 118 (D.P.R. 1986), which stated that \"[o]rdinarily, a\n\nperson is not responsible in tort for criminal conduct of third\n\nparties,\" and Estremera v. Inmobiliaria Rac, Inc., 9 P.R. Offic.\n\nTrans. 1150, 1154 (1980), which said that violence is \"primarily a\n\nproblem of public safety and a responsibility of the State,\" and\n\ncontinued:\n\n          [C]ontracting parties cannot be held liable\n          for the occurrence of a crime within their\n          company's premises, unless the same are of a\n          nature that demand a wider scope of protection\n          and security than can be supplied by law-\n          enforcement agencies.\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f             However, Elba A.B.M. v. Univ. of P.R., 25 P.R. Offic.\n\nTrans. 294, 125 D.P.R. 294, 299 (1990), did impose liability on a\n\nuniversity for a criminal’s attack on a student, equating the\n\nschool to hotels, schools and hospitals which provide services of\n\nan \"essential nature.\" Accord, Estremera, 9 Offic. Trans. at 1154.\n\nThe court in Elba also stressed the vulnerable nature of the\n\nstudent population, the school’s location in a high-crime area, and\n\nits operation as an enclave which local police did not ordinarily\n\nenter.   25 P.R. Offic. Trans. 294, 125 D.P.R. at 311, 315-18.\n\n             Similarly,    the     court   in   J.A.D.M.   v.   Plaza   Carolina\n\nShopping Mall, 132 D.P.R. 785, 791, 1993 P.R.-Eng. 840023 (1993),\n\nimposed a duty to provide security on large shopping malls.                   It\n\nnoted that the variety of services offered in such centers–-by\n\ngovernment    offices     (e.g.,    post   offices   and   utility      offices),\n\ncommercial enterprises, and entertainment establishments--made them\n\nlike a \"public square[]\" and thus meant they provided essential\n\nservices.      Id.   The decision said that the \"duty to provide\n\nadequate and reasonable security\" is based on both \"the nature of\n\nthe activity conducted . . . and on the foreseeability of criminal\n\nactivity.\"    Id. at 801.\n\n             Applying these criteria to the case at hand, it is easy\n\nto conclude that Clínica did have a duty to provide security.                But\n\nthe harder question is whether the Puerto Rico courts would impose\n\non Jiménez and Ruiz a duty to provide security in office 410 to\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fprotect their part-time physician tenants.   On the one hand, the\n\nindividual Clínica offices, like the building itself, are within a\n\nhigh-crime area; cash transactions occur within the building; and\n\npersons can freely enter the main building and then proceed to\n\nindividual offices where they are not visible to such few security\n\nguards as may patrol the building and garage.   Enhanced danger is\n\ncertainly foreseeable.\n\n          On the other hand, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has\n\nshown evident reluctance to create duties disproportionate to the\n\nability of business to protect against dangers of wrongdoing by\n\nthird parties.   See J.A.D.M., 132 D.P.R. at 799, 1993 P.R.-Eng.\n\n840023 (noting that imposing liability too easily would mean that\n\n“every store or warehouse would have to be policed by the owner”);\n\ncf. Jacobs, 640 F. Supp. at 119 (taxi operator is not liable for\n\ncriminal attacks on passengers).   Yet, despite these hesitations,\n\nthe Puerto Rico courts have not suggested that small businesses are\n\nautomatically exempt from providing reasonable protection against\n\nknown dangers, whether by warnings, security features or otherwise.\n\n          All we can say is that the Commonwealth courts have not\n\nclearly drawn a line cutting off liability. While the Puerto Rican\n\ncourts may well pause before requiring every small business to\n\nprovide a security guard, the duties sought to be imposed in this\n\ncase are far more moderate.   The appellants here operated a small\n\nindoor facility and could easily have improved security at modest\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fexpense--here, by installing a security camera and buzzer system\n\nand by changing some of its office practices.          Indeed, there is no\n\nindication that Rodríguez was even warned of crimes committed\n\nearlier on the premises.\n\n              The jury in this case was instructed that an owner or\n\nlessor has no duty to protect tenants from criminal acts unless\n\nthey   are    foreseeable;    that   institutions   providing     “essential\n\nservices” have a heightened responsibility to provide security;\n\nthat there is no duty to protect against the general level of\n\ncriminality that exists in society; and that the defendants in this\n\ncase   had    to   maintain   “reasonable   security      measures   for   the\n\nprotection of [their] guests and patients.” We are not prepared to\n\nsay that this summary of Puerto Rico law is mistaken.\n\n              The office 410 defendants say that the kind of violent\n\nattack that occurred was not foreseeable and that the earlier\n\nincidents involved petty property theft or were “outside” in the\n\ngarage.      In fact, the perpetrators in this case sought cash in the\n\nback area of the office and found none before turning on Rodríguez\n\nherself.      Further, an armed robbery--an episode with an obvious\n\npotential for great harm--had occurred in the attached garage\n\nbuilding.       Despite   defendants'   denials,    the    jury   could    have\n\nconcluded from the evidence already described that the defendants'\n\nconnections with the building would have given them some knowledge\n\nof the prior episodes.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f          As for negligence, the parties stipulated that the cost\n\nof an electronic lock would have been $285; of a buzzer $45; and of\n\na security camera $78, and that these devices could have been\n\ninstalled at Office 410.    From this evidence, a jury could have\n\nrationally concluded that such relatively low-cost measures, along\n\nwith changing office practice to locking the front door (and\n\nrequiring patients to ring a buzzer) in the late afternoon when no\n\none was at the front desk, were required for adequate security and\n\nthat these measures would have prevented the rape.\n\n          The   jury   declined     to   find   that   Rodríguez   was\n\ncomparatively negligent, leaving the defendants liable for the\n\nfull damages.   See 31 P.R. Laws Ann. § 5141; Mejias-Quiros v.\n\nMaxxam Prop. Corp., 108 F.3d 425, 427 (1st Cir. 1997).    Jiménez and\n\nRuiz say this was error because--for example--Rodríguez was already\n\nsuspicious of the assailants and did no more than seek to call\n\nsecurity and then failed to lock the outer door even though her\n\nlast patient had arrived.    In deciding what a reasonable person\n\ncould do, a jury’s latitude is considerable and we do not think\n\nthat comparative negligence was present as a matter of law.\n\n          Finally, the office 410 defendants say that the trial\n\ncourt's reduction of economic damages from $2 million to about\n\n$877,000 was inadequate.    At trial each side had by agreement\n\nsubmitted expert reports on lost income in lieu of testimony.\n\nRodríguez' expert estimated an annual \"maximum potential gross\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fincome\" for her of $165,966 based on an estimated number of\n\nsessions with patients and other expected work (e.g., teaching);\n\nbut in his damage calculations, the expert employed a figure of\n\n$110,000     offered          by    Rodríguez     herself,      describing     it    as\n\n\"conservative.\"         This led the expert to support at trial a total\n\nnet figure for economic damages of $332,000.1\n\n             The district judge deemed the jury’s $2 million figure\n\nexcessive    but       did    not     reduce    the   damages   back   to   $332,000.\n\nInstead, the district court adopted $877,000 as the figure needed\n\nto   avoid   a    new        trial.       The   judge    reached   this     figure   by\n\nsubstituting, in the expert's earlier computation, the expert’s\n\noriginal estimate of annual gross income for Rodríguez (about\n\n$166,000) in place of Rodríguez' own estimate ($110,000).                            The\n\nappellants       say    that        the   expert’s      ultimate   $332,000    figure\n\n(predicated on the $110,000 estimated income) should have capped\n\nRodríguez’ economic recovery.\n\n             Where the jury exceeds a rationally supportable figure,\n\nthe judge’s remittitur figure must be within the range rationally\n\nsupported by evidence.              See Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 215\n\n(1st Cir. 1987); Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys., 746 F.2d 78, 81 (1st\n\nCir. 1984).      We conclude that the $877,000 figure is supported by\n\n\n      1\n      The $332,000 figure was derived by reducing the annual\nestimated gross income in each year by both (1) the estimated\nexpenses that would have been incurred and (2) the net income that\nRodríguez was expected to earn in her new job, and then discounting\nthe projected annual differentials to present value.\n\n                                           -12-\n\fthe record.   A fact-finder might well choose to hold Rodríguez to\n\nher own horseback estimate of $110,000 but the evidence contained\n\nthe fully explained $166,000 figure as well as the computation\n\nneeded to derive the $877,000 total.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

The case arises from the rape and robbery of Rodr&#237;guez on April 28, 2000, at Cl&#237;nica Las Am&#233;ricas (\"Cl&#237;nica\") &#8212; a multi-condominium-unit medical clinic where she worked as a clinical psychologist &#8212; in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. The defendants were Cl&#237;nica itself and a group &#8212; the \"office 410 defendants\" &#8212;composed of the owners of the office in which Rodr&#237;guez worked: Dr. Jorge L. Jim&#233;nez Rivera (\"Jim&#233;nez\"), Dr. Oscar A. Ruiz Locomba (\"Ruiz\"), and a partnership named Jim&#233;nez &amp; Ruiz, S.E.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cl&#237;nica operates a five-story office building containing about 40 health-care-related offices. The health-care providers include doctors who own condominium office units in the building as well as doctors who rent office space from the owners. Cl&#237;nica also has a multi-story parking garage next to the medical building, a ground-level parking lot, and grounds. The building is governed by a board of directors, whose members are condominium unit owners, as well as by an Executive Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez and Ruiz (through their partnership) were the owners of office 410 on the fourth floor of Cl&#237;nica in which they ran a psychiatry and psychology practice. Several other doctors paid to use space in the office for certain hours. Within office 410, a main door (used by patients) led from the Cl&#237;nica fourth-floor hallway into the waiting area. In the waiting area, an intermediate door gave access to the \"back office\" area containing individual rooms for the doctors and a receptionist's area; a window in the waiting area looked through to the receptionist's area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez had a lease with Jim&#233;nez and Ruiz allowing her to use one of the doctors' offices in office 410 for 20 hours per week &#8212; including 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Fridays &#8212; for her clinical therapy practice. On Friday afternoon, April 28, 2000, Rodr&#237;guez was working alone in office 410; no other doctors were present and the secretary had already left. Between 5:00 and 5:15 p.m., two young men (one with a glassy-eyed look) entered the office 410 waiting area in search of a physician. Rodr&#237;guez told them that there were no doctors available and, after a few minutes, they left. Concerned, Rodr&#237;guez attempted (without success) to contact Cl&#237;nica security by calling the building's administrative office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After 5:30 p.m., while Rodr&#237;guez was occupied with a young patient, the two men returned twice. On the second occasion, shortly after 6:00 p.m., the two men entered the waiting area and robbed the patient's mother. They then proceeded into the back area where Rodr&#237;guez and the patient were in Rodr&#237;guez' office, unsuccessfully searched the back office area for cash, and eventually raped and robbed Rodr&#237;guez. The attack caused Rodr&#237;guez to suffer such trauma that she was unable to continue as a clinical psychologist in Puerto Rico and moved to New York where she found more modest employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez filed suit in the district court in Puerto Rico, claiming that Cl&#237;nica and the office 410 defendants were negligent in providing security in the Cl&#237;nica building and office 410, respectively. After a seven-day trial the jury found the defendants negligent and found also that there was no \"comparative negligence\" by Rodr&#237;guez. The jury awarded Rodr&#237;guez $2 million in economic damages and $1.5 million for emotional and physical injury, assigning 60 percent responsibility to Cl&#237;nica and 40 percent responsibility to the office 410 defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants filed motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial or remittitur. Fed.R.Civ.P. 50, 59. They claimed (among other things) that there was insufficient evidence of their negligence, that the jury's refusal to find comparative negligence was mistaken, and that the award of economic damages was excessive. The trial court denied all motions save that, by remittitur, it reduced economic damages to $877,481.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The office 410 defendants (but not Cl&#237;nica) now appeal. Denials of motions for judgment as a matter of law are reviewed <i>de novo.</i> The evidence and credibility issues are considered in the light most favorable to the verdict and we may reverse only if a reasonable jury could not have reached such a verdict. <i>Tapalian v. Tusino,</i> 377 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Trull v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc.,</i> 320 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.2002). Denial of a motion for a new trial is ordinarily overturned only to prevent \"a miscarriage of justice.\" <i>Trull,</i> 320 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' main attack is based on a supposed lack of a duty of care and insufficient evidence of negligence on their part. The pertinent evidence showed Cl&#237;nica was located in a high-crime area within San Juan and that there were a good number of cash transactions in the offices. The evidence also showed that numerous entrances led into the building and that security-guard coverage was limited. No security cameras were used as of April 28, 2000, and Cl&#237;nica had not implemented a number of security recommendations that had been made to its board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Office 410 was the last office at the end of one of the wings; its entrance was about 15 to 20 feet from an exit to a stairwell and freight elevator that led down to a lateral door (open until late at night) that let out near the external parking lot. About 10 percent of the patients in the office paid cash which was given to the office secretary and placed in envelopes in a drawer in the receptionist area. Office 410 also had samples of pharmaceuticals in an unlocked cabinet in one of the interior offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only security in place in office 410 consisted of the locks on the main door and the door between the waiting room and the back office area. There was no electronic locking system, \"buzzer\" entry system, or security camera. The regular practice was to leave the door to the hallway open at all times when there were people in the office. The secretaries regularly left the office at 5:00 or 5:30 p.m., frequently leaving one or more doctors alone in the evening. No instructions were given to the employees or tenants about locking the door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was mixed evidence as to Jim&#233;nez' and Ruiz' awareness of prior incidents of criminal conduct at Cl&#237;nica within the two years preceding the rape. These incidents included a break-in during July 1998 at the building administration offices during which petty cash was stolen; an armed robbery in March 1999 in the parking garage; and an incident in November 1999 during which five offices on the third, fourth, and fifth floors were burglarized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez and Ruiz denied knowing about any of these incidents prior to the litigation. Nevertheless, there was documentary evidence that Ruiz was on the Cl&#237;nica board when the break-in occurred in Cl&#237;nica's administrative office. Jim&#233;nez was a member of the board in 1998-1999, and was secretary from 1999 to 2002 (and was part of the executive committee), a period encompassing both the garage robbery and the burglary of five offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's Civil Code imposes liability for an \"act or omission\" that \"causes damages to another through fault or negligence,\" article 1802, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5141 (1990); and \"fault or negligence\" may be based on \"the omission of the steps which may be required by the character of the obligation and which may pertain to the circumstances of the persons, time, and place,\" article 1057, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 3021 (1990). <i>See Coyne v. Taber Partners I,</i> 53 F.3d 454, 458 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Rivera Perez v. Cruz Corchado,</i> 19 P.R. Offic. Trans. 10, 21 (1987). In the case of an omission, the defendant must have been under a duty to act &#8212; here, a duty to \"provide security commensurate with the circumstances attendant to their operations.\" <i>Coyne,</i> 53 F.3d at 458.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez and Ruiz argue that Puerto Rico law \"does not recognize or impose upon owners and lessors of office buildings a general legal obligation to provide heightened security.\" They rely upon cases like <i>Jacob v. Eagle Star Insurance Co.,</i> 640 F.Supp. 117, 118 (D.P.R.1986), which stated that \"[o]rdinarily, a person is not responsible in tort for criminal conduct of third parties,\" and <i>Estremera v. Inmobiliaria Rac, Inc.,</i> 9 P.R. Offic. Trans. 1150, 1154, 1980 WL 138530 (1980), which said that violence is \"primarily a problem of public safety and a responsibility of the State,\" and continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[C]ontracting parties cannot be held liable for the occurrence of a crime within their company's premises, unless the same are of a nature that demand a wider scope of protection and security than can be supplied by law-enforcement agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, <i>Elba A.B.M. v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> 25 P.R. Offic. Trans. 294, 125 D.P.R. 294, 299, 1990 WL 658047 (1990), did impose liability on a university for a criminal's attack on a student, equating the institution to hotels, schools and hospitals which provide services of an \"essential nature.\" <i>Accord, Estremera,</i> 9 Offic. Trans. at 1154. The court in <i>Elba</i> also stressed the vulnerable nature of the student population, the school's location in a high-crime area, and its operation as an enclave which local police did not ordinarily enter. 25 P.R. Offic. Trans. 294, 125 D.P.R. at 311, 315-18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the court in <i>J.A.D.M. v. Plaza Carolina Shopping Mall,</i> 132 D.P.R. 785, 791, 1993 P.R.-Eng. 840023, 1993 WL 840023 (1993), imposed a duty to provide security on large shopping malls. It noted that the variety of services offered in such centers &#8212; by government offices (<i>e.g.,</i> post offices and utility offices), commercial enterprises, and entertainment establishments &#8212; made them like a \"public square[]\" and thus meant they provided essential services. <i>Id.</i> The decision said that the \"duty to provide adequate and reasonable security\" is based on both \"the nature of the activity conducted... and on the foreseeability of criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i> at 801.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these criteria to the case at hand, it is easy to conclude that Cl&#237;nica did have a duty to provide security. But the harder question is whether the Puerto Rico courts would impose on Jim&#233;nez and Ruiz a duty to provide security in office 410 to protect their part-time physician tenants. On the one hand, the individual Cl&#237;nica offices, like the building itself, are within a high-crime area; cash transactions occur within the building; and persons can freely enter the main building and then proceed to individual offices where they are not visible to such few security guards as may patrol the building and garage. Enhanced danger is certainly foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has shown evident reluctance to create duties disproportionate to the ability of business to protect against dangers of wrongdoing by third parties. <i>See J.A.D.M.,</i> 132 D.P.R. at 799, 1993 P.R.-Eng. 840023 (noting that imposing liability too easily would mean that \"every store or warehouse would have to be policed by the owner\"); <i>cf. Jacob,</i> 640 F.Supp. at 119 (taxi operator is not liable for criminal attacks on passengers). Yet, despite these hesitations, the Puerto Rico courts have not suggested that small businesses are automatically exempt from providing reasonable protection against known dangers, whether by warnings, security features or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All we can say is that the Commonwealth courts have not clearly drawn a line cutting off liability. While the Puerto Rican courts may well pause before requiring every small business to provide a security guard, the duties sought to be imposed in this case are far more moderate. The appellants here operated a small indoor facility and could easily have improved security at modest expense &#8212; here, by installing a security camera and buzzer system and by changing some of its office practices. Indeed, there is no indication that Rodr&#237;guez was even warned of crimes committed earlier on the Cl&#237;nica premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury in this case was instructed that an owner or lessor has no duty to protect tenants from criminal acts unless they are foreseeable; that institutions providing \"essential services\" have a heightened responsibility to provide security; that there is no duty to protect against the general level of criminality that exists in society; and that the defendants in this case had to maintain \"reasonable security measures for the protection of [their] guests and patients.\" We are not prepared to say that this summary of Puerto Rico law is mistaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The office 410 defendants say that the kind of violent attack that occurred was not foreseeable and that the earlier incidents involved petty property theft or were \"outside\" in the garage. In fact, the perpetrators in this case sought cash in the back area of the office and found none before turning on Rodr&#237;guez herself. Further, an armed robbery &#8212; an episode with an obvious potential for great harm &#8212; had occurred in the attached garage building. Despite defendants' denials, the jury could have concluded from the evidence already described that the defendants' connections with the building would have given them some knowledge of the prior episodes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for negligence, the parties stipulated that the cost of an electronic lock would have been $285; of a buzzer $45; and of a security camera $78, and that these devices could have been installed at Office 410. From this evidence, a jury could have rationally concluded that such relatively low-cost measures, along with changing office practice to locking the front door (and requiring patients to ring a buzzer) in the late afternoon when no one was at the front desk, were required for adequate security and that these measures would have prevented the rape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury declined to find that Rodr&#237;guez was comparatively negligent, leaving the defendants liable for the full damages. <i>See</i> 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5141; <i>Mejias-Quiros v. Maxxam Prop. Corp.,</i> 108 F.3d 425, 427 (1st Cir.1997). Jim&#233;nez and Ruiz say this was error because &#8212; for example &#8212; Rodr&#237;guez was already suspicious of the assailants and did no more than seek to call security and then failed to lock the outer door even though her last patient had arrived. In deciding what a reasonable person could do, a jury's latitude is considerable and we do not think that comparative negligence was present as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the office 410 defendants say that the trial court's reduction of economic damages from $2 million to about $877,000 was inadequate. At trial each side had by agreement submitted expert reports on lost income in lieu of testimony. Rodr&#237;guez' expert estimated an annual \"maximum potential gross income\" for her of $165,966 based on an estimated number of sessions with patients and other expected work (<i>e.g.,</i> teaching); but in his damage calculations, the expert employed a figure of $110,000 offered by Rodr&#237;guez herself, describing it as \"conservative.\" This led the expert to support at trial a total net figure for economic damages of $332,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge deemed the jury's $2 million figure excessive but did not reduce the damages back to $332,000. Instead, the district court adopted $877,000 as the figure needed to avoid a new trial. The judge reached this figure by substituting, in the expert's earlier computation, the expert's original estimate of annual gross income for Rodr&#237;guez (about $166,000) in place of Rodr&#237;guez' own estimate ($110,000). The appellants say that the expert's ultimate $332,000 figure (predicated on the $110,000 estimated income) should have capped Rodr&#237;guez' economic recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the jury exceeds a rationally supportable figure, the judge's remittitur figure must be within the range rationally supported by evidence. <i>See Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> 829 F.2d 196, 215 (1st Cir.1987); <i>Segal v. Gilbert Color Sys.,</i> 746 F.2d 78, 81 (1st Cir.1984). We conclude that the $877,000 figure is supported by the record. A fact-finder might well choose to hold Rodr&#237;guez to her own horseback estimate of $110,000 but the evidence contained the fully explained $166,000 figure as well as the computation needed to derive the $877,000 total.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The $332,000 figure was derived by reducing the annual estimated gross income in each year by both (1) the estimated expenses that would have been incurred and (2) the net income that Rodr&#237;guez was expected to earn in her new job, and then discounting the projected annual differentials to present value</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Concerned, Rodr&#237;guez attempted (without success) to contact Cl&#237;nica security by calling the building's administrative office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After 5:30 p.m., while Rodr&#237;guez was occupied with a young patient, the two men returned twice. On the second occasion, shortly after 6:00 p.m., the two men entered the waiting area and robbed the patient's mother. They then proceeded into the back area where Rodr&#237;guez and the patient were in Rodr&#237;guez' office, unsuccessfully searched the back office area for cash, and eventually raped and robbed Rodr&#237;guez. The attack caused Rodr&#237;guez to suffer such trauma that she was unable to continue as a clinical psychologist in Puerto Rico and moved to New York where she found more modest employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodr&#237;guez filed suit in the district court in Puerto Rico, claiming that Cl&#237;nica and the office 410 defendants were negligent in providing security in the Cl&#237;nica building and office 410, respectively. After a seven-day trial the jury found the defendants negligent and found also that there was no \"comparative negligence\" by Rodr&#237;guez. The jury awarded Rodr&#237;guez $2 million in economic damages and $1.5 million for emotional and physical injury, assigning 60 percent responsibility to Cl&#237;nica and 40 percent responsibility to the office 410 defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants filed motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial or remittitur. Fed.R.Civ.P. 50, 59. They claimed (among other things) that there was insufficient evidence of their negligence, that the jury's refusal to find comparative negligence was mistaken, and that the award of economic damages was excessive. The trial court denied all motions save that, by remittitur, it reduced economic damages to $877,481.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The office 410 defendants (but not Cl&#237;nica) now appeal.

The pertinent evidence showed Cl&#237;nica was located in a high-crime area within San Juan and that there were a good number of cash transactions in the offices. The evidence also showed that numerous entrances led into the building and that security-guard coverage was limited. No security cameras were used as of April 28, 2000, and Cl&#237;nica had not implemented a number of security recommendations that had been made to its board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Office 410 was the last office at the end of one of the wings; its entrance was about 15 to 20 feet from an exit to a stairwell and freight elevator that led down to a lateral door (open until late at night) that let out near the external parking lot. About 10 percent of the patients in the office paid cash which was given to the office secretary and placed in envelopes in a drawer in the receptionist area. Office 410 also had samples of pharmaceuticals in an unlocked cabinet in one of the interior offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only security in place in office 410 consisted of the locks on the main door and the door between the waiting room and the back office area. There was no electronic locking system, \"buzzer\" entry system, or security camera. The regular practice was to leave the door to the hallway open at all times when there were people in the office. The secretaries regularly left the office at 5:00 or 5:30 p.m., frequently leaving one or more doctors alone in the evening. No instructions were given to the employees or tenants about locking the door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was mixed evidence as to Jim&#233;nez' and Ruiz' awareness of prior incidents of criminal conduct at Cl&#237;nica within the two years preceding the rape. These incidents included a break-in during July 1998 at the building administration offices during which petty cash was stolen; an armed robbery in March 1999 in the parking garage; and an incident in November 1999 during which five offices on the third, fourth, and fifth floors were burglarized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jim&#233;nez and Ruiz denied knowing about any of these incidents prior to the litigation. Nevertheless, there was documentary evidence that Ruiz was on the Cl&#237;nica board when the break-in occurred in Cl&#237;nica's administrative office. Jim&#233;nez was a member of the board in 1998-1999, and was secretary from 1999 to 2002 (and was part of the executive committee), a period encompassing both the garage robbery and the burglary of five offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico's Civil Code imposes liability for an \"act or omission\" that \"causes damages to another through fault or negligence,\" article 1802, 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5141 (1990); and \"fault or negligence\" may be based on \"the omission of the steps which may be required by the character of the obligation and which may pertain to the circumstances of the persons, time, and place,\" article 1057, 31 P.R.

The court in <i>Elba</i> also stressed the vulnerable nature of the student population, the school's location in a high-crime area, and its operation as an enclave which local police did not ordinarily enter. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.

Plaza Carolina Shopping Mall,</i> 132 D.P.R. 785, 791, 1993 P.R.-Eng. 840023, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">840023</span></span> (1993), imposed a duty to provide security on large shopping malls. It noted that the variety of services offered in such centers &#8212; by government offices (<i>e.g.,</i> post offices and utility offices), commercial enterprises, and entertainment establishments &#8212; made them like a \"public square[]\" and thus meant they provided essential services. <i>Id.</i> The decision said that the \"duty to provide adequate and reasonable security\" is based on both \"the nature of the activity conducted... and on the foreseeability of criminal activity.\" <i>Id.</i> at 801.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these criteria to the case at hand, it is easy to conclude that Cl&#237;nica did have a duty to provide security. But the harder question is whether the Puerto Rico courts would impose on Jim&#233;nez and Ruiz a duty to provide security in office 410 to protect their part-time physician tenants. On the one hand, the individual Cl&#237;nica offices, like the building itself, are within a high-crime area; cash transactions occur within the building; and persons can freely enter the main building and then proceed to individual offices where they are not visible to such few security guards as may patrol the building and garage. Enhanced danger is certainly foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has shown evident reluctance to create duties disproportionate to the ability of business to protect against dangers of wrongdoing by third parties. <i>See J.A.D.M.,</i> 132 D.P.R. at 799, 1993 P.R.-Eng. 840023 (noting that imposing liability too easily would mean that \"every store or warehouse would have to be policed by the owner\"); <i>cf. Jacob,</i> 640 F.Supp. at 119 (taxi operator is not liable for criminal attacks on passengers). Yet, despite these hesitations, the Puerto Rico courts have not suggested that small businesses are automatically exempt from providing reasonable protection against known dangers, whether by warnings, security features or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All we can say is that the Commonwealth courts have not clearly drawn a line cutting off liability. While the Puerto Rican courts may well pause before requiring every small business to provide a security guard, the duties sought to be imposed in this case are far more moderate. The appellants here operated a small indoor facility and could easily have improved security at modest expense &#8212; here, by installing a security camera and buzzer system and by changing some of its office practices. Indeed, there is no indication that Rodr&#237;guez was even warned of crimes committed earlier on the Cl&#237;nica premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury in this case was instructed that an owner or lessor has no duty to protect tenants from criminal acts unless they are foreseeable; that institutions providing \"essential services\" have a heightened responsibility to provide security; that there is no duty to protect against the general level of criminality that exists in society; and that the defendants in this case had to maintain \"reasonable security measures for the protection of [their] guests and patients.\" We are not prepared to say that this summary of Puerto Rico law is mistaken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The office 410 defendants say that the kind of violent attack that occurred was not foreseeable and that the earlier incidents involved petty property theft or were \"outside\" in the garage. In fact, the perpetrators in this case sought cash in the back area of the office and found none before turning on Rodr&#237;guez herself. Further, an armed robbery &#8212; an episode with an obvious potential for great harm &#8212; had occurred in the attached garage building. Despite defendants' denials, the jury could have concluded from the evidence already described that the defendants' connections with the building would have given them some knowledge of the prior episodes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for negligence, the parties stipulated that the cost of an electronic lock would have been $285; of a buzzer $45; and of a security camera $78, and that these devices could have been installed at Office 410. From this evidence, a jury could have rationally concluded that such relatively low-cost measures, along with changing office practice to locking the front door (and requiring patients to ring a buzzer) in the late afternoon when no one was at the front desk, were required for adequate security and that these measures would have prevented the rape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury declined to find that Rodr&#237;guez was comparatively negligent, leaving the defendants liable for the full damages. <i>See</i> 31 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 5141; <i>Mejias-Quiros v. Maxxam Prop. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197243\"><a href=\"/opinion/197243/mejias-quiroz-v-maxam-property-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, 427 (1st Cir.1997). Jim&#233;nez and Ruiz say this was error because &#8212; for example &#8212; Rodr&#237;guez was already suspicious of the assailants and did no more than seek to call security and then failed to lock the outer door even though her last patient had arrived. In deciding what a reasonable person could do, a jury's latitude is considerable and we do not think that comparative negligence was present as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the office 410 defendants say that the trial court's reduction of economic damages from $2 million to about $877,000 was inadequate. At trial each side had by agreement submitted expert reports on lost income in lieu of testimony. Rodr&#237;guez' expert estimated an annual \"maximum potential gross income\" for her of $165,966 based on an estimated number of sessions with patients and other expected work (<i>e.g.,</i> teaching); but in his damage calculations, the expert employed a figure of $110,000 offered by Rodr&#237;guez herself, describing it as \"conservative.\" This led the expert to support at trial a total net figure for economic damages of $332,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge deemed the jury's $2 million figure excessive but did not reduce the damages back to $332,000. Instead, the district court adopted $877,000 as the figure needed to avoid a new trial. The judge reached this figure by substituting, in the expert's earlier computation, the expert's original estimate of annual gross income for Rodr&#237;guez (about $166,000) in place of Rodr&#237;guez' own estimate ($110,000). The appellants say that the expert's ultimate $332,000 figure (predicated on the $110,000 estimated income) should have capped Rodr&#237;guez' economic recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the jury exceeds a rationally supportable figure, the judge's remittitur figure must be within the range rationally supported by evidence. <i>See Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 215 (1st Cir.1987); <i>Segal v.

We conclude that the $877,000 figure is supported by the record. A fact-finder might well choose to hold Rodr&#237;guez to her own horseback estimate of $110,000 but the evidence contained the fully explained $166,000 figure as well as the computation needed to derive the $877,000 total.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The $332,000 figure was derived by reducing the annual estimated gross income in each year by both (1) the estimated expenses that would have been incurred and (2) the net income that Rodr&#237;guez was expected to earn in her new job, and then discounting the projected annual differentials to present value</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
