Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lipez, Circuit Judge,\n                    Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Barbadoro,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Barry S. Pollack with whom Donnelly, Conroy & Gelhaar was on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Mary A. Azzarito with whom Stephen J. Cullen and Miles &\nStockbridge, P.C. were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          January 22, 2004\n\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge. This is an appeal from an award\n\nof attorney's fees and expenses to petitioner-appellee, who brought\n\nan action to secure the return of his child from the United States\n\nto her habitual residence, Mexico, under the Hague Convention on\n\nthe Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, T.I.A.S. No.\n\n11,670, 19 I.L.M. 1501 (1980).        We ordered the child's mother, the\n\nrespondent-appellant, to return the child in Whallon v. Lynn, 230\n\nF.3d 450 (1st Cir. 2000).       She now challenges the fee award.\n\n     The district court granted petitioner's request for fees and\n\ncosts    under   the   legislation    implementing    the   Convention,   the\n\nInternational Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 U.S.C. §\n\n11607(b)(3), which pertinently states, \"Any court ordering the\n\nreturn of a child pursuant to an action brought under section 11603\n\nof this title shall order the respondent to pay necessary expenses\n\nincurred by or on behalf of the petitioner . . . unless the\n\nrespondent       establishes   that    such   order    would    be   clearly\n\ninappropriate.\"\n\n        The court first engaged in a meticulous review of the claimed\n\nfees and expenses to determine their necessity.             In a methodical\n\nweeding of relevant and adequately supported expenses from those\n\nclearly unnecessary or inadequately explained or supported, it\n\nreduced the award for expenses by more than seventy percent (from\n\n$23,463.17 to $6,929.78). After considering the requested fees for\n\nboth United States and Mexican counsel, the court found the claimed\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f234.1 hours \"extreme even granting that this is an extraordinarily\n\ncontentious case.\"         It reduced the fees awarded by one half (from\n\n$41,403 to $20,701.50).\n\n      The court then considered respondent's claim that an award of\n\nthe magnitude requested was inappropriate because she was unable to\n\npay for it, living on loans from family and friends.                         It then\n\nfurther reduced the legal fees by 25 percent (from $20,701.50 to\n\n$15,526.13).         It    cited    two    cases       that   have    considered    a\n\nrespondent's limited financial means and the economic impact on the\n\nchildren in reducing a fee award.                See Rydder v. Rydder, 49 F.3d\n\n369, 373-74 (8th Cir. 1995) (46 percent reduction because of\n\nrespondent's \"straitened financial circumstances\"); Berendsen v.\n\nNichols,    938     F.    Supp.   737,    739    (D.   Kan.   1996)    (15   percent\n\nreduction; \"a fee award which unduly limited respondent's ability\n\nto support his children would be 'clearly inappropriate'\").\n\n      In sum, the court's reductions of fees and expenses amounted\n\nto   65   percent    (from    $64,866.17        to   $22,455.91).      In    granting\n\npetitioner's motion, the court specified that one firm, Miles &\n\nStockbridge, be awarded $13,973.91 (covering both allowed fees and\n\nexpenses), and that the Mexican firm of Tucker & Cinquegrana be\n\nawarded $8,482.\n\n                                    Discussion\n\n      Respondent raises two issues on appeal.                  She claims, first,\n\nthat the court erred in not considering \"either the failure of\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f[petitioner] to pay child support or how the award would affect the\n\nbest interests of the child,\" and second, that it erred in awarding\n\nfees and expenses \"in favor of counsel, rather than in favor of the\n\nparty.\"\n\n     With reference to the matters considered by the court in\n\ndetermining fees and expenses, counsel agreed at oral argument that\n\nthe standard governing our review is abuse of discretion.                          This is\n\nconsistent with such cases dealing with attorney's fee awards as\n\nLarch v. Mansfield Mun. Elec. Dep't, 272 F.3d 63, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n     Respondent asserts that the court \"refused to delve as deeply\n\nas was necessary\" into respondent's financial condition to protect\n\nthe child's      best    interests,   and        that      it    refused    to   consider\n\npetitioner's flagrant failure to make support payments in an amount\n\nalleged    to   exceed     the   amount    of        the   fee   award.         Respondent\n\nacknowledges      that     there    are         no     cases      where     a    \"clearly\n\ninappropriate\" standard has resulted in denial of all fees to a\n\nparty successful in seeking return of a child, but avers that no\n\nother known petitioner was guilty of such egregious failure to\n\nsupport.\n\n         The    district    court   has     the        duty,     under     42    U.S.C.   §\n\n11607(b)(3), to order the payment of necessary expenses and legal\n\nfees, subject to a broad caveat denoted by the words, \"clearly\n\ninappropriate.\" We agree with the Berendsen and Rydder courts that\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fpreserving the ability of a respondent to care for her child is an\n\nimportant factor to consider.       We also read the statute as giving\n\nthe district court broad discretion in its effort to comply with\n\nthe Hague Convention consistently with our own laws and standards.\n\nFinally, it is clear from the statute that the respondent has the\n\nburden to establish that a fee/expense order would be clearly\n\ninappropriate.\n\n     Our review convinces us that the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion.    We begin by looking at what was presented to the\n\ndistrict court for its decision. After petitioner filed his motion\n\nfor fees on August 17, 2000, respondent filed an opposition,\n\nlisting seven reasons, beginning with her \"straitened financial\n\ncircumstances.\"    Petitioner's failure to support respondent and\n\ntheir child was listed only as one of the reasons why respondent\n\nshould not be burdened by a fee requirement.      In its decision, the\n\ncourt stated that an award in the amount claimed for fees and\n\nexpenses   would   be   \"'clearly    inappropriate'   for   the   reasons\n\n[respondent] articulated.\"\n\n     Following the court's decision on April 18, 2003 – some two\n\nand a half years after her original opposition – respondent filed\n\na motion for reconsideration in which the only basis for reversal\n\nwas the court's failure to consider petitioner's neglect of his\n\nchild support obligations for several years.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f      We do not accept respondent's belated invitation to use a fee\n\naward determination arising out of Hague Convention proceedings as\n\na means of rectifying past violations of child support obligations.\n\nOur focus remains on the question whether respondent has clearly\n\nestablished that it is likely that her child will be significantly\n\nadversely affected by the court's award.           The only evidence given\n\nus   of   respondent's   ability   to    provide   for   her   child    is   the\n\naffidavit she submitted to the court over two years earlier, on\n\nNovember 27, 2000, and never supplemented.          This two page document\n\ncontains four averments of a general or conclusory nature: (1) she\n\nwas \"financially unable to contribute to [petitioner's] attorneys'\n\nfees;\" (2) she has \"not been employed outside of the home for over\n\na year;\" (3) she has \"no source of income;\" and (4) she has\n\n\"obtained loans from family and friends\" for support.\n\n      Before   this   affidavit    was    filed,    on   August   28,    2000,\n\nrespondent, in her opposition to petitioner's motion for fees,\n\nstated: \"If the Court is inclined to award attorneys' fees and\n\nexpenses, Respondent requests a reduction in the attorneys' fees\n\nand costs requested by Petitioner given her financial status and\n\nher ability to support Micheli.\"          About eight months later, after\n\nthe affidavit was filed, in her \"Opposition to Memorandum in\n\nSupport of Motion for 'Necessary' Expenses,\" she stated: \"Whittled\n\ndown to even the arguably identifiable and necessary expenses,\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fPetitioner is entitled to no more than $8,000 in legal fees and\n\nnecessary expenses.\"\n\n     While Respondent continued to argue that no counsel fees\n\nshould be awarded, there was no suggestion that if this less\n\ndesired course of reduction (rather than elimination) of fees and\n\nexpenses were adopted, dire results would ensue for her child. Nor\n\nwas there any evidentiary basis advanced to help the court decide\n\nhow increasing the award above $8,000 would jeopardize respondent's\n\nability   to    care   for   her    child.       We   have   no   criticism    of\n\nrespondent's desire to argue for two courses in the hopes of\n\npersuading the district court to adopt the stronger one.                      But\n\nstating a lesser objective as a permissible alternative form of\n\nrelief,   and   then     later   claiming,    without   further    evidentiary\n\nsupport, that accepting this route was reversible error, falls far\n\nshort of carrying the burden of demonstrating that this award is\n\n\"clearly inappropriate.\"\n\n     In any event, the court had before it all the material\n\nrespondent offered, not only describing her financial condition but\n\nalso asserting the prolonged lack of contribution for support from\n\npetitioner.       That    the    court    gave   serious     consideration     to\n\nrespondent's     presentation      is    indicated    both   by   its   specific\n\nreference to it and by the dramatic, even drastic, reduction of the\n\ntotal award by two thirds.         Although we do not minimize the import\n\nof the alleged financial neglect by petitioner, we see no basis for\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fsaying that the court abused its discretion in responding to the\n\nrecord before it.\n\n     The second issue, concerning the propriety of naming the two\n\nlaw firms as recipients of the fee awards, is, in our opinion, a\n\nnon-issue.     The essential fact is that the court granted the\n\nmotion, which asked that the court \"award him\" the total amount\n\nclaimed.     That   the   court   chose,   given   separate   counsel   with\n\nseparate claims for fees and expenses, to specify which law firms\n\nwere to receive discrete amounts, does not seem to raise a serious\n\nquestion.    In other words, we read the order as granting the award,\n\nas modified, to petitioner, but allocating the funds in accordance\n\nwith the supporting documents. If petitioner has a problem, he can\n\nraise it, but at this juncture we see none.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f",

If petitioner has a problem, he can raise it, but at this juncture we see none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

No. 11,670, 19 I.L.M. 1501 (1980). We ordered the child's mother, the respondent-appellant, to return the child in <i>Whallon v. Lynn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199138\"><a href=\"/opinion/199138/whallon-v-lynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2000). She now challenges the fee award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted petitioner's request for fees and costs under the legislation implementing the Convention, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 11607(b)(3), which pertinently states, \"Any court ordering the return of a child pursuant to an action brought under section 11603 of this title shall order the respondent to pay necessary expenses incurred by or on behalf of the petitioner ... unless the respondent establishes that such order would be clearly inappropriate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court first engaged in a meticulous review of the claimed fees and expenses to determine their necessity. In a methodical weeding of relevant and adequately supported expenses from those clearly unnecessary or inadequately explained or supported, it reduced the award for expenses by more than seventy percent (from $23,463.17 to $6,929.78). After considering the requested fees for both United States and Mexican counsel, the court found the claimed 234.1 hours \"extreme even granting that this is an extraordinarily contentious case.\" It reduced the fees awarded by one half (from $41,403 to $20,701.50).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then considered respondent's claim that an award of the magnitude requested was inappropriate because she was unable to pay for it, living on loans from family and friends. It then further reduced the legal fees by 25 percent (from $20,701.50 to $15,526.13). It cited two cases that have considered a respondent's limited financial means and the economic impact on the children in reducing a fee award. <i>See Rydder v. Rydder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691084\"><a href=\"/opinion/691084/bjorn-michael-rydder-v-susan-marie-rydder/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span>, 373-74 (8th Cir.1995) (46 percent reduction because of respondent's \"straitened financial circumstances\"); <i>Berendsen v. Nichols,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2596509\"><a href=\"/opinion/2596509/berendsen-v-nichols/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 739 (D.Kan. 1996) (15 percent reduction; \"a fee award which unduly limited respondent's ability to support his children would be `clearly inappropriate'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the court's reductions of fees and expenses amounted to 65 percent (from $64,866.17 to $22,455.91). In granting petitioner's motion, the court specified that one firm, Miles &amp; Stockbridge, be awarded $13,973.91 (covering both allowed fees and expenses), and that the Mexican firm of Tucker &amp; Cinquegrana be awarded $8,482.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent raises two issues on appeal. She claims, first, that the court erred in not considering \"either the failure of [petitioner] to pay child support or how the award would affect the best interests of the child,\" and second, that it erred in awarding fees and expenses \"in favor of counsel, rather than in favor of the party.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With reference to the matters considered by the court in determining fees and expenses, counsel agreed at oral argument that the standard governing our review is abuse of discretion. This is consistent with such cases dealing with attorney's fee awards as <i>Larch v. Mansfield Mun. Elec. Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199706\"><a href=\"/opinion/199706/larch-v-madan/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent asserts that the court \"refused to delve as deeply as was necessary\" into respondent's financial condition to protect the child's best interests, and that it refused to consider petitioner's flagrant failure to make support payments in an amount alleged to exceed the amount of the fee award. Respondent acknowledges that there are no cases where a \"clearly inappropriate\" standard has resulted in denial of all fees to a party successful in seeking return of a child, but avers that no other known petitioner was guilty of such egregious failure to support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has the duty, under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 11607(b)(3), to order the payment of necessary expenses and legal fees, subject to a broad caveat denoted by the words, \"clearly inappropriate.\" We agree with the <i>Berendsen</i> and <i>Rydder</i> courts that preserving the ability of a respondent to care for her child is an important factor to consider. We also read the statute as giving the district court broad discretion in its effort to comply with the Hague Convention consistently with our own laws and standards. Finally, it is clear from the statute that the respondent has the burden to establish that a fee/expense order would be clearly inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review convinces us that the district court did not abuse its discretion. We begin by looking at what was presented to the district court for its decision. After petitioner filed his motion for fees on August 17, 2000, respondent filed an opposition, listing seven reasons, beginning with her \"straitened financial circumstances.\" Petitioner's failure to support respondent and their child was listed only as one of the reasons why respondent should not be burdened by a fee requirement. In its decision, the court stated that an award in the amount claimed for fees and expenses would be \"`clearly inappropriate' for the reasons [respondent] articulated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the court's decision on April 18, 2003 &#8212; some two and a half years after her original opposition &#8212; respondent filed a motion for reconsideration in which the only basis for reversal was the court's failure to consider petitioner's neglect of his child support obligations for several years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not accept respondent's belated invitation to use a fee award determination arising out of Hague Convention proceedings as a means of rectifying past violations of child support obligations. Our focus remains on the question whether respondent has clearly established that it is likely that her child will be significantly adversely affected by the court's award. The only evidence given us of respondent's ability to provide for her child is the affidavit she submitted to the court over two years earlier, on November 27, 2000, and never supplemented. This two page document contains four averments of a general or conclusory nature: (1) she was \"financially unable to contribute to [petitioner's] attorneys' fees;\" (2) she has \"not been employed outside of the home for over a year;\" (3) she has \"no source of income;\" and (4) she has \"obtained loans from family and friends\" for support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before this affidavit was filed, on August 28, 2000, respondent, in her opposition to petitioner's motion for fees, stated: \"If the Court is inclined to award attorneys' fees and expenses, Respondent requests a reduction in the attorneys' fees and costs requested by Petitioner given her financial status and her ability to support Micheli.\" About eight months later, after the affidavit was filed, in her \"Opposition to Memorandum in Support of Motion for `Necessary' Expenses,\" she stated: \"Whittled down to even the arguably identifiable and necessary expenses, Petitioner is entitled to no more than $8,000 in legal fees and necessary expenses.\" While Respondent continued to argue that no counsel fees should be awarded, there was no suggestion that if this less desired course of reduction (rather than elimination) of fees and expenses were adopted, dire results would ensue for her child. Nor was there any evidentiary basis advanced to help the court decide how increasing the award above $8,000 would jeopardize respondent's ability to care for her child. We have no criticism of respondent's desire to argue for two courses in the hopes of persuading the district court to adopt the stronger one. But stating a lesser objective as a permissible alternative form of relief, and then later claiming, without further evidentiary support, that accepting this route was reversible error, falls far short of carrying the burden of demonstrating that this award is \"clearly inappropriate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the court had before it all the material respondent offered, not only describing her financial condition but also asserting the prolonged lack of contribution for support from petitioner. That the court gave serious consideration to respondent's presentation is indicated both by its specific reference to it and by the dramatic, even drastic, reduction of the total award by two thirds. Although we do not minimize the import of the alleged financial neglect by petitioner, we see no basis for saying that the court abused its discretion in responding to the record before it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second issue, concerning the propriety of naming the two law firms as recipients of the fee awards, is, in our opinion, a non-issue. The essential fact is that the court granted the motion, which asked that the court \"award him\" the total amount claimed. That the court chose, given separate counsel with separate claims for fees and expenses, to specify which law firms were to receive discrete amounts, does not seem to raise a serious question. In other words, we read the order as granting the award, as modified, to petitioner, but allocating the funds in accordance with the supporting documents. If petitioner has a problem, he can raise it, but at this juncture we see none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
