Many people think that securing a\n\nfavorable judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction marks the\n\nend of a plaintiff's journey.        In some instances, however, that is\n\nonly a step along the road to meaningful relief.            This is a case in\n\npoint.\n\n           In 1997, Federal Refinance Co., Inc. (Federal) obtained\n\na deficiency judgment for over $331,000 against Frank Romano, Jr.\n\nIt spent the next five years trying to satisfy the judgment by\n\nlevying upon Romano's principal asset (his shares of stock in a\n\nclosely held corporation).     When the stock proved elusive, Federal\n\nasked the district court to set aside a series of allegedly\n\nfraudulent transfers. The court's ensuing rulings did not entirely\n\nplease either Federal or Romano.           Both appeal.\n\n           We affirm the district court's bench decision (i) setting\n\naside Romano's 1988 transfer of the shares to a family trust and\n\n(ii)   upholding    the   creation    and    funding   of   certain    limited\n\npartnerships.      We are less sanguine, however, about the court's\n\nsubsequent invalidation of yet a third transfer.            See   Fed. Refin.\n\nCo. v. Klock, 229 F. Supp. 2d 26 (D. Mass. 2002).                  Finding a\n\nprocedural error, we vacate that order and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The background facts are largely undisputed.               In 1980,\n\nWickford Realty Trust obtained a mortgage loan from Second National\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fBank.    Romano unconditionally guaranteed repayment of the loan,\n\nwhich eventually went into default. Federal acquired the defaulted\n\nloan    and   conducted   a    foreclosure    proceeding.         Left   with   a\n\ndeficiency, Federal looked to the guaranty and brought a diversity\n\naction against Romano in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts.          On March 3, 1997, the court awarded\n\nFederal a judgment for $331,608.78.\n\n              Romano was thought to be a principal of a closely held\n\ncorporation, Essex Group, Inc. (Essex), a holding company whose six\n\nwholly-owned subsidiaries each operated a nursing home. Before any\n\nof the transfers here at issue, Essex's shares were held 43.75% by\n\nRomano, 47.25% by his mother Mary, and 9% by the Doyle Family\n\nTrust.\n\n              When   Federal    attempted    to   satisfy   the   judgment      by\n\ngarnishing Romano's stock, it learned that the stock had flown the\n\ncoop.    In 1988, Romano had transferred 17,500 shares (the whole of\n\nhis 43.75% equity interest), without pecuniary consideration, to a\n\nnewly formed trust (the B&T Trust) of which he was the trustee and\n\nhis children were the beneficiaries.\n\n              Federal's frustration grew even more pronounced when it\n\ndiscovered that, between 1991 and 1994, Essex had created three\n\nlimited partnerships.         Each had an Essex subsidiary as its general\n\npartner (with a 20% share of the profits) and Romano's wife,\n\nDeborah Klock, as its sole limited partner (with an 80% share of\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe   profits).   Moreover,      the   general   partners   had   divested\n\nthemselves of their real estate, each having spun off title to its\n\nnursing home into its limited partnership.           These transactions\n\narguably diluted the value of Essex's shares.\n\n           Since Romano did not appear to have other significant\n\nassets, Federal sued to get the shares back into his hands1 and to\n\ncollapse the limited partnerships.\n\nII.   THE BENCH DECISION\n\n           All of these claims were tried to the court.           The trial\n\nended in a bench decision handed down on April 23, 2002.             As we\n\nexplain below, each side got half a loaf.\n\n                            A.    Count I.\n\n           The first count of Federal's complaint asked the court to\n\ninvalidate the stock transfer as a fraudulent conveyance under\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      As a subset of this goal, Federal also sought the appointment\nof a receiver to take temporary custody of the shares. Although\nthe court initially denied that request, Federal subsequently\nrenewed it.    We discuss the fate of Federal's renewed request\ninfra.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fsection 4 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (UFCA).2                 The\n\nUFCA's constructive fraud provision, in force in 1988, read:\n\n           Every conveyance made and every obligation\n           incurred by a person who is or will be thereby\n           rendered insolvent is fraudulent as to\n           creditors without regard to his actual intent\n           if the conveyance is made or the obligation is\n           incurred without fair consideration.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, § 4 (repealed 1996).           The district court\n\ndetermined that Romano's 1988 conveyance violated this section. It\n\nset aside the transfer to the trust and decreed that the 17,500\n\nshares of stock were \"deemed to be in the unencumbered possession\n\nof . . . Romano.\"\n\n                           B.    Counts II-IV.\n\n           Counts II through IV of Federal's complaint alleged that\n\nthe   purpose   and   effect    of   the    creation   and   funding   of   the\n\npartnerships was to dilute the value of Romano's stock.                On this\n\nbasis, Federal sought to collapse the limited partnerships.                  In\n\nmounting this attack, it relied upon both UFCA § 4, quoted supra,\n\nand UFCA § 7.    The latter provision is an actual fraud provision.\n\nThroughout the relevant time frame, it read:\n\n\n      2\n      Massachusetts repealed the UFCA in 1996 and replaced it with\nthe Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA). 1996 Mass. Acts 157\n(effective Oct. 8, 1996). Both acts carry the same chapter number,\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A. Massachusetts law is clear that the UFTA\nis not to be applied retroactively. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n\nv. Napoleon, 701 N.E.2d 350, 352 (Mass. 1998); Yankee Microwave,\nInc. v. Petricca Communic. Sys., Inc., 760 N.E.2d 739, 754 n.21\n(Mass. App. Ct. 2002).     Because the conveyances that we have\nmentioned up to this point took place during the currency of the\nUFCA, that version of chapter 109A governs our analysis of them.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          Every conveyance made and every obligation\n          incurred with actual intent, as distinguished\n          from intent presumed in law, to hinder, delay\n          or defraud either present or future creditors,\n          is fraudulent as to both present and future\n          creditors.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, § 7 (repealed 1996).\n\n           The district court ruled against Federal on these counts.\n\nIt rejected Federal's constructive fraud claim, finding that the\n\ncorporations were the actual transferors and that they were not\n\ninsolvent at the times of the transfers.         The court likewise\n\nrejected the claim of actual fraud, crediting evidence that there\n\nwas a legitimate business purpose behind the creation and funding\n\nof the limited partnerships, namely, that the restructuring was a\n\nprerequisite to obtaining needed financing from the United States\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n\nIII.   THE POST-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n           Having won a partial victory, Federal filed a motion in\n\naid of judgment on May 2, 2002.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 69(a).   In\n\nthat motion, Federal asked the district court to reach and apply\n\nthe 17,500 shares of Essex stock.       Much to Federal's dismay, it\n\nlearned that the shares had slipped away again.    The tale follows.\n\n           At some point (the exact time is immaterial for present\n\npurposes), Essex had purchased from another of Romano's creditors\n\na $15,000,000 debt.   See FDIC v. Elder Care Servs., Inc., 82 F.3d\n\n524, 525-26 (1st Cir. 1996) (describing the origin of the debt).\n\nIn late April of 2002 (whether before or after the date of the\n\n                                -7-\n\fdistrict court's bench decision is not entirely clear), Romano\n\ntransferred his 17,500 shares to Essex, ostensibly in exchange for\n\nan $85,000 credit and a ten-year forbearance agreement on that\n\nindebtedness.\n\n            Faced with a Tantalean predicament, Federal promptly\n\nmoved to reconsider the denial of its motion for the appointment of\n\na receiver, see supra note 1, and to annul this most recent\n\nconveyance.     Federal averred that the 2002 transaction should be\n\nrescinded as preferential. Because this latest transfer took place\n\nafter the effective date of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act\n\n(UFTA), that updated version of chapter 109A governed the claim\n\nasserted.   The UFTA provides in pertinent part:\n\n            A transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as\n            to a creditor whose claim arose before the\n            transfer was made if the transfer was made to\n            an insider for an antecedent debt, the debtor\n            was insolvent at that time, and the insider\n            had reasonable cause to believe that the\n            debtor was insolvent.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, § 6(b).\n\n            The district court saw no need to take evidence, but,\n\nrather, summarily voided the transfer as preferential.         Fed.\n\nRefin., 229 F. Supp. 2d at 28.      The court also ensured that the\n\nelusive shares would stay put, enjoining Romano from transferring\n\nor encumbering them in any way that might interfere with Federal's\n\nefforts to reach and apply.     Finally, as a sanction for Romano's\n\nmisconduct during discovery, the court granted Federal's renewed\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fmotion for the appointment of a receiver to hold the shares for the\n\ntime being.    See id. at 28-29 & n.2.\n\nIV.   THE APPEALS\n\n            The parties have cross-appealed.               With respect to the\n\ndistrict    court's    bench        decision,    Romano   challenges     the   order\n\nvoiding the transfer to the B&T Trust whereas Federal challenges\n\nthe order     upholding       the    creation    and   funding   of    the   limited\n\npartnerships.       With respect to the district court's subsequent\n\nwritten decision,       Romano       and   Essex   —   which   has    intervened   —\n\nchallenge     the     order     invalidating       the    stock-for-credit-and-\n\nforbearance arrangement.             In the pages that follow, we address\n\nthese disputes sequentially.\n\nV.    THE TRANSFER TO THE B&T TRUST\n\n            UFCA § 4 sets out two basic conditions for setting aside\n\na transfer on the ground of constructive fraud:                      the transferor\n\nmust have (i) been insolvent at the time of the conveyance (or\n\nrendered insolvent by it), and (ii) made the conveyance without\n\nfair consideration.       Boston Trading Group v. Burnazos, 835 F.2d\n\n1504, 1510 (1st Cir. 1987).                A person is insolvent for these\n\npurposes when the readily realizable market value of his assets is\n\nless than the amount required to pay his existing debts as they\n\nbecome due.    First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Napoleon, 701 N.E.2d\n\n350, 353-55 (Mass. 1998).            Fair consideration is given in exchange\n\nfor transferred property when, \"as a fair equivalent therefor, and\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fin good faith, [other] property is conveyed or an antecedent debt\n\nis satisfied.\"       Boston Trading Group, 835 F.2d at 1512 (quoting\n\nformer Mass. Gen. Laws      ch. 109A, § 3 (repealed 1996)).\n\n            On appeal, Romano mounts a rather anemic attack on the\n\ndistrict court's initial insolvency determination.            He argues, in\n\nsubstance, that the court could not reach a decision as to his\n\nsolvency without some evidence as to the value of the Essex stock.\n\nThis argument is jejune.          His own testimony established that the\n\n17,500 shares of Essex stock were his only significant asset at the\n\nrelevant time (1988) and that he was then personally obligated to\n\nrepay over $10,000,000 in loans that were about to go into default.\n\nIf the stock had little value, Romano was insolvent.            Conversely,\n\nif the stock's value exceeded Romano's massive liabilities, then\n\nthe transfer would have rendered him insolvent.                Either way,\n\nRomano's attack misfires.\n\n            His challenge to the court's conclusion that the transfer\n\nlacked fair       consideration    is    hopeless.   He   admitted   that    he\n\nreceived no money or property in return for the shares.                     And\n\nalthough his brief includes a perfunctory assertion that the\n\ntransfer was in fact adequately supported by the love and affection\n\nof his children, he points us to no case law that suggests that,\n\nfor purposes of the UFCA, such intangibles may supplant money,\n\nproperty,    or     satisfaction     of    an   antecedent   debt    as   fair\n\nconsideration.\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f          Romano's only colorable argument implicates the district\n\ncourt's ruling in response to a motion in limine.   In the pretrial\n\nproceedings, Romano identified an expert witness whose testimony\n\nwas intended to show that, at the time of the conveyance to the B&T\n\nTrust, the 17,500 shares were worthless.   Federal moved in limine\n\nto exclude the testimony.   Romano objected, exhorting the court to\n\nallow his expert to testify on the theory that a fraudulent\n\nconveyance action will not lie if the asset conveyed is worthless\n\nat the time of transfer.3   The court granted the motion in limine,\n\nholding that the value of the stock was legally irrelevant. Romano\n\nasks us to overturn this ruling, vacate the order setting aside the\n\ntransfer, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n          As framed, this assignment of error presents an abstract\n\nlegal question regarding the proper interpretation of a state\n\nstatute. Such questions engender de novo review. See Salve Regina\n\nColl. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 231 (1991); Protective Life Ins.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      At oral argument in this court, Romano's counsel suggested\nthat the expert testimony should have been allowed to show that the\nvalue of the shares (zero) was equal to what B&T paid for them\n(nothing), and that, therefore, the transfer had been for fair\nconsideration.   We disregard this argument because Romano never\nadvanced it in the district court. See Teamsters Union, Loc. No.\n59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"If\nany principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the\nmost extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised\nsquarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time\non appeal.\"); Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir. 1987)\n(similar).\n\n                                -11-\n\fCo. v. Dignity Viatical Sett. Partners, 171 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n           Our starting point is, of course, the statutory text.\n\nUFCA § 4 authorizes the setting aside of certain conveyances.                 It\n\ndefines a conveyance as \"every payment of money, assignment,\n\nrelease,   transfer,   lease,   mortgage     or   pledge    of    tangible    or\n\nintangible   property,   and    also   the   creation      of    any   lien   or\n\nincumbrance.\" Nothing in the statute qualifies the term \"property\"\n\nor in any way indicates a legislative intent to limit the statute's\n\nreach to conveyances involving property having a positive market\n\nvalue.\n\n           Finding no comfort in the language of the UFCA, Romano\n\nfalls back upon the decision in Richman v. Leiser, 465 N.E.2d 796\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1984).    That decision cannot carry the weight that\n\nRomano loads upon it.4\n\n           In Richman, an unsecured creditor attempted to set aside\n\na conveyance of property encumbered by liens exceeding its market\n\nvalue.   Despite a showing of fraudulent intent, the court refused\n\nto invalidate the transfer.      The court began with the proposition\n\nthat \"[a] conveyance is not established as a fraudulent conveyance\n\nupon showing of a fraudulent intention alone; there must also be a\n\n\n     4\n      The other cases cited by Romano, e.g., Xerox Fin. Servs. Life\nIns. Co. v. Sterman (In re Sterman), 244 B.R. 499, 514 (D. Mass.\n1999); Shamrock, Inc. v. FDIC, 629 N.E.2d 344, 349 (Mass. App. Ct.\n1994), do little more than cite to Richman. They add nothing to\nRomano's argument.\n\n                                  -12-\n\fresulting diminution in the assets of the debtor available to\n\ncreditors.\"    Id. at 798.     It found no such diminution, reasoning\n\nthat the complaining unsecured creditor \"could not have reached the\n\nproperty before the conveyance,\" and so \"the conveyance itself\n\ncould not have been fraudulent as to him.\"            Id. at 799 (quoting\n\nStauffer v. Stauffer, 351 A.2d 236, 245 (Pa. 1976)).\n\n            Romano reads this language to signify that a fraudulent\n\nconveyance claim will not lie unless a debtor has equity in the\n\ntransferred property. Richman, however, does not sweep so broadly.\n\nThe linchpin of the Richman decision is the principle that a\n\ntransfer of fully encumbered property (i.e., property that is\n\nmortgaged for more than it is worth and, thus, has no residual\n\nvalue) puts no otherwise available assets beyond the grasp of an\n\nunsecured creditor.     That principle makes good sense:       whether or\n\nnot   the   debtor   effects   a   transfer,   the   accumulated   security\n\ninterests will prevent an unsecured creditor from reaching and\n\napplying the overencumbered property.          Cf. Stauffer, 351 A.2d at\n\n245 (refusing to set aside a conveyance of property held by the\n\nentireties because the husband's creditor could not have reached\n\nthe asset pre-conveyance).\n\n            The case at hand is cut from a different cloth.            The\n\nshares of Essex's stock were free and clear at the time that Romano\n\nsigned them over to the B&T Trust.         Absent the transfer, Federal\n\ncould have reached the stock — whatever its value — in an effort to\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fsatisfy the judgment.        Thus, the transfer put property that would\n\notherwise have been available out of the complaining creditor's\n\nreach.    For that reason, Richman is inapposite.\n\n               This result comports with the policies underlying the\n\nUFCA.    \"The purpose of the UFCA is to preserve a debtor's assets so\n\nthat creditors may look to them in the event that the debtor ceases\n\npayments . . . .\"       First Fed. Sav. & Loan, 701 N.E.2d at 354-55\n\n(citations omitted).        A debtor \"may not give [his assets] away and\n\nthereby put them beyond the reach of creditors.\"                   Id. at 355.\n\nGiven the district court's factual findings, Romano's conduct falls\n\ninto     the    heartland    of   the    prohibition     against    fraudulent\n\nconveyances.      Allowing an exception on the ground that the shares\n\nwere worthless would be at odds with the rationale underlying that\n\nprohibition.      We conclude, therefore, that the district court did\n\nnot err in denying the motion in limine.\n\n               Romano makes a related claim of error implicating the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c).            In the course of arguing that\n\nmotion, he vouchsafed that Federal could not make the required\n\nprima facie showing of Romano's insolvency at the time of the\n\ntransfer without some evidence as to the value of the shares.               He\n\nnow assigns error to the court's denial of this motion.             This is an\n\nold whine in a new bottle.          The argument essentially repeats a\n\nclaim already made and rejected.               See supra p.10.   As said, the\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fevidence established that Romano was deeply in debt at the time of\n\nthe transfer and that the transferred stock had been his only\n\nsubstantial asset.     Hence, Federal made out a prima facie case of\n\ninsolvency.    Since Romano did not rebut this showing — indeed, he\n\nmade no discernible effort to do so — the lower court did not err\n\nin denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n\n          Before leaving this transfer, we address one related\n\nitem.   At the tail end of its brief, Federal makes a perfunctory\n\nargument to the effect that the district court erred in denying its\n\nrequest for attorneys' fees.\n\n          We    need   not   tarry.      Federal's   offhand    pitch   is\n\nunaccompanied    by    any   developed   argumentation.        Under    our\n\nprecedents, therefore, it merits summary rejection.            See, e.g.,\n\nBlake v. Pellegrino, 329 F.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir. 2003); Ryan v. Royal\n\nIns. Co., 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir. 1990); United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).        In all events, neither\n\nthe UFCA nor the guaranty contains a fee-shifting provision, and\n\nFederal offers us no reason to exempt this case from the usual rule\n\nthat, absent a specific statutory or contractual fee-shifting\n\nprovision, a prevailing party cannot recover attorneys' fees as of\n\nright from the losing party.     See Chambers v. Nasco, Inc., 501 U.S.\n\n32, 45 (1991); Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y, 421\n\nU.S. 240, 258-59 (1975).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fVI.   THE CREATION AND FUNDING OF THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS\n\n             Federal     cross-appeals          from    the    district   court's\n\ndetermination that the creation of the limited partnerships and the\n\nsubsequent transfers to them of the nursing home properties did not\n\nconstitute fraudulent conveyances under the UFCA.                   In Federal's\n\nestimation,     these    transactions       were       both   constructively     and\n\nactually fraudulent.          Before analyzing Federal's contentions, we\n\npause to clarify the standard of review.\n\n                          A.    Standard of Review.\n\n             A party who challenges a district court's findings of\n\nfact, arrived at after a bench trial, faces a steep uphill climb.\n\nWhen a district court finds the facts without the intervention of\n\na jury, the court of appeals is not at liberty to start afresh.\n\nSee Cumpiano v. Banco Santander, 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990);\n\nKeyes v. Sec'y of Navy, 853 F.2d 1016, 1019 (1st Cir. 1988); see\n\nalso Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).             \"The trial judge sees and hears the\n\nwitnesses at first hand and comes to appreciate the nuances of the\n\nlitigation    in   a    way    [that]    appellate      courts   cannot   hope   to\n\nreplicate.\"     Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152.              Consequently, \"[i]f the\n\ndistrict court's account of the evidence is plausible . . . the\n\ncourt of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had\n\nit been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the\n\nevidence differently.\" Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S.\n\n564, 573-74 (1985).           In the last analysis, factual findings or\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fconclusions drawn therefrom may only be set aside if, after a\n\nsearching    review   of     the    entire    record,    the    court     of   appeals\n\n\"form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\"\n\nCumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152.\n\n             Federal strives to free itself from this inhospitable\n\nstandard    of   review      by    arguing    that   the    trial    court      merely\n\ndetermined    the    legal    effect    of     uncontroverted       facts.          Thus,\n\nFederal's thesis runs,        the court's decision should be reviewed de\n\nnovo.    We reject this thesis for two reasons.\n\n            In the first place, Federal's characterization of the\n\nmaterial facts as uncontroverted is wishful thinking.                          Factual\n\ndisputes sprout throughout the record like weeds in an untended\n\ngarden.       Although       Federal    classifies       such    things        as     the\n\nprotagonists' motives in restructuring the nursing home operations\n\nand the rationale for naming Klock, rather than Romano, as the\n\nlimited partner, as questions of law, that taxonomy is unrealistic.\n\nWe    consistently    have    refused    to     permit     parties   to    advantage\n\nthemselves by couching questions of fact as questions of law, see,\n\ne.g., Reliance Steel Prods. Co. v. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co., 880 F.2d\n\n575, 577 (1st Cir. 1989), and we see no reason to abandon that\n\nsalutary practice today.           The clearly erroneous standard of review\n\n\"cannot be evaded by the simple expedient of creative relabeling.\"\n\nId.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f          In     the   second    place,    even        if     the     facts     were\n\nuncontroverted,    that     circumstance   alone       would    not     alter   the\n\nstandard of review.       When the trier's findings depend upon its\n\nchoice of competing inferences drawn from undisputed facts, the\n\nclearly erroneous standard continues to apply.                  See Jackson v.\n\nUnited States, 156 F.3d 230, 233 (1st Cir. 1998); Dedham Water Co.\n\nv. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nTo the extent that the raw facts are undisputed, this is such a\n\ncase.\n\n          We also reject Federal's intimation that mixed questions\n\nof fact and law invariably demand de novo review.                   The scope of\n\nreview for mixed questions varies.         The more fact-intensive the\n\ninquiry, the more likely we are to apply clear error review; the\n\nmore law-dominated the inquiry, the more likely we are to undertake\n\nde novo review.    Sierra Fria Corp. v. Evans, 127 F.3d 175, 181 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); United States v. Howard (In re Extrad. of Howard), 996\n\nF.2d 1320, 1327-28 (1st Cir. 1993).         Probing the existence of a\n\nfraudulent     conveyance    customarily    is     a        factbound    inquiry,\n\nsubjecting the court's findings to clear error review.                  See, e.g.,\n\nBeal Bank v. Pittorino, 177 F.3d 65, 69 (1st Cir. 1999); Barrett v.\n\nCont'l Ill. Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 882 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.\n\n1989). This result commends itself with particular force where, as\n\nhere, a claim turns on elusive issues of motive or intent.                       See\n\nCrellin Techs., Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp., 18 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fCir. 1994); see also Cumpiano, 902 F.2d at 152 (counseling that\n\n\"[f]indings concerning an actor's intent fit neatly within the\n\nintegument of the 'clearly erroneous' rule\").               We are satisfied,\n\ntherefore, that the standard of review applicable to the lower\n\ncourt's disposition of counts II through IV is clear error.\n\n                         B.    Constructive Fraud.\n\n            We turn now to the trial court's findings. Setting aside\n\na conveyance for constructive fraud under UFCA § 4 requires both a\n\nfinding that the transferor was insolvent at the time of the\n\ntransfer (or was rendered insolvent thereby) and a finding that the\n\nconveyance was made without fair consideration.              Implicit in this\n\nanalytic framework is the assumption that the factfinder first must\n\nidentify the relevant transferor.            See Boston Trading Group, 835\n\nF.2d   at   1509.     Here,   the   district    court   concluded   that   the\n\ncorporations were the relevant transferors:\n\n            [T]aking all the evidence and the reasonable\n            inferences therefrom, the court is not\n            persuaded   that   at  the   time  of    that\n            restructuring the corporations, who were\n            actually the ones who were making the\n            conveyance of their stock, were thereby\n            rendered insolvent. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n            Federal   mounts    two   attacks    on   the   district   court's\n\nfinding.    First, it pounces on a mistake embedded in the court's\n\narticulation and labors to persuade us that this bevue discredits\n\nthe court's conclusion.         Second, it posits that the finding is\n\nclearly erroneous.      Neither attack succeeds.\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f            To be sure, the district court misspoke at one point in\n\nits bench decision:          there was no conveyance of stock involved in\n\nthe creation and funding of the limited partnerships.                          Rather, the\n\nshareholders of the parent company (Essex) voted to create the\n\nlimited     partnerships,       and    each     subsidiary             corporation        then\n\ntransferred       its   real    estate     to           its    newly     formed     limited\n\npartnership.\n\n            From all indications, the court's passing mention of a\n\nstock transfer amounts to a slip of the tongue, substituting\n\n\"stock\" for \"real estate.\"            The record as a whole makes it crystal\n\nclear that the court squarely decided the identity question.                                At\n\nthe start of the trial, the court put its finger on the problem,\n\nasking    Federal's     counsel,      \"[w]ho        .    .    .   caused     [the    limited\n\npartnerships] to be set up?\"             Counsel's response framed the two\n\npossible    answers     to    this    query     —       either     (i)      Essex   and    the\n\nsubsidiary corporations (as the donors of the real estate), or (ii)\n\nRomano    (whom    Federal      endeavored       to          depict    as    the    \"actual\"\n\ntransferor).      Trial of the limited partnership claims focused on\n\nwhich of these proposed answers was correct (i.e., who should be\n\ndeemed the transferor).              The court proceeded to resolve this\n\nquestion.\n\n              We have held before that a reasoned decision should not\n\nbe vacated merely because a lapsus linguae occurred.                            See, e.g.,\n\nLenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1088 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fClauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 663 n.3 (1st Cir. 1987).             So it is\n\nhere:   taken in context, the district court's infelicitous choice\n\nof words does not undermine the cogency of its determination.\n\n           Moving to the next plateau, we perceive no clear error in\n\nthe court's conclusion that the corporations, not the individual\n\ndefendants, were the relevant transferors.           It is undisputed that\n\nEssex and its subsidiaries formed the limited partnerships and\n\ndeeded the real estate to them.          Although Romano apparently voted\n\nhis shares (or, more precisely, the shares standing in the name of\n\nthe B&T Trust) in favor of the restructuring, there is no direct\n\nevidence to support a finding that he was the driving force behind\n\nthe decision.    Romano was not the majority shareholder, and he\n\ntestified that he was not \"in a position to either block or approve\n\nwhat took place.\"       While we may regard Romano's assertion as\n\nsuspect,   weighing   the    evidence     and   assessing   the    witnesses'\n\ncredibility is uniquely the province of the district court.             Here,\n\nthere were two permissible views of the evidence.                  In such a\n\ncircumstance, the factfinder's choice between those competing views\n\ncannot be clearly erroneous. Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574; Keyes, 858\n\nF.2d at 1020.\n\n           That ends this phase of our inquiry.           Given the court's\n\nsupportable   finding   as    to   the    identity   of   the   transferors,\n\nFederal's claim of constructive fraud must fail.                  Viewing the\n\ncorporations as the transferors, there is no evidence that they\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fwere insolvent either at the time of the transfers or immediately\n\nthereafter.\n\n                            C.   Actual Fraud.\n\n              This leaves Federal's claim under UFCA § 7. Our analysis\n\nof this claim is straightforward.            Setting aside a conveyance for\n\nactual fraud requires, at a bare minimum, a finding of \"actual\n\nintent . . . to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future\n\ncreditors.\" Palmer v. Murphy, 677 N.E.2d 247, 254-55 & n.15 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1997) (construing UFCA § 7).            The court below found as a\n\nmatter of fact that the limited partnerships were created and\n\nfunded for a legitimate business purpose rather than to hinder,\n\ndelay,   or    defraud   creditors.       This    finding    is   not   clearly\n\nerroneous.\n\n              Klock testified that the reason for the restructuring was\n\nto   obtain    HUD   financing   to    rehabilitate    the   nursing    homes.\n\nAccording to Klock, HUD required, as a condition of each loan, that\n\nthe real estate be separated from the operating entity.                     The\n\nlimited partnerships provided the vehicles for that separation.\n\nDespite countervailing evidence suggesting that the purpose behind\n\nthe restructuring was to dilute the value of Romano's stock, the\n\ntrial court was free to choose between the two versions of the\n\ntruth and draw appropriate inferences.            See Anderson, 470 U.S. at\n\n574; Keyes, 853 F.2d at 1020.         Consequently, we uphold the court's\n\nrejection of the actual fraud claim.\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fVI.   THE TRANSFER TO ESSEX\n\n           We come now to the order setting aside the post-trial\n\ntransfer of Romano's well-traveled shares to Essex.5          In response\n\nto Federal's motion to annul that transfer, the district court held\n\na status conference on June 17, 2002.        Although the court set the\n\nmatter down for hearing eight days hence, it was vague as to how\n\nthat hearing would proceed.      When the appointed date arrived, the\n\ncourt declined to take testimony, instead inviting oral argument\n\nand   telling    the   parties   that   it   was   treating   the   hearing\n\n\"functionally as a motion for summary judgment.\"\n\n           After listening to the lawyers' arguments, the court\n\nreserved decision.      It subsequently filed a written rescript in\n\nwhich it ruled, as a matter of law, that the transfer must be\n\nrescinded.      Fed. Refin., 229 F. Supp. 2d at 28.\n\n                        A.   Standard of Review.\n\n          In view of the court's explicit statement at the June 25\n\nhearing, we invoke our familiar summary judgment jurisprudence.\n\nUnder that rubric, we, like the district court, must accept the\n\nfacts most favorable to the nonmoving party (here, Romano) and draw\n\nall reasonable inferences to that party's behoof.         Garside v. Osco\n\nDrug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990).              We review the\n\n\n\n      5\n      Essex, qua intervenor, joins Romano in prosecuting this\nappeal (No. 02-2547).   With respect to this issue, Essex's and\nRomano's rights are congruent. For simplicity's sake, therefore,\nwe treat Romano as if he were the sole appellant.\n\n                                   -23-\n\fdistrict court's entry of summary judgment de novo.                Id.   We will\n\naffirm   only    if    the     \"pleadings,       depositions,      answers     to\n\ninterrogatories,      and    admissions    on    file,   together     with    the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n           When a party moves for summary judgment and suggests that\n\nno trialworthy issues exist, that party ordinarily must support the\n\nmotion with affidavits or other materials of evidentiary quality.\n\nPlumley v. S. Container, Inc., 303 F.3d 364, 368 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nThe burden of production then shifts to the nonmovant to show that\n\na genuine issue looms.         Garside, 895 F.2d at 48.            The protocol\n\ndiffers, however, as to issues on which the nonmovant bears the\n\nburden of proof.      As to such issues, the movant is not obliged to\n\nmake an initial evidentiary showing.            Rather, it is incumbent upon\n\nthe nonmovant to demonstrate, in the first instance, that specific\n\nfacts exist sufficient to create an authentic dispute.                Id.\n\n                        B.    The Preference Claim.\n\n           As said, the UFTA controls with respect to Federal's\n\nclaim that a preferential transfer occurred.             See supra Part III.\n\nThat   statute   empowers     a   court   to     set   aside   a   transfer    as\n\npreferential if (i) the creditor's claim arose before the transfer\n\noccurred, (ii) the transfer was made to an insider on account of an\n\nantecedent debt, (iii) the debtor was insolvent at the time of the\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\ftransfer, and (iv) the transferee had reasonable cause to believe\n\nthat the debtor was insolvent.                Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, § 6(b).\n\n               Romano first posits that a genuine issue of material fact\n\nexisted vis-à-vis his solvency at the time Essex redeemed his\n\nstock.    As the moving party, Federal bore the initial burden of\n\nproducing evidence of Romano's insolvency.                    Plumley, 303 F.3d at\n\n368.\n\n               A    finding       of     insolvency    requires     proof     of     both\n\nliabilities and assets.                See First Fed. Sav. & Loan, 701 N.E.2d at\n\n353-55.    The papers before the district court contained evidence\n\ntending to show that Romano's debts exceeded $17,000,000 at the\n\ntime of the transfer.             But Federal provided next to no evidence on\n\nthe asset side of the ledger.                 It merely asked the court to take\n\njudicial notice of the prior ruling that Romano's only significant\n\nasset    was       the    Essex   stock     and    pointed   out   that     Romano    had\n\npurportedly \"sold\" the stock to Essex for an $85,000 credit on an\n\nantecedent debt and a ten-year forbearance agreement as to the\n\nbalance of that debt.\n\n               We agree with Romano that this evidence was insufficient\n\nto permit a reasoned calculation of the value of his assets (and,\n\nthus, of       his       financial      condition).     A    finding   of   insolvency\n\nrequires more than a showing of formidable debt; it also requires\n\na corresponding showing as to the debtor's assets.                     The fact that\n\nRomano had no assets besides the Essex shares in 1988 — some\n\n\n                                            -25-\n\ffourteen years before the date of the transfer in question — told\n\nthe court very little about the extent of his holdings in 2002.\n\nWhile it may be likely that the value of Romano's assets was less\n\nthan the amount of his liabilities, summary judgment cannot be\n\ngranted on the basis of informed intuitions.         \"The precincts\n\npatrolled by Rule 56 admit of . . . no room for the judge to\n\nsuperimpose his own ideas of probability and likelihood (no matter\n\nhow reasonable those ideas may be) upon the carapace of the cold\n\nrecord.\"    Greenburg v. P.R. Marit. Shipping Auth., 835 F.2d 932,\n\n936 (1st Cir. 1987). A court considering a summary judgment motion\n\ncannot simply presume that plaintiffs will win cases that seem open\n\nand shut.   See Leyva v. On the Beach, Inc., 171 F.3d 717, 720 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n            In granting summary judgment, the court below glossed\n\nover this evidentiary defect. It noted the mountain of debt facing\n\nRomano and then suggested that it was \"undisputed\" that this debt\n\nexceeded the dollar value of Romano's assets.    Fed. Refin., 229 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 28.    We have been over the record with a fine-tooth\n\ncomb and cannot find any such concession.       During the June 25\n\nhearing, Romano's counsel acknowledged that the court earlier had\n\nfound Romano insolvent, but then reminded the court that the\n\nsituation had changed.    Counsel stated:\n\n            There has to be a valuation hearing and a\n            trial on the merits to find out if the items\n            that were conveyed by Mr. Romano to Essex were\n            conveyed by someone who was then insolvent. .\n\n                                -26-\n\f            . .   That's a factual issue that can't be\n            glossed over and can't be determined in this\n            kind of proceeding. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nThat statement squarely raised the insolvency question.                 Thus, the\n\ndistrict court erred in treating the fact as undisputed.\n\n            That error undermines the order for summary judgment. On\n\nthis record, Federal simply did not carry its burden of production\n\nanent the insolvency question.         Whatever the evidence eventually\n\nmay show regarding the ratio of Romano's assets to his liabilities\n\n— a matter on which we take no view — we are constrained at this\n\nstage to rule that summary judgment was improvidently granted.\n\n            Romano also argues that other genuine issues of material\n\nfact remained unresolved at the time that the district court\n\ngranted summary judgment.        To this end, he points us to a series of\n\ndefenses available under UFTA § 9.           For the sake of completeness,\n\nwe examine this argument as well.                We use UFTA § 9(f)(2) as an\n\nexemplar.\n\n            The UFTA provides that even if a transfer meets the\n\ncriteria for avoidance set out in UFTA § 6, a court may not set it\n\naside so long as it was \"made in the ordinary course of business or\n\nfinancial affairs of the debtor and the insider.\"                 Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 109(a), § 9(f)(2).      That provision constitutes an affirmative\n\ndefense,    and,   thus,   the   burden     of    proof   falls    on   the   party\n\nasserting it.      See Prairie Lakes Health Care Sys., Inc. v. Wookey,\n\n583 N.W.2d 405, 414 & n.7 (S.D. 1998) (concluding that the burden\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fof proving section 9 defenses falls on the party asserting them).\n\nIn order to avoid summary judgment, therefore, Romano typically\n\nwould have to shoulder the burden of adducing specific facts\n\ntending to show that his transfer of shares to Essex was a\n\ntransaction undertaken in the ordinary course of business.\n\n           Romano asserted the section 9(f)(2) defense at the June\n\n25 hearing.    He did not, however, adduce any evidence in support of\n\nit.   In the usual case, mere assertions of counsel are not enough\n\nto block summary judgment.     See Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters\n\nand Joiners, 1 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 1993); Brennan v. Hendrigan,\n\n888 F.2d 189, 191 (1st Cir. 1989).      Federal urges us to apply that\n\nrule here.\n\n           Federal's argument overlooks the atypical procedural\n\nposture in which this question arose.         Federal's motion to set\n\naside the post-trial transfer was not couched as a motion for\n\nsummary judgment.     At the June 17 status conference — the first\n\ntime the district court addressed Federal's motion — the court set\n\nthe matter down for hearing on June 25, stating that it would\n\nattempt to resolve the motion \"as a matter of law\" and that if it\n\ncould not do so it would try the matter.\n\n             These comments were imprecise.    Although the court may\n\nhave intended all along to hold a summary judgment hearing, it did\n\nnot say so.    No motion for summary judgment had been made, and the\n\ndocket entry reveals that the clerk scheduled June 25 as the first\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\fday for \"a jury-waived trial.\"     To confuse matters further, the\n\ncourt neither specifically mentioned summary judgment nor asked the\n\nparties to prepare affidavits or other evidentiary submissions\n\nbefore the June 25 hearing.\n\n          Courts have recognized that summary judgment is strong\n\nmedicine, and the rules provide that parties must be given adequate\n\nnotice of summary judgment proceedings and a reasonable time within\n\nwhich to proffer supporting documents. See, e.g., Rogan v. Menino,\n\n175 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 1999); Stella v. Town of Tewksbury, 4\n\nF.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir. 1993).    Indeed, Rule 56(a) anticipates that\n\na party opposing summary judgment will have a ten-day window within\n\nwhich to prepare and present evidence in opposition.        We have\n\ntaken special pains to emphasize the importance of this temporal\n\nwindow in cases — analogous to this one — involving sua sponte\n\ngrants of summary judgment.    The district court must \"first give[]\n\nthe targeted party notice and a chance to present its evidence on\n\nthe essential elements of the claim or defense.\" Berkovitz v. Home\n\nBox Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996); accord Leyva, 171\n\nF.3d at 720; Stella, 4 F.3d at 55-56.\n\n          Viewed against this backdrop, the district court's ruling\n\ncannot withstand scrutiny. No motion for summary judgment had been\n\nfiled, and nothing in the court's instructions prior to June 25\n\nalerted Romano to the need to produce evidentiary support for his\n\n\n\n\n                                 -29-\n\faffirmative defenses.6      Accordingly, the first real notice that the\n\ncourt would treat the matter under the framework applicable to\n\nsummary judgment motions came on the day of the hearing:             June 25.\n\nThus, the procedure followed in this case flouted the imperatives\n\nof Rule 56.      See Berkovitz, 89 F.3d at 30.        The result was that\n\nRomano     had   neither   advance   notice    of   the   district   court's\n\nintentions nor an adequate opportunity to proffer evidence.\n\n             We need go no further.         By its very nature, a section\n\n9(f)(2) defense requires a fact-specific inquiry into the workings\n\nof the transferor and the transferee and the specific nature of the\n\ntransactions between them.      Federal's proffers do not conclusively\n\ndemonstrate the futility of a section 9(f)(2) defense and, in the\n\npeculiar circumstances of this case, we cannot hold Romano's\n\nfailure to lay a solid factual foundation for that defense against\n\nhim.       Consequently, the issue remains open, and the entry of\n\nsummary judgment must be vacated.7\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      Assuming, for argument's sake, that the court's comments on\nJune 17 hinted that it might conduct a summary judgment hearing on\nJune 25, the intervening time was plainly less than the ten-day\ninterval that Rule 56 requires.\n       7\n      Romano's brief also mentions possible defenses under UFTA §\n9(f)(1) and (f)(3).    Like the section 9(f)(2) defense, these\ndefenses call for fact-specific inquiries — and Romano had no fair\nopportunity to produce evidence regarding them.      Thus, Romano\nremains free to litigate these issues upon remand.\n\n                                     -30-\n\fVII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We affirm the district court's orders setting aside the\n\n1988   stock   transfer   and   refusing   to   collapse        the   limited\n\npartnership    structures.      However,   in   light      of     procedural\n\nirregularities and the existence of unresolved factual disputes, we\n\nvacate the lower court's entry of what amounted to a sua sponte\n\nsummary judgment regarding the 2002 stock transfer and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.       We leave intact\n\nthe court's provisional appointment of a receiver to hold the\n\nembattled shares until such time as their fate is resolved.\n\n\n\nAffirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. All parties shall\n\nbear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -31-\n\f",

In some instances, however, that is only a step along the road to meaningful relief. This is a case in point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, Federal Refinance Co., Inc. (Federal) obtained a deficiency judgment for over $331,000 against Frank Romano, Jr. It spent the next five years trying to satisfy the judgment by levying upon Romano's principal asset (his shares of stock in a closely held corporation). When the stock proved elusive, Federal asked the district court to set aside a series of allegedly fraudulent transfers. The court's ensuing rulings did not entirely please either Federal or Romano. Both appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's bench decision (i) setting aside Romano's 1988 transfer of the shares to a family trust and (ii) upholding the creation and funding of certain limited partnerships. We are less sanguine, however, about the court's subsequent invalidation of yet a third transfer. <i>See Fed. Refin. Co. v. Klock,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d 26 (D.Mass.2002). Finding a procedural error, we vacate that order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are largely undisputed. In 1980, Wickford Realty Trust obtained a mortgage loan from Second National Bank. Romano unconditionally guaranteed repayment of the loan, which eventually went into default. Federal acquired the defaulted loan and conducted a foreclosure proceeding. Left with a deficiency, Federal looked to the guaranty and brought a diversity action against Romano in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On March 3, 1997, the court awarded Federal a judgment for $331,608.78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano was thought to be a principal of a closely held corporation, Essex Group, Inc. (Essex), a holding company whose six wholly-owned subsidiaries each operated a nursing home. Before any of the transfers here at issue, Essex's shares were held 43.75% by Romano, 47.25% by his mother Mary, and 9% by the Doyle Family Trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Federal attempted to satisfy the judgment by garnishing Romano's stock, it learned that the stock had flown the coop. In 1988, Romano had transferred 17,500 shares (the whole of his 43.75% equity interest), without pecuniary consideration, to a newly formed trust (the B &amp; T Trust) of which he was the trustee and his children were the beneficiaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal's frustration grew even more pronounced when it discovered that, between 1991 and 1994, Essex had created three limited partnerships. Each had an Essex subsidiary as its general partner (with a 20% share of the profits) and Romano's wife, Deborah Klock, as its sole limited partner (with an 80% share of the profits). Moreover, the general partners had divested themselves of their real estate, each having spun off title to its nursing home into its limited partnership. These transactions arguably diluted the value of Essex's shares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Romano did not appear to have other significant assets, Federal sued to get the shares back into his hands<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and to collapse the limited partnerships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE BENCH DECISION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these claims were tried to the court. The trial ended in a bench decision handed down on April 23, 2002. As we explain below, each side got half a loaf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Count I.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first count of Federal's complaint asked the court to invalidate the stock transfer as a fraudulent conveyance under section 4 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (UFCA).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The UFCA's constructive fraud provision, in force in 1988, read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every conveyance made and every obligation incurred by a person who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent is fraudulent as to creditors without regard to his actual intent if the conveyance is made or the obligation is incurred without fair consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 4 (repealed 1996). The district court determined that Romano's 1988 conveyance violated this section. It set aside the transfer to the trust and decreed that the 17,500 shares of stock were \"deemed to be in the unencumbered possession of ... Romano.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Counts II-IV.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts II through IV of Federal's complaint alleged that the purpose and effect of the creation and funding of the partnerships was to dilute the value of Romano's stock. On this basis, Federal sought to collapse the limited partnerships. In mounting this attack, it relied upon both UFCA &#167; 4, quoted <i>supra,</i> and UFCA &#167; 7. The latter provision is an actual fraud provision. Throughout the relevant time frame, it read: Every conveyance made and every obligation incurred with actual intent, as distinguished from intent presumed in law, to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors, is fraudulent as to both present and future creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 7 (repealed 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled against Federal on these counts. It rejected Federal's constructive fraud claim, finding that the corporations were the actual transferors and that they were not insolvent at the times of the transfers. The court likewise rejected the claim of actual fraud, crediting evidence that there was a legitimate business purpose behind the creation and funding of the limited partnerships, namely, that the restructuring was a prerequisite to obtaining needed financing from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE POST-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having won a partial victory, Federal filed a motion in aid of judgment on May 2, 2002. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a). In that motion, Federal asked the district court to reach and apply the 17,500 shares of Essex stock. Much to Federal's dismay, it learned that the shares had slipped away again. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point (the exact time is immaterial for present purposes), Essex had purchased from another of Romano's creditors a $15,000,000 debt. <i>See FDIC v. Elder Care Servs., Inc.,</i> 82 F.3d 524, 525-26 (1st Cir.1996) (describing the origin of the debt). In late April of 2002 (whether before or after the date of the district court's bench decision is not entirely clear), Romano transferred his 17,500 shares to Essex, ostensibly in exchange for an $85,000 credit and a ten-year forbearance agreement on that indebtedness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with a Tantalean predicament, Federal promptly moved to reconsider the denial of its motion for the appointment of a receiver, <i>see supra</i> note 1, and to annul this most recent conveyance. Federal averred that the 2002 transaction should be rescinded as preferential. Because this latest transfer took place after the effective date of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), that updated version of chapter 109A governed the claim asserted. The UFTA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made if the transfer was made to an insider for an antecedent debt, the debtor was insolvent at that time, and the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 6(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court saw no need to take evidence, but, rather, summarily voided the transfer as preferential. <i>Fed. Refin.,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 28. The court also ensured that the elusive shares would stay put, enjoining Romano from transferring or encumbering them in any way that might interfere with Federal's efforts to reach and apply. Finally, as a sanction for Romano's misconduct during discovery, the court granted Federal's renewed motion for the appointment of a receiver to hold the shares for the time being. <i>See id.</i> at 28-29 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE APPEALS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have cross-appealed. With respect to the district court's bench decision, Romano challenges the order voiding the transfer to the B &amp; T Trust whereas Federal challenges the order upholding the creation and funding of the limited partnerships. With respect to the district court's subsequent written decision, Romano and Essex &#8212; which has intervened &#8212; challenge the order invalidating the stock-for-credit-and-forbearance arrangement. In the pages that follow, we address these disputes sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. THE TRANSFER TO THE B &amp; T TRUST</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UFCA &#167; 4 sets out two basic conditions for setting aside a transfer on the ground of constructive fraud: the transferor must have (i) been insolvent at the time of the conveyance (or rendered insolvent by it), and (ii) made the conveyance without fair consideration. <i>Boston Trading Group v. Burnazos,</i> 835 F.2d 1504, 1510 (1st Cir.1987). A person is insolvent for these purposes when the readily realizable market value of his assets is less than the amount required to pay his existing debts as they become due. <i>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Napoleon,</i> 428 Mass. 371, 701 N.E.2d 350, 353-55 (1998). Fair consideration is given in exchange for transferred property when, \"as a fair equivalent therefor, and in good faith, [other] property is conveyed or an antecedent debt is satisfied.\" <i>Boston Trading Group,</i> 835 F.2d at 1512 (quoting former Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 3 (repealed 1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Romano mounts a rather anemic attack on the district court's initial insolvency determination. He argues, in substance, that the court could not reach a decision as to his solvency without some evidence as to the value of the Essex stock. This argument is jejune. His own testimony established that the 17,500 shares of Essex stock were his only significant asset at the relevant time (1988) and that he was then personally obligated to repay over $10,000,000 in loans that were about to go into default. If the stock had little value, Romano was insolvent. Conversely, if the stock's value exceeded Romano's massive liabilities, then the transfer would have rendered him insolvent. Either way, Romano's attack misfires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His challenge to the court's conclusion that the transfer lacked fair consideration is hopeless. He admitted that he received no money or property in return for the shares. And although his brief includes a perfunctory assertion that the transfer was in fact adequately supported by the love and affection of his children, he points us to no case law that suggests that, for purposes of the UFCA, such intangibles may supplant money, property, or satisfaction of an antecedent debt as fair consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano's only colorable argument implicates the district court's ruling in response to a motion in limine. In the pretrial proceedings, Romano identified an expert witness whose testimony was intended to show that, at the time of the conveyance to the B &amp; T Trust, the 17,500 shares were worthless. Federal moved in limine to exclude the testimony. Romano objected, exhorting the court to allow his expert to testify on the theory that a fraudulent conveyance action will not lie if the asset conveyed is worthless at the time of transfer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court granted the motion in limine, holding that the value of the stock was legally irrelevant. Romano asks us to overturn this ruling, vacate the order setting aside the transfer, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As framed, this assignment of error presents an abstract legal question regarding the proper interpretation of a state statute. Such questions engender de novo review. <i>See Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell,</i> 499 U.S. 225, 231, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991); <i>Protective Life Ins. Co. v. Dignity Viatical Sett. Partners,</i> 171 F.3d 52, 54 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our starting point is, of course, the statutory text. UFCA &#167; 4 authorizes the setting aside of certain conveyances. It defines a conveyance as \"every payment of money, assignment, release, transfer, lease, mortgage or pledge of tangible or intangible property, and also the creation of any lien or incumbrance.\" Nothing in the statute qualifies the term \"property\" or in any way indicates a legislative intent to limit the statute's reach to conveyances involving property having a positive market value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no comfort in the language of the UFCA, Romano falls back upon the decision in <i>Richman v. Leiser,</i> 18 Mass. App.Ct. 308, 465 N.E.2d 796 (1984). That decision cannot carry the weight that Romano loads upon it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Richman,</i> an unsecured creditor attempted to set aside a conveyance of property encumbered by liens exceeding its market value. Despite a showing of fraudulent intent, the court refused to invalidate the transfer. The court began with the proposition that \"[a] conveyance is not established as a fraudulent conveyance upon showing of a fraudulent intention alone; there must also be a resulting diminution in the assets of the debtor available to creditors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 798. It found no such diminution, reasoning that the complaining unsecured creditor \"could not have reached the property before the conveyance,\" and so \"the conveyance itself could not have been fraudulent as to him.\" <i>Id.</i> at 799 (quoting <i>Stauffer v. Stauffer,</i> 465 Pa. 558, 351 A.2d 236, 245 (1976)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano reads this language to signify that a fraudulent conveyance claim will not lie unless a debtor has equity in the transferred property. <i>Richman,</i> however, does not sweep so broadly. The linchpin of the <i>Richman</i> decision is the principle that a transfer of fully encumbered property (i.e., property that is mortgaged for more than it is worth and, thus, has no residual value) puts no otherwise available assets beyond the grasp of an <i>unsecured</i> creditor. That principle makes good sense: whether or not the debtor effects a transfer, the accumulated security interests will prevent an unsecured creditor from reaching and applying the overencumbered property. <i>Cf. Stauffer,</i> 351 A.2d at 245 (refusing to set aside a conveyance of property held by the entireties because the husband's creditor could not have reached the asset pre-conveyance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is cut from a different cloth. The shares of Essex's stock were free and clear at the time that Romano signed them over to the B &amp; T Trust. Absent the transfer, Federal could have reached the stock &#8212; whatever its value &#8212; in an effort to satisfy the judgment. Thus, the transfer put property that would otherwise have been available out of the complaining creditor's reach. For that reason, <i>Richman</i> is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result comports with the policies underlying the UFCA. \"The purpose of the UFCA is to preserve a debtor's assets so that creditors may look to them in the event that the debtor ceases payments....\" <i>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan,</i> 701 N.E.2d at 354-55 (citations omitted). A debtor \"may not give [his assets] away and thereby put them beyond the reach of creditors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 355. Given the district court's factual findings, Romano's conduct falls into the heartland of the prohibition against fraudulent conveyances. Allowing an exception on the ground that the shares were worthless would be at odds with the rationale underlying that prohibition. We conclude, therefore, that the district court did not err in granting the motion in limine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano makes a related claim of error implicating the district court's denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c). In the course of arguing that motion, he vouchsafed that Federal could not make the required prima facie showing of Romano's insolvency at the time of the transfer without some evidence as to the value of the shares. He now assigns error to the court's denial of this motion. This is an old whine in a new bottle. The argument essentially repeats a claim already made and rejected. <i>See supra</i> p. 10. As said, the evidence established that Romano was deeply in debt at the time of the transfer and that the transferred stock had been his only substantial asset. Hence, Federal made out a prima facie case of insolvency. Since Romano did not rebut this showing &#8212; indeed, he made no discernible effort to do so &#8212; the lower court did not err in denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before leaving this transfer, we address one related item. At the tail end of its brief, Federal makes a perfunctory argument to the effect that the district court erred in denying its request for attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry. Federal's offhand pitch is unaccompanied by any developed argumentation. Under our precedents, therefore, it merits summary rejection. <i>See, e.g., Blake v. Pellegrino,</i> 329 F.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co.,</i> 916 F.2d 731, 734 (1st Cir.1990); <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). In all events, neither the UFCA nor the guaranty contains a fee-shifting provision, and Federal offers us no reason to exempt this case from the usual rule that, absent a specific statutory or contractual fee-shifting provision, a prevailing party cannot recover attorneys' fees as of right from the losing party. <i>See Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.,</i> 501 U.S. 32, 45, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991); <i>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc'y,</i> 421 U.S. 240, 258-59, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">VI. THE CREATION AND FUNDING OF THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal cross-appeals from the district court's determination that the creation of the limited partnerships and the subsequent transfers to them of the nursing home properties did not constitute fraudulent conveyances under the UFCA. In Federal's estimation, these transactions were both constructively and actually fraudulent. Before analyzing Federal's contentions, we pause to clarify the standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standard of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party who challenges a district court's findings of fact, arrived at after a bench trial, faces a steep uphill climb. When a district court finds the facts without the intervention of a jury, the court of appeals is not at liberty to start afresh. <i>See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander,</i> 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990); <i>Keyes v. Sec'y of Navy,</i> 853 F.2d 1016, 1019 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). \"The trial judge sees and hears the witnesses at first hand and comes to appreciate the nuances of the litigation in a way [that] appellate courts cannot hope to replicate.\" <i>Cumpiano,</i> 902 F.2d at 152. Consequently, \"[i]f the district court's account of the evidence is plausible ... the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\" <i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,</i> 470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). In the last analysis, factual findings or conclusions drawn therefrom may only be set aside if, after a searching review of the entire record, the court of appeals \"form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Cumpiano,</i> 902 F.2d at 152.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal strives to free itself from this inhospitable standard of review by arguing that the trial court merely determined the legal effect of uncontroverted facts. Thus, Federal's thesis runs, the court's decision should be reviewed de novo. We reject this thesis for two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, Federal's characterization of the material facts as uncontroverted is wishful thinking. Factual disputes sprout throughout the record like weeds in an untended garden. Although Federal classifies such things as the protagonists' motives in restructuring the nursing home operations and the rationale for naming Klock, rather than Romano, as the limited partner, as questions of law, that taxonomy is unrealistic. We consistently have refused to permit parties to advantage themselves by couching questions of fact as questions of law, <i>see, e.g., Reliance Steel Prods. Co. v. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 880 F.2d 575, 577 (1st Cir.1989), and we see no reason to abandon that salutary practice today. The clearly erroneous standard of review \"cannot be evaded by the simple expedient of creative relabeling.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, even if the facts were uncontroverted, that circumstance alone would not alter the standard of review. When the trier's findings depend upon its choice of competing inferences drawn from undisputed facts, the clearly erroneous standard continues to apply. <i>See Jackson v. United States,</i> 156 F.3d 230, 233 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc.,</i> 972 F.2d 453, 457 (1st Cir.1992). To the extent that the raw facts are undisputed, this is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Federal's intimation that mixed questions of fact and law invariably demand de novo review. The scope of review for mixed questions varies. The more fact-intensive the inquiry, the more likely we are to apply clear error review; the more law-dominated the inquiry, the more likely we are to undertake de novo review. <i>Sierra Fria Corp. v. Evans,</i> 127 F.3d 175, 181 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Howard</i> (<i>In re Extrad. of Howard</i>), 996 F.2d 1320, 1327-28 (1st Cir.1993). Probing the existence of a fraudulent conveyance customarily is a factbound inquiry, subjecting the court's findings to clear error review. <i>See, e.g., Beal Bank v. Pittorino,</i> 177 F.3d 65, 69 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Barrett v. Cont'l Ill. Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 882 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.1989). This result commends itself with particular force where, as here, a claim turns on elusive issues of motive or intent. <i>See Crellin</i> <i>Techs., Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp.,</i> 18 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994); <i>see also Cumpiano,</i> 902 F.2d at 152 (counseling that \"[f]indings concerning an actor's intent fit neatly within the integument of the `clearly erroneous' rule\"). We are satisfied, therefore, that the standard of review applicable to the lower court's disposition of counts II through IV is clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Constructive Fraud.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the trial court's findings. Setting aside a conveyance for constructive fraud under UFCA &#167; 4 requires both a finding that the transferor was insolvent at the time of the transfer (or was rendered insolvent thereby) and a finding that the conveyance was made without fair consideration. Implicit in this analytic framework is the assumption that the factfinder first must identify the relevant transferor. <i>See Boston Trading Group,</i> 835 F.2d at 1509. Here, the district court concluded that the corporations were the relevant transferors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]aking all the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom, the court is not persuaded that at the time of that restructuring <i>the corporations, who were actually the ones who were making the conveyance of their stock,</i> were thereby rendered insolvent. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal mounts two attacks on the district court's finding. First, it pounces on a mistake embedded in the court's articulation and labors to persuade us that this bevue discredits the court's conclusion. Second, it posits that the finding is clearly erroneous. Neither attack succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the district court misspoke at one point in its bench decision: there was no conveyance of stock involved in the creation and funding of the limited partnerships. Rather, the shareholders of the parent company (Essex) voted to create the limited partnerships, and each subsidiary corporation then transferred its real estate to its newly formed limited partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From all indications, the court's passing mention of a stock transfer amounts to a slip of the tongue, substituting \"stock\" for \"real estate.\" The record as a whole makes it crystal clear that the court squarely decided the identity question. At the start of the trial, the court put its finger on the problem, asking Federal's counsel, \"[w]ho ... caused [the limited partnerships] to be set up?\" Counsel's response framed the two possible answers to this query &#8212; either (i) Essex and the subsidiary corporations (as the donors of the real estate), or (ii) Romano (whom Federal endeavored to depict as the \"actual\" transferor). Trial of the limited partnership claims focused on which of these proposed answers was correct (i.e., who should be deemed the transferor). The court proceeded to resolve this question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held before that a reasoned decision should not be vacated merely because a lapsus linguae occurred. <i>See, e.g., Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm.,</i> 998 F.2d 1083, 1088 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Clauson v. Smith,</i> 823 F.2d 660, 663 n. 3 (1st Cir.1987). So it is here: taken in context, the district court's infelicitous choice of words does not undermine the cogency of its determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving to the next plateau, we perceive no clear error in the court's conclusion that the corporations, not the individual defendants, were the relevant transferors. It is undisputed that Essex and its subsidiaries formed the limited partnerships and deeded the real estate to them. Although Romano apparently voted his shares (or, more precisely, the shares standing in the name of the B &amp; T Trust) in favor of the restructuring, there is no direct evidence to support a finding that he was the driving force behind the decision. Romano was not the majority shareholder, and he testified that he was not \"in a position to either block or approve what took place.\" While we may regard Romano's assertion as suspect, weighing the evidence and assessing the witnesses' credibility is uniquely the province of the district court. Here, there were two permissible views of the evidence. In such a circumstance, the factfinder's choice between those competing views cannot be clearly erroneous. <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504; <i>Keyes,</i> 853 F.2d at 1020.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this phase of our inquiry. Given the court's supportable finding as to the identity of the transferors, Federal's claim of constructive fraud must fail. Viewing the corporations as the transferors, there is no evidence that they were insolvent either at the time of the transfers or immediately thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Actual Fraud.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves Federal's claim under UFCA &#167; 7. Our analysis of this claim is straightforward. Setting aside a conveyance for actual fraud requires, at a bare minimum, a finding of \"actual intent... to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors.\" <i>Palmer v. Murphy,</i> 42 Mass.App.Ct. 334, 677 N.E.2d 247, 254-55 &amp; n. 15 (1997) (construing UFCA &#167; 7). The court below found as a matter of fact that the limited partnerships were created and funded for a legitimate business purpose rather than to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. This finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Klock testified that the reason for the restructuring was to obtain HUD financing to rehabilitate the nursing homes. According to Klock, HUD required, as a condition of each loan, that the real estate be separated from the operating entity. The limited partnerships provided the vehicles for that separation. Despite countervailing evidence suggesting that the purpose behind the restructuring was to dilute the value of Romano's stock, the trial court was free to choose between the two versions of the truth and draw appropriate inferences. <i>See Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504; <i>Keyes,</i> 853 F.2d at 1020. Consequently, we uphold the court's rejection of the actual fraud claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VII. THE TRANSFER TO ESSEX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come now to the order setting aside the post-trial transfer of Romano's well-traveled shares to Essex.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In response to Federal's motion to annul that transfer, the district court held a status conference on June 17, 2002. Although the court set the matter down for hearing eight days hence, it was vague as to how that hearing would proceed. When the appointed date arrived, the court declined to take testimony, instead inviting oral argument and telling the parties that it was treating the hearing \"functionally as a motion for summary judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening to the lawyers' arguments, the court reserved decision. It subsequently filed a written rescript in which it ruled, as a matter of law, that the transfer must be rescinded. <i>Fed. Refin.,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standard of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the court's explicit statement at the June 25 hearing, we invoke our familiar summary judgment jurisprudence. Under that rubric, we, like the district court, must accept the facts most favorable to the nonmoving party (here, Romano) and draw all reasonable inferences to that party's behoof. <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990). We review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo. <i>Id.</i> We will affirm only if the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party moves for summary judgment and suggests that no trialworthy issues exist, that party ordinarily must support the motion with affidavits or other materials of evidentiary quality. <i>Plumley v. S. Container, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 364, 368 (1st Cir.2002). The burden of production then shifts to the nonmovant to show that a genuine issue looms. <i>Garside,</i> 895 F.2d at 48. The protocol differs, however, as to issues on which the nonmovant bears the burden of proof. As to such issues, the movant is not obliged to make an initial evidentiary showing. Rather, it is incumbent upon the nonmovant to demonstrate, in the first instance, that specific facts exist sufficient to create an authentic dispute. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Preference Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the UFTA controls with respect to Federal's claim that a preferential transfer occurred. <i>See supra</i> Part III. That statute empowers a court to set aside a transfer as preferential if (i) the creditor's claim arose before the transfer occurred, (ii) the transfer was made to an insider on account of an antecedent debt, (iii) the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer, and (iv) the transferee had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 6(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano first posits that a genuine issue of material fact existed vis-&#224;-vis his solvency at the time Essex redeemed his stock. As the moving party, Federal bore the initial burden of producing evidence of Romano's insolvency. <i>Plumley,</i> 303 F.3d at 368.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A finding of insolvency requires proof of both liabilities and assets. <i>See First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan,</i> 701 N.E.2d at 353-55. The papers before the district court contained evidence tending to show that Romano's debts exceeded $17,000,000 at the time of the transfer. But Federal provided next to no evidence on the asset side of the ledger. It merely asked the court to take judicial notice of the prior ruling that Romano's only significant asset was the Essex stock and pointed out that Romano had purportedly \"sold\" the stock to Essex for an $85,000 credit on an antecedent debt and a ten-year forbearance agreement as to the balance of that debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Romano that this evidence was insufficient to permit a reasoned calculation of the value of his assets (and, thus, of his financial condition). A finding of insolvency requires more than a showing of formidable debt; it also requires a corresponding showing as to the debtor's assets. The fact that Romano had no assets besides the Essex shares in 1988 &#8212; some fourteen years before the date of the transfer in question &#8212; told the court very little about the extent of his holdings in 2002. While it may be likely that the value of Romano's assets was less than the amount of his liabilities, summary judgment cannot be granted on the basis of informed intuitions. \"The precincts patrolled by Rule 56 admit of ... no room for the judge to superimpose his own ideas of probability and likelihood (no matter how reasonable those ideas may be) upon the carapace of the cold record.\" <i>Greenburg v. P.R. Marit. Shipping Auth.,</i> 835 F.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir.1987). A court considering a summary judgment motion cannot simply presume that plaintiffs will win cases that seem open and shut. <i>See Leyva v. On the Beach, Inc.,</i> 171 F.3d 717, 720 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting summary judgment, the court below glossed over this evidentiary defect. It noted the mountain of debt facing Romano and then suggested that it was \"undisputed\" that this debt exceeded the dollar value of Romano's assets. <i>Fed. Refin.,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 28. We have been over the record with a fine-tooth comb and cannot find any such concession. During the June 25 hearing, Romano's counsel acknowledged that the court earlier had found Romano insolvent, but then reminded the court that the situation had changed. Counsel stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There has to be a valuation hearing and a trial on the merits to find out if the items that were conveyed by Mr. Romano to Essex were conveyed by someone who was <i>then</i> insolvent.... That's a factual issue that can't be glossed over and can't be determined in this kind of proceeding. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That statement squarely raised the insolvency question. Thus, the district court erred in treating the fact as undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That error undermines the order for summary judgment. On this record, Federal simply did not carry its burden of production anent the insolvency question. Whatever the evidence eventually may show regarding the ratio of Romano's assets to his liabilities &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; we are constrained at this stage to rule that summary judgment was improvidently granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano also argues that other genuine issues of material fact remained unresolved at the time that the district court granted summary judgment. To this end, he points us to a series of defenses available under UFTA &#167; 9. For the sake of completeness, we examine this argument as well. We use UFTA &#167; 9(f)(2) as an exemplar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The UFTA provides that even if a transfer meets the criteria for avoidance set out in UFTA &#167; 6, a court may not set it aside so long as it was \"made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the insider.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109(a), &#167; 9(f)(2). That provision constitutes an affirmative defense, and, thus, the burden of proof falls on the party asserting it. <i>See Prairie Lakes Health Care Sys., Inc. v. Wookey,</i> 583 N.W.2d 405, 414 &amp; n. 7 (S.D.1998) (concluding that the burden of proving section 9 defenses falls on the party asserting them). In order to avoid summary judgment, therefore, Romano typically would have to shoulder the burden of adducing specific facts tending to show that his transfer of shares to Essex was a transaction undertaken in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano asserted the section 9(f)(2) defense at the June 25 hearing. He did not, however, adduce any evidence in support of it. In the usual case, mere assertions of counsel are not enough to block summary judgment. <i>See Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners,</i> 1 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Brennan v. Hendrigan,</i> 888 F.2d 189, 191 (1st Cir.1989). Federal urges us to apply that rule here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal's argument overlooks the atypical procedural posture in which this question arose. Federal's motion to set aside the post-trial transfer was not couched as a motion for summary judgment. At the June 17 status conference &#8212; the first time the district court addressed Federal's motion &#8212; the court set the matter down for hearing on June 25, stating that it would attempt to resolve the motion \"as a matter of law\" and that if it could not do so it would try the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These comments were imprecise. Although the court may have intended all along to hold a summary judgment hearing, it did not say so. No motion for summary judgment had been made, and the docket entry reveals that the clerk scheduled June 25 as the first day for \"a jury-waived trial.\" To confuse matters further, the court neither specifically mentioned summary judgment nor asked the parties to prepare affidavits or other evidentiary submissions before the June 25 hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have recognized that summary judgment is strong medicine, and the rules provide that parties must be given adequate notice of summary judgment proceedings and a reasonable time within which to proffer supporting documents. <i>See, e.g., Rogan v. Menino,</i> 175 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Stella v. Town of Tewksbury,</i> 4 F.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir.1993). Indeed, Rule 56(a) anticipates that a party opposing summary judgment will have a ten-day window within which to prepare and present evidence in opposition. We have taken special pains to emphasize the importance of this temporal window in cases &#8212; analogous to this one &#8212; involving sua sponte grants of summary judgment. The district court must \"first give[ ] the targeted party notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.\" <i>Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1996); <i>accord Leyva,</i> 171 F.3d at 720; <i>Stella,</i> 4 F.3d at 55-56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, the district court's ruling cannot withstand scrutiny. No motion for summary judgment had been filed, and nothing in the court's instructions prior to June 25 alerted Romano to the need to produce evidentiary support for his affirmative defenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Accordingly, the first real notice that the court would treat the matter under the framework applicable to summary judgment motions came on the day of the hearing: June 25. Thus, the procedure followed in this case flouted the imperatives of Rule 56. <i>See Berkovitz,</i> 89 F.3d at 30. The result was that Romano had neither advance notice of the district court's intentions nor an adequate opportunity to proffer evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. By its very nature, a section 9(f)(2) defense requires a fact-specific inquiry into the workings of the transferor and the transferee and the specific nature of the transactions between them. Federal's proffers do not conclusively demonstrate the futility of a section 9(f)(2) defense and, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, we cannot hold Romano's failure to lay a solid factual foundation for that defense against him. Consequently, the issue remains open, and the entry of summary judgment must be vacated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's orders setting aside the 1988 stock transfer and refusing to collapse the limited partnership structures. However, in light of procedural irregularities and the existence of unresolved factual disputes, we vacate the lower court's entry of what amounted to a sua sponte summary judgment regarding the 2002 stock transfer and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We leave intact the court's provisional appointment of a receiver to hold the embattled shares until such time as their fate is resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.

Although the court initially denied that request, Federal subsequently renewed it. We discuss the fate of Federal's renewed request<i>infra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Massachusetts repealed the UFCA in 1996 and replaced it with the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA). 1996 Mass. Acts 157 (effective Oct. 8, 1996). Both acts carry the same chapter number, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A. Massachusetts law is clear that the UFTA is not to be applied retroactively<i>First Fed.

Sys., Inc.,</i> 53 Mass.App.Ct. 497, 760 N.E.2d 739, 754 n. 21 (2002). Because the conveyances that we have mentioned up to this point took place during the currency of the UFCA, that version of chapter 109A governs our analysis of them.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> At oral argument in this court, Romano's counsel suggested that the expert testimony should have been allowed to show that the value of the shares (zero) was equal to what B &amp; T paid for them (nothing), and that, therefore, the transfer had been for fair consideration. We disregard this argument because Romano never advanced it in the district court<i>See Teamsters Union, Loc. No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"); <i>Clauson v.

FDIC,</i> 36 Mass.App.Ct. 162, 629 N.E.2d 344, 349 (1994), do little more than cite to <i>Richman.</i> They add nothing to Romano's argument.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Essex, qua intervenor, joins Romano in prosecuting this appeal (No. 02-2547). With respect to this issue, Essex's and Romano's rights are congruent.

Like the section 9(f)(2) defense, these defenses call for fact-specific inquiries &#8212; and Romano had no fair opportunity to produce evidence regarding them. Thus, Romano remains free to litigate these issues upon remand</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

This is a case in point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, Federal Refinance Co., Inc. (Federal) obtained a deficiency judgment for over $331,000 against Frank Romano, Jr. It spent the next five years trying to satisfy the judgment by levying upon Romano's principal asset (his shares of stock in a closely held corporation). When the stock proved elusive, Federal asked the district court to set aside a series of allegedly fraudulent transfers. The court's ensuing rulings did not entirely please either Federal or Romano. Both appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's bench decision (i) setting aside Romano's 1988 transfer of the shares to a family trust and (ii) upholding the creation and funding of certain limited partnerships. We are less sanguine, however, about the court's subsequent invalidation of yet a third transfer. <i>See Fed. Refin. Co. v. Klock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2396753\"><a href=\"/opinion/2396753/federal-refinance-co-inc-v-klock/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2002). Finding a procedural error, we vacate that order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are largely undisputed. In 1980, Wickford Realty Trust obtained a mortgage loan from Second National Bank. Romano unconditionally guaranteed repayment of the loan, which eventually went into default. Federal acquired the defaulted loan and conducted a foreclosure proceeding. Left with a deficiency, Federal looked to the guaranty and brought a diversity action against Romano in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On March 3, 1997, the court awarded Federal a judgment for $331,608.78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano was thought to be a principal of a closely held corporation, Essex Group, Inc. (Essex), a holding company whose six wholly-owned subsidiaries each operated a nursing home. Before any of the transfers here at issue, Essex's shares were held 43.75% by Romano, 47.25% by his mother Mary, and 9% by the Doyle Family Trust.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Federal attempted to satisfy the judgment by garnishing Romano's stock, it learned that the stock had flown the coop. In 1988, Romano had transferred 17,500 shares (the whole of his 43.75% equity interest), without pecuniary consideration, to a newly formed trust (the B &amp; T Trust) of which he was the trustee and his children were the beneficiaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal's frustration grew even more pronounced when it discovered that, between 1991 and 1994, Essex had created three limited partnerships. Each had an Essex subsidiary as its general partner (with a 20% share of the profits) and Romano's wife, Deborah Klock, as its sole limited partner (with an 80% share of the profits). Moreover, the general partners had divested themselves of their real estate, each having spun off title to its nursing home into its limited partnership. These transactions arguably diluted the value of Essex's shares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Romano did not appear to have other significant assets, Federal sued to get the shares back into his hands<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and to collapse the limited partnerships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE BENCH DECISION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these claims were tried to the court. The trial ended in a bench decision handed down on April 23, 2002. As we explain below, each side got half a loaf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Count I.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first count of Federal's complaint asked the court to invalidate the stock transfer as a fraudulent conveyance under section 4 of the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (UFCA).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The UFCA's constructive fraud provision, in force in 1988, read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every conveyance made and every obligation incurred by a person who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent is fraudulent as to creditors without regard to his actual intent if the conveyance is made or the obligation is incurred without fair consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 4 (repealed 1996). The district court determined that Romano's 1988 conveyance violated this section. It set aside the transfer to the trust and decreed that the 17,500 shares of stock were \"deemed to be in the unencumbered possession of ... Romano.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Counts II-IV.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts II through IV of Federal's complaint alleged that the purpose and effect of the creation and funding of the partnerships was to dilute the value of Romano's stock. On this basis, Federal sought to collapse the limited partnerships. In mounting this attack, it relied upon both UFCA &#167; 4, quoted <i>supra,</i> and UFCA &#167; 7. The latter provision is an actual fraud provision. Throughout the relevant time frame, it read: Every conveyance made and every obligation incurred with actual intent, as distinguished from intent presumed in law, to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors, is fraudulent as to both present and future creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 7 (repealed 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled against Federal on these counts. It rejected Federal's constructive fraud claim, finding that the corporations were the actual transferors and that they were not insolvent at the times of the transfers. The court likewise rejected the claim of actual fraud, crediting evidence that there was a legitimate business purpose behind the creation and funding of the limited partnerships, namely, that the restructuring was a prerequisite to obtaining needed financing from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE POST-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having won a partial victory, Federal filed a motion in aid of judgment on May 2, 2002. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 69(a). In that motion, Federal asked the district court to reach and apply the 17,500 shares of Essex stock. Much to Federal's dismay, it learned that the shares had slipped away again. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point (the exact time is immaterial for present purposes), Essex had purchased from another of Romano's creditors a $15,000,000 debt. <i>See FDIC v. Elder Care Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196723\"><a href=\"/opinion/196723/fdic-v-elder-care-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 525-26 (1st Cir.1996) (describing the origin of the debt). In late April of 2002 (whether before or after the date of the district court's bench decision is not entirely clear), Romano transferred his 17,500 shares to Essex, ostensibly in exchange for an $85,000 credit and a ten-year forbearance agreement on that indebtedness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with a Tantalean predicament, Federal promptly moved to reconsider the denial of its motion for the appointment of a receiver, <i>see supra</i> note 1, and to annul this most recent conveyance. Federal averred that the 2002 transaction should be rescinded as preferential. Because this latest transfer took place after the effective date of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), that updated version of chapter 109A governed the claim asserted. The UFTA provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made if the transfer was made to an insider for an antecedent debt, the debtor was insolvent at that time, and the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 6(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court saw no need to take evidence, but, rather, summarily voided the transfer as preferential. <i>Fed. Refin.,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 28. The court also ensured that the elusive shares would stay put, enjoining Romano from transferring or encumbering them in any way that might interfere with Federal's efforts to reach and apply. Finally, as a sanction for Romano's misconduct during discovery, the court granted Federal's renewed motion for the appointment of a receiver to hold the shares for the time being. <i>See id.</i> at 28-29 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE APPEALS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have cross-appealed. With respect to the district court's bench decision, Romano challenges the order voiding the transfer to the B &amp; T Trust whereas Federal challenges the order upholding the creation and funding of the limited partnerships. With respect to the district court's subsequent written decision, Romano and Essex &#8212; which has intervened &#8212; challenge the order invalidating the stock-for-credit-and-forbearance arrangement.

THE TRANSFER TO THE B &amp; T TRUST</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">UFCA &#167; 4 sets out two basic conditions for setting aside a transfer on the ground of constructive fraud: the transferor must have (i) been insolvent at the time of the conveyance (or rendered insolvent by it), and (ii) made the conveyance without fair consideration. <i>Boston Trading Group v. Burnazos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499424\"><a href=\"/opinion/499424/boston-trading-group-inc-v-robert-a-burnazos-boston-trading-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1504</span></a></span>, 1510 (1st Cir.1987). A person is insolvent for these purposes when the readily realizable market value of his assets is less than the amount required to pay his existing debts as they become due. <i>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Napoleon,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></span>, 353-55 (1998). Fair consideration is given in exchange for transferred property when, \"as a fair equivalent therefor, and in good faith, [other] property is conveyed or an antecedent debt is satisfied.\" <i>Boston Trading Group,</i> 835 F.2d at 1512 (quoting former Mass.

He argues, in substance, that the court could not reach a decision as to his solvency without some evidence as to the value of the Essex stock. This argument is jejune. His own testimony established that the 17,500 shares of Essex stock were his only significant asset at the relevant time (1988) and that he was then personally obligated to repay over $10,000,000 in loans that were about to go into default. If the stock had little value, Romano was insolvent. Conversely, if the stock's value exceeded Romano's massive liabilities, then the transfer would have rendered him insolvent. Either way, Romano's attack misfires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His challenge to the court's conclusion that the transfer lacked fair consideration is hopeless. He admitted that he received no money or property in return for the shares. And although his brief includes a perfunctory assertion that the transfer was in fact adequately supported by the love and affection of his children, he points us to no case law that suggests that, for purposes of the UFCA, such intangibles may supplant money, property, or satisfaction of an antecedent debt as fair consideration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano's only colorable argument implicates the district court's ruling in response to a motion in limine. In the pretrial proceedings, Romano identified an expert witness whose testimony was intended to show that, at the time of the conveyance to the B &amp; T Trust, the 17,500 shares were worthless. Federal moved in limine to exclude the testimony. Romano objected, exhorting the court to allow his expert to testify on the theory that a fraudulent conveyance action will not lie if the asset conveyed is worthless at the time of transfer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court granted the motion in limine, holding that the value of the stock was legally irrelevant. Romano asks us to overturn this ruling, vacate the order setting aside the transfer, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As framed, this assignment of error presents an abstract legal question regarding the proper interpretation of a state statute. Such questions engender de novo review. <i>See Salve Regina Coll. v.

UFCA &#167; 4 authorizes the setting aside of certain conveyances. It defines a conveyance as \"every payment of money, assignment, release, transfer, lease, mortgage or pledge of tangible or intangible property, and also the creation of any lien or incumbrance.\" Nothing in the statute qualifies the term \"property\" or in any way indicates a legislative intent to limit the statute's reach to conveyances involving property having a positive market value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no comfort in the language of the UFCA, Romano falls back upon the decision in <i>Richman v. Leiser,</i> 18 Mass. App.Ct. 308, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2051473\"><a href=\"/opinion/2051473/richman-v-leiser/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span> (1984). That decision cannot carry the weight that Romano loads upon it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Richman,</i> an unsecured creditor attempted to set aside a conveyance of property encumbered by liens exceeding its market value. Despite a showing of fraudulent intent, the court refused to invalidate the transfer. The court began with the proposition that \"[a] conveyance is not established as a fraudulent conveyance upon showing of a fraudulent intention alone; there must also be a resulting diminution in the assets of the debtor available to creditors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 798. It found no such diminution, reasoning that the complaining unsecured creditor \"could not have reached the property before the conveyance,\" and so \"the conveyance itself could not have been fraudulent as to him.\" <i>Id.</i> at 799 (quoting <i>Stauffer v. Stauffer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1437062\"><a href=\"/opinion/1437062/stauffer-v-stauffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1437062\"><a href=\"/opinion/1437062/stauffer-v-stauffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 245 (1976)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano reads this language to signify that a fraudulent conveyance claim will not lie unless a debtor has equity in the transferred property. <i>Richman,</i> however, does not sweep so broadly. The linchpin of the <i>Richman</i> decision is the principle that a transfer of fully encumbered property (i.e., property that is mortgaged for more than it is worth and, thus, has no residual value) puts no otherwise available assets beyond the grasp of an <i>unsecured</i> creditor. That principle makes good sense: whether or not the debtor effects a transfer, the accumulated security interests will prevent an unsecured creditor from reaching and applying the overencumbered property. <i>Cf. Stauffer,</i> 351 A.2d at 245 (refusing to set aside a conveyance of property held by the entireties because the husband's creditor could not have reached the asset pre-conveyance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand is cut from a different cloth. The shares of Essex's stock were free and clear at the time that Romano signed them over to the B &amp; T Trust. Absent the transfer, Federal could have reached the stock &#8212; whatever its value &#8212; in an effort to satisfy the judgment. Thus, the transfer put property that would otherwise have been available out of the complaining creditor's reach. For that reason, <i>Richman</i> is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This result comports with the policies underlying the UFCA. \"The purpose of the UFCA is to preserve a debtor's assets so that creditors may look to them in the event that the debtor ceases payments....\" <i>First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan,</i> 701 N.E.2d at 354-55 (citations omitted). A debtor \"may not give [his assets] away and thereby put them beyond the reach of creditors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 355. Given the district court's factual findings, Romano's conduct falls into the heartland of the prohibition against fraudulent conveyances. Allowing an exception on the ground that the shares were worthless would be at odds with the rationale underlying that prohibition. We conclude, therefore, that the district court did not err in granting the motion in limine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano makes a related claim of error implicating the district court's denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c). In the course of arguing that motion, he vouchsafed that Federal could not make the required prima facie showing of Romano's insolvency at the time of the transfer without some evidence as to the value of the shares. He now assigns error to the court's denial of this motion. This is an old whine in a new bottle. The argument essentially repeats a claim already made and rejected. <i>See supra</i> p. 10. As said, the evidence established that Romano was deeply in debt at the time of the transfer and that the transferred stock had been his only substantial asset. Hence, Federal made out a prima facie case of insolvency. Since Romano did not rebut this showing &#8212; indeed, he made no discernible effort to do so &#8212; the lower court did not err in denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before leaving this transfer, we address one related item. At the tail end of its brief, Federal makes a perfunctory argument to the effect that the district court erred in denying its request for attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry. Federal's offhand pitch is unaccompanied by any developed argumentation. Under our precedents, therefore, it merits summary rejection. <i>See, e.g., Blake v. Pellegrino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200465\"><a href=\"/opinion/200465/blake-v-first-physicians-cor/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Ryan v.

In all events, neither the UFCA nor the guaranty contains a fee-shifting provision, and Federal offers us no reason to exempt this case from the usual rule that, absent a specific statutory or contractual fee-shifting provision, a prevailing party cannot recover attorneys' fees as of right from the losing party. <i>See Chambers v.

In Federal's estimation, these transactions were both constructively and actually fraudulent. Before analyzing Federal's contentions, we pause to clarify the standard of review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standard of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party who challenges a district court's findings of fact, arrived at after a bench trial, faces a steep uphill climb. When a district court finds the facts without the intervention of a jury, the court of appeals is not at liberty to start afresh. <i>See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir.1990); <i>Keyes v.

Consequently, \"[i]f the district court's account of the evidence is plausible ... the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\" <i>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 573-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span> (1985). In the last analysis, factual findings or conclusions drawn therefrom may only be set aside if, after a searching review of the entire record, the court of appeals \"form[s] a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Cumpiano,</i> 902 F.2d at 152.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal strives to free itself from this inhospitable standard of review by arguing that the trial court merely determined the legal effect of uncontroverted facts. Thus, Federal's thesis runs, the court's decision should be reviewed de novo. We reject this thesis for two reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, Federal's characterization of the material facts as uncontroverted is wishful thinking. Factual disputes sprout throughout the record like weeds in an untended garden. Although Federal classifies such things as the protagonists' motives in restructuring the nursing home operations and the rationale for naming Klock, rather than Romano, as the limited partner, as questions of law, that taxonomy is unrealistic. We consistently have refused to permit parties to advantage themselves by couching questions of fact as questions of law, <i>see, e.g., Reliance Steel Prods. Co. v. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526735\"><a href=\"/opinion/526735/reliance-steel-products-company-v-national-fire-insurance-company-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 577 (1st Cir.1989), and we see no reason to abandon that salutary practice today. The clearly erroneous standard of review \"cannot be evaded by the simple expedient of creative relabeling.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, even if the facts were uncontroverted, that circumstance alone would not alter the standard of review. When the trier's findings depend upon its choice of competing inferences drawn from undisputed facts, the clearly erroneous standard continues to apply. <i>See Jackson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198130\"><a href=\"/opinion/198130/jackson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 233 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Dedham Water Co. v. Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588805\"><a href=\"/opinion/588805/dedham-water-co-inc-v-cumberland-farms-dairy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 457 (1st Cir.1992). To the extent that the raw facts are undisputed, this is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Federal's intimation that mixed questions of fact and law invariably demand de novo review. The scope of review for mixed questions varies. The more fact-intensive the inquiry, the more likely we are to apply clear error review; the more law-dominated the inquiry, the more likely we are to undertake de novo review. <i>Sierra Fria Corp. v. Evans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197592\"><a href=\"/opinion/197592/sierra-fria-corp-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span>, 181 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v.

Probing the existence of a fraudulent conveyance customarily is a factbound inquiry, subjecting the court's findings to clear error review. <i>See, e.g., Beal Bank v. Pittorino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198469\"><a href=\"/opinion/198469/beal-bank-v-amelia/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Barrett v.

This result commends itself with particular force where, as here, a claim turns on elusive issues of motive or intent. <i>See Crellin</i> <i>Techs., Inc. v. Equipmentlease Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195233\"><a href=\"/opinion/195233/crellin-v-equipmentlease-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1994); <i>see also Cumpiano,</i> 902 F.2d at 152 (counseling that \"[f]indings concerning an actor's intent fit neatly within the integument of the `clearly erroneous' rule\"). We are satisfied, therefore, that the standard of review applicable to the lower court's disposition of counts II through IV is clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Constructive Fraud.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the trial court's findings. Setting aside a conveyance for constructive fraud under UFCA &#167; 4 requires both a finding that the transferor was insolvent at the time of the transfer (or was rendered insolvent thereby) and a finding that the conveyance was made without fair consideration. Implicit in this analytic framework is the assumption that the factfinder first must identify the relevant transferor. <i>See Boston Trading Group,</i> 835 F.2d at 1509. Here, the district court concluded that the corporations were the relevant transferors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]aking all the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom, the court is not persuaded that at the time of that restructuring <i>the corporations, who were actually the ones who were making the conveyance of their stock,</i> were thereby rendered insolvent. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal mounts two attacks on the district court's finding. First, it pounces on a mistake embedded in the court's articulation and labors to persuade us that this bevue discredits the court's conclusion. Second, it posits that the finding is clearly erroneous. Neither attack succeeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the district court misspoke at one point in its bench decision: there was no conveyance of stock involved in the creation and funding of the limited partnerships. Rather, the shareholders of the parent company (Essex) voted to create the limited partnerships, and each subsidiary corporation then transferred its real estate to its newly formed limited partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From all indications, the court's passing mention of a stock transfer amounts to a slip of the tongue, substituting \"stock\" for \"real estate.\" The record as a whole makes it crystal clear that the court squarely decided the identity question. At the start of the trial, the court put its finger on the problem, asking Federal's counsel, \"[w]ho ... caused [the limited partnerships] to be set up?\" Counsel's response framed the two possible answers to this query &#8212; either (i) Essex and the subsidiary corporations (as the donors of the real estate), or (ii) Romano (whom Federal endeavored to depict as the \"actual\" transferor). Trial of the limited partnership claims focused on which of these proposed answers was correct (i.e., who should be deemed the transferor). The court proceeded to resolve this question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held before that a reasoned decision should not be vacated merely because a lapsus linguae occurred. <i>See, e.g., Lenn v.

So it is here: taken in context, the district court's infelicitous choice of words does not undermine the cogency of its determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving to the next plateau, we perceive no clear error in the court's conclusion that the corporations, not the individual defendants, were the relevant transferors. It is undisputed that Essex and its subsidiaries formed the limited partnerships and deeded the real estate to them. Although Romano apparently voted his shares (or, more precisely, the shares standing in the name of the B &amp; T Trust) in favor of the restructuring, there is no direct evidence to support a finding that he was the driving force behind the decision. Romano was not the majority shareholder, and he testified that he was not \"in a position to either block or approve what took place.\" While we may regard Romano's assertion as suspect, weighing the evidence and assessing the witnesses' credibility is uniquely the province of the district court. Here, there were two permissible views of the evidence. In such a circumstance, the factfinder's choice between those competing views cannot be clearly erroneous. <i>Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 574, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Given the court's supportable finding as to the identity of the transferors, Federal's claim of constructive fraud must fail. Viewing the corporations as the transferors, there is no evidence that they were insolvent either at the time of the transfers or immediately thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Actual Fraud.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves Federal's claim under UFCA &#167; 7. Our analysis of this claim is straightforward. Setting aside a conveyance for actual fraud requires, at a bare minimum, a finding of \"actual intent... to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors.\" <i>Palmer v. Murphy,</i> 42 Mass.App.Ct. 334, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></span>, 254-55 &amp; n. 15 (1997) (construing UFCA &#167; 7). The court below found as a matter of fact that the limited partnerships were created and funded for a legitimate business purpose rather than to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. This finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Klock testified that the reason for the restructuring was to obtain HUD financing to rehabilitate the nursing homes. According to Klock, HUD required, as a condition of each loan, that the real estate be separated from the operating entity. The limited partnerships provided the vehicles for that separation. Despite countervailing evidence suggesting that the purpose behind the restructuring was to dilute the value of Romano's stock, the trial court was free to choose between the two versions of the truth and draw appropriate inferences. <i>See Anderson,</i> 470 U.S. at 574, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Consequently, we uphold the court's rejection of the actual fraud claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VII. THE TRANSFER TO ESSEX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come now to the order setting aside the post-trial transfer of Romano's well-traveled shares to Essex.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In response to Federal's motion to annul that transfer, the district court held a status conference on June 17, 2002. Although the court set the matter down for hearing eight days hence, it was vague as to how that hearing would proceed. When the appointed date arrived, the court declined to take testimony, instead inviting oral argument and telling the parties that it was treating the hearing \"functionally as a motion for summary judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening to the lawyers' arguments, the court reserved decision. It subsequently filed a written rescript in which it ruled, as a matter of law, that the transfer must be rescinded. <i>Fed. Refin.,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Standard of Review.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the court's explicit statement at the June 25 hearing, we invoke our familiar summary judgment jurisprudence. Under that rubric, we, like the district court, must accept the facts most favorable to the nonmoving party (here, Romano) and draw all reasonable inferences to that party's behoof. <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.1990). We review the district court's entry of summary judgment de novo. <i>Id.</i> We will affirm only if the \"pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a party moves for summary judgment and suggests that no trialworthy issues exist, that party ordinarily must support the motion with affidavits or other materials of evidentiary quality. <i>Plumley v. S. Container, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200125\"><a href=\"/opinion/200125/plumley-v-southern-container/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 368 (1st Cir.2002). The burden of production then shifts to the nonmovant to show that a genuine issue looms. <i>Garside,</i> 895 F.2d at 48. The protocol differs, however, as to issues on which the nonmovant bears the burden of proof. As to such issues, the movant is not obliged to make an initial evidentiary showing. Rather, it is incumbent upon the nonmovant to demonstrate, in the first instance, that specific facts exist sufficient to create an authentic dispute. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Preference Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the UFTA controls with respect to Federal's claim that a preferential transfer occurred. <i>See supra</i> Part III. That statute empowers a court to set aside a transfer as preferential if (i) the creditor's claim arose before the transfer occurred, (ii) the transfer was made to an insider on account of an antecedent debt, (iii) the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer, and (iv) the transferee had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A, &#167; 6(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano first posits that a genuine issue of material fact existed vis-&#224;-vis his solvency at the time Essex redeemed his stock. As the moving party, Federal bore the initial burden of producing evidence of Romano's insolvency. <i>Plumley,</i> 303 F.3d at 368.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A finding of insolvency requires proof of both liabilities and assets. <i>See First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan,</i> 701 N.E.2d at 353-55. The papers before the district court contained evidence tending to show that Romano's debts exceeded $17,000,000 at the time of the transfer. But Federal provided next to no evidence on the asset side of the ledger. It merely asked the court to take judicial notice of the prior ruling that Romano's only significant asset was the Essex stock and pointed out that Romano had purportedly \"sold\" the stock to Essex for an $85,000 credit on an antecedent debt and a ten-year forbearance agreement as to the balance of that debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Romano that this evidence was insufficient to permit a reasoned calculation of the value of his assets (and, thus, of his financial condition). A finding of insolvency requires more than a showing of formidable debt; it also requires a corresponding showing as to the debtor's assets. The fact that Romano had no assets besides the Essex shares in 1988 &#8212; some fourteen years before the date of the transfer in question &#8212; told the court very little about the extent of his holdings in 2002. While it may be likely that the value of Romano's assets was less than the amount of his liabilities, summary judgment cannot be granted on the basis of informed intuitions. \"The precincts patrolled by Rule 56 admit of ... no room for the judge to superimpose his own ideas of probability and likelihood (no matter how reasonable those ideas may be) upon the carapace of the cold record.\" <i>Greenburg v. P.R. Marit. Shipping Auth.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499045\"><a href=\"/opinion/499045/laurence-b-greenburg-etc-v-puerto-rico-maritime-shipping-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 936 (1st Cir.1987). A court considering a summary judgment motion cannot simply presume that plaintiffs will win cases that seem open and shut. <i>See Leyva v. On the Beach, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198404\"><a href=\"/opinion/198404/leyva-v-on-the-beach-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 720 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting summary judgment, the court below glossed over this evidentiary defect. It noted the mountain of debt facing Romano and then suggested that it was \"undisputed\" that this debt exceeded the dollar value of Romano's assets. <i>Fed. Refin.,</i> 229 F.Supp.2d at 28. We have been over the record with a fine-tooth comb and cannot find any such concession. During the June 25 hearing, Romano's counsel acknowledged that the court earlier had found Romano insolvent, but then reminded the court that the situation had changed. Counsel stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There has to be a valuation hearing and a trial on the merits to find out if the items that were conveyed by Mr. Romano to Essex were conveyed by someone who was <i>then</i> insolvent.... That's a factual issue that can't be glossed over and can't be determined in this kind of proceeding. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That statement squarely raised the insolvency question. Thus, the district court erred in treating the fact as undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That error undermines the order for summary judgment. On this record, Federal simply did not carry its burden of production anent the insolvency question. Whatever the evidence eventually may show regarding the ratio of Romano's assets to his liabilities &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; we are constrained at this stage to rule that summary judgment was improvidently granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano also argues that other genuine issues of material fact remained unresolved at the time that the district court granted summary judgment. To this end, he points us to a series of defenses available under UFTA &#167; 9. For the sake of completeness, we examine this argument as well. We use UFTA &#167; 9(f)(2) as an exemplar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The UFTA provides that even if a transfer meets the criteria for avoidance set out in UFTA &#167; 6, a court may not set it aside so long as it was \"made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the insider.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109(a), &#167; 9(f)(2). That provision constitutes an affirmative defense, and, thus, the burden of proof falls on the party asserting it. <i>See Prairie Lakes Health Care Sys., Inc. v. Wookey,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></span>, 414 &amp; n. 7 (S.D.1998) (concluding that the burden of proving section 9 defenses falls on the party asserting them). In order to avoid summary judgment, therefore, Romano typically would have to shoulder the burden of adducing specific facts tending to show that his transfer of shares to Essex was a transaction undertaken in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romano asserted the section 9(f)(2) defense at the June 25 hearing. He did not, however, adduce any evidence in support of it. In the usual case, mere assertions of counsel are not enough to block summary judgment. <i>See Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194847\"><a href=\"/opinion/194847/dow-v-ubc/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.1993); <i>Brennan v.

Federal urges us to apply that rule here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal's argument overlooks the atypical procedural posture in which this question arose. Federal's motion to set aside the post-trial transfer was not couched as a motion for summary judgment. At the June 17 status conference &#8212; the first time the district court addressed Federal's motion &#8212; the court set the matter down for hearing on June 25, stating that it would attempt to resolve the motion \"as a matter of law\" and that if it could not do so it would try the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These comments were imprecise. Although the court may have intended all along to hold a summary judgment hearing, it did not say so. No motion for summary judgment had been made, and the docket entry reveals that the clerk scheduled June 25 as the first day for \"a jury-waived trial.\" To confuse matters further, the court neither specifically mentioned summary judgment nor asked the parties to prepare affidavits or other evidentiary submissions before the June 25 hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have recognized that summary judgment is strong medicine, and the rules provide that parties must be given adequate notice of summary judgment proceedings and a reasonable time within which to proffer supporting documents. <i>See, e.g., Rogan v. Menino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198447\"><a href=\"/opinion/198447/rogan-v-menino/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.1999); <i>Stella v.

Indeed, Rule 56(a) anticipates that a party opposing summary judgment will have a ten-day window within which to prepare and present evidence in opposition. We have taken special pains to emphasize the importance of this temporal window in cases &#8212; analogous to this one &#8212; involving sua sponte grants of summary judgment. The district court must \"first give[ ] the targeted party notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.\" <i>Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196881\"><a href=\"/opinion/196881/berkovitz-v-home-box-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1996); <i>accord Leyva,</i> 171 F.3d at 720; <i>Stella,</i> 4 F.3d at 55-56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, the district court's ruling cannot withstand scrutiny. No motion for summary judgment had been filed, and nothing in the court's instructions prior to June 25 alerted Romano to the need to produce evidentiary support for his affirmative defenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Accordingly, the first real notice that the court would treat the matter under the framework applicable to summary judgment motions came on the day of the hearing: June 25. Thus, the procedure followed in this case flouted the imperatives of Rule 56. <i>See Berkovitz,</i> 89 F.3d at 30. The result was that Romano had neither advance notice of the district court's intentions nor an adequate opportunity to proffer evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. By its very nature, a section 9(f)(2) defense requires a fact-specific inquiry into the workings of the transferor and the transferee and the specific nature of the transactions between them. Federal's proffers do not conclusively demonstrate the futility of a section 9(f)(2) defense and, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, we cannot hold Romano's failure to lay a solid factual foundation for that defense against him. Consequently, the issue remains open, and the entry of summary judgment must be vacated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's orders setting aside the 1988 stock transfer and refusing to collapse the limited partnership structures. However, in light of procedural irregularities and the existence of unresolved factual disputes, we vacate the lower court's entry of what amounted to a sua sponte summary judgment regarding the 2002 stock transfer and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We leave intact the court's provisional appointment of a receiver to hold the embattled shares until such time as their fate is resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.
