Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Michael J. Iacopino, with whom Brennan Caron Lenehan &\nIacopino was on brief, for appellant.\n     Peter E. Papps, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         November 23, 2005\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.         Dustin Buttrick, a twenty-two-\n\nyear-old man living in Elliot, Maine, crossed over the state line\n\ninto New Hampshire, having arranged to rendezvous with a fourteen-\n\nyear-old girl he met over the Internet to have sex.           The \"girl\"\n\nturned out to have been a fiction; Buttrick was caught in a sting\n\noperation   set   up   by   the   Portsmouth,    New   Hampshire,   Police\n\nDepartment. There is no dispute that the \"girl\" told Buttrick that\n\nshe was underage, and there is no dispute that he crossed over the\n\nstate line for the anticipated tryst.           Buttrick never found his\n\nintended paramour; the Portsmouth police arrested him first.          His\n\ndefense was that mere curiosity drove him; although he brought\n\nalong condoms, as he had told the \"girl\" that he would, he said\n\nthat he had never intended to have sex with her.\n\n            On September 9, 2004, a jury found Buttrick guilty of\n\ntraveling in interstate commerce with the purpose of engaging in\n\nillicit sexual conduct with another person between twelve and\n\nsixteen years of age, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b).            See\n\nalso 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423(f), 2241(c).           Buttrick was sentenced to\n\neighteen months in prison, followed by a five-year period of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n            This appeal addresses two legal questions previously\n\nraised in defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal or, in the\n\nalternative, a new trial.         Buttrick argues that the statute of\n\nconviction, 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b), is unconstitutional as applied to\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fhim because it punishes mere thought and burdens the right to\n\ntravel.   The statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n           A person who travels in interstate commerce\n           . . . for the purpose of engaging in any\n           illicit sexual conduct with another person\n           shall be fined under this title or imprisoned\n           not more than 30 years, or both.\n\nButtrick's second argument is that the district court erred in\n\ndenying   his    request        for   a   jury    instruction,    drawn   from   an\n\naffirmative defense under the Model Penal Code, on abandonment or\n\nrenunciation of intent to commit the crime.\n\n           We hold that the claim of statutory unconstitutionality\n\nis meritless and devolves into nothing more than an insufficiency\n\nof evidence claim.        On the second issue, we agree with the district\n\ncourt that even if, in theory, an abandonment defense were ever\n\navailable in response to a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b),\n\na   question    we   do   not    address,       the   proffered   instruction    was\n\nproperly rejected because it was an erroneous statement of the law.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                           I.\n\n           The facts recited come largely from Buttrick's testimony.\n\nThat testimony includes the evidence as to which the proposed\n\ninstruction was directed and provides the basis for evaluating the\n\nclaims that the statute was unconstitutionally applied.                   There is\n\nno need to discuss the government's additional evidence of guilt.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f               Buttrick testified as follows.         Before the incident in\n\nquestion, he had visited chat rooms thirty or forty times.                   He had\n\nexplicit sexual conversations with women seven or eight times and\n\nmade arrangements to meet three or four of these women.\n\n               On June 8, 2003, Buttrick logged into a Yahoo! chat room.\n\nHe     was   attracted     to   an    individual     using    the   screen     name\n\n\"baybeedaw188\" and contacted her via instant messaging.                  He asked\n\nthe individual her age, and she identified herself as a fourteen-\n\nyear-old girl.         The chat quickly became sexually graphic, with\n\nButtrick suggesting that they get together to \"fool around.\"                     He\n\nalso    said    to    \"baybeedaw188,\"    untruthfully,       that   he   was   only\n\nnineteen years old, that he was from Dover, New Hampshire, and that\n\nhe had \"fooled around\" before with someone he met online.\n\n               Buttrick testified at trial that he had no intent to go\n\nany further than conversation -- that it was all just fantasy.                   He\n\ncontinued       the    fantasy,      replying   to    e-mail    messages       from\n\n\"baybeedaw188\" and engaging in other sexually explicit online\n\nconversations with her.           During a June 22 chat room conversation,\n\nhowever, he went a step beyond fantasy and suggested that they meet\n\nin person.       He and \"baybeedaw188\" agreed to meet at 8:30 a.m. on\n\nTuesday, June 24, 2003, at the New Hampshire State Liquor Store on\n\nthe Route 1 traffic circle in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n\n               Buttrick testified that he did not believe the statements\n\nfrom \"baybeedaw188\" that she was fourteen years old.                     Over the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fweekend before the meeting, Buttrick talked about these chat room\n\nconversations with a friend, Tom Whelan, who was a part-time police\n\nofficer.    Buttrick told Whelan about the meeting, saying he \"would\n\njust drive by and take a look\" and that he \"was curious to see who\n\n[he] was talking to.\"         Whelan advised him that it was a bad idea.\n\n            Still, on Monday, June 23, Buttrick and \"baybeedaw188\"\n\nhad another sexual chat room conversation, during which they\n\nconfirmed    that    they     would    meet    as   planned    the      next   morning.\n\nAccording to the testimony of the detective behind the sting\n\noperation,    Buttrick      told      \"baybeedawl88\"        that   he    would   bring\n\n\"Durex\"-brand       condoms    with    him     to   their     meeting.     Buttrick's\n\ntestimony was that he had no intent to perform any sexual act with\n\nher or even to meet her.         He said that he intended to drive to the\n\nmeeting place in New Hampshire from his home in Maine, about five\n\nmiles away, \"just see who this person was.                  I was just curious.\"\n\n            On Tuesday, June 24, as he dressed before driving to the\n\nmeeting, Buttrick grabbed various items from his dresser, including\n\ncondoms.     He testified that he did not bring the condoms to have\n\nsex with \"baybeedaw188\"; rather, he said, \"I've been going out a\n\nlot and I try to make it a habit of carrying condoms on me.\"                        He\n\nalso testified that as he drove to the meeting, it still had not\n\ncrossed his mind that perhaps he would have sex with her after all.\n\n            Buttrick drove across the state line toward the meeting\n\nplace.     At the traffic circle in Portsmouth, he drove around the\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fcircle once, then pulled off to look toward the liquor store to see\n\nif someone was in the parking lot.   He then drove around the circle\n\nanother time and again pulled off.    He intended, he testified, to\n\nget on the traffic circle a third time.     Before he could do so,\n\nhowever, he was pulled over by the Portsmouth police and arrested.\n\nA detective testified that he recovered two condoms from Buttrick's\n\nfront pocket, one of which was a \"Durex\"-brand condom.\n\n            Buttrick admitted at trial that during a post-arrest\n\ninterview by the police, he was asked whether \"the purpose of this\n\nwhole thing\" was that he \"wanted to have sex with a 14-year-old\n\ngirl,\" and that he answered, \"Yeah.\"    He testified, however, that\n\nwhat he said to the police was not an admission of guilt, just an\n\nacknowledgment that he knew why he had been arrested.    He admitted\n\nthat when he was asked in the post-arrest interview what his\n\npurpose was in crossing the state line, he had said that he did not\n\nknow, but that his intention was to drive home from the traffic\n\ncircle because he \"knew it wasn't a good idea.\"          He further\n\nadmitted that when asked at the interview whether he would have\n\nstopped had he seen a fourteen-year-old-girl in the parking lot, he\n\nhad replied, \"no,\" and said that he \"would have been freaked out\n\nand . . .     would have known it . . . wasn't a good idea.\"     He\n\nstressed that if he had seen a girl at the lot, he would not have\n\nhad sex with her.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f           The crux of Buttrick's defense, then, was that he never\n\nhad any intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct even before he\n\nleft his home on his trip to the meeting place.         Curiosity, in\n\nother words, not sex, led him across the state line.\n\n                                II.\n\nA.         Unconstitutionality of the Statute as Applied\n\n           We   quickly    dispose    of   Buttrick's      as-applied\n\nconstitutional challenge, since the claim of unconstitutionality is\n\ncontrolled by our prior decision in United States v. Gamache, 156\n\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998).    Gamache rejected the argument that 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2423(b) punishes mere thought.    See id. at 7-8.      Other\n\ncircuits have come to the same conclusion.       United States v.\n\nBredimus, 352 F.3d 200, 208-09 (5th Cir. 2003); United States v.\n\nHan, 230 F.3d 560, 563 (2d Cir. 2000); see also Hoke v. United\n\nStates, 227 U.S. 308, 323 (1913) (upholding as constitutional\n\nsimilar statutory language in the Mann Act).\n\n           As Gamache holds, the statute punishes those who perform\n\nthe act of crossing the state line with the intent to engage in the\n\nspecified wrongful conduct.     See 156 F.3d at 8.        The intent\n\nrequirement is often proved through another series of acts.       See\n\nid.   Here, as in Gamache, those acts include defendant's repeated\n\ncorrespondence with his intended paramour, his setting up the\n\ndetails of the assignation, his bringing of the condoms, and his\n\nactual traveling to the general vicinity of the rendezvous point,\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fon the scheduled date and at the scheduled time.        See id.     Buttrick\n\n\"did not abstractly contemplate crossing state boundaries with a\n\nthought to committing a crime upon reaching his destination\"; he\n\ndid much more.   Id.\n\n          Buttrick attempts to distinguish Gamache on the ground\n\nthat he allegedly displayed a clear intent not to engage in any\n\nillicit conduct.     This argument is nothing more than an attack on\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence and does not state a constitutional\n\nclaim.\n\n          His argument that the statute violates due process by\n\ninterfering   with   the   right   to   travel   suffers     from   the   same\n\ninfirmity.    He argues not that Congress cannot regulate travel as\n\nit does in the statute, but that since he lacked the requisite\n\nintent, the statute as applied is unconstitutional. Again, this is\n\nnothing more than an attack on the jury's finding that he had the\n\nrequisite intent.    Cf. Bredimus, 352 F.3d at 209-10 (holding that\n\n§ 2423(b) does not impermissibly burden the right to foreign travel\n\nbecause it only criminalizes travel done with illicit intent).\n\nB.        Request for an Instruction             on   the    Abandonment or\n          Renunciation Defense\n\n          We review a properly preserved objection to the failure\n\nto give a requested jury instruction de novo.               Sanchez-Lopez v.\n\nFuentes-Pujols, 375 F.3d 121, 133 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Gray v.\n\nGenlyte Group, Inc., 289 F.3d 128, 133 (1st Cir. 2002)).              Such a\n\nrefusal constitutes reversible error only if it was prejudicial in\n\n                                   -8-\n\flight of the entire record.          Id. at 133.      If the proffered\n\ninstruction misstates the applicable law, it cannot be accepted.\n\nSee United States v. Montañez, 105 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(\"[A] defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of\n\ndefense if sufficient evidence is produced at trial to support the\n\ndefense   and   the   proposed   instruction   correctly   describes   the\n\napplicable law.\").\n\n           At trial, the defense theory was that Buttrick had never\n\nformed an intent to engage in illicit sexual contact, that he was\n\nmerely a victim of his own curiosity.     Nonetheless, at the close of\n\ntrial, Buttrick requested an instruction1 based on Model Penal Code\n\n\n     1\n           The requested instruction provided:\n\n                Dustin Buttrick asserts as a defense that he\n           renunciated or abandoned any effort to commit the\n           crime with which he is charged. It is a complete\n           defense to the charge against the defendant that he\n           renunciated or abandoned his effort to commit the\n           crime or otherwise prevented its commission. Such\n           abandonment or renunciation must be complete and\n           voluntary.\n                Renunciation is not voluntary if it is\n           motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances,\n           not present or apparent at the inception of the\n           actor's course of conduct, that increase the\n           probability of detection or apprehension or that\n           make more difficult the accomplishment of the\n           criminal purpose.\n                Renunciation is not complete if it is\n           motivated by a decision to postpone the criminal\n           conduct until a more advantageous time or to\n           transfer the criminal effort to another but similar\n           objective or victim.\n                The Government has the burden to prove beyond\n           a   reasonable    doubt   that    the   Defendant's\n           renunciation or abandonment of the crime was not\n\n                                    -9-\n\f§ 5.01(4), which defines renunciation as an affirmative defense to\n\nattempt crimes.   For shorthand we refer to the defense as one of\n\nabandonment.\n\n          The rationale in the Model Penal Code for recognizing\n\nsuch a defense to attempt crimes is said to be twofold: \"First,\n\nallowance of the defense recognizes that the actor's conduct no\n\nlonger poses a danger to society.   Second, the availability of the\n\ndefense provides actors with a 'motive for desisting from their\n\ncriminal designs, thereby diminishing the risk that the substantive\n\ncrime will be committed.'\"   United States v. Shelton, 30 F.3d 702,\n\n706 (6th Cir. 1994) (quoting Model Penal Code § 5.01(4) cmt. 8\n\n(Official Draft 1985)).\n\n          The district court rejected defendant's request for an\n\nabandonment instruction on a number of grounds.       One of those\n\ngrounds -- that Buttrick's proposed instruction was not a correct\n\nstatement of the applicable law -- suffices to affirm.\n\n\n\n\n          voluntary or not complete.\n               If you find that the Defendant voluntarily and\n          completely renunciated or abandoned an effort to\n          commit the crime charged in the indictment then you\n          must find him to be not guilty. If you find that\n          his abandonment or renunciation was not voluntary\n          or complete and that the Government has proven the\n          elements of the offense as I have explained them to\n          you then you should find the Defendant to be\n          guilty.\n\n                               -10-\n\f            Buttrick admits that the Model Penal Code defense by its\n\nterms applies to \"attempt\" crimes.2    See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 751(a)\n\n(attempt to escape from custody); 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 846\n\n(attempt to possess cocaine for resale).    He relies on cases that\n\nhe claims recognize the defense of abandonment or renunciation of\n\nan attempt crime.    See United States v. Doyon, 194 F.3d 207, 212\n\n(1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Dworken, 855 F.2d 12, 20 (1st\n\nCir. 1988); United States v. Bailey, 834 F.2d 218, 227 (1st Cir.\n\n1987).    These cases do not hold that the affirmative defense of\n\nabandonment is, in fact, available, but merely assume so arguendo.\n\nThe government, in turn, relies on cases that explicitly reject the\n\nabandonment defense in attempt crimes. See, e.g., Shelton, 30 F.3d\n\nat 706. This circuit has reserved the question of the availability\n\nof the defense in attempt crimes, see Bailey, 834 F.2d at 227 &\n\nn.7, and, despite the battle waged in this case using the proxy of\n\nattempt crimes, we still reserve the question.\n\n            It is unnecessary to address the argument to resolve the\n\ncase.    We expressly do not reach the questions of (1) whether the\n\nModel Penal Code defense of abandonment is ever available for an\n\nattempt crime, and (2) whether, if the answer to the first question\n\n\n     2\n          We note that Buttrick was charged with the substantive\ncrime under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b). We thus also do not reach any\nquestions about available defenses to aiding and abetting, see\nUnited States v. Garrett, 720 F.2d 705, 713-14 (D.C. Cir. 1983)\n(considering an abandonment defense to the charge of aiding and\nabetting the violation of § 2423), or to conspiracy crimes of this\nilk. Nor do we reach any questions about an entrapment defense.\n\n                                -11-\n\fwere \"yes,\" 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) is sufficiently like an attempt\n\ncrime   that   such   an    affirmative     defense    could    in   theory    be\n\napplicable.\n\n           The district court, assuming arguendo that the law on the\n\ntwo points above could be read in defendant's favor, nonetheless\n\nrejected the proposed instruction on the ground that it misstated\n\nthe law by misallocating the burden of proof.                    The proposed\n\ninstruction placed the burden on the government \"to prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that [Buttrick's] renunciation or abandonment of\n\nthe crime was not voluntary or complete.\"\n\n           The district court gave three reasons for its conclusion.\n\nFirst, the court noted that while the Model Penal Code appeared to\n\nplace the burden of persuasion on the government on the defense of\n\nrenunciation, see Model Penal Code § 5.01(4) cmt. 8, at 358-59, 361\n\n(Official Draft 1985), that allocation of burdens had not generally\n\nbeen accepted by the states, see id. at 361 & n.282 (citing state\n\nstatutes and proposals).\n\n           Second,    the    court   pointed     out   that    the   statute   of\n\nconviction, 18 U.S.C. § 2423, itself defined an affirmative defense\n\nto   certain   conduct      criminalized    by   the    statute.       In   that\n\naffirmative defense, set forth at § 2423(g), Congress placed the\n\nburdens of both production and persuasion on the defendant:\n\n           Defense. In a prosecution under this section\n           based on illicit sexual conduct as defined in\n           subsection(f)(2), it is a defense, which the\n           defendant must establish by a preponderance of\n\n                                     -12-\n\f             the evidence, that the defendant reasonably\n             believed that the person with whom the\n             defendant engaged in the commercial sex act\n             had attained the age of 18 years.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2423(g). It would be, the court reasoned, inconsistent\n\nto alter this allocation of burdens for an affirmative defense not\n\neven recognized by the statute.\n\n             Lastly, the court reasoned that the allocation of burdens\n\nin the proposed instruction was inconsistent with United States v.\n\nHartsock, 347 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003). Following Hartsock's rule of\n\nexamining both the particular crime and the particular defense to\n\ndetermine who has the burden of persuasion on an affirmative\n\ndefense, see id. at 8-9, the district court held that \"the burden\n\nof   proof   should   be   on   the   defendant   with   respect   to   this\n\naffirmative defense instruction.\"\n\n             The court noted that the defendant's premise was that\n\neven if all of the elements of the crime had been committed -- he\n\nhad crossed the state line with the purpose to engage in sex with\n\na minor -- he could nonetheless be found not guilty because he had\n\nabandoned that intent by the time he was stopped by the police.3\n\nAccepting arguendo the premise that an abandonment offense could\n\nlie, the district court held that the defendant is more likely than\n\nthe prosecution to be in possession of the information necessary to\n\n\n      3\n          Again, we stress that we do not decide the validity of\ndefendant's theory that the abandonment defense is applicable to a\nprosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 2423; we note only that to date no\ncourt has accepted the theory in this context.\n\n                                      -13-\n\festablish the defense, and so the defendant should bear the burdens\n\nof   both   production   and   persuasion.    Accordingly,   the   court\n\nconcluded that under Hartsock, Buttrick's proposed instruction\n\nincorrectly placed the burden of persuasion for the affirmative\n\ndefense on the government.4\n\n            The district court notified defense counsel of this\n\nproblem in the proposed instruction and gave counsel a chance to\n\npropose a revised instruction that would place the burden of proof\n\nback onto the defendant.       Counsel declined to do so.\n\n            We agree with the district court's analysis that the\n\nproposed instruction was simply wrong as to the allocation of\n\nburdens of this assumed defense under 18 U.S.C. § 2423, even\n\nindulging every preliminary assumption in defendant's favor. There\n\nis no need to add to the district court's thoughtful analysis of\n\nthe problem.\n\n                                   III.\n\n            We affirm the judgment of conviction.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n          Even in Bailey, in which this court reserved the question\nof the availability of the abandonment defense for attempt crimes,\nthe proffered abandonment instruction, held not to be warranted by\nthe evidence, placed the burden of persuasion on the defendant.\n834 F.2d at 226 n.6.\n\n                                   -14-\n\f",

The \"girl\" turned out to have been a fiction; Buttrick was caught in a sting operation set up by the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Police Department. There is no dispute that the \"girl\" told Buttrick that she was underage, and there is no dispute that he crossed over the state line for the anticipated tryst. Buttrick never found his intended paramour; the Portsmouth police arrested him first. His defense was that mere curiosity drove him; although he brought along condoms, as he had told the \"girl\" that he would, he said that he had never intended to have sex with her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 9, 2004, a jury found Buttrick guilty of traveling in interstate commerce with the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with another person between twelve and sixteen years of age, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b). <i>See also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2423(f), 2241(c). Buttrick was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, followed by a five-year period of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal addresses two legal questions previously raised in defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, a new trial. Buttrick argues that the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b), is unconstitutional as applied to him because it punishes mere thought and burdens the right to travel. The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person who travels in interstate commerce ... for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct with another person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick's second argument is that the district court erred in denying his request for a jury instruction, drawn from an affirmative defense under the Model Penal Code, on abandonment or renunciation of intent to commit the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the claim of statutory unconstitutionality is meritless and devolves into nothing more than an insufficiency of evidence claim. On the second issue, we agree with the district court that even if, in theory, an abandonment defense were ever available in response to a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b), a question we do not address, the proffered instruction was properly rejected because it was an erroneous statement of the law. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts recited come largely from Buttrick's testimony. That testimony includes the evidence as to which the proposed instruction was directed and provides the basis for evaluating the claims that the statute was unconstitutionally applied. There is no need to discuss the government's additional evidence of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick testified as follows. Before the incident in question, he had visited chat rooms thirty or forty times. He had explicit sexual conversations with women seven or eight times and made arrangements to meet three or four of these women.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 8, 2003, Buttrick logged into a Yahoo! chat room. He was attracted to an individual using the screen name \"baybeedaw188\" and contacted her via instant messaging. He asked the individual her age, and she identified herself as a fourteen-year-old girl. The chat quickly became sexually graphic, with Buttrick suggesting that they get together to \"fool around.\" He also said to \"baybeedaw188,\" untruthfully, that he was only nineteen years old, that he was from Dover, New Hampshire, and that he had \"fooled around\" before with someone he met online.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick testified at trial that he had no intent to go any further than conversation &#8212; that it was all just fantasy. He continued the fantasy, replying to e-mail messages from \"baybeedaw188\" and engaging in other sexually explicit online conversations with her. During a June 22 chat room conversation, however, he went a step beyond fantasy and suggested that they meet in person. He and \"baybeedaw188\" agreed to meet at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 24, 2003, at the New Hampshire State Liquor Store on the Route 1 traffic circle in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick testified that he did not believe the statements from \"baybeedaw188\" that she was fourteen years old. Over the weekend before the meeting, Buttrick talked about these chat room conversations with a friend, Tom Whelan, who was a part-time police officer. Buttrick told Whelan about the meeting, saying he \"would just drive by and take a look\" and that he \"was curious to see who [he] was talking to.\" Whelan advised him that it was a bad idea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, on Monday, June 23, Buttrick and \"baybeedaw188\" had another sexual chat room conversation, during which they confirmed that they would meet as planned the next morning. According to the testimony of the detective behind the sting operation, Buttrick told \"baybeedawl88\" that he would bring \"Durex\"-brand condoms with him to their meeting. Buttrick's testimony was that he had no intent to perform any sexual act with her or even to meet her. He said that he intended to drive to the meeting place in New Hampshire from his home in Maine, about five miles away, \"just see who this person was. I was just curious.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Tuesday, June 24, as he dressed before driving to the meeting, Buttrick grabbed various items from his dresser, including condoms. He testified that he did not bring the condoms to have sex with \"baybeedaw188\"; rather, he said, \"I've been going out a lot and I try to make it a habit of carrying condoms on me.\" He also testified that as he drove to the meeting, it still had not crossed his mind that perhaps he would have sex with her after all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick drove across the state line toward the meeting place. At the traffic circle in Portsmouth, he drove around the circle once, then pulled off to look toward the liquor store to see if someone was in the parking lot. He then drove around the circle another time and again pulled off. He intended, he testified, to get on the traffic circle a third time. Before he could do so, however, he was pulled over by the Portsmouth police and arrested. A detective testified that he recovered two condoms from Buttrick's front pocket, one of which was a \"Durex\"-brand condom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick admitted at trial that during a post-arrest interview by the police, he was asked whether \"the purpose of this whole thing\" was that he \"wanted to have sex with a 14-year-old girl,\" and that he answered, \"Yeah.\" He testified, however, that what he said to the police was not an admission of guilt, just an acknowledgment that he knew why he had been arrested. He admitted that when he was asked in the post-arrest interview what his purpose was in crossing the state line, he had said that he did not know, but that his intention was to drive home from the traffic circle because he \"knew it wasn't a good idea.\" He further admitted that when asked at the interview whether he would have stopped had he seen a fourteen-year-old-girl in the parking lot, he had replied, \"no,\" and said that he \"would have been freaked out and ... would have known it ... wasn't a good idea.\" He stressed that if he had seen a girl at the lot, he would not have had sex with her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of Buttrick's defense, then, was that he never had any intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct even before he left his home on his trip to the meeting place. Curiosity, in other words, not sex, led him across the state line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Unconstitutionality of the Statute as Applied</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We quickly dispose of Buttrick's as-applied constitutional challenge, since the claim of unconstitutionality is controlled by our prior decision in <i>United States v. Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1998). <i>Gamache</i> rejected the argument that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b) punishes mere thought. <i>See id.</i> at 7-8. Other circuits have come to the same conclusion. <i>United States v. Bredimus,</i> 352 F.3d 200, 208-09 (5th Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Han,</i> 230 F.3d 560, 563 (2d Cir.2000); <i>see also Hoke v. United States,</i> 227 U.S. 308, 323, 33 S.Ct. 281, 57 L.Ed. 523 (1913) (upholding as constitutional similar statutory language in the Mann Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As <i>Gamache</i> holds, the statute punishes those who perform the act of crossing the state line with the intent to engage in the specified wrongful conduct. <i>See</i> 156 F.3d at 8. The intent requirement is often proved through another series of acts. <i>See id.</i> Here, as in <i>Gamache,</i> those acts include defendant's repeated correspondence with his intended paramour, his setting up the details of the assignation, his bringing of the condoms, and his actual traveling to the general vicinity of the rendezvous point, on the scheduled date and at the scheduled time. <i>See id.</i> Buttrick \"did not abstractly contemplate crossing state boundaries with a thought to committing a crime upon reaching his destination\"; he did much more. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick attempts to distinguish <i>Gamache</i> on the ground that he allegedly displayed a clear intent not to engage in any illicit conduct. This argument is nothing more than an attack on the sufficiency of the evidence and does not state a constitutional claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His argument that the statute violates due process by interfering with the right to travel suffers from the same infirmity. He argues not that Congress cannot regulate travel as it does in the statute, but that since he lacked the requisite intent, the statute as applied is unconstitutional. Again, this is nothing more than an attack on the jury's finding that he had the requisite intent. <i>Cf. Bredimus,</i> 352 F.3d at 209-10 (holding that &#167; 2423(b) does not impermissibly burden the right to foreign travel because it only criminalizes travel done with illicit intent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Request for an Instruction on the Abandonment or Renunciation Defense</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a properly preserved objection to the failure to give a requested jury instruction de novo. <i>Sanchez-Lopez v. Fuentes-Pujols,</i> 375 F.3d 121, 133 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc.,</i> 289 F.3d 128, 133 (1st Cir.2002)). Such a refusal constitutes reversible error only if it was prejudicial in light of the entire record. <i>Id.</i> at 133. If the proffered instruction misstates the applicable law, it cannot be accepted. <i>See United States v. Montanez,</i> 105 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[A] defendant is entitled to an instruction on his theory of defense if sufficient evidence is produced at trial to support the defense and the proposed instruction correctly describes the applicable law.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the defense theory was that Buttrick had never formed an intent to engage in illicit sexual contact, that he was merely a victim of his own curiosity. Nonetheless, at the close of trial, Buttrick requested an instruction<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> based on Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(4), which defines renunciation as an affirmative defense to attempt crimes. For shorthand we refer to the defense as one of abandonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale in the Model Penal Code for recognizing such a defense to attempt crimes is said to be twofold: \"First, allowance of the defense recognizes that the actor's conduct no longer poses a danger to society. Second, the availability of the defense provides actors with a `motive for desisting from their criminal designs, thereby diminishing the risk that the substantive crime will be committed.'\" <i>United States v. Shelton,</i> 30 F.3d 702, 706 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(4) cmt. 8 (Official Draft 1985)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected defendant's request for an abandonment instruction on a number of grounds. One of those grounds &#8212; that Buttrick's proposed instruction was not a correct statement of the applicable law &#8212; suffices to affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick admits that the Model Penal Code defense by its terms applies to \"attempt\" crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 751(a) (attempt to escape from custody); 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(A), 846 (attempt to possess cocaine for resale). He relies on cases that he claims recognize the defense of abandonment or renunciation of an attempt crime. <i>See United States v. Doyon,</i> 194 F.3d 207, 212 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Dworken,</i> 855 F.2d 12, 20 (1st Cir.1988); <i>United States v. Bailey,</i> 834 F.2d 218, 227 (1st Cir.1987). These cases do not hold that the affirmative defense of abandonment is, in fact, available, but merely assume so arguendo. The government, in turn, relies on cases that explicitly reject the abandonment defense in attempt crimes. <i>See, e.g., Shelton,</i> 30 F.3d at 706. This circuit has reserved the question of the availability of the defense in attempt crimes, <i>see Bailey,</i> 834 F.2d at 227 &amp; n. 7, and, despite the battle waged in this case using the proxy of attempt crimes, we still reserve the question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unnecessary to address the argument to resolve the case. We expressly do not reach the questions of (1) whether the Model Penal Code defense of abandonment is ever available for an attempt crime, and (2) whether, if the answer to the first question were \"yes,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b) is sufficiently like an attempt crime that such an affirmative defense could in theory be applicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, assuming arguendo that the law on the two points above could be read in defendant's favor, nonetheless rejected the proposed instruction on the ground that it misstated the law by misallocating the burden of proof. The proposed instruction placed the burden on the government \"to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Buttrick's] renunciation or abandonment of the crime was not voluntary or complete.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court gave three reasons for its conclusion. First, the court noted that while the Model Penal Code appeared to place the burden of persuasion on the government on the defense of renunciation, <i>see</i> Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(4) cmt. 8, at 358-59, 361 (Official Draft 1985), that allocation of burdens had not generally been accepted by the states, <i>see id.</i> at 361 &amp; n. 282 (citing state statutes and proposals).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court pointed out that the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423, itself defined an affirmative defense to certain conduct criminalized by the statute. In that affirmative defense, set forth at &#167; 2423(g), Congress placed the burdens of both production and persuasion on the defendant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense. In a prosecution under this section based on illicit sexual conduct as defined in subsection(f)(2), it is a defense, which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant reasonably believed that the person with whom the defendant engaged in the commercial sex act had attained the age of 18 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(g). It would be, the court reasoned, inconsistent to alter this allocation of burdens for an affirmative defense not even recognized by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the court reasoned that the allocation of burdens in the proposed instruction was inconsistent with <i>United States v. Hartsock,</i> 347 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2003). Following <i>Hartsock's</i> rule of examining both the particular crime and the particular defense to determine who has the burden of persuasion on an affirmative defense, <i>see id.</i> at 8-9, the district court held that \"the burden of proof should be on the defendant with respect to this affirmative defense instruction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court noted that the defendant's premise was that even if all of the elements of the crime had been committed &#8212; he had crossed the state line with the purpose to engage in sex with a minor &#8212; he could nonetheless be found not guilty because he had abandoned that intent by the time he was stopped by the police.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Accepting arguendo the premise that an abandonment offense could lie, the district court held that the defendant is more likely than the prosecution to be in possession of the information necessary to establish the defense, and so the defendant should bear the burdens of both production and persuasion. Accordingly, the court concluded that under <i>Hartsock,</i> Buttrick's proposed instruction incorrectly placed the burden of persuasion for the affirmative defense on the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court notified defense counsel of this problem in the proposed instruction and gave counsel a chance to propose a revised instruction that would place the burden of proof back onto the defendant. Counsel declined to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's analysis that the proposed instruction was simply wrong as to the allocation of burdens of this assumed defense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423, even indulging every preliminary assumption in defendant's favor.

Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, CAMPBELL and CYR, Senior Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dustin Buttrick, a twenty-two-year-old man living in Elliot, Maine, crossed over the state line into New Hampshire, having arranged to rendezvous with a fourteen-year-old girl he met over the Internet to have sex. The \"girl\" turned out to have been a fiction; Buttrick was caught in a sting operation set up by the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Police Department. There is no dispute that the \"girl\" told Buttrick that she was underage, and there is no dispute that he crossed over the state line for the anticipated tryst. Buttrick never found his intended paramour; the Portsmouth police arrested him first. His defense was that mere curiosity drove him; although he brought along condoms, as he had told the \"girl\" that he would, he said that he had never intended to have sex with her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 9, 2004, a jury found Buttrick guilty of traveling in interstate commerce with the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with another person between twelve and sixteen years of age, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b). <i>See also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2423(f), 2241(c). Buttrick was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, followed by a five-year period of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal addresses two legal questions previously raised in defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, a new trial. Buttrick argues that the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b), is unconstitutional as applied to him because it punishes mere thought and burdens the right to travel. The statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person who travels in interstate commerce ... for the purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct with another person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick's second argument is that the district court erred in denying his request for a jury instruction, drawn from an affirmative defense under the Model Penal Code, on abandonment or renunciation of intent to commit the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the claim of statutory unconstitutionality is meritless and devolves into nothing more than an insufficiency of evidence claim. On the second issue, we agree with the district court that even if, in theory, an abandonment defense were ever available in response to a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b), a question we do not address, the proffered instruction was properly rejected because it was an erroneous statement of the law. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts recited come largely from Buttrick's testimony. That testimony includes the evidence as to which the proposed instruction was directed and provides the basis for evaluating the claims that the statute was unconstitutionally applied. There is no need to discuss the government's additional evidence of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick testified as follows. Before the incident in question, he had visited chat rooms thirty or forty times. He had explicit sexual conversations with women seven or eight times and made arrangements to meet three or four of these women.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 8, 2003, Buttrick logged into a Yahoo! chat room. He was attracted to an individual using the screen name \"baybeedaw188\" and contacted her via instant messaging. He asked the individual her age, and she identified herself as a fourteen-year-old girl. The chat quickly became sexually graphic, with Buttrick suggesting that they get together to \"fool around.\" He also said to \"baybeedaw188,\" untruthfully, that he was only nineteen years old, that he was from Dover, New Hampshire, and that he had \"fooled around\" before with someone he met online.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick testified at trial that he had no intent to go any further than conversation &#8212; that it was all just fantasy. He continued the fantasy, replying to e-mail messages from \"baybeedaw188\" and engaging in other sexually explicit online conversations with her. During a June 22 chat room conversation, however, he went a step beyond fantasy and suggested that they meet in person. He and \"baybeedaw188\" agreed to meet at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, June 24, 2003, at the New Hampshire State Liquor Store on the Route 1 traffic circle in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick testified that he did not believe the statements from \"baybeedaw188\" that she was fourteen years old. Over the weekend before the meeting, Buttrick talked about these chat room conversations with a friend, Tom Whelan, who was a part-time police officer. Buttrick told Whelan about the meeting, saying he \"would just drive by and take a look\" and that he \"was curious to see who [he] was talking to.\" Whelan advised him that it was a bad idea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, on Monday, June 23, Buttrick and \"baybeedaw188\" had another sexual chat room conversation, during which they confirmed that they would meet as planned the next morning. According to the testimony of the detective behind the sting operation, Buttrick told \"baybeedawl88\" that he would bring \"Durex\"-brand condoms with him to their meeting. Buttrick's testimony was that he had no intent to perform any sexual act with her or even to meet her. He said that he intended to drive to the meeting place in New Hampshire from his home in Maine, about five miles away, \"just see who this person was. I was just curious.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Tuesday, June 24, as he dressed before driving to the meeting, Buttrick grabbed various items from his dresser, including condoms. He testified that he did not bring the condoms to have sex with \"baybeedaw188\"; rather, he said, \"I've been going out a lot and I try to make it a habit of carrying condoms on me.\" He also testified that as he drove to the meeting, it still had not crossed his mind that perhaps he would have sex with her after all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick drove across the state line toward the meeting place. At the traffic circle in Portsmouth, he drove around the circle once, then pulled off to look toward the liquor store to see if someone was in the parking lot. He then drove around the circle another time and again pulled off. He intended, he testified, to get on the traffic circle a third time. Before he could do so, however, he was pulled over by the Portsmouth police and arrested. A detective testified that he recovered two condoms from Buttrick's front pocket, one of which was a \"Durex\"-brand condom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick admitted at trial that during a post-arrest interview by the police, he was asked whether \"the purpose of this whole thing\" was that he \"wanted to have sex with a 14-year-old girl,\" and that he answered, \"Yeah.\" He testified, however, that what he said to the police was not an admission of guilt, just an acknowledgment that he knew why he had been arrested. He admitted that when he was asked in the post-arrest interview what his purpose was in crossing the state line, he had said that he did not know, but that his intention was to drive home from the traffic circle because he \"knew it wasn't a good idea.\" He further admitted that when asked at the interview whether he would have stopped had he seen a fourteen-year-old-girl in the parking lot, he had replied, \"no,\" and said that he \"would have been freaked out and ... would have known it ... wasn't a good idea.\" He stressed that if he had seen a girl at the lot, he would not have had sex with her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of Buttrick's defense, then, was that he never had any intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct even before he left his home on his trip to the meeting place. Curiosity, in other words, not sex, led him across the state line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

The intent requirement is often proved through another series of acts. <i>See id.</i> Here, as in <i>Gamache,</i> those acts include defendant's repeated correspondence with his intended paramour, his setting up the details of the assignation, his bringing of the condoms, and his actual traveling to the general vicinity of the rendezvous point, on the scheduled date and at the scheduled time. <i>See id.</i> Buttrick \"did not abstractly contemplate crossing state boundaries with a thought to committing a crime upon reaching his destination\"; he did much more. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick attempts to distinguish <i>Gamache</i> on the ground that he allegedly displayed a clear intent not to engage in any illicit conduct. This argument is nothing more than an attack on the sufficiency of the evidence and does not state a constitutional claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His argument that the statute violates due process by interfering with the right to travel suffers from the same infirmity. He argues not that Congress cannot regulate travel as it does in the statute, but that since he lacked the requisite intent, the statute as applied is unconstitutional. Again, this is nothing more than an attack on the jury's finding that he had the requisite intent. <i>Cf. Bredimus,</i> 352 F.3d at 209-10 (holding that &#167; 2423(b) does not impermissibly burden the right to foreign travel because it only criminalizes travel done with illicit intent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

Such a refusal constitutes reversible error only if it was prejudicial in light of the entire record. <i>Id.</i> at 133. If the proffered instruction misstates the applicable law, it cannot be accepted. <i>See United States v.

Nonetheless, at the close of trial, Buttrick requested an instruction<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> based on Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(4), which defines renunciation as an affirmative defense to attempt crimes. For shorthand we refer to the defense as one of abandonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rationale in the Model Penal Code for recognizing such a defense to attempt crimes is said to be twofold: \"First, allowance of the defense recognizes that the actor's conduct no longer poses a danger to society. Second, the availability of the defense provides actors with a `motive for desisting from their criminal designs, thereby diminishing the risk that the substantive crime will be committed.'\" <i>United States v. Shelton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675142\"><a href=\"/opinion/675142/united-states-v-mack-j-shelton/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span>, 706 (6th Cir.1994) (quoting Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(4) cmt. 8 (Official Draft 1985)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected defendant's request for an abandonment instruction on a number of grounds. One of those grounds &#8212; that Buttrick's proposed instruction was not a correct statement of the applicable law &#8212; suffices to affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buttrick admits that the Model Penal Code defense by its terms applies to \"attempt\" crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 751(a) (attempt to escape from custody); 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(b)(1)(A), 846 (attempt to possess cocaine for resale). He relies on cases that he claims recognize the defense of abandonment or renunciation of an attempt crime. <i>See United States v. Doyon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198684\"><a href=\"/opinion/198684/united-states-v-doyon/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Dworken,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510631\"><a href=\"/opinion/510631/united-states-v-jay-lewis-dworken-aka-jason-lewis-jay-lewis-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.1988); <i>United States v.

These cases do not hold that the affirmative defense of abandonment is, in fact, available, but merely assume so arguendo. The government, in turn, relies on cases that explicitly reject the abandonment defense in attempt crimes. <i>See, e.g., Shelton,</i> 30 F.3d at 706. This circuit has reserved the question of the availability of the defense in attempt crimes, <i>see Bailey,</i> 834 F.2d at 227 &amp; n. 7, and, despite the battle waged in this case using the proxy of attempt crimes, we still reserve the question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unnecessary to address the argument to resolve the case. We expressly do not reach the questions of (1) whether the Model Penal Code defense of abandonment is ever available for an attempt crime, and (2) whether, if the answer to the first question were \"yes,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b) is sufficiently like an attempt crime that such an affirmative defense could in theory be applicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, assuming arguendo that the law on the two points above could be read in defendant's favor, nonetheless rejected the proposed instruction on the ground that it misstated the law by misallocating the burden of proof. The proposed instruction placed the burden on the government \"to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Buttrick's] renunciation or abandonment of the crime was not voluntary or complete.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court gave three reasons for its conclusion. First, the court noted that while the Model Penal Code appeared to place the burden of persuasion on the government on the defense of renunciation, <i>see</i> Model Penal Code &#167; 5.01(4) cmt. 8, at 358-59, 361 (Official Draft 1985), that allocation of burdens had not generally been accepted by the states, <i>see id.</i> at 361 &amp; n. 282 (citing state statutes and proposals).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the court pointed out that the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423, itself defined an affirmative defense to certain conduct criminalized by the statute. In that affirmative defense, set forth at &#167; 2423(g), Congress placed the burdens of both production and persuasion on the defendant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense. In a prosecution under this section based on illicit sexual conduct as defined in subsection(f)(2), it is a defense, which the defendant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant reasonably believed that the person with whom the defendant engaged in the commercial sex act had attained the age of 18 years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(g). It would be, the court reasoned, inconsistent to alter this allocation of burdens for an affirmative defense not even recognized by the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the court reasoned that the allocation of burdens in the proposed instruction was inconsistent with <i>United States v. Hartsock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783915\"><a href=\"/opinion/783915/united-states-v-willard-hartsock/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003). Following <i>Hartsock's</i> rule of examining both the particular crime and the particular defense to determine who has the burden of persuasion on an affirmative defense, <i>see id.</i> at 8-9, the district court held that \"the burden of proof should be on the defendant with respect to this affirmative defense instruction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court noted that the defendant's premise was that even if all of the elements of the crime had been committed &#8212; he had crossed the state line with the purpose to engage in sex with a minor &#8212; he could nonetheless be found not guilty because he had abandoned that intent by the time he was stopped by the police.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Accepting arguendo the premise that an abandonment offense could lie, the district court held that the defendant is more likely than the prosecution to be in possession of the information necessary to establish the defense, and so the defendant should bear the burdens of both production and persuasion. Accordingly, the court concluded that under <i>Hartsock,</i> Buttrick's proposed instruction incorrectly placed the burden of persuasion for the affirmative defense on the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court notified defense counsel of this problem in the proposed instruction and gave counsel a chance to propose a revised instruction that would place the burden of proof back onto the defendant. Counsel declined to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's analysis that the proposed instruction was simply wrong as to the allocation of burdens of this assumed defense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423, even indulging every preliminary assumption in defendant's favor. There is no need to add to the district court's thoughtful analysis of the problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the judgment of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The requested instruction provided:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Dustin Buttrick asserts as a defense that he renunciated or abandoned any effort to commit the crime with which he is charged. It is a complete defense to the charge against the defendant that he renunciated or abandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission. Such abandonment or renunciation must be complete and voluntary.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Renunciation is not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by circumstances, not present or apparent at the inception of the actor's course of conduct, that increase the probability of detection or apprehension or that make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone the criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the criminal effort to another but similar objective or victim.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The Government has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant's renunciation or abandonment of the crime was not voluntary or not complete.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If you find that the Defendant voluntarily and completely renunciated or abandoned an effort to commit the crime charged in the indictment then you must find him to be not guilty. If you find that his abandonment or renunciation was not voluntary or complete and that the Government has proven the elements of the offense as I have explained them to you then you should find the Defendant to be guilty.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that Buttrick was charged with the substantive crime under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b). We thus also do not reach any questions about available defenses to aiding and abetting,<i>see United States v. Garrett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"426996\"><a href=\"/opinion/426996/united-states-v-philip-h-garrett-united-states-of-america-v-timothy-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, 713-14 (D.C.Cir.1983) (considering an abandonment defense to the charge of aiding and abetting the violation of &#167; 2423), or to conspiracy crimes of this ilk. Nor do we reach any questions about an entrapment defense.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Again, we stress that we do not decide the validity of defendant's theory that the abandonment defense is applicable to a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423; we note only that to date no court has accepted the theory in this context</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Even in<i>Bailey,</i> in which this court reserved the question of the availability of the abandonment defense for attempt crimes, the proffered abandonment instruction, held not to be warranted by the evidence, placed the burden of persuasion on the defendant. 834 F.2d at 226 n. 6.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
