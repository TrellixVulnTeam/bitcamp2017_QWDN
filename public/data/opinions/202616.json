Xie Mei Zheng, a native and\n\ncitizen of China, petitions for review of a final order of removal\n\nfrom the Board of Immigration Appeals.        The Immigration Judge\n\nfound Zheng not to be credible, and further concluded that even if\n\nZheng were credible she had not established that she had a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution.    The BIA adopted the IJ's opinion and\n\naffirmed.    Because the IJ's decision is supported by substantial\n\nevidence, we deny the petition for review.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            Zheng was born in China in December 1981.   On January 6,\n\n2000, she entered the United States using false travel documents.\n\nImmigration authorities detained her, and on February 17, 2000, she\n\nwas issued a Notice to Appear in deportation proceedings.      Zheng\n\nconceded that she was inadmissible, and she filed an application\n\nfor political asylum on December 15, 2000.      She also applied for\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT).\n\n            Zheng's application stated that she feared persecution on\n\nthe basis of her political opinion.    In an accompanying affidavit,\n\nshe described an incident in which she had been expelled from\n\njunior high school for her opposition to China's birth control\n\npolicies.   She claimed to have expressed her opinions in a \"school\n\nnews letter\" in May 1997.      While the school principal had twice\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fasked her to \"write a self-criticism withdrawing [her] opinion,\"\n\nshe said she refused to do so and was expelled.\n\n            Zheng's affidavit also described a second incident.          She\n\nstated that in August 1999 she and her boyfriend had attempted to\n\nobtain a marriage certificate. They were turned away because Zheng\n\nwas underage.       Zheng believed that because of this attempted\n\nmarriage, Chinese authorities became suspicious that she was having\n\na sexual relationship with her boyfriend and that she might be\n\npregnant.    According to Zheng, this suspicion was misplaced as she\n\nwas   a    virgin   and     intended    to   remain   so   until   marriage.\n\nNonetheless, in September 1999 she was notified that she had to\n\nattend a gynecological exam.        She did not go, as she feared an IUD\n\nwould be inserted into her against her will.           She then received a\n\nsecond notice in November 1999 and so she went into hiding at her\n\naunt's home for about a month.         After that, she came to the United\n\nStates.\n\n            On December 17, 2004, a hearing on Zheng's claims was\n\nheld before an IJ.        Zheng was the only witness at the hearing, and\n\nher testimony was given in the Mandarin language with a translator\n\npresent.    Her asylum application and accompanying affidavit were\n\nentered into evidence, as were China's country reports from 1999\n\nand 2003.\n\n            Zheng's testimony began by discussing her attempt to\n\nobtain a marriage license and the authorities' subsequent attempts\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fto make her submit to a gynecological exam.     She also testified\n\nabout her expulsion from junior high school.\n\n          In her testimony about the junior high school incident,\n\nZheng was asked where she wrote the \"opinions\" that caused her to\n\nbe expelled.   As translated, her response was: \"I just wrote out\n\nthose in my class for what I feel, for what I felt.\"   Her attorney,\n\nwho said that he spoke Mandarin, objected to the translation and\n\ntold the IJ that what Zheng actually said is that she wrote in\n\n\"some kind of publication specifically for the class, for the\n\nparticular class. . . . It's like either in the paper form or on\n\nblackboard [sic], it's like a, you know, (indiscernible) after\n\n(indiscernible), that type of thing.\"     The IJ instructed Zheng's\n\nattorney to ask her further questions to clarify the issue.   Zheng\n\nclarified that she had written her articles in chalk on the\n\nblackboard in the back of the class -- it was the class policy that\n\nstudents were free to write about their opinions and about current\n\nevents on the rear blackboard.       Zheng then testified that the\n\nprincipal instructed her to stop writing her anti-government views\n\non the blackboard, that she did not comply, and that she was\n\naccordingly dismissed from her middle school.\n\n          Her counsel also moved to admit supporting documentary\n\nevidence, for both this incident and the marriage license incident,\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fbut it does not appear that the documentary evidence was ever\n\nadmitted for any purpose beyond identification.1\n\n          The IJ asked Zheng why she feared returning to China in\n\nlight of the fact that she was now old enough to marry.          He\n\nspecifically asked if she feared that anything would happen to her\n\non her return.   Her response was \"I'm not very clear, I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I'll be thrown in jail . . . [b]ecause I was smuggle[d] out\n\nof the country and it's against law [sic].\"\n\n          On cross-examination, the government's attorney asked\n\nZheng why she had applied for a marriage license even though she\n\nknew she was ineligible, especially since her actions were likely\n\nto draw the attention of family planning officials.    Her response\n\nwas that she did not realize that the officials would come after\n\n\n     1\n       The first supporting document was a letter purporting to be\nfrom Zheng's junior high school.       According to the certified\ntranslation, the letter states that Zheng had \"many times published\narticles on the class bulletin board\" against China's birth control\npolicies, and that she was being expelled for her refusal to stop\ndoing this. The second document was a letter purporting to be from\nthe regional birth control office; it informed Zheng that she was\nrequired to report for an examination. Zheng testified that both\ndocuments had been in the possession of her parents, who then\nmailed them to her in the United States after her arrival.\n     The documents had not been sent for authentication, and at the\nhearing the government's attorney argued that authentication was\nnecessary. The IJ expressed frustration at delays in the case and\nstated for the record that \"I'm very likely going to have to make\na decision today based on what I have and what makes sense, and\nlike that.\"\n     Prior to cross-examination, Zheng's attorney asked that the\ndocuments be admitted into evidence. The IJ responded by asking if\nit was OK to do this after cross-examination. Zheng's attorney\nagreed, but it does not appear that the issue was revisited at any\nlater point in the proceedings.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fher, and that she applied because she wanted to get married, and so\n\nshe decided to try her luck.\n\n          Zheng   was   also   questioned   further    about   going   into\n\nhiding. She testified that she first went into hiding in September\n\nof 1999 at an aunt's house -- specifically, her father's younger\n\nsister.   She stated that she stayed at her aunt's house until she\n\nleft China, and that she never had any contact with Chinese\n\nofficials.   Several questions later, however, she stated that she\n\nhad hid at her aunt's house for a month, and that after a month she\n\nhid in another aunt's house -- this aunt being her mother's sister.\n\nWhen asked why she had only mentioned one aunt in her affidavit,\n\nZheng responded that she had spent more time hiding with one of the\n\naunts, and that at the time she wrote her affidavit she did not\n\nthink it important to be specific about where she was hiding; she\n\nthought it sufficient to merely say she was hiding at her aunt's\n\nhouse.\n\n          The government's attorney questioned Zheng further on the\n\njunior high school incident, pointing out that her affidavit had\n\nreferred to a \"school newsletter.\" As translated, Zheng's response\n\nwas that the articles were in her \"class's publication,\" and that\n\nher understanding of a \"school newsletter\" was that it is like\n\nsomething published on a class blackboard. On further questioning,\n\nshe stated that she had twice written articles on the blackboard,\n\nonce in May 1997, and again in July 1997.             When asked why the\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fsecond article was not mentioned in her earlier affidavit, Zheng\n\nresponded that she felt it was not a major point.\n\n             Zheng conceded on cross-examination that she had never\n\nbeen forced to have an IUD inserted, had never had an abortion, had\n\nnever had a tubal ligation, and that she had not been subjected to\n\nphysically invasive techniques.\n\n             That day, the IJ orally denied Zheng's applications for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.          As an initial\n\nmatter, the IJ determined that Zheng was not credible.         Because we\n\ndo not reach that ground, we do not recount the evidence and\n\nreasoning on which the IJ relied.\n\n             The IJ independently concluded that the events Zheng had\n\ntestified to, even if true, did not amount to past persecution.\n\nAdditionally, he concluded that Zheng's testimony could not be\n\nenough to establish a well-founded fear of persecution.             He noted\n\nthat Zheng was now old enough to get married and have children, and\n\nthat she would be \"in the same position as anybody else in China\"\n\nif she returned.     The IJ further stated that Zheng had not met her\n\nburden for demonstrating eligibility for withholding of removal,\n\nnor did she show that she would likely be tortured in China.\n\n             In a brief per curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed\n\nthe   IJ's   decision.     The   BIA   stated   that   the   IJ's    adverse\n\ncredibility determination was not clearly erroneous, and that even\n\nif Zheng's testimony were credible she had neither established that\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fshe had suffered past persecution, nor established that she had a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution based on a protected\n\nground.    Because the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling, but\n\nalso discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review\n\nboth the IJ's and BIA's opinions.      Ouk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 108,\n\n110 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                 II.\n\n            Zheng's petition for review challenges only the adverse\n\ncredibility determination and the agency's determination that Zheng\n\ndid not qualify for asylum even if credible.\n\n            In order to qualify for asylum, an alien must show that\n\nhe or she is a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the immigration\n\nlaws.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1).    The alien has the burden of\n\nproof for establishing that he or she is eligible for asylum.     Id.\n\n§ 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); Jean v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n            To demonstrate that he or she is a \"refugee,\" the alien\n\nmust show that he or she has either suffered past persecution, or\n\nhas a well-founded fear of future persecution, on account of his or\n\nher \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see also\n\nAlibeaj v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 188, 191 (1st Cir. 2006).        If an\n\nindividual has been \"forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo\n\ninvoluntary sterilization, or . . . has been persecuted for failure\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\for refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to\n\na coercive population control regime,\" that individual is deemed to\n\nhave been \"persecuted on account of political opinion.\"    8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42).    Similarly, an individual who \"has a well founded\n\nfear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or\n\nsubject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance\" is\n\ndeemed to have \"a well founded fear of persecution on account of\n\npolitical opinion.\"   Id.\n\n          We are required to uphold the IJ's determinations unless\n\n\"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"   Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).    We bypass any analysis of the IJ's credibility\n\ndetermination; even if Zheng's testimony is deemed credible, the\n\nIJ's denial of asylum is supported by substantial evidence.\n\n          Zheng concedes that the past events she described do not\n\nsupport a finding that she suffered past persecution. Cf. 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42); Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(discussing the kind of events that amount to persecution).     To\n\nprevail, Zheng must therefore show that she has a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution on the basis of a protected ground.      That\n\ninquiry has both a subjective and an objective component.       See\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f           Zheng's asylum claim falters on the objective prong.\n\nChina's country report documents that it is illegal in many areas\n\nfor single women to bear children.        And there may be evidence that\n\nsome pregnant single women in China are subject to persecution.\n\nBut Zheng's affidavit explicitly stated her intention to abstain\n\nfrom sex until marriage.      The IJ noted that since Zheng is now old\n\nenough to get married and have children, it is unclear why she\n\nshould reasonably fear persecution if she returned to China.\n\nZheng's   response   on   this   point   was   equivocal   and   she   merely\n\nventured that she might be thrown in jail because it was illegal\n\nfor her to have been smuggled out of the country.           This was not a\n\nreason why Zheng reasonably feared persecution on the basis of a\n\nprotected ground -- an issue on which she bore the burden of proof.\n\n           The BIA rejected Zheng's attempt to rehabilitate her\n\nargument before it.        Her brief had asserted that because she\n\nopposes   China's    family   planning    policies,   it    is   reasonably\n\nforeseeable that she will be persecuted for her beliefs. The brief\n\ndid not cite any evidence in the record supporting this assertion,\n\nnor did Zheng otherwise explain why the assertion was true.              The\n\nBIA's rejection of this theory was reasonable.\n\n           In her brief to this court, Zheng supplemented her\n\nargument with references to China's country condition reports, and\n\nshe argues that the IJ specifically erred by failing to consider\n\nher claim in light of this evidence.       Even assuming dubitante that\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fZheng has adequately preserved this argument, it lacks merit.   The\n\ncited passages merely state that the government sometimes imposes\n\nsanctions on individuals who have unauthorized pregnancies, or who\n\nassist others in having unauthorized pregnancies.   Zheng points us\n\nto no record evidence that she faces a reasonable probability of\n\npersecution simply because she personally opposes China's family\n\nplanning policies.   Certainly Zheng has pointed to nothing that\n\ncompels such a conclusion.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

The IJ noted that since Zheng is now old enough to get married and have children, it is unclear why she should reasonably fear persecution if she returned to China. Zheng's response on this point was equivocal and she merely ventured that she might be thrown in jail because it was illegal for her to have been smuggled out of the country.

The Immigration Judge found Zheng not to be credible, and further concluded that even if Zheng were credible she had not established that she had a well-founded fear of persecution. The BIA adopted the IJ's opinion and affirmed. Because the IJ's decision is supported by substantial evidence, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng was born in China in December 1981. On January 6, 2000, she entered the United States using false travel documents. Immigration authorities detained her, and on February 17, 2000, she was issued a Notice to Appear in deportation proceedings. Zheng conceded that she was inadmissible, and she filed an application for political asylum on December 15, 2000. She also applied for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng's application stated that she feared persecution on the basis of her political opinion. In an accompanying affidavit, she described an incident in which she had been expelled from junior high school for her opposition to China's birth control policies. She claimed to have expressed her opinions in a \"school news letter\" in May 1997. While the school principal had twice asked her to \"write a self-criticism withdrawing [her] opinion,\" she said she refused to do so and was expelled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng's affidavit also described a second incident. She stated that in August 1999 she and her boyfriend had attempted to obtain a marriage certificate. They were turned away because Zheng was underage. Zheng believed that because of this attempted marriage, Chinese authorities became suspicious that she was having a sexual relationship with her boyfriend and that she might be pregnant. According to Zheng, this suspicion was misplaced as she was a virgin and intended to remain so until marriage. Nonetheless, in September 1999 she was notified that she had to attend a gynecological exam. She did not go, as she feared an IUD would be inserted into her against her will. She then received a second notice in November 1999 and so she went into hiding at her aunt's home for about a month. After that, she came to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 17, 2004, a hearing on Zheng's claims was held before an IJ. Zheng was the only witness at the hearing, and her testimony was given in the Mandarin language with a translator present. Her asylum application and accompanying affidavit were entered into evidence, as were China's country reports from 1999 and 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng's testimony began by discussing her attempt to obtain a marriage license and the authorities' subsequent attempts to make her submit to a gynecological exam. She also testified about her expulsion from junior high school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her testimony about the junior high school incident, Zheng was asked where she wrote the \"opinions\" that caused her to be expelled. As translated, her response was: \"I just wrote out those in my class for what I feel, for what I felt.\" Her attorney, who said that he spoke Mandarin, objected to the translation and told the IJ that what Zheng actually said is that she wrote in \"some kind of publication specifically for the class, for the particular class. . . . It's like either in the paper form or on blackboard [sic], it's like a, you know, (indiscernible) after (indiscernible), that type of thing.\" The IJ instructed Zheng's attorney to ask her further questions to clarify the issue. Zheng clarified that she had written her articles in chalk on the blackboard in the back of the class &#8212; it was the class policy that students were free to write about their opinions and about current events on the rear blackboard. Zheng then testified that the principal instructed her to stop writing her anti-government views on the blackboard, that she did not comply, and that she was accordingly dismissed from her middle school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Her counsel also moved to admit supporting documentary evidence, for both this incident and the marriage license incident, but it does not appear that the documentary evidence was ever admitted for any purpose beyond identification.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ asked Zheng why she feared returning to China in light of the fact that she was now old enough to marry. He specifically asked if she feared that anything would happen to her on her return. Her response was \"I'm not very clear, I'm not sure. Maybe I'll be thrown in jail . . . [b]ecause I was smuggle[d] out of the country and it's against law [sic].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, the government's attorney asked Zheng why she had applied for a marriage license even though she knew she was ineligible, especially since her actions were likely to draw the attention of family planning officials. Her response was that she did not realize that the officials would come after her, and that she applied because she wanted to get married, and so she decided to try her luck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zheng was also questioned further about going into hiding. She testified that she first went into hiding in September of 1999 at an aunt's house &#8212; specifically, her father's younger sister. She stated that she stayed at her aunt's house until she left China, and that she never had any contact with Chinese officials. Several questions later, however, she stated that she had hid at her aunt's house for a month, and that after a month she hid in another aunt's house &#8212; this aunt being her mother's sister.

Certainly Zheng has pointed to nothing that <i>compels</i> such a conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The first supporting document was a letter purporting to be from Zheng's junior high school. According to the certified translation, the letter states that Zheng had \"many times published articles on the class bulletin board\" against China's birth control policies, and that she was being expelled for her refusal to stop doing this. The second document was a letter purporting to be from the regional birth control office; it informed Zheng that she was required to report for an examination. Zheng testified that both documents had been in the possession of her parents, who then mailed them to her in the United States after her arrival</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The documents had not been sent for authentication, and at the hearing the government's attorney argued that authentication was necessary. The IJ expressed frustration at delays in the case and stated for the record that \"I'm very likely going to have to make a decision today based on what I have and what makes sense, and like that.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Prior to cross-examination, Zheng's attorney asked that the documents be admitted into evidence. The IJ responded by asking if it was OK to do this after cross-examination. Zheng's attorney agreed, but it does not appear that the issue was revisited at any later point in the proceedings.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
