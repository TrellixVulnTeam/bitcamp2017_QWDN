Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Eduardo A.

Valldejuli, on brief for appellee Claribel Rivera-\nJiménez.\n     Mariángela Tirado-Vales, on brief for appellee Elisbel\nMaldonado-Rivera.\n\n\n\n                          March 29, 2004\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.        Defendants-appellants seek to\n\nappeal the district court's denial of their summary judgment\n\nmotions. The motions were predicated in part on a state official's\n\nqualified   immunity   from   suit.         Plaintiffs-appellees   Claribel\n\nRivera-Jiménez     (\"Rivera\")         and      Elisbel   Maldonado-Rivera\n\n(\"Maldonado\") challenge this court's jurisdiction to review the\n\nappeal.     For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and\n\ndismiss in part.\n\n                              I.   Background\n\n            Plaintiffs Rivera and Maldonado brought an action in\n\nSeptember 1997 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for alleged violations of\n\ntheir rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the\n\nUnited States Constitution and Article II, § 4 of the Constitution\n\nof the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n            Both plaintiffs worked at the Commonwealth of Puerto\n\nRico's Department of Justice.1        Rivera was a special agent at the\n\nSpecial Investigations Bureau (\"SIB\") of the Department of Justice\n\nfrom 1989 until her employment was terminated in 1999.             In 1996,\n\nRivera was conducting an investigation into a December 1989 murder\n\n\n\n1\n   In reciting a factual overview, we seek only to give context to\nour jurisdictional ruling and do not disturb any of the district\ncourt's findings. The official positions of the named defendants\nare given for the time period relevant to the factual allegations\non which the complaint is based, except for the position of\nSecretary of Justice and Director of the Special Investigations\nBureau, where there was a change of personnel in both positions in\n1997.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fin   which   criminal    charges    had   not   been    filed.     During     the\n\ninvestigation, she learned that Lydia Morales (\"Morales\"), Director\n\nof SIB until 1997, was the local prosecutor who had been assigned\n\nto   investigate   the   crime     shortly    after    it   happened.      Rivera\n\nconcluded that Morales had acted at least negligently or otherwise\n\nunlawfully.    She filed a report which she allegedly showed to her\n\nsupervisors.    At some point, Rivera alleges, she was perceived by\n\nher supervisors as leaking this report to the local press. Despite\n\ncharges being filed in the murder case, Rivera continued in her\n\nattempts to bring attention to the alleged corruption within SIB.\n\nRivera alleges in her complaint that after communicating the\n\nreport's findings to her superiors she was the object of hostility\n\nand abuse in the workplace.2\n\n             Plaintiff Maldonado began his employment at the SIB in\n\n1995.    He was assigned to investigate drug trafficking and weapons\n\nsmuggling by public officials.               In September 1996, Maldonado\n\ndiscovered that some files were missing from his locked file\n\ncabinet.     The files were related to one of his investigations at\n\nSIB.    He clashed with his supervisor Ismael Castro (\"Castro\") over\n\nthis investigation and the issue of the stolen files.                   The local\n\npress learned of the stolen files and reported the story leaving\n\nSIB personnel to think Maldonado leaked the story.                In addition,\n\n\n2\n    Rivera conducted a subsequent investigation into casino\nlicensing, after which, she alleges her supervisors requested she\nkeep the results of that investigation to herself.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fMaldonado was also asked what he knew about Rivera's investigation\n\nby Morales and a local prosecutor in a meeting, and by Castro.          He\n\nalleges that he began receiving negative evaluations at work and\n\nwas the object of retaliatory harassment by his supervisor and\n\nother agents at SIB.\n\n           Plaintiffs brought a complaint against the Secretary of\n\nthe Department of Justice, their respective supervisors and the\n\nhead of the SIB.    Plaintiff Maldonado's claims against defendant\n\nJosé   Fuentes-Agostini     (\"Fuentes-Agostini\")      were     voluntarily\n\ndismissed.3\n\n           After discovery was completed, the remaining defendants\n\nfiled motions for summary judgment.        Defendants Fuentes-Agostini\n\nand Aníbal Torres (\"Torres\"), director of the SIB after 1997, argue\n\nseveral   issues   in   their   brief,   including   whether    the   First\n\nAmendment law was clearly established at the time the alleged\n\nconstitutional violation took place.         The other co-defendants,\n\nPedro Pierluisi (\"Pierluisi\"), the Secretary of Justice until 1997;\n\nMorales, director of the SIB; Domingo Alvarez (\"Alvarez\"), director\n\nof the Corruption and Organized Crime Investigation Division of\n\nSIB; Miguel Gierbolini (\"Gierbolini\"), sub-director of the SIB;\n\nCastro, the interim director of the Division for the Investigation\n\nof Public Officials involved in Organized Crime; and Ernesto\n\n\n3\n    Co-defendant Fuentes-Agostini was sworn in as Secretary of\nJustice in January 1997. Maldonado had not advanced any specific\nclaims against Fuentes-Agostini.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fFernández (\"Fernández\"), the interim director of the Organized\n\nCrime Division, argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n             The   summary   judgment       motions    were     referred        to     a\n\nmagistrate judge for report and recommendation.                    The magistrate\n\njudge recommended that all motions for summary judgment be denied\n\nexcept Pierluisi's motion as to Maldonado's claims and all claims\n\nagainst   Fuentes-Agostini     for     money    damages       in    his   official\n\ncapacity.4\n\n             The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation\n\nafter receiving defendants' objections.                 Defendants-appellants\n\nappeal from this order.\n\n                             II.    Jurisdiction\n\n             Defendants-appellants       assert       that    this      court        has\n\njurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal of the district\n\ncourt's denial of their motions for summary judgment based on the\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity.\n\n             Defendants-appellants       Pierluisi,          Morales,     Alvarez,\n\nGierbolini, Castro and Fernández argue that jurisdiction arises\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).         Defendants-appellants Fuentes-Agostini\n\nand Torres-Rivera argue that jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  This recommendation, based on Puerto Rico's Eleventh Amendment's\nimmunity from suit, is not at issue.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          Under         28   U.S.C.   §    1291,   the   courts    of    appeal   have\n\njurisdiction over \"all final decisions of the district courts of\n\nthe United States . . . .\"                28 U.S.C. § 1291.        Under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1292(b), appellate courts have jurisdiction over interlocutory\n\nappeals where a \"controlling question of law\" is involved, and\n\nthere is \"substantial ground for difference of opinion.\" 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1292(b).    Section 1292(b) allows for district judges to certify\n\nquestions of law for review by the appellate court.                          In this\n\nappeal, the district judge did not certify any such question.\n\nTherefore, we determine that only 28 U.S.C. § 1291 may apply, and\n\nexamine whether the order appealed from is a final order within the\n\nmeaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n             It    is    a   well-settled        proposition      that   denials    of\n\nqualified immunity that turn on issues of fact rather than issues\n\nof law are not immediately appealable as final orders. See Johnson\n\nv. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 311-12 (1995); Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's\n\nOffice, 298 F.3d 81, 89-90 (1st Cir. 2002); Stella v. Kelley, 63\n\nF.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1995).               Defendants, who did not argue the\n\njurisdictional issue, seek to frame all the issues on appeal as\n\nlegal, not factual, ones.             They argue that they were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity as a matter of law and that the district court\n\nerred in adopting the Report and Recommendation.                   We are convinced\n\nthat only certain aspects of the order denying summary judgment are\n\nappealable.       We explain.\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f            In Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 319-20 (1995), the\n\nSupreme    Court   held   that   \"a    defendant,     entitled      to   invoke   a\n\nqualified immunity defense, may not appeal a district court's\n\nsummary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or\n\nnot the pretrial record sets forth a 'genuine' issue of fact for\n\ntrial.\"\n\n            After evaluating the First Amendment claims brought by\n\nplaintiffs, the magistrate judge concluded her recommendation as\n\nfollows:\n\n            [h]ere, as to both plaintiffs, there are fact\n            issues regarding the motives of defendants.\n            Indeed, a factor to consider in the case at\n            bar is the motive for the alleged adverse\n            employment action taken against the plaintiffs\n            . . . . Further, the evidence relating to the\n            defendants' motivation in the action taken\n            against plaintiffs is a factual matter . . . .\n            Accordingly, because there are factual issues\n            as to an essential element of plaintiffs'\n            claims (i.e., the motivation of defendants in\n            the   actions   taken    against   plaintiffs)\n            defendants' motions for summary judgment on\n            the basis of qualified immunity must be\n            denied.\n\n            Some of the defendants in this appeal seek to appeal\n\nissues relating to the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim. However,\n\nwe do not have jurisdiction over denials of summary judgment\n\nmotions where      a   party   seeks   to    appeal   issues   of    evidentiary\n\nsufficiency, or where a genuine issue of material fact remains in\n\ndispute. In this case, the genuine issue of material fact which is\n\nin dispute is the defendants' motive in the adverse employment\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\factions.    \"[A] summary judgment order which determines that the\n\npretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of [material] fact, as\n\ndistinguished from an order that determines whether certain given\n\nfacts demonstrate, under clearly established law, a violation of\n\nsome federally protected right, is not reviewable on demand.\"\n\nStella, 63 F.3d at 74.\n\n            The court below addressed the evidence supporting both\n\nplaintiffs' First Amendment claims, dissecting them into the three\n\nelements,   and       came   to   the   conclusion    that   genuine   issues    of\n\nmaterial fact precluded entry of summary judgment.               We do not have\n\njurisdiction to hear appeals of this nature. See Acevedo-García v.\n\nVera-Monroig, 204 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that, when an\n\nappeal   from     a    denial     of    qualified    immunity   challenges      the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence, no appellate jurisdiction exists);\n\nGuilloty-Pérez v. Fuentes-Agostini, 196 F.3d 293, 294 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (no appellate jurisdiction when district court denied summary\n\njudgment motion \"because there were material factual issues both as\n\nto the nature of the involvement of [defendants], as well as their\n\n[sic] motivations for their involvement\") (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            In Guilloty-Pérez, 196 F.3d at 294, a case strikingly\n\nsimilar to the present one, we dismissed the appeal for lack of\n\njurisdiction.         There, as here, the lower court denied qualified\n\nimmunity to the officers because genuine issues of material fact\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fexisted as to the defendants' motivation.               Id.    We are presented\n\nwith the same issue. We cannot review the district court's rulings\n\nas to the sufficiency of the claims because certain determinations\n\nremain to be made by the factfinder.               Therefore, no appellate\n\njurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because the denial of\n\nthese summary judgment motions is not a final order.                See Acevedo-\n\nGarcía, 204 F.3d at 10.\n\n                        III.     Qualified Immunity\n\n            \"Denials   of     summary   judgment       on   qualified     immunity\n\ngrounds are reviewed to the extent that the qualified immunity\n\ndefense turns upon a purely legal question and any disputed facts\n\nare not material to the issue of immunity.\"             Suboh, 298 F.3d at 89-\n\n90 (citing Fletcher v. Town of Clinton, 196 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (internal quotation marks omitted)). To determine whether an\n\nofficial is entitled to qualified immunity we use a three-part\n\ntest: first, whether a constitutional violation has been alleged if\n\nplaintiffs' allegations are established as true; second, whether\n\nthe   law   was   clearly    established    at   the    time   of   the    alleged\n\nviolation; and last, whether a reasonable official, similarly\n\nsituated would understand that the challenged conduct violated a\n\nconstitutional norm.        Id. at 90; see also Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S.\n\n603 (1999).\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview the lower court's determination that genuine issues of\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fmaterial fact exist as to the defendants' motives in taking various\n\nallegedly retaliatory actions against the plaintiffs. However, the\n\nfirst   prong    of    the        qualified     immunity    inquiry     --   whether\n\nplaintiffs' allegations, if true, establish a claim of retaliation\n\nin   violation   of   the     First    Amendment     --    implicates    two   other\n\nquestions, both of which are considered legal in nature, and\n\ntherefore subject to appellate review at this time insofar as they\n\ncould potentially sustain qualified immunity objections. See Mihos\n\nv. Swift, 358 F.3d 91, 105 (1st Cir. 2004) (stating that a mere\n\nissue of fact on unconstitutional motive does not carry plaintiff\n\nto trial because defendant may prevail on other basis).\n\n           The   first       is    whether    plaintiffs'    speech     touches   on\n\nmatters of public concern and is therefore protected under the\n\nFirst Amendment.       See id. at 102-03; see also Torres-Rosado v.\n\nRotger-Sabat, 335 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2003).                     Here, despite\n\ndefendants' arguments to the contrary, plaintiffs' speech raised\n\nthe possibility of corruption in a public agency and is therefore\n\nprotected under the First Amendment.              Torres-Rosado at 11-12 (even\n\ninternal memoranda raising such concerns are protected).\n\n           The second is whether an employee's First Amendment\n\ninterests outweigh the government's interests as an employer in\n\navoiding disruption in the workplace -- the so-called Pickering\n\nbalancing test.       See Mihos, 358 F.3d at 103 (citing Pickering v.\n\nBd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968)); see also Torres-Rosado,\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f335 F.3d at 11, 13.    Although this determination is usually a legal\n\none, it may be necessary to resolve the disputed questions of fact\n\n(such as whether a defendant's claim of potential disruption is\n\nreasonable) before an evaluation can properly be made. See Johnson\n\nv. Ganim, 342 F.3d 105, 114-15 (2d Cir. 2003).         On this record, we\n\nagree with the magistrate judge that the defendants' allegations of\n\ndisruption fail to show that they are entitled to summary judgment\n\non this issue as a matter of law.\n\n          In addition, the defendants argue that neither plaintiff\n\nhas suffered a sufficiently adverse employment action to support a\n\nFirst Amendment retaliation claim.          Although defendants contend\n\nthat this is a legal determination capable of review at this\n\njuncture by virtue of defendants' assertion of qualified immunity,\n\nit is not entirely clear this is so.         See Myers v. Neb. Health &\n\nHuman Servs., 324 F.3d 655, 660 (8th Cir. 2003) (holding that this\n\nis a jury issue, at least where there are material facts in dispute\n\nas to whether employer's action affected a material change in\n\nemployee's working conditions).\n\n          In   any    event,   the   standard   for   showing   an   adverse\n\nemployment action is lower in the First Amendment retaliation\n\ncontext than it is in other contexts (such as Title VII), see Power\n\nv. Summers, 226 F.3d 815, 820-21 (7th Cir. 2000), and the Supreme\n\nCourt has indicated that even relatively minor events might give\n\nrise to liability.    See Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f62, 75-76 & n.8 (1990); see also Coszalter v. City of Salem, 320\n\nF.3d 968,      974-77       (9th   Cir.    2003)   (\"To   constitute     an   adverse\n\nemployment action, a government act of retaliation need not be\n\nsevere and it need not be of a certain kind.\"); Power, 226 F.3d at\n\n820 (\"Any deprivation under color of law that is likely to deter\n\nthe exercise of free speech, whether by an employee or anyone else,\n\nis actionable . . . .\"); but see Breaux v. City of Garland, 205\n\nF.3d 150, 157 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding that some employment actions\n\nare not actionable even though they have the effect of chilling the\n\nexercise of free speech).\n\n              Here, the plaintiffs have alleged sufficiently adverse\n\nemployment actions to sustain their retaliation claims.                     Plaintiff\n\nRivera claims that she was subjected to, among other things,\n\ninternal investigation and ultimately dismissal as a result of\n\nengaging in protected speech.               Plaintiff Maldonado claims that he\n\nwas subjected         to,    among   other    things,     the   denial   of   special\n\nbenefits and assignments.               Assuming these allegations are true,\n\nSuboh, 298 F.3d at 90, and absent more information minimizing the\n\nimpact   of     the    denial      of     benefits,   plaintiffs     have     alleged\n\nsufficiently adverse employment actions to underpin a claim of\n\nimpermissible retaliation.\n\n              We turn now to the second prong of the qualified immunity\n\nanalysis. \"The question of whether a right is clearly established\n\nis an issue of law for the court to decide.\"                Suboh, 298 F.3d at 90\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\f(citing Elder v. Holloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516 (1994)); see also\n\nStella, 63 F.3d at 77.       Defendants Fuentes-Agostini and Torres\n\nargue that the court below erred in determining as a matter of law\n\nthat plaintiffs' First Amendment right was clearly established in\n\n1996 and 1997, when the injuries are alleged to have occurred.\n\n           \"One tried and true way of determining whether [a] right\n\nwas clearly established at the time the defendants acted, is to ask\n\nwhether existing case law gave the defendants fair warning that\n\ntheir conduct violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\"\n\nSuboh, 298 F.3d at 93 (citation omitted). The magistrate judge did\n\nexactly this, looking to the caselaw as it existed at the time,\n\nwhich   had   held   that   these   types   of   retaliatory   action   in\n\nemployment, involving a public employee's speech on a question of\n\npublic concern, was a clear violation of the First Amendment.5\n\nMoreover, the unconstitutionality of such retaliation was clearly\n\nestablished in this circuit and the Supreme Court at the time of\n\nthe alleged violations.       See, e.g., Rutan, 497 U.S. 62 (1990)\n\n(holding that conditioning any employment promotion or action on\n\npatronage violates a public employee's First Amendment rights\n\nabsent compelling government interest); Branti v.

In the instant appeal,\n\nthe lower court determined that questions remained as to the issue\n\nof defendants' motive which precluded entry of summary judgment on\n\nqualified immunity grounds.            Since \"pre-trial qualified immunity\n\ndecisions are immediately appealable as collateral orders when the\n\nimmunity claim presents a legal issue that can be decided without\n\nconsidering the correctness of the plaintiff's version of the\n\nfacts,\"    Acevedo-García,       204    F.3d   at      14,      we    cannot     exercise\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fjurisdiction over this part of the qualified immunity analysis.\n\nDoing so would entail making a determination of material facts.\n\n                          IV.

The motions were predicated in part on a state official's qualified immunity from suit. Plaintiffs-appellees Claribel Rivera-Jim&#233;nez (\"Rivera\") and Elisbel Maldonado-Rivera (\"Maldonado\") challenge this court's jurisdiction to review the appeal. For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs Rivera and Maldonado brought an action in September 1997 under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 for alleged violations of their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article II, &#167; 4 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both plaintiffs worked at the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Department of Justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Rivera was a special agent at the Special Investigations Bureau (\"SIB\") of the Department of Justice from 1989 until her employment was terminated in 1999. In 1996, Rivera was conducting an investigation into a December 1989 murder in which criminal charges had not been filed. During the investigation, she learned that Lydia Morales (\"Morales\"), Director of SIB until 1997, was the local prosecutor who had been assigned to investigate the crime shortly after it happened. Rivera concluded that Morales had acted at least negligently or otherwise unlawfully. She filed a report which she allegedly showed to her supervisors. At some point, Rivera alleges, she was perceived by her supervisors as leaking this report to the local press. Despite charges being filed in the murder case, Rivera continued in her attempts to bring attention to the alleged corruption within SIB. Rivera alleges in her complaint that after communicating the report's findings to her superiors she was the object of hostility and abuse in the workplace.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Maldonado began his employment at the SIB in 1995. He was assigned to investigate drug trafficking and weapons smuggling by public officials. In September 1996, Maldonado discovered that some files were missing from his locked file cabinet. The files were related to one of his investigations at SIB. He clashed with his supervisor Ismael Castro (\"Castro\") over this investigation and the issue of the stolen files. The local press learned of the stolen files and reported the story leaving SIB personnel to think Maldonado leaked the story. In addition, Maldonado was also asked what he knew about Rivera's investigation by Morales and a local prosecutor in a meeting, and by Castro. He alleges that he began receiving negative evaluations at work and was the object of retaliatory harassment by his supervisor and other agents at SIB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought a complaint against the Secretary of the Department of Justice, their respective supervisors and the head of the SIB. Plaintiff Maldonado's claims against defendant Jos&#233; Fuentes-Agostini (\"Fuentes-Agostini\") were voluntarily dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery was completed, the remaining defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Defendants Fuentes-Agostini and An&#237;bal Torres (\"Torres\"), director of the SIB after 1997, argue several issues in their brief, including whether the First Amendment law was clearly established at the time the alleged constitutional violation took place. The other co-defendants, Pedro Pierluisi (\"Pierluisi\"), the Secretary of Justice until 1997; Morales, director of the SIB; Domingo Alvarez (\"Alvarez\"), director of the Corruption and Organized Crime Investigation Division of SIB; Miguel Gierbolini (\"Gierbolini\"), subdirector of the SIB; Castro, the interim director of the Division for the Investigation of Public Officials involved in Organized Crime; and Ernesto Fern&#225;ndez (\"Fern&#225;ndez\"), the interim director of the Organized Crime Division, argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summary judgment motions were referred to a magistrate judge for report and recommendation. The magistrate judge recommended that all motions for summary judgment be denied except Pierluisi's motion as to Maldonado's claims and all claims against Fuentes-Agostini for money damages in his official capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation after receiving defendants' objections. Defendants-appellants appeal from this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Jurisdiction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants-appellants assert that this court has jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal of the district court's denial of their motions for summary judgment based on the doctrine of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants-appellants Pierluisi, Morales, Alvarez, Gierbolini, Castro and Fern&#225;ndez argue that jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b). Defendants-appellants Fuentes-Agostini and Torres-Rivera argue that jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, the courts of appeal have jurisdiction over \"all final decisions of the district courts of the United States....\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b), appellate courts have jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals where a \"controlling question of law\" is involved, and there is \"substantial ground for difference of opinion.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b). Section 1292(b) allows for district judges to certify questions of law for review by the appellate court. In this appeal, the district judge did not certify any such question. Therefore, we determine that only 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 may apply, and examine whether the order appealed from is a final order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a well-settled proposition that denials of qualified immunity that turn on issues of fact rather than issues of law are not immediately appealable as final orders. <i>See Johnson v. Jones,</i> 515 U.S. 304, 311-12, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995); <i>Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 89-90 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Stella v. Kelley,</i> 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.1995). Defendants, who did not argue the jurisdictional issue, seek to frame all the issues on appeal as legal, not factual, ones. They argue that they were entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law and that the district court erred in adopting the Report and Recommendation. We are convinced that only certain aspects of the order denying summary judgment are appealable. We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Johnson v. Jones,</i> 515 U.S. 304, 319-20, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995), the Supreme Court held that \"a defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a district court's summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a `genuine' issue of fact for trial.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After evaluating the First Amendment claims brought by plaintiffs, the magistrate judge concluded her recommendation as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[h]ere, as to both plaintiffs, there are fact issues regarding the motives of defendants. Indeed, a factor to consider in the case at bar is the motive for the alleged adverse employment action taken against the plaintiffs.... Further, the evidence relating to the defendants' motivation in the action taken against plaintiffs is a factual matter.... Accordingly, because there are factual issues as to an essential element of plaintiffs' claims (i.e., the motivation of defendants in the actions taken against plaintiffs) defendants' motions for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity must be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of the defendants in this appeal seek to appeal issues relating to the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim. However, we do not have jurisdiction over denials of summary judgment motions where a party seeks to appeal issues of evidentiary sufficiency, or where a genuine issue of material fact remains in dispute. In this case, the genuine issue of material fact which is in dispute is the defendants' motive in the adverse employment actions. \"[A] summary judgment order which determines that the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of [material] fact, as distinguished from an order that determines whether certain given facts demonstrate, under clearly established law, a violation of some federally protected right, is not reviewable on demand.\" <i>Stella,</i> 63 F.3d at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below addressed the evidence supporting both plaintiffs' First Amendment claims, dissecting them into the three elements, and came to the conclusion that genuine issues of material fact precluded entry of summary judgment. We do not have jurisdiction to hear appeals of this nature. <i>See Acevedo-Garc&#237;a v. Vera-Monroig,</i> 204 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2000) (holding that, when an appeal from a denial of qualified immunity challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, no appellate jurisdiction exists); <i>Guilloty-P&#233;rez v. Fuentes-Agostini,</i> 196 F.3d 293, 294 (1st Cir.1999) (no appellate jurisdiction when district court denied summary judgment motion \"because there were material factual issues both as to the nature of the involvement of [defendants], as well as their [sic] motivations for their involvement\") (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Guilloty-P&#233;rez,</i> 196 F.3d at 294, a case strikingly similar to the present one, we dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. There, as here, the lower court denied qualified immunity to the officers because genuine issues of material fact existed as to the defendants' motivation. <i>Id.</i> We are presented with the same issue. We cannot review the district court's rulings as to the sufficiency of the claims because certain determinations remain to be made by the factfinder. Therefore, no appellate jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 because the denial of these summary judgment motions is not a final order. <i>See Acevedo-Garc&#237;a,</i> 204 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Qualified Immunity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Denials of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds are reviewed to the extent that the qualified immunity defense turns upon a purely legal question and any disputed facts are not material to the issue of immunity.\" <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 89-90 (citing <i>Fletcher v. Town of Clinton,</i> 196 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted)). To determine whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity we use a three-part test: first, whether a constitutional violation has been alleged if plaintiffs' allegations are established as true; second, whether the law was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation; and last, whether a reasonable official, similarly situated would understand that the challenged conduct violated a constitutional norm. <i>Id.</i> at 90; <i>see also Wilson v. Layne,</i> 526 U.S. 603, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we lack jurisdiction to review the lower court's determination that genuine issues of material fact exist as to the defendants' motives in taking various allegedly retaliatory actions against the plaintiffs. However, the first prong of the qualified immunity inquiry &#8212; whether plaintiffs' allegations, if true, establish a claim of retaliation in violation of the First Amendment &#8212; implicates two other questions, both of which are considered legal in nature, and therefore subject to appellate review at this time insofar as they could potentially sustain qualified immunity objections. <i>See Mihos v. Swift,</i> 358 F.3d 91, 105 (1st Cir.2004) (stating that a mere issue of fact on unconstitutional motive does not carry plaintiff to trial because defendant may prevail on other basis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first is whether plaintiffs' speech touches on matters of public concern and is therefore protected under the First Amendment. <i>See id.</i> at 102-03; <i>see also Torres-Rosado v. Rotger-Sabat,</i> 335 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2003). Here, despite defendants' arguments to the contrary, plaintiffs' speech raised the possibility of corruption in a public agency and is therefore protected under the First Amendment. <i>Torres-Rosado</i> at 11-12 (even internal memoranda raising such concerns are protected).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second is whether an employee's First Amendment interests outweigh the government's interests as an employer in avoiding disruption in the workplace &#8212; the so-called <i>Pickering</i> balancing test. <i>See Mihos,</i> 358 F.3d at 103 (citing <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968)); <i>see also Torres-Rosado,</i> 335 F.3d at 11, 13. Although this determination is usually a legal one, it may be necessary to resolve the disputed questions of fact (such as whether a defendant's claim of potential disruption is reasonable) before an evaluation can properly be made. <i>See Johnson v. Ganim,</i> 342 F.3d 105, 114-15 (2d Cir. 2003). On this record, we agree with the magistrate judge that the defendants' allegations of disruption fail to show that they are entitled to summary judgment on this issue as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the defendants argue that neither plaintiff has suffered a sufficiently adverse employment action to support a First Amendment retaliation claim. Although defendants contend that this is a legal determination capable of review at this juncture by virtue of defendants' assertion of qualified immunity, it is not entirely clear this is so. <i>See Myers v. Neb.

The magistrate judge did exactly this, looking to the caselaw as it existed at the time, which had held that these types of retaliatory action in employment, involving a public employee's speech on a question of public concern, was a clear violation of the First Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Moreover, the unconstitutionality of such retaliation was clearly established in this circuit and the Supreme Court at the time of the alleged violations. <i>See, e.g., Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990) (holding that conditioning any employment promotion or action on patronage violates a public employee's First Amendment rights absent compelling government interest); <i>Branti v.

In the instant appeal, the lower court determined that questions remained as to the issue of defendants' motive which precluded entry of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.

Plaintiffs-appellees Claribel Rivera-Jim&#233;nez (\"Rivera\") and Elisbel Maldonado-Rivera (\"Maldonado\") challenge this court's jurisdiction to review the appeal. For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs Rivera and Maldonado brought an action in September 1997 under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 for alleged violations of their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article II, &#167; 4 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both plaintiffs worked at the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Department of Justice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Rivera was a special agent at the Special Investigations Bureau (\"SIB\") of the Department of Justice from 1989 until her employment was terminated in 1999. In 1996, Rivera was conducting an investigation into a December 1989 murder in which criminal charges had not been filed. During the investigation, she learned that Lydia Morales (\"Morales\"), Director of SIB until 1997, was the local prosecutor who had been assigned to investigate the crime shortly after it happened. Rivera concluded that Morales had acted at least negligently or otherwise unlawfully. She filed a report which she allegedly showed to her supervisors. At some point, Rivera alleges, she was perceived by her supervisors as leaking this report to the local press. Despite charges being filed in the murder case, Rivera continued in her attempts to bring attention to the alleged corruption within SIB. Rivera alleges in her complaint that after communicating the report's findings to her superiors she was the object of hostility and abuse in the workplace.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Maldonado began his employment at the SIB in 1995. He was assigned to investigate drug trafficking and weapons smuggling by public officials. In September 1996, Maldonado discovered that some files were missing from his locked file cabinet. The files were related to one of his investigations at SIB. He clashed with his supervisor Ismael Castro (\"Castro\") over this investigation and the issue of the stolen files. The local press learned of the stolen files and reported the story leaving SIB personnel to think Maldonado leaked the story. In addition, Maldonado was also asked what he knew about Rivera's investigation by Morales and a local prosecutor in a meeting, and by Castro. He alleges that he began receiving negative evaluations at work and was the object of retaliatory harassment by his supervisor and other agents at SIB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs brought a complaint against the Secretary of the Department of Justice, their respective supervisors and the head of the SIB. Plaintiff Maldonado's claims against defendant Jos&#233; Fuentes-Agostini (\"Fuentes-Agostini\") were voluntarily dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery was completed, the remaining defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Defendants Fuentes-Agostini and An&#237;bal Torres (\"Torres\"), director of the SIB after 1997, argue several issues in their brief, including whether the First Amendment law was clearly established at the time the alleged constitutional violation took place. The other co-defendants, Pedro Pierluisi (\"Pierluisi\"), the Secretary of Justice until 1997; Morales, director of the SIB; Domingo Alvarez (\"Alvarez\"), director of the Corruption and Organized Crime Investigation Division of SIB; Miguel Gierbolini (\"Gierbolini\"), subdirector of the SIB; Castro, the interim director of the Division for the Investigation of Public Officials involved in Organized Crime; and Ernesto Fern&#225;ndez (\"Fern&#225;ndez\"), the interim director of the Organized Crime Division, argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summary judgment motions were referred to a magistrate judge for report and recommendation. The magistrate judge recommended that all motions for summary judgment be denied except Pierluisi's motion as to Maldonado's claims and all claims against Fuentes-Agostini for money damages in his official capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation after receiving defendants' objections.

Section 1292(b) allows for district judges to certify questions of law for review by the appellate court. In this appeal, the district judge did not certify any such question. Therefore, we determine that only 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 may apply, and examine whether the order appealed from is a final order within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a well-settled proposition that denials of qualified immunity that turn on issues of fact rather than issues of law are not immediately appealable as final orders. <i>See Johnson v.

However, we do not have jurisdiction over denials of summary judgment motions where a party seeks to appeal issues of evidentiary sufficiency, or where a genuine issue of material fact remains in dispute. In this case, the genuine issue of material fact which is in dispute is the defendants' motive in the adverse employment actions. \"[A] summary judgment order which determines that the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of [material] fact, as distinguished from an order that determines whether certain given facts demonstrate, under clearly established law, a violation of some federally protected right, is not reviewable on demand.\" <i>Stella,</i> 63 F.3d at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below addressed the evidence supporting both plaintiffs' First Amendment claims, dissecting them into the three elements, and came to the conclusion that genuine issues of material fact precluded entry of summary judgment.

To determine whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity we use a three-part test: first, whether a constitutional violation has been alleged if plaintiffs' allegations are established as true; second, whether the law was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation; and last, whether a reasonable official, similarly situated would understand that the challenged conduct violated a constitutional norm. <i>Id.</i> at 90; <i>see also Wilson v.

However, the first prong of the qualified immunity inquiry &#8212; whether plaintiffs' allegations, if true, establish a claim of retaliation in violation of the First Amendment &#8212; implicates two other questions, both of which are considered legal in nature, and therefore subject to appellate review at this time insofar as they could potentially sustain qualified immunity objections. <i>See Mihos v.

Here, despite defendants' arguments to the contrary, plaintiffs' speech raised the possibility of corruption in a public agency and is therefore protected under the First Amendment. <i>Torres-Rosado</i> at 11-12 (even internal memoranda raising such concerns are protected).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second is whether an employee's First Amendment interests outweigh the government's interests as an employer in avoiding disruption in the workplace &#8212; the so-called <i>Pickering</i> balancing test. <i>See Mihos,</i> 358 F.3d at 103 (citing <i>Pickering v.

Although this determination is usually a legal one, it may be necessary to resolve the disputed questions of fact (such as whether a defendant's claim of potential disruption is reasonable) before an evaluation can properly be made. <i>See Johnson v.
