Ian    Brown   suffered   serious\n\ninjuries in a motorcycle accident that occurred near Hartwell Road\n\nin Bedford, Massachusetts.     Brown's injuries, which resulted from\n\nhis collision with a utility pole located off the edge of the road\n\nand on the \"road-side\" of a guardrail, left him a paraplegic.\n\n           Brown and his parents (for convenience, \"Brown\") brought\n\na negligence action against Boston Edison, a utility company, and\n\nthe United States.1     Brown claimed that both parties were liable\n\nfor his injuries because both allowed a dangerous condition -- the\n\nutility pole's location on the road-side of the guardrail -- to\n\nexist off the edge of Hartwell Road.\n\n           The   district   court   granted     the   defendants'   summary\n\njudgment motions, concluding that neither the United States nor\n\nBoston Edison owed a duty of care to Brown.           The court determined\n\nthat the United States owed no duty to Brown because the Town of\n\nBedford, and not the United States, owned or controlled Hartwell\n\nRoad.   As a result, the court concluded that the United States was\n\nnot responsible for maintaining the road and its appurtenances in\n\na safe condition.     As for Boston Edison, the court concluded that\n\n\n\n1\n  The district court had jurisdiction over Brown's claims as\nfollows. Brown's claim against the United States was brought under\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b). Brown's claim\nagainst Boston Edison was based on diversity of citizenship --\nBrown is a citizen of the State of New Jersey and Boston Edison is\na New York corporation with a principal place of business in\nMassachusetts. See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332. The claim against Boston\nEdison involved an amount in controversy exceeding $75,000. Id.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fit   owed   no    duty   to   Brown    because       Brown's     accident   was   not\n\nreasonably       foreseeable.     Brown          appeals   the   district   court's\n\nrulings.2    We affirm.\n\n                                      I.    Facts\n\n             We provide most of the facts here, reserving some for our\n\ndiscussion of the appellate claims.                Because we are reviewing the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants, we\n\npresent these facts in the light most favorable to Brown.                   See Rodi\n\nv. S. New Eng. Sch. of Law, 532 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n                                      The Pole\n\n             In 1916, the Town of Bedford granted Boston Edison the\n\nright to install a pole line along Hartwell Road.                  Among the poles\n\ninstalled was Pole 16/37 (\"Pole 16\" or \"pole\") -- the pole at\n\nissue.      Boston Edison placed Pole 16 thirteen inches off of a\n\ncurved portion of Hartwell Road.                  As the years passed, Boston\n\nEdison replaced Pole 16, which was made of wood, on a periodic\n\nbasis. Specifically, Boston Edison replaced the pole in 1929, 1954\n\nand 1964.     So far as is known, however, the position of the pole\n\nnever changed.        In approximately 1990, an unknown third party\n\nplaced a guardrail along Hartwell Road.               Standing between the road\n\nand the guardrail was Pole 16.\n\n\n\n\n2\n  The district court alternatively held that Brown's claim against\nBoston Edison was barred by Massachusetts' statute of repose, MASS .\nGEN. LAWS ch. 260, ยง 2B.\n\n                                           -3-\n\f                            The Accident\n\n            At the time of the accident Brown was an Air Force\n\nLieutenant stationed at Hanscom Air Force base.          The base is\n\nlocated on land bordering Hartwell Road that is owned by the United\n\nStates. The accident occurred as Brown was traveling to Hanscom on\n\nhis motorcycle via Hartwell Road.      Brown, proceeding at a speed of\n\napproximately twenty-five miles per hour, hit a depression in the\n\nroad, which caused him to lose control of his motorcycle.     Leaping\n\nfrom the motorcycle, Brown chose the guardrail as an aim point for\n\nhis body.   The guardrail, however, channeled Brown headfirst into\n\nPole 16.    Although there was no evidence that the pole had ever\n\nbeen struck prior to Brown's accident, Bedford Town police logs\n\nrevealed that, in the eight years preceding Brown's accident,\n\ntwenty-eight accidents had occurred in the vicinity of the pole.\n\n                          II.   Discussion\n\n            We review a court's grant of summary judgment de novo.\n\nBogan v. City of Boston, 489 F.3d 417, 424 (1st Cir. 2007).        In\n\nthis case, Massachusetts law applies to both of Brown's claims.\n\nSee Magarian v. Hawkins, 321 F.3d 235, 238 n.4 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nSoto v. United States, 11 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            To prevail in a negligence action under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant owed the\n\nplaintiff a duty of reasonable care; (2) the defendant breached\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthis duty; (3) damage to the plaintiff resulted; and (4) the breach\n\nof the duty caused this damage.        Jupin v. Kask, 849 N.E.2d 829, 835\n\n(Mass. 2006).      Typically, whether a plaintiff has satisfied the\n\nlast three elements is for a jury to decide.              Id.    Whether the\n\ndefendant owes any duty in the first place, however, is a question\n\nof   law   and,   therefore,   grist    for   the   summary   judgment   mill.\n\nAfarian v. Mass. Elec. Co., 866 N.E.2d 901, 905 (Mass. 2007) (\"The\n\nexistence of a legal duty is a question of law appropriate for\n\nresolution by summary judgment.\").             Central to Brown's claims\n\nagainst the United States and Boston Edison is the question of\n\nwhether either party owed him a duty of care.\n\n            Generally, a duty of care exists under Massachusetts law\n\nwhere the resulting harm was \"reasonably foreseeable.\"            Jupin, 849\n\nN.E.2d at 835.       More specifically, where an actor is able to\n\nforesee that his conduct could cause harm to others, he is charged\n\nwith a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid this harm.                Id.\n\n(\"To the extent that a legal standard does exist for determining\n\nthe existence of a tort duty . . ., it is a test of the 'reasonable\n\nforeseeability' of the harm.\") (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); see also Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus,\n\nInc., 514 N.E.2d 100, 102 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987) (\"There is no duty\n\nowed when the risk which results in the plaintiff's injury is not\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fone which could be reasonably anticipated by the defendant.\").3\n\nWith this general terrain mapped, we turn first to Brown's claim\n\nagainst the United States.\n\n           Brown's negligence claim against the United States is\n\npremised   on   his   contention   that   the   United   States   owned   and\n\ncontrolled Hartwell Road -- the road off of which he was injured.\n\nControl is the key as, under Massachusetts law, \"it is elementary\n\nthat liability for damage caused by the condition of premises\n\ncommonly depends upon control of the offending instrumentality,\n\neither through ownership or otherwise.\" Underhill v. Shactman, 151\n\nN.E.2d 287, 290 (Mass. 1958) (citation omitted); see also McIntyre\n\nv. Boston Redevelopment Auth., 595 N.E.2d 334, 336 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1992)(\"[T]he critical test is who had the right to control the\n\nproperty.\").\n\n           Despite Brown's contention to the contrary, the record\n\nevidence overwhelmingly supports the district court's conclusion\n\nthat the Town of Bedford, and not the United States, controlled\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Massachusetts courts have also defined duty in more abstract\nterms. See Luoni v. Berube, 729 N.E.2d 1108, 1113 (Mass. 2000)\n(\"The concept of 'duty' . . . 'is not sacrosanct in itself, but is\nonly an expression of the sum total of . . . considerations of\npolicy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to\nprotection . . . . No better general statement can be made than\nthat the courts will find a duty where, in general, reasonable\npersons would recognize it and agree that it exists.'\") (citation\nomitted); Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll., 449 N.E.2d 331, 335 (Mass.\n1983) (\"[A] duty finds its 'source in existing social values and\ncustoms.'\") (citation omitted).\n\n                                    -6-\n\fHartwell Road either through ownership or otherwise.                    Several\n\npieces of evidence stand out.\n\n            First, a sworn declaration and a deed both indicate that\n\nthe Town of Bedford actually owned Hartwell Road.                  The United\n\nStates' title expert, after examining a multitude of records\n\nincluding those of the Bedford Town Clerk, testified that the Town\n\nof Bedford took title to Hartwell Road in 1734-35.                 A 1952 deed\n\nfrom the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, while granting the United\n\nStates   fee    ownership    of   the   land   surrounding   Hartwell    Road,\n\nexplicitly excluded \"all public or private roads, right[s] of way\n\nand/or easements now existing within the said boundaries . . . .\"4\n\n            In addition, the sworn deposition testimony of four\n\nwitnesses      leads   to   the   conclusion   that   the   Town   of   Bedford\n\ncontrolled Hartwell Road.          A witness responsible for maintaining\n\nthe grounds and roads at Hanscom for decades testified that the\n\nTown of Bedford has always maintained Hartwell Road and that the\n\nemployees at Hanscom had never maintained or done anything to the\n\nroad. An eighteen-year employee of the Town's Department of Public\n\nWorks testified that the Town maintains Hartwell Road and is\n\nresponsible for law enforcement on the road.            With respect to the\n\nTown's maintenance of the road, this witness noted that the Town\n\n\n\n4\n  The land transferred in the 1952 deed was later divided into two\nseparate portions in 1977, with the Navy taking \"Parcel B,\" the\nportion closest to the accident site. The Air Force retained the\nother parcel.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fsweeps, plows, and paves the road, in addition to painting its\n\nstreet lines and filling its potholes.     A previous Bedford Town\n\nforeman who had worked in Bedford's Highway and Grounds Division\n\ntestified similarly regarding the Town's maintenance of Hartwell\n\nRoad.   Finally, the United States' title expert testified that the\n\nTown of Bedford installed a sewer line under the road around 1958.\n\n           Finally, the declarations of two government employees\n\nsupport the United States' position.    A civilian employee of the\n\nUnited States Air Force, responsible for overseeing the real\n\nproperty for the Air Force facilities at Hanscom Air Force base,\n\ntestified that \"no agency of the federal government owns or has\n\nowned or maintained Hartwell Road and its shoulders.\"   A civilian\n\nemployee of the United States Navy, responsible for managing the\n\nNavy's portion of the Hanscom land, testified that the road was\n\nused as a public road and that the Navy \"did no maintenance,\n\nconstruction, planning, public safety, or law enforcement work with\n\nregard to the road.\"\n\n           Faced with this substantial evidence, Brown nevertheless\n\nargues that two other pieces of evidence turn the issue of control\n\ninto a question for the jury.    After closer examination of this\n\nevidence, we disagree.\n\n           Brown offers the affidavit of a licensed attorney, who\n\nopined that the Town of Bedford has merely an easement interest in\n\nHartwell Road and that the United States is the fee owner of the\n\n\n                                -8-\n\froad.   Even if this testimony were enough to put the ownership of\n\nHartwell Road into question, the distinction made in the affidavit\n\nis immaterial.      As detailed above, the record evidence makes\n\nmanifest that the Town of Bedford exercised control over Hartwell\n\nRoad in every conceivable sense.\n\n           Brown also offers the deposition of Arthur Hayes, an Air\n\nForce specialist in cartography and real estate.    Hayes testified\n\nthat the Navy owns the land upon which Pole 16 stands.         This\n\ntestimony, however, does not create a question of material fact for\n\ntwo reasons. First, Hayes's testimony as to ownership suffers from\n\nan inherent flaw.     It is based primarily on the 1952 deed that\n\ntransferred ownership of the Hanscom land from the Commonwealth of\n\nMassachusetts to the United States.    As detailed above, this deed\n\nexplicitly excluded \"all public or private roads, right of way\n\nand/or easements now existing.\"       Second, and again, even if a\n\nmaterial fact existed as to the ownership of Hartwell Road, the\n\nrecord evidence plainly shows that the Town of Bedford controlled\n\nHartwell Road.   See McIntyre, 595 N.E.2d at 336.\n\n           As we have noted, in order to forestall summary judgment,\n\nthe record evidence must be \"'sufficiently open-ended to permit a\n\nrational fact finder to resolve the [liability] issue in favor of\n\neither side.'\"   Ramรญrez-Carlo v. United States, 496 F.3d 41, 46\n\n(1st Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).     Here, given the significant\n\nevidence indicating that the Town of Bedford, and not the United\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fStates, controlled Hartwell Road, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt appropriately granted summary judgment to the United States.\n\n            We turn to Brown's claim against Boston Edison.          Unlike\n\nthe United States, Boston Edison concedes owning part of the\n\nallegedly dangerous condition, viz., Pole 16.5         We thus return to\n\nthe governing principles of Massachusetts negligence law. In cases\n\nwhere the liability of a utility company for harm caused by one of\n\nits utility poles is at issue, the Supreme Judicial Court of\n\nMassachusetts   has   taken   a   more   focused   approach   to   the   duty\n\nanalysis.   In such cases, the duty analysis is directed by ยง 368 of\n\nthe Restatement (Second) of Torts.          Afarian, 866 N.E.2d at 907\n\n(concluding that the principles expressed in ยง 368 \"provide a\n\nfunctional framework for determining the issue of duty\"); id. at\n\n908 (\"We adopt the approach set forth in ยง 368 of the Restatement\n\nbecause it comports with concepts of reasonable foreseeability . .\n\n. .\").6\n\n\n5\n  We noted earlier that the general rule is that \"liability . . .\ncommonly depends upon control of the offending instrumentality,\neither through ownership or otherwise.\" See Underhill, 151 N.E.2d\nat 290 (emphasis added). As we discuss infra, however, where the\nliability of a utility company for harm caused by one of its\nutility poles is at issue, Massachusetts law, following ยง 368 of\nthe Restatement (Second) of Torts, focuses on \"possession.\" Any\npotential dissonance between these standards is of no consequence\nhere. Boston Edison concedes that it owns the pole and that it is\nresponsible for the pole's maintenance. The company does not put\nits \"control\" of the pole into question, nor does it controvert\n\"possession\" for purposes of analysis under ยง 368.\n6\n  The parties appear to be under the impression that the Maryland\nCourt of Appeals' decision in Coates v. S. Md. Elec. Coop., Inc.,\n\n                                   -10-\n\f              Section 368, titled \"Conditions Dangerous to Travelers on\n\nAdjacent Highway,\" deals specifically with liability for harm\n\ncaused   by    artificial   conditions    on   land   bordering   highways.7\n\nSection 368 provides:\n\n              A possessor of land who creates or permits to\n              remain thereon an . . . artificial condition\n              so near an existing highway that he realizes\n              or should realize [the artificial condition]\n              involves an unreasonable risk to others\n              accidentally brought into contact with such\n              condition while traveling with reasonable care\n              upon the highway, is subject to liability for\n              physical harm thereby caused to persons who\n              (a) are traveling on the highway, or (b)\n              foreseeably deviate from it in the ordinary\n              course of travel.\n\n              Before proceeding to the duty analysis, we pause to\n\naddress some tangential issues.      Here, all parties agree that the\n\nartificial condition that posed the risk of harm is not the pole\n\nalone but the location of the pole on the road-side of the\n\nguardrail.       And although Boston Edison did not \"create\" this\n\n\n\n731 A.2d 931 (Md. 1999) -- which identified a number of factors a\ncourt may consider when conducting the duty analysis in cases where\na utility pole has been struck -- is controlling. The parties are\nmistaken. Although the Supreme Judicial Court referenced Coates in\nthe Afarian decision, it made clear that Coates is merely\nillustrative of one approach courts have taken when examining cases\nthat arise in this context.     Afarian, 866 N.E.2d at 906.     The\nSupreme Judicial Court explicitly adopted the approach articulated\nin ยง 368 of the Restatement rather than the Coates approach. Id.\nat 908.\n7\n  Although ยง 368 speaks to potential duties owed by the \"owners or\noccupiers\" of the bordering land, the Supreme Judicial Court\nestablished in Afarian that duties may be owed by utility companies\nthat maintain poles on the bordering land. 866 N.E.2d at 908.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fcondition insofar as the guardrail was installed by an unknown\n\nthird party, the argument runs that it permitted the condition to\n\nremain on the bordering land.\n\n          With that brush cleared we are presented with two central\n\ninquiries:   whether a reasonable jury could find (1) that Boston\n\nEdison realized or should have realized that the pole's location\n\nposed an unreasonable risk of harm to the traveling public and (2)\n\nthat Brown foreseeably deviated from the highway.      The parties\n\ntrain much of their fire on the latter question, realizing that in\n\norder for Brown to be included in the class of plaintiffs covered\n\nby ยง 368, he must have foreseeably deviated from the highway.   See\n\nAfarian, 866 N.E.2d at 908 (not reaching the question of whether\n\nutility company realized or should have realized pole placement\n\ncreated an unreasonable risk of harm because drunk driver did not\n\nforeseeably deviate from highway); see also Miller v. Highway\n\nComm'r, 801 N.E.2d 599, 606 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004) (\"For a duty to\n\narise under section 368, the person to whom the duty is owed must\n\nforeseeably deviate from the roadway in the ordinary course of\n\ntravel . . . .\").   But both inquiries must be answered, and we\n\nfocus our attention on the equally dispositive former question --\n\nwhether Boston Edison realized or should have realized that the\n\nlocation of the pole on the road-side of the guardrail posed an\n\nunreasonable risk of harm to the traveling public.     This is, at\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fbottom, also a question of foreseeability, albeit not the same\n\nquestion as is posed by the second inquiry.\n\n          Nothing   in   the   record   suggests   that   Boston   Edison\n\nactually realized that the pole posed an unreasonable risk because\n\nof its location in relation to the guardrail.         Prior to Brown's\n\naccident, the guardrail had never channeled anyone into the pole,\n\nand in fact, the pole had never been struck.       And Brown failed to\n\nproduce evidence that the dangerous condition had been brought to\n\nBoston Edison's attention.\n\n          Thus, the question becomes whether Boston Edison should\n\nhave realized that the pole's location posed an unreasonable risk\n\nto the traveling public.       After examining the record, we must\n\nanswer this question in the negative.\n\n          No reasonable jury could conclude that Boston Edison\n\nshould have realized, when it originally placed or replaced Pole\n\n16, that the pole's location in relation to the guardrail posed an\n\nunreasonable risk to the traveling public.     The reason is obvious.\n\nThe guardrail did not exist until approximately 1990, and Boston\n\nEdison had most recently replaced the pole in 1964, twenty-six\n\nyears prior.\n\n          Brown wisely eschews any argument to the contrary and\n\ninstead suggests that Boston Edison should have realized that the\n\nguardrail/pole combination posed an unreasonable risk because, in\n\nthe eight years preceding Brown's accident in 2002, twenty-eight\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fmotor vehicle accidents occurred in the vicinity of the pole.

As for Boston Edison, the court concluded that it owed no duty to Brown because Brown's accident was not reasonably foreseeable. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> Brown appeals the district court's rulings.<sup>[2]</sup> We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Facts</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We provide most of the facts here, reserving some for our discussion of the appellate claims. Because we are reviewing the district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants, we present these facts in the light most favorable to Brown. <i>See </i><i>Rodi v. S. New Eng. Sch. of Law,</i> 532 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Pole</h2>\n<p>In 1916, the Town of Bedford granted Boston Edison the right to install a pole line along Hartwell Road. Among the poles installed was Pole 16/37 (\"Pole 16\" or \"pole\") ย the pole at issue. Boston Edison placed Pole 16 thirteen inches off of a curved portion of Hartwell Road. As the years passed, Boston Edison replaced Pole 16, which was made of wood, on a periodic basis. Specifically, Boston Edison replaced the pole in 1929, 1954 and 1964. So far as is known, however, the position of the pole never changed. In approximately 1990, an unknown third party placed a guardrail along Hartwell Road. Standing between the road and the guardrail was Pole 16.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Accident</h2>\n<p>At the time of the accident Brown was an Air Force Lieutenant stationed at Hanscom Air Force base. The base is located on land bordering Hartwell Road that is owned by the United States. The accident occurred as Brown was traveling to Hanscom on his motorcycle via Hartwell Road. Brown, proceeding at a speed of approximately twenty-five miles per hour, hit a depression in the road, which caused him to lose control of his motorcycle. Leaping from the motorcycle, Brown chose the guardrail as an aim point for his body. The guardrail, however, channeled Brown headfirst into Pole 16. Although there was no evidence that the pole had ever been struck prior to Brown's accident, Bedford Town police logs revealed that, in the eight years preceding Brown's accident, twenty-eight accidents had occurred in the vicinity of the pole.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review a court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Bogan v. City of Boston,</i> 489 F.3d 417, 424 (1st Cir.2007). In this case, Massachusetts law applies to both of Brown's claims. <i>See </i><i>Magarian v. Hawkins,</i> 321 F.3d 235, 238 n. 4 (1st Cir. 2003); <i>Soto v. United States,</i> 11 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>To prevail in a negligence action under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care; (2) the defendant breached this duty; (3) damage to the plaintiff resulted; and (4) the breach of the duty caused this damage. <i>Jupin v. Kask,</i> 447 Mass. 141, 849 N.E.2d 829, 835 (2006). Typically, whether a plaintiff has satisfied the last three elements is for a jury to decide. <i>Id.</i> Whether the defendant owes any duty in the first place, however, is a question of law and, therefore, grist for the summary judgment mill. <i>Afarian v. Mass. Elec. Co.,</i> 449 Mass. 257, 866 N.E.2d 901, 905 (2007) (\"The existence of a legal duty is a question of law appropriate for resolution by summary judgment.\"). Central to Brown's claims against the United States and Boston Edison is the question of whether either party owed him a duty of care.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Generally, a duty of care exists under Massachusetts law where the resulting harm was \"reasonably foreseeable.\" <i>Jupin,</i> 849 N.E.2d at 835. More specifically, where an actor is able to foresee that his conduct could cause harm to others, he is charged with a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid this harm. <i>Id.</i> (\"To the extent that a legal standard does exist for determining the existence of a tort duty ..., it is a test of the `reasonable foreseeability' of the harm.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.,</i> 25 Mass.App.Ct. 901, 514 N.E.2d 100, 102 (1987) (\"There is no duty owed when the risk which results in the plaintiff's injury is not one which could be reasonably anticipated by the defendant.\").<sup>[3]</sup> With this general terrain mapped, we turn first to Brown's claim against the United States.</p>\n<p>Brown's negligence claim against the United States is premised on his contention that the United States owned and controlled Hartwell Road ย the road off of which he was injured. Control is the key as, under Massachusetts law, \"it is elementary that liability for damage caused by the condition of premises commonly depends upon control of the offending instrumentality, either through ownership or otherwise.\" <i>Underhill v. Shactman,</i> 337 Mass. 730, 151 N.E.2d 287, 290 (1958) (citation omitted); <i>see also McIntyre v. Boston Redevelopment Auth.,</i> 33 Mass.App.Ct. 901, 595 N.E.2d 334, 336 (1992)(\"[T]he critical test is who had the right to control the property.\").</p>\n<p>Despite Brown's contention to the contrary, the record evidence overwhelmingly supports the district court's conclusion that the Town of Bedford, and not the United States, controlled Hartwell Road either through ownership or otherwise. Several pieces of evidence stand out.</p>\n<p>First, a sworn declaration and a deed both indicate that the Town of Bedford actually owned Hartwell Road. The United States' title expert, after examining a multitude of records including those of the Bedford Town Clerk, testified that the Town of Bedford took title to Hartwell Road in 1734-35. A 1952 deed from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, while granting the United States fee ownership of the land surrounding Hartwell Road, explicitly excluded \"all public or private roads, right[s] of way and/or easements now existing within the said boundaries ....\"<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition, the sworn deposition testimony of four witnesses leads to the conclusion that the Town of Bedford controlled Hartwell Road. A witness responsible for maintaining the grounds and roads at Hanscom for decades testified that the Town of Bedford has always maintained Hartwell Road and that the employees at Hanscom had never maintained or done anything to the road. An eighteen-year employee of the Town's Department of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Public Works testified that the Town maintains Hartwell Road and is responsible for law enforcement on the road. With respect to the Town's maintenance of the road, this witness noted that the Town sweeps, plows, and paves the road, in addition to painting its street lines and filling its potholes. A previous Bedford Town foreman who had worked in Bedford's Highway and Grounds Division testified similarly regarding the Town's maintenance of Hartwell Road. Finally, the United States' title expert testified that the Town of Bedford installed a sewer line under the road around 1958.</p>\n<p>Finally, the declarations of two government employees support the United States' position. A civilian employee of the United States Air Force, responsible for overseeing the real property for the Air Force facilities at Hanscom Air Force base, testified that \"no agency of the federal government owns or has owned or maintained Hartwell Road and its shoulders.\" A civilian employee of the United States Navy, responsible for managing the Navy's portion of the Hanscom land, testified that the road was used as a public road and that the Navy \"did no maintenance, construction, planning, public safety, or law enforcement work with regard to the road.\"</p>\n<p>Faced with this substantial evidence, Brown nevertheless argues that two other pieces of evidence turn the issue of control into a question for the jury. After closer examination of this evidence, we disagree.</p>\n<p>Brown offers the affidavit of a licensed attorney, who opined that the Town of Bedford has merely an easement interest in Hartwell Road and that the United States is the fee owner of the road. Even if this testimony were enough to put the ownership of Hartwell Road into question, the distinction made in the affidavit is immaterial. As detailed above, the record evidence makes manifest that the Town of Bedford exercised control over Hartwell Road in every conceivable sense.</p>\n<p>Brown also offers the deposition of Arthur Hayes, an Air Force specialist in cartography and real estate. Hayes testified that the Navy owns the land upon which Pole 16 stands. This testimony, however, does not create a question of material fact for two reasons. First, Hayes's testimony as to ownership suffers from an inherent flaw. It is based primarily on the 1952 deed that transferred ownership of the Hanscom land from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the United States. As detailed above, this deed explicitly excluded \"all public or private roads, right of way and/or easements now existing.\" Second, and again, even if a material fact existed as to the ownership of Hartwell Road, the record evidence plainly shows that the Town of Bedford controlled Hartwell Road. <i>See McIntyre,</i> 595 N.E.2d at 336.</p>\n<p>As we have noted, in order to forestall summary judgment, the record evidence must be \"`sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational fact finder to resolve the [liability] issue in favor of either side.'\" <i>Ramirez-Carlo v. United States,</i> 496 F.3d 41, 46 (1st Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Here, given the significant evidence indicating that the Town of Bedford, and not the United States, controlled Hartwell Road, we conclude that the district court appropriately granted summary judgment to the United States.</p>\n<p>We turn to Brown's claim against Boston Edison. Unlike the United States, Boston Edison concedes owning part of the allegedly dangerous condition, <i>viz.,</i> Pole 16.<sup>[5]</sup> We thus return to the governing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> principles of Massachusetts negligence law. In cases where the liability of a utility company for harm caused by one of its utility poles is at issue, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has taken a more focused approach to the duty analysis. In such cases, the duty analysis is directed by ยง 368 of the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts. Afarian,</i> 866 N.E.2d at 907 (concluding that the principles expressed in ยง 368 \"provide a functional framework for determining the issue of duty\"); <i>id.</i> at 908 (\"We adopt the approach set forth in ยง 368 of the Restatement because it comports with concepts of reasonable foreseeability....\").<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Section 368, titled \"Conditions Dangerous to Travelers on Adjacent Highway,\" deals specifically with liability for harm caused by artificial conditions on land bordering highways.<sup>[7]</sup> Section 368 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>A possessor of land who creates or permits to remain thereon an ... artificial condition so near an existing highway that he realizes or should realize [the artificial condition] involves an unreasonable risk to others accidentally brought into contact with such condition while traveling with reasonable care upon the highway, is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to persons who (a) are traveling on the highway, or (b) foreseeably deviate from it in the ordinary course of travel.</blockquote>\n<p>Before proceeding to the duty analysis, we pause to address some tangential issues. Here, all parties agree that the artificial condition that posed the risk of harm is not the pole alone but the location of the pole on the road-side of the guardrail. And although Boston Edison did not \"create\" this condition insofar as the guardrail was installed by an unknown third party, the argument runs that it permitted the condition to remain on the bordering land.</p>\n<p>With that brush cleared we are presented with two central inquiries: whether a reasonable jury could find (1) that Boston Edison realized or should have realized that the pole's location posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the traveling public <i>and</i> (2) that Brown foreseeably deviated from the highway. The parties train much of their fire on the latter question, realizing that in order for Brown to be included in the class of plaintiffs covered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> by ยง 368, he must have foreseeably deviated from the highway. <i>See Afarian,</i> 866 N.E.2d at 908 (not reaching the question of whether utility company realized or should have realized pole placement created an unreasonable risk of harm because drunk driver did not foreseeably deviate from highway); <i>see also </i><i>Miller v. Highway Comm'r,</i> 344 Ill.App.3d 1157, 279 Ill.Dec. 925, 801 N.E.2d 599, 606 (2004) (\"For a duty to arise under section 368, the person to whom the duty is owed must foreseeably deviate from the roadway in the ordinary course of travel....\"). But both inquiries must be answered, and we focus our attention on the equally dispositive former question ย whether Boston Edison realized or should have realized that the location of the pole on the road-side of the guardrail posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the traveling public. This is, at bottom, also a question of foreseeability, albeit not the same question as is posed by the second inquiry.</p>\n<p>Nothing in the record suggests that Boston Edison actually realized that the pole posed an unreasonable risk because of its location in relation to the guardrail. Prior to Brown's accident, the guardrail had never channeled anyone into the pole, and in fact, the pole had never been struck. And Brown failed to produce evidence that the dangerous condition had been brought to Boston Edison's attention.</p>\n<p>Thus, the question becomes whether Boston Edison should have realized that the pole's location posed an unreasonable risk to the traveling public. After examining the record, we must answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p>No reasonable jury could conclude that Boston Edison should have realized, when it originally placed or replaced Pole 16, that the pole's location in relation to the guardrail posed an unreasonable risk to the traveling public. The reason is obvious. The guardrail did not exist until approximately 1990, and Boston Edison had most recently replaced the pole in 1964, twenty-six years prior.</p>\n<p>Brown wisely eschews any argument to the contrary and instead suggests that Boston Edison should have realized that the guardrail/pole combination posed an unreasonable risk because, in the eight years preceding Brown's accident in 2002, twenty-eight motor vehicle accidents occurred in the vicinity of the pole. To support this point, he submitted police logs to the district court which catalogued these accidents. We are not persuaded, however, that these police logs create a triable issue for the jury.</p>\n<p>Even if we were to assume that Massachusetts law would impose a duty on utility companies to survey the location of its poles if made aware that accidents occurred in the vicinity of the poles, and we doubt it would, nothing in the record indicates that Boston Edison <i>was</i> presented with information or otherwise made aware that accidents were occurring in the vicinity of Pole 16. Therefore, for Brown's argument to succeed, we must assume that Massachusetts law would impose an additional duty on utility companies ย the duty to independently seek out information about accidents occurring near its poles. We read nothing in Massachusetts law that counsels the imposition of such a duty. <i>See Afarian,</i> 866 N.E.2d at 908 (\"In view of our society's dependence on the services supplied by utility companies, and the public benefit of receiving those services, public policy favors some limitation on the liability of utility companies.\") (citations omitted).<sup>[8]</sup> Having concluded as we do, there is no need to reach the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> court's alternative holding ย that Brown's claim against Boston Edison is barred by Massachusetts' statute of repose, MASS. GEN. LAWS ch. 260, ยง 2B.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED</i>.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court had jurisdiction over Brown's claims as follows. Brown's claim against the United States was brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b). Brown's claim against Boston Edison was based on diversity of citizenship ย Brown is a citizen of the State of New Jersey and Boston Edison is a New York corporation with a principal place of business in Massachusetts. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332. The claim against Boston Edison involved an amount in controversy exceeding $75,000. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  The district court alternatively held that Brown's claim against Boston Edison was barred by Massachusetts' statute of repose, MASS. GEN. LAWS ch. 260, ยง 2B.</p>\n<p>[3]  Massachusetts courts have also defined duty in more abstract terms. <i>See </i><i>Luoni v. Berube,</i> 431 Mass. 729, 729 N.E.2d 1108, 1113 (2000) (\"The concept of `duty' ... `is not sacrosanct in itself, but is only an expression of the sum total of ... considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection .... No better general statement can be made than that the courts will find a duty where, in general, reasonable persons would recognize it and agree that it exists.'\") (citation omitted); <i>Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll.,</i> 389 Mass. 47, 449 N.E.2d 331, 335 (1983) (\"[A] duty finds its `source in existing social values and customs.'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>[4]  The land transferred in the 1952 deed was later divided into two separate portions in 1977, with the Navy taking \"Parcel B,\" the portion closest to the accident site. The Air Force retained the other parcel.</p>\n<p>[5]  We noted earlier that the general rule is that \"liability . . . commonly depends upon <i>control</i> of the offending instrumentality, either through ownership or otherwise.\" <i>See </i><i>Underhill,</i> 151 N.E.2d at 290 (emphasis added). As we discuss <i>infra,</i> however, where the liability of a utility company for harm caused by one of its utility poles is at issue, Massachusetts law, following ยง 368 of the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts,</i> focuses on \"possession.\" Any potential dissonance between these standards is of no consequence here. Boston Edison concedes that it owns the pole and that it is responsible for the pole's maintenance. The company does not put its \"control\" of the pole into question, nor does it controvert \"possession\" for purposes of analysis under ยง 368.</p>\n<p>[6]  The parties appear to be under the impression that the Maryland Court of Appeals' decision in <i>Coates v. S. Md. Elec. Coop., Inc.,</i> 354 Md. 499, 731 A.2d 931 (1999) ย which identified a number of factors a court may consider when conducting the duty analysis in cases where a utility pole has been struck ย is controlling. The parties are mistaken. Although the Supreme Judicial Court referenced <i>Coates</i> in the <i>Afarian</i> decision, it made clear that <i>Coates</i> is merely illustrative of one approach courts have taken when examining cases that arise in this context. <i>Afarian,</i> 866 N.E.2d at 906. The Supreme Judicial Court explicitly adopted the approach articulated in ยง 368 of the Restatement rather than the <i>Coates</i> approach. <i>Id.</i> at 908.</p>\n<p>[7]  Although ยง 368 speaks to potential duties owed by the \"owners or occupiers\" of the bordering land, the Supreme Judicial Court established in <i>Afarian</i> that duties may be owed by utility companies that maintain poles on the bordering land. 866 N.E.2d at 908.</p>\n<p>[8]  We note that Brown does not argue that Boston Edison was under a continuing duty to inspect the location of all of its utility poles in order to determine whether changing road conditions had made the poles a risk to travelers.\n</p>\n<p>Declining to advance such an argument was wise. We are aware of no judicial decision imposing such a vast precautionary duty on utility companies and the few courts that have directly considered whether such a duty exists have concluded that it does not. <i>See </i><i>Coates,</i> 731 A.2d at 945 (concluding that a utility company is \"under no tort duty to make any massive engineering inspection of all of [its] poles . . . existing along the streets and roads of the State\"); <i>Miller,</i> 279 Ill.Dec. 925, 801 N.E.2d at 609-10 (declining to impose on the utility company a duty that would require the company to \"continuously monitor changes in road and other relevant conditions to determine whether a particular utility pole had been placed in a dangerous location\").</p>\n<p>[9]  As a postscript, we note that Brown argues that the district court erred when it refused to consider the Massachusetts Highway Design Manual, which Brown attached to his opposition to summary judgment motion. Brown attached the manual for the purpose of establishing that guardrails are used to prevent a vehicle from leaving the roadway and striking a fixed object more objectionable than the guardrail itself. The district court declined to consider the manual, concluding that Brown made no showing that the manual was applicable to the guardrail installed on Hartwell Road or that it was in effect when the guardrail was installed. Whether or not the district court erred when it refused to consider the manual, however, is of no consequence in light of our duty analysis above.</p>\n\n</div>",

Sch. of Law,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203357\"><a href=\"/opinion/203357/rodi-v-southern-new-england-school-of-law/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Pole</h2>\n<p>In 1916, the Town of Bedford granted Boston Edison the right to install a pole line along Hartwell Road. Among the poles installed was Pole 16/37 (\"Pole 16\" or \"pole\") ย the pole at issue. Boston Edison placed Pole 16 thirteen inches off of a curved portion of Hartwell Road. As the years passed, Boston Edison replaced Pole 16, which was made of wood, on a periodic basis. Specifically, Boston Edison replaced the pole in 1929, 1954 and 1964. So far as is known, however, the position of the pole never changed. In approximately 1990, an unknown third party placed a guardrail along Hartwell Road. Standing between the road and the guardrail was Pole 16.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Accident</h2>\n<p>At the time of the accident Brown was an Air Force Lieutenant stationed at Hanscom Air Force base. The base is located on land bordering Hartwell Road that is owned by the United States. The accident occurred as Brown was traveling to Hanscom on his motorcycle via Hartwell Road. Brown, proceeding at a speed of approximately twenty-five miles per hour, hit a depression in the road, which caused him to lose control of his motorcycle. Leaping from the motorcycle, Brown chose the guardrail as an aim point for his body. The guardrail, however, channeled Brown headfirst into Pole 16. Although there was no evidence that the pole had ever been struck prior to Brown's accident, Bedford Town police logs revealed that, in the eight years preceding Brown's accident, twenty-eight accidents had occurred in the vicinity of the pole.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review a court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Bogan v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202789\"><a href=\"/opinion/202789/bogan-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 424 (1st Cir.2007). In this case, Massachusetts law applies to both of Brown's claims. <i>See </i><i>Magarian v. Hawkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200362\"><a href=\"/opinion/200362/magarian-v-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, 238 n. 4 (1st Cir. 2003); <i>Soto v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658375\"><a href=\"/opinion/658375/elvin-h-soto-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p>To prevail in a negligence action under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care; (2) the defendant breached this duty; (3) damage to the plaintiff resulted; and (4) the breach of the duty caused this damage. <i>Jupin v. Kask,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">849</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></span>, 835 (2006). Typically, whether a plaintiff has satisfied the last three elements is for a jury to decide. <i>Id.</i> Whether the defendant owes any duty in the first place, however, is a question of law and, therefore, grist for the summary judgment mill. <i>Afarian v. Mass. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">866</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">901</span></span>, 905 (2007) (\"The existence of a legal duty is a question of law appropriate for resolution by summary judgment.\"). Central to Brown's claims against the United States and Boston Edison is the question of whether either party owed him a duty of care.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Generally, a duty of care exists under Massachusetts law where the resulting harm was \"reasonably foreseeable.\" <i>Jupin,</i> 849 N.E.2d at 835. More specifically, where an actor is able to foresee that his conduct could cause harm to others, he is charged with a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid this harm. <i>Id.</i> (\"To the extent that a legal standard does exist for determining the existence of a tort duty ..., it is a test of the `reasonable foreseeability' of the harm.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Glick v. Prince Italian Foods of Saugus, Inc.,</i> 25 Mass.App.Ct. 901, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></span>, 102 (1987) (\"There is no duty owed when the risk which results in the plaintiff's injury is not one which could be reasonably anticipated by the defendant.\").<sup>[3]</sup> With this general terrain mapped, we turn first to Brown's claim against the United States.</p>\n<p>Brown's negligence claim against the United States is premised on his contention that the United States owned and controlled Hartwell Road ย the road off of which he was injured. Control is the key as, under Massachusetts law, \"it is elementary that liability for damage caused by the condition of premises commonly depends upon control of the offending instrumentality, either through ownership or otherwise.\" <i>Underhill v. Shactman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2151976\"><a href=\"/opinion/2151976/underhill-v-shactman/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2151976\"><a href=\"/opinion/2151976/underhill-v-shactman/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span>, 290 (1958) (citation omitted); <i>see also McIntyre v. Boston Redevelopment Auth.,</i> 33 Mass.App.Ct. 901, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></span>, 336 (1992)(\"[T]he critical test is who had the right to control the property.\").</p>\n<p>Despite Brown's contention to the contrary, the record evidence overwhelmingly supports the district court's conclusion that the Town of Bedford, and not the United States, controlled Hartwell Road either through ownership or otherwise. Several pieces of evidence stand out.</p>\n<p>First, a sworn declaration and a deed both indicate that the Town of Bedford actually owned Hartwell Road. The United States' title expert, after examining a multitude of records including those of the Bedford Town Clerk, testified that the Town of Bedford took title to Hartwell Road in 1734-35. A 1952 deed from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, while granting the United States fee ownership of the land surrounding Hartwell Road, explicitly excluded \"all public or private roads, right[s] of way and/or easements now existing within the said boundaries ....\"<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition, the sworn deposition testimony of four witnesses leads to the conclusion that the Town of Bedford controlled Hartwell Road. A witness responsible for maintaining the grounds and roads at Hanscom for decades testified that the Town of Bedford has always maintained Hartwell Road and that the employees at Hanscom had never maintained or done anything to the road. An eighteen-year employee of the Town's Department of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Public Works testified that the Town maintains Hartwell Road and is responsible for law enforcement on the road. With respect to the Town's maintenance of the road, this witness noted that the Town sweeps, plows, and paves the road, in addition to painting its street lines and filling its potholes. A previous Bedford Town foreman who had worked in Bedford's Highway and Grounds Division testified similarly regarding the Town's maintenance of Hartwell Road. Finally, the United States' title expert testified that the Town of Bedford installed a sewer line under the road around 1958.</p>\n<p>Finally, the declarations of two government employees support the United States' position. A civilian employee of the United States Air Force, responsible for overseeing the real property for the Air Force facilities at Hanscom Air Force base, testified that \"no agency of the federal government owns or has owned or maintained Hartwell Road and its shoulders.\" A civilian employee of the United States Navy, responsible for managing the Navy's portion of the Hanscom land, testified that the road was used as a public road and that the Navy \"did no maintenance, construction, planning, public safety, or law enforcement work with regard to the road.\"</p>\n<p>Faced with this substantial evidence, Brown nevertheless argues that two other pieces of evidence turn the issue of control into a question for the jury. After closer examination of this evidence, we disagree.</p>\n<p>Brown offers the affidavit of a licensed attorney, who opined that the Town of Bedford has merely an easement interest in Hartwell Road and that the United States is the fee owner of the road. Even if this testimony were enough to put the ownership of Hartwell Road into question, the distinction made in the affidavit is immaterial. As detailed above, the record evidence makes manifest that the Town of Bedford exercised control over Hartwell Road in every conceivable sense.</p>\n<p>Brown also offers the deposition of Arthur Hayes, an Air Force specialist in cartography and real estate. Hayes testified that the Navy owns the land upon which Pole 16 stands. This testimony, however, does not create a question of material fact for two reasons. First, Hayes's testimony as to ownership suffers from an inherent flaw. It is based primarily on the 1952 deed that transferred ownership of the Hanscom land from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the United States. As detailed above, this deed explicitly excluded \"all public or private roads, right of way and/or easements now existing.\" Second, and again, even if a material fact existed as to the ownership of Hartwell Road, the record evidence plainly shows that the Town of Bedford controlled Hartwell Road. <i>See McIntyre,</i> 595 N.E.2d at 336.</p>\n<p>As we have noted, in order to forestall summary judgment, the record evidence must be \"`sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational fact finder to resolve the [liability] issue in favor of either side.'\" <i>Ramirez-Carlo v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1453438\"><a href=\"/opinion/1453438/ramirez-carlo-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Here, given the significant evidence indicating that the Town of Bedford, and not the United States, controlled Hartwell Road, we conclude that the district court appropriately granted summary judgment to the United States.</p>\n<p>We turn to Brown's claim against Boston Edison. Unlike the United States, Boston Edison concedes owning part of the allegedly dangerous condition, <i>viz.,</i> Pole 16.<sup>[5]</sup> We thus return to the governing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> principles of Massachusetts negligence law. In cases where the liability of a utility company for harm caused by one of its utility poles is at issue, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has taken a more focused approach to the duty analysis. In such cases, the duty analysis is directed by ยง 368 of the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts. Afarian,</i> 866 N.E.2d at 907 (concluding that the principles expressed in ยง 368 \"provide a functional framework for determining the issue of duty\"); <i>id.</i> at 908 (\"We adopt the approach set forth in ยง 368 of the Restatement because it comports with concepts of reasonable foreseeability....\").<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Section 368, titled \"Conditions Dangerous to Travelers on Adjacent Highway,\" deals specifically with liability for harm caused by artificial conditions on land bordering highways.<sup>[7]</sup> Section 368 provides:</p>\n<blockquote>A possessor of land who creates or permits to remain thereon an ... artificial condition so near an existing highway that he realizes or should realize [the artificial condition] involves an unreasonable risk to others accidentally brought into contact with such condition while traveling with reasonable care upon the highway, is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to persons who (a) are traveling on the highway, or (b) foreseeably deviate from it in the ordinary course of travel.</blockquote>\n<p>Before proceeding to the duty analysis, we pause to address some tangential issues. Here, all parties agree that the artificial condition that posed the risk of harm is not the pole alone but the location of the pole on the road-side of the guardrail. And although Boston Edison did not \"create\" this condition insofar as the guardrail was installed by an unknown third party, the argument runs that it permitted the condition to remain on the bordering land.</p>\n<p>With that brush cleared we are presented with two central inquiries: whether a reasonable jury could find (1) that Boston Edison realized or should have realized that the pole's location posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the traveling public <i>and</i> (2) that Brown foreseeably deviated from the highway. The parties train much of their fire on the latter question, realizing that in order for Brown to be included in the class of plaintiffs covered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> by ยง 368, he must have foreseeably deviated from the highway. <i>See Afarian,</i> 866 N.E.2d at 908 (not reaching the question of whether utility company realized or should have realized pole placement created an unreasonable risk of harm because drunk driver did not foreseeably deviate from highway); <i>see also </i><i>Miller v. Highway Comm'r,</i> 344 Ill.App.3d 1157, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></span>, 606 (2004) (\"For a duty to arise under section 368, the person to whom the duty is owed must foreseeably deviate from the roadway in the ordinary course of travel....\"). But both inquiries must be answered, and we focus our attention on the equally dispositive former question ย whether Boston Edison realized or should have realized that the location of the pole on the road-side of the guardrail posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the traveling public. This is, at bottom, also a question of foreseeability, albeit not the same question as is posed by the second inquiry.</p>\n<p>Nothing in the record suggests that Boston Edison actually realized that the pole posed an unreasonable risk because of its location in relation to the guardrail. Prior to Brown's accident, the guardrail had never channeled anyone into the pole, and in fact, the pole had never been struck. And Brown failed to produce evidence that the dangerous condition had been brought to Boston Edison's attention.</p>\n<p>Thus, the question becomes whether Boston Edison should have realized that the pole's location posed an unreasonable risk to the traveling public. After examining the record, we must answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p>No reasonable jury could conclude that Boston Edison should have realized, when it originally placed or replaced Pole 16, that the pole's location in relation to the guardrail posed an unreasonable risk to the traveling public. The reason is obvious. The guardrail did not exist until approximately 1990, and Boston Edison had most recently replaced the pole in 1964, twenty-six years prior.</p>\n<p>Brown wisely eschews any argument to the contrary and instead suggests that Boston Edison should have realized that the guardrail/pole combination posed an unreasonable risk because, in the eight years preceding Brown's accident in 2002, twenty-eight motor vehicle accidents occurred in the vicinity of the pole. To support this point, he submitted police logs to the district court which catalogued these accidents. We are not persuaded, however, that these police logs create a triable issue for the jury.</p>\n<p>Even if we were to assume that Massachusetts law would impose a duty on utility companies to survey the location of its poles if made aware that accidents occurred in the vicinity of the poles, and we doubt it would, nothing in the record indicates that Boston Edison <i>was</i> presented with information or otherwise made aware that accidents were occurring in the vicinity of Pole 16. Therefore, for Brown's argument to succeed, we must assume that Massachusetts law would impose an additional duty on utility companies ย the duty to independently seek out information about accidents occurring near its poles. We read nothing in Massachusetts law that counsels the imposition of such a duty. <i>See Afarian,</i> 866 N.E.2d at 908 (\"In view of our society's dependence on the services supplied by utility companies, and the public benefit of receiving those services, public policy favors some limitation on the liability of utility companies.\") (citations omitted).<sup>[8]</sup> Having concluded as we do, there is no need to reach the district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> court's alternative holding ย that Brown's claim against Boston Edison is barred by Massachusetts' statute of repose, MASS. GEN. LAWS ch. 260, ยง 2B.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the reasons provided above, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED</i>.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The district court had jurisdiction over Brown's claims as follows. Brown's claim against the United States was brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b). Brown's claim against Boston Edison was based on diversity of citizenship ย Brown is a citizen of the State of New Jersey and Boston Edison is a New York corporation with a principal place of business in Massachusetts. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. ยง 1332. The claim against Boston Edison involved an amount in controversy exceeding $75,000. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  The district court alternatively held that Brown's claim against Boston Edison was barred by Massachusetts' statute of repose, MASS. GEN. LAWS ch. 260, ยง 2B.</p>\n<p>[3]  Massachusetts courts have also defined duty in more abstract terms. <i>See </i><i>Luoni v. Berube,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></span>, 1113 (2000) (\"The concept of `duty' ... `is not sacrosanct in itself, but is only an expression of the sum total of ... considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection .... No better general statement can be made than that the courts will find a duty where, in general, reasonable persons would recognize it and agree that it exists.'\") (citation omitted); <i>Mullins v. Pine Manor Coll.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2200392\"><a href=\"/opinion/2200392/mullins-v-pine-manor-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2200392\"><a href=\"/opinion/2200392/mullins-v-pine-manor-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span>, 335 (1983) (\"[A] duty finds its `source in existing social values and customs.'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>[4]  The land transferred in the 1952 deed was later divided into two separate portions in 1977, with the Navy taking \"Parcel B,\" the portion closest to the accident site. The Air Force retained the other parcel.</p>\n<p>[5]  We noted earlier that the general rule is that \"liability . . . commonly depends upon <i>control</i> of the offending instrumentality, either through ownership or otherwise.\" <i>See </i><i>Underhill,</i> 151 N.E.2d at 290 (emphasis added). As we discuss <i>infra,</i> however, where the liability of a utility company for harm caused by one of its utility poles is at issue, Massachusetts law, following ยง 368 of the <i>Restatement (Second) of Torts,</i> focuses on \"possession.\" Any potential dissonance between these standards is of no consequence here. Boston Edison concedes that it owns the pole and that it is responsible for the pole's maintenance. The company does not put its \"control\" of the pole into question, nor does it controvert \"possession\" for purposes of analysis under ยง 368.</p>\n<p>[6]  The parties appear to be under the impression that the Maryland Court of Appeals' decision in <i>Coates v. S. Md. Elec. Coop., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2299808\"><a href=\"/opinion/2299808/coates-v-southern-md-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2299808\"><a href=\"/opinion/2299808/coates-v-southern-md-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span> (1999) ย which identified a number of factors a court may consider when conducting the duty analysis in cases where a utility pole has been struck ย is controlling. The parties are mistaken. Although the Supreme Judicial Court referenced <i>Coates</i> in the <i>Afarian</i> decision, it made clear that <i>Coates</i> is merely illustrative of one approach courts have taken when examining cases that arise in this context. <i>Afarian,</i> 866 N.E.2d at 906. The Supreme Judicial Court explicitly adopted the approach articulated in ยง 368 of the Restatement rather than the <i>Coates</i> approach. <i>Id.</i> at 908.</p>\n<p>[7]  Although ยง 368 speaks to potential duties owed by the \"owners or occupiers\" of the bordering land, the Supreme Judicial Court established in <i>Afarian</i> that duties may be owed by utility companies that maintain poles on the bordering land. 866 N.E.2d at 908.</p>\n<p>[8]  We note that Brown does not argue that Boston Edison was under a continuing duty to inspect the location of all of its utility poles in order to determine whether changing road conditions had made the poles a risk to travelers.\n</p>\n<p>Declining to advance such an argument was wise. We are aware of no judicial decision imposing such a vast precautionary duty on utility companies and the few courts that have directly considered whether such a duty exists have concluded that it does not. <i>See </i><i>Coates,</i> 731 A.2d at 945 (concluding that a utility company is \"under no tort duty to make any massive engineering inspection of all of [its] poles . . . existing along the streets and roads of the State\"); <i>Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></span>, 801 N.E.2d at 609-10 (declining to impose on the utility company a duty that would require the company to \"continuously monitor changes in road and other relevant conditions to determine whether a particular utility pole had been placed in a dangerous location\").</p>\n<p>[9]  As a postscript, we note that Brown argues that the district court erred when it refused to consider the Massachusetts Highway Design Manual, which Brown attached to his opposition to summary judgment motion. Brown attached the manual for the purpose of establishing that guardrails are used to prevent a vehicle from leaving the roadway and striking a fixed object more objectionable than the guardrail itself. The district court declined to consider the manual, concluding that Brown made no showing that the manual was applicable to the guardrail installed on Hartwell Road or that it was in effect when the guardrail was installed. Whether or not the district court erred when it refused to consider the manual, however, is of no consequence in light of our duty analysis above.</p>\n\n</div>",
