GAGNE AND LINDA JENESKI,\n\n                     Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                v.\n\n               CITY OF WORCESTER; STEPHEN WILLAND,\n\n                      Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. F. Dennis Saylor IV, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                     *\n               Farris and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Daniel Joseph Shea with whom Daniel J. Shea, P.C. was on brief\nfor appellants.\n     Janet J. McGuiggan, Assistant City Solicitor, City of\nWorcester Law Department, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           May 8, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.   This appeal involves the standards\n\nfor pleading with particularity fraud claims brought under two\n\nsubsections of the False Claims Act (\"FCA\") concerned with making\n\nfalse records or statements to get false claims paid and conspiring\n\nto defraud the government by getting false claims paid.       31 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3729(a)(2) and (a)(3).\n\n          Plaintiffs   mistakenly   read   the   Supreme   Court's   2008\n\nopinion in Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders, 128\n\nS. Ct. 2123 (2008), as having altered the requirements of pleading\n\nfraud with particularity set forth in United States ex rel. Rost v.\n\nPfizer, Inc., 507 F.3d 720 (1st Cir. 2007), and United States ex\n\nrel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, 360 F.3d 220 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).   Allison Engine concerns a different issue and does not\n\nalter those fraud with particularity requirements, which apply as\n\nwell to the conspiracy claim. The complaint was properly dismissed\n\nfor failing to meet those standards. The district court also acted\n\nproperly within its discretion in not allowing plaintiffs to amend\n\ntheir complaint yet a third time.\n\n          Edward L. Gagne and Linda Jeneski, a present and a former\n\nemployee of the Worcester City Manager's Office of Employment and\n\nTraining (\"CMOET\"), filed a qui tam action on behalf of the federal\n\ngovernment against the defendant City of Worcester and a former\n\nCity official.   The United States declined to enter the case.\n\nPlaintiffs alleged federal grant funds meant for one purpose were\n\n\n                                -2-\n\ffraudulently diverted to improper expenditures.   They alleged the\n\ndefendants were liable under the FCA for violations of provisions\n\nrequiring defendants to have: \"knowingly present[ed], or cause[d]\n\nto be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States\n\nGovernment . . . a false or fraudulent claim for payment or\n\napproval,\" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1); \"knowingly ma[de], use[d], or\n\ncause[d] to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a\n\nfalse or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\" id.\n\n§ 3729(a)(2); and \"conspire[d] to defraud the Government by getting\n\na false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid,\" id. § 3729(a)(3).\n\nDespite their having twice amended their complaint, relators failed\n\nto provide details on any particular false or fraudulent statement\n\nmade to get a false claim paid by the federal government.\n\n          The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss\n\nfor failure to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and denied relators\n\nleave to amend a third time.   United States ex. rel. Gagne v. City\n\nof Worcester, No. 06-40241, 2008 WL 2510143 (D. Mass. June 20,\n\n2008).    The court later denied a Rule 59(e) motion and said\n\nrelators had mischaracterized its earlier order as resting on a\n\nneed to make a presentment claim under subsections (a)(2) and\n\n(a)(3).   On appeal, relators argue that the court applied the\n\n\"presentment\" requirement of § 3729(a)(1) to their subsection\n\n(a)(2) and (a)(3) claims and that this, along with the court's\n\nreliance on Rost and Karvelas, was error in light of the Supreme\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fCourt's decision in Allison Engine.        They also challenge the\n\ncourt's denial of leave to amend.    We affirm for the reasons which\n\nfollow.\n\n                                I.\n\n          The facts as alleged in the complaint are set forth\n\nwithout crediting unsupported conclusions or assertions. Universal\n\nCommc'n Sys., Inc. v. Lycos, Inc., 478 F.3d 413, 415 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n          Gagne worked for the CMOET; Jeneski was a former CMOET\n\nemployee. Defendant Stephen Willand was the head of CMOET and also\n\nserved as Executive Director of the Central Massachusetts Regional\n\nEmployment Board (\"CMREB\") and the Director of the City's \"One Stop\n\nProvider,\" also known as \"Workforce Central,\" which was established\n\nunder the Workforce Investment Act (\"WIA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2945.\n\n          Under the WIA, the federal government provides grants to\n\nstates to fund job training programs.     See generally id. § 2811;\n\nsee also Santana v. Calderón, 342 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).   One\n\nstop providers, such as Workforce Central, provide training, adult\n\neducation, literacy programs, and support services.       29 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2841, 2864.\n\n          The gist of the relators' complaint is that the City\n\nimproperly used WIA grant funds to pay Willand and other CMOET\n\nemployees for performing very little work or for work unrelated to\n\nWIA projects, to provide City cars to Willand and others, and to\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fpay out $130,000 to settle a state employment discrimination\n\nlawsuit   that   plaintiff   Gagne   had   brought,   alleging   sexual\n\norientation discrimination.    Primarily, the complaint alleged that\n\nCity employees falsely categorized hours on their time sheets as\n\ntime spent on WIA projects.\n\n          Relators filed suit on November 9, 2006 naming the City\n\nas defendant.1    The central allegations of their Second Amended\n\nComplaint, filed on January 4, 2008, were as follows:\n\n          During Workforce Central and CMREB Fiscal Year\n          2004 (FY2004), and before and after FY2004,\n          Defendant City's Agents STEPHEN WILLAND, BRUCE\n          DAHLQUIST, DONALD ANDERSON, KEVIN CROWLEY, and\n          CARLENE BULL, among others, with the full\n          knowledge and acquiescence of Defendant City's\n          upper management statutorily responsible for\n          the integrity of WIA federal funds . . . ,\n          made and caused to be made false, misleading\n          and fraudulent pretenses and representations\n          through periodic reports and requests for\n          funds to the U.S. Department of Labor, U.S.\n          Department of Health and Human Services, and\n          State of Massachusetts based on the allocation\n          of Workforce Central and CMREB employees' time\n          which were not based on after-the-fact actual\n          activities of the employees charged to the\n          various programs, contracts, grants or awards\n          of the [WIA]. . . . In order to accomplish the\n          unlawful funding of WILLAND and DAHLQUIST,\n          capitated funds earned from the welfare\n          activities of Workforce Central were \"loaned\"\n\n\n     1\n          Relators filed a First Amended Complaint without leave of\nthe court on June 18, 2007. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (allowing\none amendment as of right if no responsive pleading has been filed\nbut requiring leave for subsequent amendments). The City moved to\ndismiss. Relators filed an opposition in which they also asked for\nleave to amend. The court granted leave to amend, allowed relators\nto name Willand as an additional defendant, and held the City's\nfirst motion to dismiss moot.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            to various Workforce Central time accounts to\n            which ANDERSON, CROWLEY, BULL, and others\n            would bill their time to free-up Wagner-Peyser2\n            funds so that WILLAND and DAHLQUIST could bill\n            to Wagner-Peyser as specifically prohibited by\n            law. The loans from welfare program earnings\n            were loaned to Department 31S account numbers\n            224, 228 and 231 and were never repaid.\n            Accounts 31S224, 31S228, and 31S231 appear on\n            Anderson and Crowley's time sheets while\n            Wagner-Peyser, which is their legitimate One-\n            Stop overhead, does not. CARLENE BULL is the\n            person   responsible    for   the    accounting\n            manipulation.\n\nSecond Amended Complaint ¶ 30.    Plaintiffs also alleged that:\n\n            Beginning on or before June 28, 2003 and\n            continuing on and after June 25, 2004 . . .\n            [Willand and other City employees] did\n            knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, and\n            agree with each other, and with others known\n            and unknown to the Relators, to commit\n            offenses against the United States, to wit,\n            fraud or misapplication concerning Federal\n            funds under the [WIA], in violation of [18\n            U.S.C. § 665] and fraud or misapplication\n            concerning a program receiving Federal funds\n            in violation of [18 U.S.C. § 666]; and did\n            further so combine, conspire and agree to\n            defraud the United States by impeding,\n            impairing, obstructing and defeating the\n            lawful government functions of the U.S.\n            Department of Labor through deceit, trickery\n            and dishonest means.\n\nId. ¶ 22.\n\n            Other paragraphs of the complaint alleged that defendants\n\nengaged in a conspiracy to defraud the government, by \"caus[ing]\n\nfalse, misleading and fraudulent pretenses and representations to\n\n\n     2\n          The Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. § 49 et seq., enacted in\n1933, was amended by the WIA.     Workforce Central and the CMREB\nreceived funds under both statutes.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fbe made to WIA funding sources . . . to allow [City employees] to\n\nreceive excessive and unreasonable compensation through unlawful,\n\ndishonest and deceitful means by misapplication or obtaining by\n\nfraud of funds from the [WIA].\"        Id. ¶ 23.      The complaint also\n\nalleged defendants violated the WIA because Willand and others\n\nworked for the CMOET while at the same time holding official roles\n\nin Workforce Central and the CMREB.3         Id. ¶¶ 9-10.      Defendants\n\nmoved to dismiss on January 28, 2008, arguing that the Second\n\nAmended   Complaint   still   failed    to   allege    fraud   with   the\n\nparticularity required under Rule 9(b).4\n\n          On June 20, 2008, the district court entered an order\n\ndismissing the Second Amended Complaint, as we have described. The\n\ncourt noted that relators' opposition incorporated by reference\n\ntheir earlier opposition to the first motion to dismiss, in which\n\nthey had sought leave to amend.        The court said it was unclear\n\nwhether relators intended to request leave to amend their complaint\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          In their opposition to the City's motion to dismiss the\nfirst complaint on Rule 9(b) grounds, plaintiffs had attached 119\npages of allegedly fraudulent time sheets. But these time sheets\nwere not attached to the Second Amended Complaint.\n     4\n          Defendants also argued that the court lacked jurisdiction\nunder the public disclosure bar of the FCA, see generally Rost, 507\nF.3d at 727-28; 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(A), and that relators had\nnot served them properly, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 4.       The district\ncourt held it could not determine whether the public disclosure bar\napplied on the record before it and did not reach the Rule 4\nargument. Defendants do not address either ruling on appeal.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fagain, but held that even if they did, it would not allow further\n\namendment.      Gagne, 2008 WL 2510143, at *5 n.5.\n\n            Relators filed a motion to alter or amend judgment\n\npurportedly under Rule 59(e), arguing that the court had committed\n\na manifest error of law by relying on Karvelas, which they said\n\ndealt    only   with   \"presentment\"   cases,   or   cases   brought   under\n\nsubsection (a)(1) of the FCA in which the allegation is that the\n\ndefendant actually presented a false claim to the government.5\n\nThey argued Karvelas did not apply to subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3)\n\ncases. The court denied plaintiffs' motion, stating relators erred\n\nin arguing it based its holding on a presentment requirement, and\n\nsaying it \"ha[d] considered the sufficiency of relators' complaint\n\n\n\n\n     5\n          Relators also argued the court committed a manifest error\nof law by misstating the statutory language in describing their\nclaims. The court said the complaint alleged defendants violated\nthe FCA \"by (1) presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment\nor approval to the federal government in violation of § 3729(a)(1),\n(2) making or using false records or statements to make false or\nfraudulent claims in violation of § 3729(a)(2), and (3) conspiring\nto get false or fraudulent claims paid or approved by the federal\ngovernment in violation of § 3729(a)(3).\" Gagne, 2008 WL 2510143,\nat *1 (emphasis added).       Relators argued that the court's\nsubstitution of \"and\" for the statute's \"or\" conflated the three\nsubsections and led it to extend the presentment requirement of\n(a)(1).\n          Relators also argue the court erroneously summarized the\nelements of each subsection. For example, it substituted \"to make\nfalse or fraudulent claims\" for the statute's \"to get a false or\nfraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government\" in describing\nsubsection (a)(2). While the court did use summary language in\ndescribing relators' claims that did not reflect the exact\nstatutory text, the remainder of its opinion shows this summary did\nnot cause it to analyze the complaint incorrectly.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fwith regard to Rule 9(b) only,\" which it held applies with equal\n\nforce to subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3).           Relators appealed.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.           The Dismissal of Relators' Complaint\n\n             We review de novo the district court's dismissal order\n\nfor failure to comply with Rule 9(b).           See SBT Holdings, LLC v.\n\nTown of Westminster, 547 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             We   have   previously    held    the    heightened   pleading\n\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) apply to claims brought under\n\nsubsection (a)(1) of the FCA, Karvelas, 360 F.3d at 227-28, and\n\nsubsection (a)(2), Rost, 507 F.3d at 731.            We now hold those Rule\n\n9(b) requirements apply to conspiracy claims under subsection\n\n(a)(3).      That is the rule of most circuits.          See, e.g., United\n\nStates ex rel. Marlar v. BWXT Y-12, L.L.C., 525 F.3d 439, 445 (6th\n\nCir. 2008); United States ex rel. Joshi v. St. Luke's Hosp., Inc.,\n\n441 F.3d 552, 556 (8th Cir. 2006); Corsello v. Lincare, Inc., 428\n\nF.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam); see also 2 J.T.\n\nBoese, Civil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions § 5.04, at 5-44 to\n\n-45 (3d ed. 2009).\n\n             Rule 9(b) requires that \"[i]n alleging fraud or mistake,\n\na    party    must   state   with     particularity     the   circumstances\n\nconstituting fraud or mistake.\"             This standard \"means that a\n\ncomplaint must specify 'the time, place, and content of an alleged\n\nfalse representation.'\"      Rost, 507 F.3d at 731 (quoting Doyle v.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fHasbro,    Inc.,   103   F.3d   186,    194   (1st    Cir.   1996));   see    also\n\nAlternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsis, Inc., 374 F.3d 23, 29\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (noting that Rule 9(b) requires the pleader \"to\n\nspecify the who, what, where, and when of the allegedly false or\n\nfraudulent representation\"). \"Conclusory allegations . . . are not\n\nsufficient\" to satisfy Rule 9(b).          Rost, 507 F.3d at 731.      The rule\n\nmay be satisfied, however, \"where, although some questions remain\n\nunanswered, the complaint as a whole is sufficiently particular to\n\npass muster under the FCA.\"            Id. at 732; see also Karvelas, 360\n\nF.3d at 233 n.17 (\"In a related context, we held that courts will\n\nallow private securities fraud cases 'to advance past the pleadings\n\nstage when some questions remain unanswered, provided the complaint\n\nas a whole is sufficiently particular to pass muster under the\n\n[Private    Securities    Litigation      Reform     Act].'\"   (quoting      In   re\n\nCabletron Sys., Inc., 311 F.3d 11, 32 (1st Cir. 2002))).\n\n            The essence of relators' argument is that they have pled\n\nfacts sufficient to meet the Rule 9(b) standards under (a)(2) and\n\n(a)(3), if not as to the \"presentment\" of a false claim to the\n\nfederal government.6       They say under Allison Engine they do not\n\nneed to plead presentment as to their (a)(2) and (a)(3) claims.\n\nThat is true as far as it goes, but irrelevant.              The district court\n\ndid not impose a presentment requirement; rather, it correctly held\n\n\n\n     6\n          Relators make no arguments specific to their (a)(1) claim\nand have therefore waived that argument on appeal.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fthat the allegations made did not otherwise meet the fraud pleading\n\nrequirements for the elements of claims under subsections (a)(2)\n\nand (a)(3).\n\n            In Allison Engine, an FCA qui tam action, the Supreme\n\nCourt clarified, unanimously, the pleading requirements for the\n\nelements of claims brought under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) of\n\nthe FCA.    It reversed an opinion of the Sixth Circuit which held\n\nthat the relators did not need to show that the defendant intended\n\nthat the false claim be paid by the government, only that it be\n\npaid by a private entity using government funds.      Allison Engine,\n\n128 S. Ct. at 2126-28.\n\n            The Supreme Court held that claims under subsections\n\n(a)(2) and (a)(3) need not show that a false claim has actually\n\nbeen presented to the government.       Id. at 2129-30.   It also held\n\nthat the complaint must show that the government, and not a private\n\ncontractor using government funds, was the defrauded party. Id. at\n\n2128.   The Court said that subsection (a)(2) does not \"require[]\n\nproof that a defendant's false record or statement was submitted to\n\nthe Government,\" only that \"the defendant made a false record or\n\nstatement for the purpose of getting 'a false or fraudulent claim\n\npaid or approved by the Government.'\"      Id. at 2129-30; see also 1\n\nBoese, supra § 2.02[G].     The defendant must have \"intend[ed] the\n\nGovernment to rely on that false statement as a condition of\n\npayment.\"     Allison Engine, 128 S. Ct. at 2130.    Under subsection\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f(a)(3), the Court held, the complaint need not show the defendants\n\n\"intended the false record or statement to be presented directly to\n\nthe Government,\" but it must show they intended to defraud the\n\ngovernment and \"agreed that the false record or statement would\n\nhave a material effect on the Government's decision to pay the\n\nfalse or fraudulent claim.\"        Id. at 2130-31.7\n\n            Karvelas requires the complaint to provide, among other\n\nfraud specifics, \"details concerning the dates of the claims, the\n\ncontent of the forms or bills submitted, their identification\n\nnumbers, [and] the amount of money charged to the government.\"\n\nKarvelas,   360   F.3d   at     233.     Rost   recognizes   that    Karvelas\n\nnevertheless   allows    some    flexibility    in   construing     the   fraud\n\nallegations of FCA complaints.           Rost, 507 F.3d at 731-32.        Even\n\nviewing the complaint under a more flexible standard, we agree with\n\n\n     7\n          Allison Engine thus forecloses, in subsection (a)(2) and\n(a)(3) cases, a broad reading of portions of our Karvelas and Rost\nholdings. For example, in Karvelas, which involved a subsection\n(a)(1) claim, we said that \"the defendant's presentation of false\nor fraudulent claims to the government is a central element of\nevery [FCA] case,\" Karvelas, 360 F.3d at 232 (emphasis added), and\nthat a complaint must \"provide details that identify particular\nfalse claims for payment that were submitted to the government,\"\nid., repeated in Rost, 507 F.3d at 731. That is true only of cases\nunder subsection (a)(1), which expressly includes a presentment\nrequirement. As to subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) claims, the relator\nmust still connect the allegedly fraudulent statement to a planned\nclaim on the government fisc, must show that the defendant intended\nthe statement would have a material effect on the government's\ndecision to pay a claim, and must plead the facts of the fraud with\nsufficient particularity to satisfy Rule 9(b).       Cf. Universal\nCommc'n Sys., Inc., 478 F.3d at 426-27 (noting that Rule 9(b)\nrequired plaintiff to draw connection between defendants' false\nstatements and allegedly fraudulent securities scheme).\n\n                                       -12-\n\fthe district court that the complaint was insufficiently particular\n\nto pass muster under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) of the FCA.\n\n          We take the most specific of the paragraphs of the\n\ncomplaint,   paragraph    30.     The     complaint      does   allege   the\n\nbeneficiaries of the alleged fraud.             It also identifies which\n\nstatute was the source of the federal funds.            It alleges, in less\n\nclear terms than our recounting, that Willand and other City\n\nemployees engaged in certain practices; it also referred generally\n\nto other unnamed City employees.        It named employee Bull \"as the\n\nperson responsible for the accounting manipulation,\" albeit without\n\nexplanation, including any explanation as to why the manipulation\n\nwas fraudulent.    It did allege in general terms some of the\n\nmechanisms said to be fraudulent: that certain unspecified funds\n\nfrom Workforce Central welfare activities were \"loaned\" to other\n\nWorkforce Central time accounts and that City employees would bill\n\ntheir unspecified time (presumably to those time accounts) in order\n\nto free up Wagner-Peyser funds.      The purpose of the loans, it is\n\nalleged, was so that Willand and Dahlquist could bill something\n\nwhich is unspecified, and whatever they did bill was prohibited by\n\nsome unspecified law.      The complaint adds that City employees\n\nAnderson and Crowley had time sheets, unspecified, with these\n\nparticular   accounts    being   listed    on    them    for    some   times,\n\nunidentified, while their legitimate, unspecified, overhead account\n\nunder the Wagner-Peyser Act was not listed.\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f             The complaint largely ignores the fact that it is the\n\nfraud itself which must be pled with particularity, not just who\n\nbenefits from the fraud and what pot of federal money may be the\n\nobject of the fraud.     It is also not enough to allege there has\n\nbeen some accounting misallocation of expenses to one federal pot\n\nof money rather than another without some explanation of why that\n\nis fraudulent.8\n\n             Relators provide no details on what the alleged \"false,\n\nmisleading and fraudulent pretenses and representations\" consisted\n\nof, who made them, or when they were made \"to get a false or\n\nfraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\" 31 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3729 (a)(2).     See Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc., 374 F.3d at\n\n29.       They also do not specify what the \"periodic reports and\n\nrequests for funds\" were which were made.\n\n             Relators also fail to connect the only falsity or fraud\n\nfor which they provide any detail -- the allegedly fraudulent time\n\nsheets -- to an effort to get a false claim paid or approved by the\n\ngovernment.     They state only that \"[t]he employee time-sheets are\n\nofficial documents that are issued in compliance with law and\n\nrequired to be maintained to support invoices.\"         They do not\n\nprovide any details about the invoices themselves.      They do not\n\n\n\n      8\n          The complaint also   alleged that defendants conspired to\npay the tort settlement         to Gagne \"unlawfully, from WIA\nfunds, . . . as prohibited     by law.\"  The complaint provides no\nexplanation about how or why   this was fraudulent.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fshow how the time sheets had a material effect on the government's\n\ndecision to pay the invoices or any other claim, even if the time\n\nsheets were considered.       Although the complaint gives details on\n\nthe time accounts to which City employees allegedly falsely billed\n\ntheir time, such fraudulent reporting is not actionable under the\n\nFCA unless it is connected to getting a false or fraudulent claim\n\non the government paid or approved.\n\n           The complaint attempts to track the general statutory\n\nlanguage   by   alleging    that   defendants,   \"through   each     act   of\n\nfabrication and submission of a fraudulent time sheet or other\n\ndocument, made or used a false record or statement to get a false\n\nor fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\" and\n\nestimates that in FY2004, there were up to 1000 instances of\n\nfraudulent time sheet submission, rendering defendants liable for\n\napproximately    $500,000     in   damages.      However,   a     conclusory\n\nallegation that defendants' submissions of time sheets was the\n\nmaking or usage of a false record or statement to get a false or\n\nfraudulent claim paid or approved by the government, absent more\n\ndetail about those submissions and their connection to the false or\n\nfraudulent claims, is insufficient under Rule 9(b).         See Rost, 507\n\nF.3d at 731.\n\n           Finally, the complaint alleges that Willand's and other\n\nCity   employees'   holding   multiple     positions   violated    the   WIA.\n\nHowever, \"FCA liability does not attach to violations of federal\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\flaw or regulations . . . that are independent of any false claim.\"\n\nId. at 727.\n\n          The district court was correct.\n\nB.        The Denial of Leave to Amend\n\n          Relators also challenge the district court's refusal to\n\ngrant them leave to amend their complaint a third time.          See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).       Our review is for abuse of discretion.\n\nO'Connell v. Hyatt Hotels of P.R., 357 F.3d 152, 154 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n          Rule 15(a) reflects a liberal amendment policy, see id.,\n\nand provides that a court \"should freely give leave when justice so\n\nrequires.\"    Even   so,   \"the   district   court   enjoys   significant\n\nlatitude in deciding whether to grant leave to amend,\" and we\n\n\"defer to the district court's decision 'if any adequate reason for\n\nthe denial is apparent on the record.'\"        ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v.\n\nAdvest, Inc., 512 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting LaRocca v.\n\nBorden, Inc., 276 F.3d 22, 32 n.9 (1st Cir. 2002)).           Reasons for\n\ndenying leave include undue delay in filing the motion, bad faith\n\nor dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue\n\nprejudice to the opposing party, and futility of amendment.         Foman\n\nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Rost, 507 F.3d at 733-34.\n\n          We hold the district court did not abuse its discretion.\n\nThe court did not, as relators argue, base its denial of leave to\n\namend on the \"lack of clarity\" as to whether they were actually\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\frequesting   leave.   The   court's   order   was   based   on   relators'\n\nrepeated failure to cure the deficiencies in their pleadings.         See\n\nGagne, 2008 WL 2510143, at *5 n.5 (citing Rost and Foman for the\n\nproposition that permissible grounds for denial of leave to amend\n\ninclude a repeated failure to cure pleading deficiencies).             The\n\noriginal complaint was filed in 2006; the First Amended Complaint\n\nwas filed in 2007; the Second Amended Complaint in January 2008.\n\nThe district court's opinion was on June 20, 2008.          Plaintiffs do\n\nnot get a fourth chance to try to get it right.      See ACA Fin. Guar.\n\nCorp., 512 F.3d at 57.\n\n                                III.\n\n          We affirm the district court's order dismissing relators'\n\nclaim and denying leave to amend.\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f",

McGuiggan, Assistant City Solicitor, City of Worcester Law Department, for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, FARRIS<sup>[*]</sup> and BOUDIN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p>This appeal involves the standards for pleading with particularity fraud claims brought under two subsections of the False Claims Act (\"FCA\") concerned with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> making false records or statements to get false claims paid and conspiring to defraud the government by getting false claims paid. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(2) and (a)(3).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs mistakenly read the Supreme Court's 2008 opinion in <i>Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2123, 170 L.Ed.2d 1030 (2008), as having altered the requirements of pleading fraud with particularity set forth in <i>United States ex rel. Rost v. Pfizer, Inc.,</i> 507 F.3d 720 (1st Cir.2007), and <i>United States ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hospital,</i> 360 F.3d 220 (1st Cir. 2004). <i>Allison Engine</i> concerns a different issue and does not alter those fraud with particularity requirements, which apply as well to the conspiracy claim. The complaint was properly dismissed for failing to meet those standards. The district court also acted properly within its discretion in not allowing plaintiffs to amend their complaint yet a third time.</p>\n<p>Edward L. Gagne and Linda Jeneski, a present and a former employee of the Worcester City Manager's Office of Employment and Training (\"CMOET\"), filed a qui tam action on behalf of the federal government against the defendant City of Worcester and a former City official. The United States declined to enter the case. Plaintiffs alleged federal grant funds meant for one purpose were fraudulently diverted to improper expenditures. They alleged the defendants were liable under the FCA for violations of provisions requiring defendants to have: \"knowingly present[ed], or cause[d] to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government . . . a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,\" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1); \"knowingly ma[de], use[d], or cause[d] to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\" <i>id.</i> § 3729(a)(2); and \"conspire[d] to defraud the Government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid,\" <i>id.</i> § 3729(a)(3). Despite their having twice amended their complaint, relators failed to provide details on any particular false or fraudulent statement made to get a false claim paid by the federal government.</p>\n<p>The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and denied relators leave to amend a third time. <i>United States ex. rel. Gagne v. City of Worcester,</i> No. 06-40241, 2008 WL 2510143 (D.Mass. June 20, 2008). The court later denied a Rule 59(e) motion and said relators had mischaracterized its earlier order as resting on a need to make a presentment claim under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3). On appeal, relators argue that the court applied the \"presentment\" requirement of § 3729(a)(1) to their subsection (a)(2) and (a)(3) claims and that this, along with the court's reliance on <i>Rost</i> and <i>Karvelas,</i> was error in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Allison Engine.</i> They also challenge the court's denial of leave to amend. We affirm for the reasons which follow.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The facts as alleged in the complaint are set forth without crediting unsupported conclusions or assertions. <i>Universal Commc'n Sys., Inc. v. Lycos, Inc.,</i> 478 F.3d 413, 415 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Gagne worked for the CMOET; Jeneski was a former CMOET employee. Defendant Stephen Willand was the head of CMOET and also served as Executive Director of the Central Massachusetts Regional Employment Board (\"CMREB\") and the Director of the City's \"One Stop Provider,\" also known as \"Workforce Central,\" which was established under the Workforce Investment Act (\"WIA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2945.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> Under the WIA, the federal government provides grants to states to fund job training programs. <i>See generally id.</i> § 2811; <i>see also </i><i>Santana v. Calderon,</i> 342 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.2003). One stop providers, such as Workforce Central, provide training, adult education, literacy programs, and support services. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2841, 2864.</p>\n<p>The gist of the relators' complaint is that the City improperly used WIA grant funds to pay Willand and other CMOET employees for performing very little work or for work unrelated to WIA projects, to provide City cars to Willand and others, and to pay out $130,000 to settle a state employment discrimination lawsuit that plaintiff Gagne had brought, alleging sexual orientation discrimination. Primarily, the complaint alleged that City employees falsely categorized hours on their time sheets as time spent on WIA projects.</p>\n<p>Relators filed suit on November 9, 2006 naming the City as defendant.<sup>[1]</sup> The central allegations of their Second Amended Complaint, filed on January 4, 2008, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>During Workforce Central and CMREB Fiscal Year 2004 (FY2004), and before and after FY2004, Defendant City's Agents STEPHEN WILLAND, BRUCE DAHLQUIST, DONALD ANDERSON, KEVIN CROWLEY, and CARLENE BULL, among others, with the full knowledge and acquiescence of Defendant City's upper management statutorily responsible for the integrity of WIA federal funds . . ., made and caused to be made false, misleading and fraudulent pretenses and representations through periodic reports and requests for funds to the U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and State of Massachusetts based on the allocation of Workforce Central and CMREB employees' time which were not based on after-the-fact actual activities of the employees charged to the various programs, contracts, grants or awards of the [WIA]. . . . In order to accomplish the unlawful funding of WILLAND and DAHLQUIST, capitated funds earned from the welfare activities of Workforce Central were \"loaned\" to various Workforce Central time accounts to which ANDERSON, CROWLEY, BULL, and others would bill their time to free-up Wagner-Peyser<sup>[2]</sup> funds so that WILLAND and DAHLQUIST could bill to Wagner-Peyser as specifically prohibited by law. The loans from welfare program earnings were loaned to Department 31S account numbers 224, 228 and 231 and were never repaid. Accounts 31S224, 31S228, and 31S231 appear on Anderson and Crowley's time sheets while Wagner-Peyser, which is their legitimate One-Stop overhead, does not. CARLENE BULL is the person responsible for the accounting manipulation.</blockquote>\n<p>Second Amended Complaint ¶ 30. Plaintiffs also alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote>Beginning on or before June 28, 2003 and continuing on and after June 25, 2004 . . . [Willand and other City employees] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, and agree with each other, and with others known and unknown to the Relators, to commit offenses against the United States, to wit, fraud or misapplication concerning Federal funds under the [WIA], in violation of [18 U.S.C. § 665] and fraud or misapplication concerning a program receiving Federal funds in violation of [18 U.S.C. § 666]; and did further so combine, conspire and agree to defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful government functions of the U.S. Department of Labor through deceit, trickery and dishonest means.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> ¶ 22.</p>\n<p>Other paragraphs of the complaint alleged that defendants engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the government, by \"caus[ing] false, misleading and fraudulent pretenses and representations to be made to WIA funding sources . . . to allow [City employees] to receive excessive and unreasonable compensation through unlawful, dishonest and deceitful means by misapplication or obtaining by fraud of funds from the [WIA].\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 23. The complaint also alleged defendants violated the WIA because Willand and others worked for the CMOET while at the same time holding official roles in Workforce Central and the CMREB.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 9-10. Defendants moved to dismiss on January 28, 2008, arguing that the Second Amended Complaint still failed to allege fraud with the particularity required under Rule 9(b).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>On June 20, 2008, the district court entered an order dismissing the Second Amended Complaint, as we have described. The court noted that relators' opposition incorporated by reference their earlier opposition to the first motion to dismiss, in which they had sought leave to amend. The court said it was unclear whether relators intended to request leave to amend their complaint again, but held that even if they did, it would not allow further amendment. <i>Gagne,</i> 2008 WL 2510143, at *5 n. 5.</p>\n<p>Relators filed a motion to alter or amend judgment purportedly under Rule 59(e), arguing that the court had committed a manifest error of law by relying on <i>Karvelas,</i> which they said dealt only with \"presentment\" cases, or cases brought under subsection (a)(1) of the FCA in which the allegation is that the defendant actually presented a false claim to the government.<sup>[5]</sup> They argued <i>Karvelas</i> did not apply <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> to subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) cases. The court denied plaintiffs' motion, stating relators erred in arguing it based its holding on a presentment requirement, and saying it \"ha[d] considered the sufficiency of relators' complaint with regard to Rule 9(b) only,\" which it held applies with equal force to subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3). Relators appealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>The Dismissal of Relators' Complaint</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review de novo the district court's dismissal order for failure to comply with Rule 9(b). <i>See </i><i>SBT Holdings, LLC v. Town of Westminster,</i> 547 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>We have previously held the heightened pleading requirements of Fed. R.Civ.P. 9(b) apply to claims brought under subsection (a)(1) of the FCA, <i>Karvelas,</i> 360 F.3d at 227-28, and subsection (a)(2), <i>Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 731. We now hold those Rule 9(b) requirements apply to conspiracy claims under subsection (a)(3). That is the rule of most circuits. <i>See, e.g., United States ex rel. Marlar v. BWXT Y-12, L.L.C.,</i> 525 F.3d 439, 445 (6th Cir.2008); <i>United States ex rel. Joshi v. St. Luke's Hosp., Inc.,</i> 441 F.3d 552, 556 (8th Cir. 2006); <i>Corsello v. Lincare, Inc.,</i> 428 F.3d 1008, 1014 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <i>see also</i> 2 J.T. Boese, <i>Civil False Claims and</i> Qui Tam <i>Actions</i> § 5.04, at 5-44 to -45 (3d ed.2009).</p>\n<p>Rule 9(b) requires that \"[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\" This standard \"means that a complaint must specify `the time, place, and content of an alleged false representation.'\" <i>Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 731 (quoting <i>Doyle v. Hasbro, Inc.,</i> 103 F.3d 186, 194 (1st Cir.1996)); <i>see also </i><i>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc.,</i> 374 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that Rule 9(b) requires the pleader \"to specify the who, what, where, and when of the allegedly false or fraudulent representation\"). \"Conclusory allegations . . . are not sufficient\" to satisfy Rule 9(b). <i>Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 731. The rule may be satisfied, however, \"where, although some questions remain unanswered, the complaint as a whole is sufficiently particular to pass muster under the FCA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 732; <i>see also Karvelas,</i> 360 F.3d at 233 n. 17 (\"In a related context, we held that courts will allow private securities fraud cases `to advance past the pleadings stage when some questions remain unanswered, provided the complaint as a whole is sufficiently particular to pass muster under the [Private Securities Litigation Reform Act].'\" (quoting <i>In re Cabletron Sys., Inc.,</i> 311 F.3d 11, 32 (1st Cir.2002))).</p>\n<p>The essence of relators' argument is that they have pled facts sufficient to meet the Rule 9(b) standards under (a)(2) and (a)(3), if not as to the \"presentment\" of a false claim to the federal government.<sup>[6]</sup> They say under <i>Allison Engine</i> they do not need to plead presentment as to their (a)(2) and (a)(3) claims. That is true as far as it goes, but irrelevant. The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> district court did not impose a presentment requirement; rather, it correctly held that the allegations made did not otherwise meet the fraud pleading requirements for the elements of claims under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3).</p>\n<p>In <i>Allison Engine,</i> an FCA qui tam action, the Supreme Court clarified, unanimously, the pleading requirements for the elements of claims brought under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) of the FCA. It reversed an opinion of the Sixth Circuit which held that the relators did not need to show that the defendant intended that the false claim be paid by the government, only that it be paid by a private entity using government funds. <i>Allison Engine,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2126-28.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court held that claims under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) need not show that a false claim has actually been presented to the government. <i>Id.</i> at 2129-30. It also held that the complaint must show that the government, and not a private contractor using government funds, was the defrauded party. <i>Id.</i> at 2128. The Court said that subsection (a)(2) does not \"require[ ] proof that a defendant's false record or statement was submitted to the Government,\" only that \"the defendant made a false record or statement for the purpose of getting `a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 2129-30; <i>see also</i> 1 Boese, <i>supra</i> § 2.02[G]. The defendant must have \"intend[ed] the Government to rely on that false statement as a condition of payment.\" <i>Allison Engine,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 2130. Under subsection (a)(3), the Court held, the complaint need not show the defendants \"intended the false record or statement to be presented directly to the Government,\" but it must show they intended to defraud the government and \"agreed that the false record or statement would have a material effect on the Government's decision to pay the false or fraudulent claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2130-31.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Karvelas</i> requires the complaint to provide, among other fraud specifics, \"details concerning the dates of the claims, the content of the forms or bills submitted, their identification numbers, [and] the amount of money charged to the government.\" <i>Karvelas,</i> 360 F.3d at 233. <i>Rost</i> recognizes that <i>Karvelas</i> nevertheless allows some flexibility in construing the fraud allegations of FCA complaints. <i>Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 731-32. Even viewing the complaint under a more flexible standard, we agree with the district court that the complaint was insufficiently particular to pass muster under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) of the FCA.</p>\n<p>We take the most specific of the paragraphs of the complaint, paragraph 30. The complaint does allege the beneficiaries of the alleged fraud. It also identifies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> which statute was the source of the federal funds. It alleges, in less clear terms than our recounting, that Willand and other City employees engaged in certain practices; it also referred generally to other unnamed City employees. It named employee Bull \"as the person responsible for the accounting manipulation,\" albeit without explanation, including any explanation as to why the manipulation was fraudulent. It did allege in general terms some of the mechanisms said to be fraudulent: that certain unspecified funds from Workforce Central welfare activities were \"loaned\" to other Workforce Central time accounts and that City employees would bill their unspecified time (presumably to those time accounts) in order to free up Wagner-Peyser funds. The purpose of the loans, it is alleged, was so that Willand and Dahlquist could bill something which is unspecified, and whatever they did bill was prohibited by some unspecified law. The complaint adds that City employees Anderson and Crowley had time sheets, unspecified, with these particular accounts being listed on them for some times, unidentified, while their legitimate, unspecified, overhead account under the Wagner-Peyser Act was not listed.</p>\n<p>The complaint largely ignores the fact that it is the fraud itself which must be pled with particularity, not just who benefits from the fraud and what pot of federal money may be the object of the fraud. It is also not enough to allege there has been some accounting misallocation of expenses to one federal pot of money rather than another without some explanation of why that is fraudulent.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Relators provide no details on what the alleged \"false, misleading and fraudulent pretenses and representations\" consisted of, who made them, or when they were made \"to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(2). <i>See </i><i>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc.,</i> 374 F.3d at 29. They also do not specify what the \"periodic reports and requests for funds\" were which were made.</p>\n<p>Relators also fail to connect the only falsity or fraud for which they provide any detail  the allegedly fraudulent time sheets  to an effort to get a false claim paid or approved by the government. They state only that \"[t]he employee time-sheets are official documents that are issued in compliance with law and required to be maintained to support invoices.\" They do not provide any details about the invoices themselves. They do not show how the time sheets had a material effect on the government's decision to pay the invoices or any other claim, even if the time sheets were considered. Although the complaint gives details on the time accounts to which City employees allegedly falsely billed their time, such fraudulent reporting is not actionable under the FCA unless it is connected to getting a false or fraudulent claim on the government paid or approved.</p>\n<p>The complaint attempts to track the general statutory language by alleging that defendants, \"through each act of fabrication and submission of a fraudulent time sheet or other document, made or used a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\" and estimates that in FY2004, there were up to 1000 instances of fraudulent time sheet submission, rendering defendants liable for approximately $500,000 in damages. However, a conclusory allegation that defendants' submissions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> of time sheets was the making or usage of a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government, absent more detail about those submissions and their connection to the false or fraudulent claims, is insufficient under Rule 9(b). <i>See Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 731.</p>\n<p>Finally, the complaint alleges that Willand's and other City employees' holding multiple positions violated the WIA. However, \"FCA liability does not attach to violations of federal law or regulations . . . that are independent of any false claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 727.</p>\n<p>The district court was correct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Denial of Leave to Amend</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Relators also challenge the district court's refusal to grant them leave to amend their complaint a third time. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). Our review is for abuse of discretion. <i>O'Connell v. Hyatt Hotels of P.R.,</i> 357 F.3d 152, 154 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Rule 15(a) reflects a liberal amendment policy, <i>see id.,</i> and provides that a court \"should freely give leave when justice so requires.\" Even so, \"the district court enjoys significant latitude in deciding whether to grant leave to amend,\" and we \"defer to the district court's decision `if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent on the record.'\" <i>ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v. Advest, Inc.,</i> 512 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>LaRocca v. Borden, Inc.,</i> 276 F.3d 22, 32 n. 9 (1st Cir.2002)). Reasons for denying leave include undue delay in filing the motion, bad faith or dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of amendment. <i>Foman v. Davis,</i> 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); <i>Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 733-34.</p>\n<p>We hold the district court did not abuse its discretion. The court did not, as relators argue, base its denial of leave to amend on the \"lack of clarity\" as to whether they were actually requesting leave. The court's order was based on relators' repeated failure to cure the deficiencies in their pleadings. <i>See Gagne,</i> 2008 WL 2510143, at *5 n. 5 (citing <i>Rost</i> and <i>Foman</i> for the proposition that permissible grounds for denial of leave to amend include a repeated failure to cure pleading deficiencies). The original complaint was filed in 2006; the First Amended Complaint was filed in 2007; the Second Amended Complaint in January 2008. The district court's opinion was on June 20, 2008. Plaintiffs do not get a fourth chance to try to get it right. <i>See </i><i>ACA Fin. Guar. Corp.,</i> 512 F.3d at 57.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the district court's order dismissing relators' claim and denying leave to amend.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Relators filed a First Amended Complaint without leave of the court on June 18, 2007. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (allowing one amendment as of right if no responsive pleading has been filed but requiring leave for subsequent amendments). The City moved to dismiss. Relators filed an opposition in which they also asked for leave to amend. The court granted leave to amend, allowed relators to name Willand as an additional defendant, and held the City's first motion to dismiss moot.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. § 49 <i>et seq.,</i> enacted in 1933, was amended by the WIA. Workforce Central and the CMREB received funds under both statutes.</p>\n<p>[3]  In their opposition to the City's motion to dismiss the first complaint on Rule 9(b) grounds, plaintiffs had attached 119 pages of allegedly fraudulent time sheets. But these time sheets were not attached to the Second Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p>[4]  Defendants also argued that the court lacked jurisdiction under the public disclosure bar of the FCA, <i>see generally Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 727-28; 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(A), and that relators had not served them properly, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4. The district court held it could not determine whether the public disclosure bar applied on the record before it and did not reach the Rule 4 argument. Defendants do not address either ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p>[5]  Relators also argued the court committed a manifest error of law by misstating the statutory language in describing their claims. The court said the complaint alleged defendants violated the FCA \"by (1) presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment or approval to the federal government in violation of § 3729(a)(1), (2) making or using false records or statements to make false or fraudulent claims in violation of § 3729(a)(2), <i>and</i> (3) conspiring to get false or fraudulent claims paid or approved by the federal government in violation of § 3729(a)(3).\" <i>Gagne,</i> 2008 WL 2510143, at *1 (emphasis added). Relators argued that the court's substitution of \"and\" for the statute's \"or\" conflated the three subsections and led it to extend the presentment requirement of (a)(1).\n</p>\n<p>Relators also argue the court erroneously summarized the elements of each subsection. For example, it substituted \"to make false or fraudulent claims\" for the statute's \"to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government\" in describing subsection (a)(2). While the court did use summary language in describing relators' claims that did not reflect the exact statutory text, the remainder of its opinion shows this summary did not cause it to analyze the complaint incorrectly.</p>\n<p>[6]  Relators make no arguments specific to their (a)(1) claim and have therefore waived that argument on appeal.</p>\n<p>[7]  <i>Allison Engine</i> thus forecloses, in subsection (a)(2) and (a)(3) cases, a broad reading of portions of our <i>Karvelas</i> and <i>Rost</i> holdings. For example, in <i>Karvelas,</i> which involved a subsection (a)(1) claim, we said that \"the defendant's presentation of false or fraudulent claims to the government is a central element of <i>every</i> [FCA] case,\" <i>Karvelas,</i> 360 F.3d at 232 (emphasis added), and that a complaint must \"provide details that identify particular false claims for payment that were submitted to the government,\" <i>id., repeated in Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 731. That is true only of cases under subsection (a)(1), which expressly includes a presentment requirement. As to subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) claims, the relator must still connect the allegedly fraudulent statement to a planned claim on the government fisc, must show that the defendant intended the statement would have a material effect on the government's decision to pay a claim, and must plead the facts of the fraud with sufficient particularity to satisfy Rule 9(b). <i>Cf. </i><i>Universal Commc'n Sys., Inc.,</i> 478 F.3d at 426-27 (noting that Rule 9(b) required plaintiff to draw connection between defendants' false statements and allegedly fraudulent securities scheme).</p>\n<p>[8]  The complaint also alleged that defendants conspired to pay the tort settlement to Gagne \"unlawfully, from WIA funds, . . . as prohibited by law.\" The complaint provides no explanation about how or why this was fraudulent.</p>\n\n</div>",

The complaint was properly dismissed for failing to meet those standards. The district court also acted properly within its discretion in not allowing plaintiffs to amend their complaint yet a third time.</p>\n<p>Edward L. Gagne and Linda Jeneski, a present and a former employee of the Worcester City Manager's Office of Employment and Training (\"CMOET\"), filed a qui tam action on behalf of the federal government against the defendant City of Worcester and a former City official. The United States declined to enter the case. Plaintiffs alleged federal grant funds meant for one purpose were fraudulently diverted to improper expenditures. They alleged the defendants were liable under the FCA for violations of provisions requiring defendants to have: \"knowingly present[ed], or cause[d] to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government . . . a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,\" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1); \"knowingly ma[de], use[d], or cause[d] to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\" <i>id.</i> § 3729(a)(2); and \"conspire[d] to defraud the Government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid,\" <i>id.</i> § 3729(a)(3). Despite their having twice amended their complaint, relators failed to provide details on any particular false or fraudulent statement made to get a false claim paid by the federal government.</p>\n<p>The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and denied relators leave to amend a third time. <i>United States ex. rel.

June 20, 2008). The court later denied a Rule 59(e) motion and said relators had mischaracterized its earlier order as resting on a need to make a presentment claim under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3). On appeal, relators argue that the court applied the \"presentment\" requirement of § 3729(a)(1) to their subsection (a)(2) and (a)(3) claims and that this, along with the court's reliance on <i>Rost</i> and <i>Karvelas,</i> was error in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Allison Engine.</i> They also challenge the court's denial of leave to amend.

Defendant Stephen Willand was the head of CMOET and also served as Executive Director of the Central Massachusetts Regional Employment Board (\"CMREB\") and the Director of the City's \"One Stop Provider,\" also known as \"Workforce Central,\" which was established under the Workforce Investment Act (\"WIA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2945.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> Under the WIA, the federal government provides grants to states to fund job training programs. <i>See generally id.</i> § 2811; <i>see also </i><i>Santana v.

One stop providers, such as Workforce Central, provide training, adult education, literacy programs, and support services. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2841, 2864.</p>\n<p>The gist of the relators' complaint is that the City improperly used WIA grant funds to pay Willand and other CMOET employees for performing very little work or for work unrelated to WIA projects, to provide City cars to Willand and others, and to pay out $130,000 to settle a state employment discrimination lawsuit that plaintiff Gagne had brought, alleging sexual orientation discrimination. Primarily, the complaint alleged that City employees falsely categorized hours on their time sheets as time spent on WIA projects.</p>\n<p>Relators filed suit on November 9, 2006 naming the City as defendant.<sup>[1]</sup> The central allegations of their Second Amended Complaint, filed on January 4, 2008, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>During Workforce Central and CMREB Fiscal Year 2004 (FY2004), and before and after FY2004, Defendant City's Agents STEPHEN WILLAND, BRUCE DAHLQUIST, DONALD ANDERSON, KEVIN CROWLEY, and CARLENE BULL, among others, with the full knowledge and acquiescence of Defendant City's upper management statutorily responsible for the integrity of WIA federal funds . . ., made and caused to be made false, misleading and fraudulent pretenses and representations through periodic reports and requests for funds to the U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and State of Massachusetts based on the allocation of Workforce Central and CMREB employees' time which were not based on after-the-fact actual activities of the employees charged to the various programs, contracts, grants or awards of the [WIA]. . . . In order to accomplish the unlawful funding of WILLAND and DAHLQUIST, capitated funds earned from the welfare activities of Workforce Central were \"loaned\" to various Workforce Central time accounts to which ANDERSON, CROWLEY, BULL, and others would bill their time to free-up Wagner-Peyser<sup>[2]</sup> funds so that WILLAND and DAHLQUIST could bill to Wagner-Peyser as specifically prohibited by law. The loans from welfare program earnings were loaned to Department 31S account numbers 224, 228 and 231 and were never repaid. Accounts 31S224, 31S228, and 31S231 appear on Anderson and Crowley's time sheets while Wagner-Peyser, which is their legitimate One-Stop overhead, does not. CARLENE BULL is the person responsible for the accounting manipulation.</blockquote>\n<p>Second Amended Complaint ¶ 30. Plaintiffs also alleged that:</p>\n<blockquote>Beginning on or before June 28, 2003 and continuing on and after June 25, 2004 . . . [Willand and other City employees] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, and agree with each other, and with others known and unknown to the Relators, to commit offenses against the United States, to wit, fraud or misapplication concerning Federal funds under the [WIA], in violation of [18 U.S.C. § 665] and fraud or misapplication concerning a program receiving Federal funds in violation of [18 U.S.C. § 666]; and did further so combine, conspire and agree to defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful government functions of the U.S. Department of Labor through deceit, trickery and dishonest means.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> ¶ 22.</p>\n<p>Other paragraphs of the complaint alleged that defendants engaged in a conspiracy to defraud the government, by \"caus[ing] false, misleading and fraudulent pretenses and representations to be made to WIA funding sources . . . to allow [City employees] to receive excessive and unreasonable compensation through unlawful, dishonest and deceitful means by misapplication or obtaining by fraud of funds from the [WIA].\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 23. The complaint also alleged defendants violated the WIA because Willand and others worked for the CMOET while at the same time holding official roles in Workforce Central and the CMREB.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Id.</i> ¶¶ 9-10. Defendants moved to dismiss on January 28, 2008, arguing that the Second Amended Complaint still failed to allege fraud with the particularity required under Rule 9(b).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>On June 20, 2008, the district court entered an order dismissing the Second Amended Complaint, as we have described. The court noted that relators' opposition incorporated by reference their earlier opposition to the first motion to dismiss, in which they had sought leave to amend. The court said it was unclear whether relators intended to request leave to amend their complaint again, but held that even if they did, it would not allow further amendment. <i>Gagne,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2510143</span></span>, at *5 n. 5.</p>\n<p>Relators filed a motion to alter or amend judgment purportedly under Rule 59(e), arguing that the court had committed a manifest error of law by relying on <i>Karvelas,</i> which they said dealt only with \"presentment\" cases, or cases brought under subsection (a)(1) of the FCA in which the allegation is that the defendant actually presented a false claim to the government.<sup>[5]</sup> They argued <i>Karvelas</i> did not apply <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> to subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) cases. The court denied plaintiffs' motion, stating relators erred in arguing it based its holding on a presentment requirement, and saying it \"ha[d] considered the sufficiency of relators' complaint with regard to Rule 9(b) only,\" which it held applies with equal force to subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3).

Under subsection (a)(3), the Court held, the complaint need not show the defendants \"intended the false record or statement to be presented directly to the Government,\" but it must show they intended to defraud the government and \"agreed that the false record or statement would have a material effect on the Government's decision to pay the false or fraudulent claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2130-31.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Karvelas</i> requires the complaint to provide, among other fraud specifics, \"details concerning the dates of the claims, the content of the forms or bills submitted, their identification numbers, [and] the amount of money charged to the government.\" <i>Karvelas,</i> 360 F.3d at 233. <i>Rost</i> recognizes that <i>Karvelas</i> nevertheless allows some flexibility in construing the fraud allegations of FCA complaints. <i>Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 731-32. Even viewing the complaint under a more flexible standard, we agree with the district court that the complaint was insufficiently particular to pass muster under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) of the FCA.</p>\n<p>We take the most specific of the paragraphs of the complaint, paragraph 30. The complaint does allege the beneficiaries of the alleged fraud. It also identifies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> which statute was the source of the federal funds. It alleges, in less clear terms than our recounting, that Willand and other City employees engaged in certain practices; it also referred generally to other unnamed City employees. It named employee Bull \"as the person responsible for the accounting manipulation,\" albeit without explanation, including any explanation as to why the manipulation was fraudulent. It did allege in general terms some of the mechanisms said to be fraudulent: that certain unspecified funds from Workforce Central welfare activities were \"loaned\" to other Workforce Central time accounts and that City employees would bill their unspecified time (presumably to those time accounts) in order to free up Wagner-Peyser funds. The purpose of the loans, it is alleged, was so that Willand and Dahlquist could bill something which is unspecified, and whatever they did bill was prohibited by some unspecified law. The complaint adds that City employees Anderson and Crowley had time sheets, unspecified, with these particular accounts being listed on them for some times, unidentified, while their legitimate, unspecified, overhead account under the Wagner-Peyser Act was not listed.</p>\n<p>The complaint largely ignores the fact that it is the fraud itself which must be pled with particularity, not just who benefits from the fraud and what pot of federal money may be the object of the fraud. It is also not enough to allege there has been some accounting misallocation of expenses to one federal pot of money rather than another without some explanation of why that is fraudulent.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Relators provide no details on what the alleged \"false, misleading and fraudulent pretenses and representations\" consisted of, who made them, or when they were made \"to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(2). <i>See </i><i>Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc.,</i> 374 F.3d at 29. They also do not specify what the \"periodic reports and requests for funds\" were which were made.</p>\n<p>Relators also fail to connect the only falsity or fraud for which they provide any detail  the allegedly fraudulent time sheets  to an effort to get a false claim paid or approved by the government. They state only that \"[t]he employee time-sheets are official documents that are issued in compliance with law and required to be maintained to support invoices.\" They do not provide any details about the invoices themselves. They do not show how the time sheets had a material effect on the government's decision to pay the invoices or any other claim, even if the time sheets were considered. Although the complaint gives details on the time accounts to which City employees allegedly falsely billed their time, such fraudulent reporting is not actionable under the FCA unless it is connected to getting a false or fraudulent claim on the government paid or approved.</p>\n<p>The complaint attempts to track the general statutory language by alleging that defendants, \"through each act of fabrication and submission of a fraudulent time sheet or other document, made or used a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government,\" and estimates that in FY2004, there were up to 1000 instances of fraudulent time sheet submission, rendering defendants liable for approximately $500,000 in damages. However, a conclusory allegation that defendants' submissions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> of time sheets was the making or usage of a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government, absent more detail about those submissions and their connection to the false or fraudulent claims, is insufficient under Rule 9(b). <i>See Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 731.</p>\n<p>Finally, the complaint alleges that Willand's and other City employees' holding multiple positions violated the WIA. However, \"FCA liability does not attach to violations of federal law or regulations . . . that are independent of any false claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 727.</p>\n<p>The district court was correct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The Denial of Leave to Amend</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Relators also challenge the district court's refusal to grant them leave to amend their complaint a third time. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). Our review is for abuse of discretion. <i>O'Connell v. Hyatt Hotels of P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200849\"><a href=\"/opinion/200849/oconnell-v-hyatt-hotel/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Rule 15(a) reflects a liberal amendment policy, <i>see id.,</i> and provides that a court \"should freely give leave when justice so requires.\" Even so, \"the district court enjoys significant latitude in deciding whether to grant leave to amend,\" and we \"defer to the district court's decision `if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent on the record.'\" <i>ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v. Advest, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>LaRocca v.

Reasons for denying leave include undue delay in filing the motion, bad faith or dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies, undue prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of amendment. <i>Foman v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1962); <i>Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 733-34.</p>\n<p>We hold the district court did not abuse its discretion. The court did not, as relators argue, base its denial of leave to amend on the \"lack of clarity\" as to whether they were actually requesting leave. The court's order was based on relators' repeated failure to cure the deficiencies in their pleadings. <i>See Gagne,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2510143</span></span>, at *5 n. 5 (citing <i>Rost</i> and <i>Foman</i> for the proposition that permissible grounds for denial of leave to amend include a repeated failure to cure pleading deficiencies). The original complaint was filed in 2006; the First Amended Complaint was filed in 2007; the Second Amended Complaint in January 2008. The district court's opinion was on June 20, 2008. Plaintiffs do not get a fourth chance to try to get it right. <i>See </i><i>ACA Fin. Guar. Corp.,</i> 512 F.3d at 57.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the district court's order dismissing relators' claim and denying leave to amend.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Relators filed a First Amended Complaint without leave of the court on June 18, 2007. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (allowing one amendment as of right if no responsive pleading has been filed but requiring leave for subsequent amendments). The City moved to dismiss. Relators filed an opposition in which they also asked for leave to amend. The court granted leave to amend, allowed relators to name Willand as an additional defendant, and held the City's first motion to dismiss moot.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. § 49 <i>et seq.,</i> enacted in 1933, was amended by the WIA. Workforce Central and the CMREB received funds under both statutes.</p>\n<p>[3]  In their opposition to the City's motion to dismiss the first complaint on Rule 9(b) grounds, plaintiffs had attached 119 pages of allegedly fraudulent time sheets. But these time sheets were not attached to the Second Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p>[4]  Defendants also argued that the court lacked jurisdiction under the public disclosure bar of the FCA, <i>see generally Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 727-28; 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(A), and that relators had not served them properly, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 4. The district court held it could not determine whether the public disclosure bar applied on the record before it and did not reach the Rule 4 argument. Defendants do not address either ruling on appeal.</p>\n<p>[5]  Relators also argued the court committed a manifest error of law by misstating the statutory language in describing their claims. The court said the complaint alleged defendants violated the FCA \"by (1) presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment or approval to the federal government in violation of § 3729(a)(1), (2) making or using false records or statements to make false or fraudulent claims in violation of § 3729(a)(2), <i>and</i> (3) conspiring to get false or fraudulent claims paid or approved by the federal government in violation of § 3729(a)(3).\" <i>Gagne,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2510143</span></span>, at *1 (emphasis added). Relators argued that the court's substitution of \"and\" for the statute's \"or\" conflated the three subsections and led it to extend the presentment requirement of (a)(1).\n</p>\n<p>Relators also argue the court erroneously summarized the elements of each subsection. For example, it substituted \"to make false or fraudulent claims\" for the statute's \"to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government\" in describing subsection (a)(2). While the court did use summary language in describing relators' claims that did not reflect the exact statutory text, the remainder of its opinion shows this summary did not cause it to analyze the complaint incorrectly.</p>\n<p>[6]  Relators make no arguments specific to their (a)(1) claim and have therefore waived that argument on appeal.</p>\n<p>[7]  <i>Allison Engine</i> thus forecloses, in subsection (a)(2) and (a)(3) cases, a broad reading of portions of our <i>Karvelas</i> and <i>Rost</i> holdings. For example, in <i>Karvelas,</i> which involved a subsection (a)(1) claim, we said that \"the defendant's presentation of false or fraudulent claims to the government is a central element of <i>every</i> [FCA] case,\" <i>Karvelas,</i> 360 F.3d at 232 (emphasis added), and that a complaint must \"provide details that identify particular false claims for payment that were submitted to the government,\" <i>id., repeated in Rost,</i> 507 F.3d at 731. That is true only of cases under subsection (a)(1), which expressly includes a presentment requirement. As to subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) claims, the relator must still connect the allegedly fraudulent statement to a planned claim on the government fisc, must show that the defendant intended the statement would have a material effect on the government's decision to pay a claim, and must plead the facts of the fraud with sufficient particularity to satisfy Rule 9(b). <i>Cf. </i><i>Universal Commc'n Sys., Inc.,</i> 478 F.3d at 426-27 (noting that Rule 9(b) required plaintiff to draw connection between defendants' false statements and allegedly fraudulent securities scheme).</p>\n<p>[8]  The complaint also alleged that defendants conspired to pay the tort settlement to Gagne \"unlawfully, from WIA funds, . . . as prohibited by law.\" The complaint provides no explanation about how or why this was fraudulent.</p>\n\n</div>",
