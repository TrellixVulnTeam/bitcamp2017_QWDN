Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Keith Niemic on brief pro se.\n     James A. Bello, Lisa R. Wichter, and Morrison Mahoney LLP on\nbrief for appellees.\n\n\n                             July 28, 2008\n\f           Per Curiam.     Appellant Keith Niemic, a Massachusetts\n\ninmate, filed this civil-rights action complaining of inadequate\n\nmedical care, denial of court access, and other constitutional and\n\nstate-law violations.      The twenty named defendants consist of\n\ntwelve \"corrections defendants,\" i.e., employees of the Department\n\nof Corrections, and eight \"medical defendants,\" i.e., employees of\n\nUMass Correctional Health (\"UMCH\"), which is the entity engaged to\n\nprovide medical care to inmates. When the medical defendants moved\n\nfor summary judgment, Niemic sought a continuance under Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(f), explaining that he lacked information needed to file\n\nan opposition.   The district court denied that request and granted\n\nsummary   judgment.      With   the    claims   against   the   corrections\n\ndefendants still pending, the court then agreed, at the medical\n\ndefendants' behest, to enter a separate and final judgment under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).          Niemic now appeals from this ruling.\n\nHaving satisfied ourselves that the case is properly before us, we\n\naffirm.\n\n           Although neither party has questioned the Rule 54(b)\n\ndetermination, \"we are duty bound to take it up sua sponte\" since\n\nthe issue \"implicates the scope of our appellate jurisdiction.\"\n\nSpiegel v. Trustees of Tufts College, 843 F.2d 38, 43 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).    Rule 54(b) permits a district court, in cases involving\n\nmultiple claims or parties, to direct entry of a final judgment \"as\n\nto one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties\" if it\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f\"expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.\"\n\nReview of such a certification comprises two steps.              We first ask\n\n\"whether the judgment has the requisite aspects of finality.\"               Id.\n\nThe answer to that question is not in doubt here, since the\n\njudgment dismissed all claims against the medical defendants.               We\n\nthen scrutinize the determination that there is no just reason for\n\ndelay.    In doing so, we examine \"the sufficiency of the district\n\ncourt's assessments of (1) any interrelationship or overlap among\n\nthe various legal and factual issues involved in the dismissed and\n\nthe   pending   claims,   and    (2)    any    equities    and   efficiencies\n\nimplicated by the requested piecemeal review.\"              Credit Francais\n\nInt'l, S.A. v. Bio-Vita, Ltd., 78 F.3d 698, 706 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           At our request, the district court provided a written\n\nexplanation for its Rule 54(b) determination.             It there cited the\n\nneed to protect the medical defendants from \"unnecessary cost and\n\napprehension,\" noting that the case against the other defendants\n\nwould likely \"continue indefinitely\" since they had not yet filed\n\ndispositive motions. Absent from this discussion, however, was any\n\nconsideration of the interrelationship between the dismissed and\n\npending   claims.    While      this   omission   reduces    the   degree    of\n\ndeference owed to the court's explanation, see, e.g., Spiegel, 843\n\nF.2d at 43-44, our independent review reveals only minimal overlap\n\nbetween the two sets of claims.               As narrowed on appeal, the\n\naccusations against the medical defendants are largely confined to\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fclaims under the Eighth Amendment--to the effect that the treatment\n\nof Niemic's migraine headaches and hepatitis C was so deficient as\n\nto   amount    to    deliberate     indifference.      These    claims     carry    a\n\nsignificant potential for overlap with the allegations against only\n\none of the corrections defendants: Susan Martin, the department's\n\ndirector of health services.             Of the charges against her, the most\n\nnoteworthy in this regard is that she, along with several other\n\nsupervisors,        approved   flawed     medical   decisions   concerning       the\n\ntreatment of Niemic's migraines; such conduct allegedly contributed\n\nto the persistence of his migraine pain and thereby played a role\n\nin the cessation of his hepatitis C treatment.                       Yet in the\n\npertinent count of the complaint, the only specific reference to\n\nthese events is a charge, brought against Martin and six other\n\ndefendants, focusing on \"the delay and denial of access to ... a\n\nneurologist.\"\n\n              We    find   that    the   claims   against   Martin   are   not     so\n\nintertwined with the adjudicated claims as to invalidate the Rule\n\n54(b) certification.              It is unlikely that this court will be\n\n\"confronted in successive appeals with common issues of law or\n\nfact, to the detriment of judicial efficiency.\" Kersey v. Dennison\n\nMfg. Co., 3 F.3d 482, 487 (1st Cir. 1993).             Moreover, the judgment\n\nhere jettisoned certain parties, rather than certain claims, from\n\nthe case.     Cf. Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576,\n\n579-81 (1st Cir. 1994) (upholding certification in former context);\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fFeinstein v. Resolution Trust Corp., 942 F.2d 34, 39-40 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (same).      And while it is difficult to say that there is a\n\n\"pressing, exceptional need for immediate intervention\" here, id.\n\nat 45, the district court's concern about \"unnecessary cost and\n\napprehension\" is a permissible consideration, see, e.g., McKibben\n\nv. Chubb, 840 F.2d 1525, 1528 n.5 (10th Cir. 1988).                    Although we\n\nfind this a close case, we allow the Rule 54(b) determination to\n\nstand.\n\n            The   merits    of   the   appeal      do   not    require      extended\n\nanalysis.      On the basis of the extant record, an award of summary\n\njudgment for the medical defendants was plainly justified.                    Niemic\n\nadvances a two-pronged Eighth Amendment challenge.                       First, he\n\ncontends that defendants inadequately treated his migraines and\n\nthereby   effectively      caused   him   to    terminate       his    hepatitis   C\n\ntreatment (since the side-effects thereof aggravated the migraine\n\npain).    Yet it is undisputed that, over a span of two and one-half\n\nyears, some 21 different medications were prescribed in an effort\n\nto   address    Niemic's   headaches.        Far    from      acting   in   \"wanton\n\ndisregard\" of his rights, DesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 1991), the medical defendants were \"responsive to [Niemic's]\n\ncomplaints, expended substantial resources trying to get to the\n\nroot of his problem, and adopted other measures in an effort to\n\nalleviate his discomfort,\" Feeney v. Corr. Med. Servs., Inc., 464\n\nF.3d 158, 162-63 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 105\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f(2007).    Niemic's chief remonstrance appears to be directed at\n\ndefendants' refusal to continue him on a narcotic with which he was\n\ninitially treated.         Yet \"disagreement as to the appropriate course\n\nof treatment ... [is] insufficient to prove a constitutional\n\nviolation.\" Ruiz-Rosa v. Rull√°n, 485 F.3d 150, 156 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n               Second, Niemic questions the decision to discontinue the\n\nhepatitis C treatment because of his suspected drug use.                 The\n\nrecord establishes that defendants' \"common practice\" is to require\n\nthat patients abstain from the use of illegal substances for one\n\nyear prior to receiving such treatment.           Niemic provides no basis\n\nto question the medical justification for this practice; indeed,\n\nthe (Mason) affidavit on which he relies supports such an approach.\n\n               Niemic's cursory challenge to the finding of substance\n\nabuse also falls short, especially since the urinalysis lab report\n\nconfirmed the presence of cocaine and morphine.           On appeal, Niemic\n\nrelies    on    a   1987   state   court   document   addressing   urinalysis\n\ntesting, but he did not do so below and, in any event, has not\n\nexplained its relevance.\n\n               Niemic's principal objection to the summary judgment\n\nmotion in the district court was based not on the merits but,\n\nrather, on Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)--the \"procedural escape hatch for\n\na party who genuinely requires additional time to marshal facts\n\nessential to justify [his] opposition.\" Paterson-Leitch Co. v.\n\nMass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 988 (1st Cir. 1988)\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted).    On appeal, however, he has\n\noffered no sustained argumentation in support of this issue and,\n\nthus, has forfeited it.   See, e.g., United States v. Jiminez, 498\n\nF.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           Even were we to consider the matter, Niemic would fall\n\nshort.   A party seeking to invoke Rule 56(f) must establish\n\n           (i) good cause for his inability to have\n           discovered or marshalled the necessary facts\n           earlier in the proceedings; (ii) a plausible\n           basis for believing that additional facts\n           probably exist and can be retrieved within a\n           reasonable time; and (iii) an explanation of\n           how those facts, if collected, will suffice to\n           defeat the pending summary judgment motion.\n\nRivera-Torres v. Rey-Hernandez, 502 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nAlso required is a demonstration of \"due diligence both in pursuing\n\ndiscovery before the summary judgment initiative surfaces and in\n\npursuing an extension of time thereafter.\"   Resolution Trust Corp.\n\nv. N. Bridge Assocs., Inc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir. 1994).   As\n\nNiemic has failed to satisfy several of these criteria, the denial\n\nof Rule 56(f) relief cannot be deemed an abuse of discretion.     We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n           Niemic cited three justifications for a postponement:\n\ndifficulty in accessing his legal papers; delayed access to medical\n\nrecords; and a \"ransacking\" of his prison cell.      The first, he\n\nexplained, was mainly due to his movement between prisons.     As to\n\nthe second, Niemic complained generally about requests for medical\n\nrecords or copies thereof being denied.       And the prison-cell\n\n                                -7-\n\fincident, which occurred in his absence shortly after the summary\n\njudgment motion arrived, allegedly resulted in his papers being\n\nstrewn about and several discovery requests going missing.\n\n            These reasons prove inadequate.                For one thing, Niemic\n\nacknowledged gaining access to all of his legal materials two and\n\none-half months before the summary judgment motion was filed.                   For\n\nanother, he not only failed to describe what medical records were\n\nallegedly withheld from him but, more important, failed to document\n\nthat any actually were withheld.                 The summary judgment motion\n\nitself was accompanied by over 300 pages of medical records, which\n\nNiemic has never described as being incomplete.                As to the alleged\n\nransacking, Niemic did not explain why any missing discovery\n\nrequests    could   not   have    been     promptly    redrafted    and   served.\n\nMoreover, the grievance he filed in connection with that incident\n\nonly complained of missing jewelry, not missing papers.\n\n            More generally, Niemic never explained in his Rule 56(f)\n\nfilings what additional facts likely existed or how they would be\n\nmaterial.     Nor   did   he     attempt    to   do   so    thereafter.    It    is\n\nnoteworthy that, in the wake of the summary judgment ruling, he\n\nasserted several times that he finally had gained complete access\n\n\"to his own (long sought) medical and legal records\" and that,\n\nbased thereon, a genuine issue of material fact \"could easily be\n\nshown.\"     But he never endeavored to make such a showing, either\n\nbelow or on appeal.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f           In a final argument, Niemic faults the district court for\n\nnot advising him of the Rule 56 requirements, particularly \"the\n\nnecessity of filing affidavits.\"         Yet a court is under no duty to\n\ntutor a pro se litigant. Moreover, Niemic's professed ignorance is\n\nbelied by the record.     Approximately six months before the summary\n\njudgment   motion   was   filed   (and   twelve   months   before   it   was\n\ndecided), he submitted a document citing Rule 56(f) and stating\n\nthat, because of incomplete discovery, he was not then in a\n\nposition to \"submit[] the necessary affidavits or other evidence to\n\noppose\" a summary judgment motion.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

On the basis of the extant record, an award of summary\n\njudgment for the medical defendants was plainly justified.                    Niemic\n\nadvances a two-pronged Eighth Amendment challenge.                       First, he\n\ncontends that defendants inadequately treated his migraines and\n\nthereby   effectively      caused   him   to    terminate       his    hepatitis   C\n\ntreatment (since the side-effects thereof aggravated the migraine\n\npain).    Yet it is undisputed that, over a span of two and one-half\n\nyears, some 21 different medications were prescribed in an effort\n\nto   address    Niemic's   headaches.

Niemic's chief remonstrance appears to be directed at\n\ndefendants' refusal to continue him on a narcotic with which he was\n\ninitially treated.         Yet \"disagreement as to the appropriate course\n\nof treatment ... [is] insufficient to prove a constitutional\n\nviolation.\" Ruiz-Rosa v.

The\n\nrecord establishes that defendants' \"common practice\" is to require\n\nthat patients abstain from the use of illegal substances for one\n\nyear prior to receiving such treatment.           Niemic provides no basis\n\nto question the medical justification for this practice; indeed,\n\nthe (Mason) affidavit on which he relies supports such an approach.\n\n               Niemic's cursory challenge to the finding of substance\n\nabuse also falls short, especially since the urinalysis lab report\n\nconfirmed the presence of cocaine and morphine.           On appeal, Niemic\n\nrelies    on    a   1987   state   court   document   addressing   urinalysis\n\ntesting, but he did not do so below and, in any event, has not\n\nexplained its relevance.\n\n               Niemic's principal objection to the summary judgment\n\nmotion in the district court was based not on the merits but,\n\nrather, on Fed.

As\n\nNiemic has failed to satisfy several of these criteria, the denial\n\nof Rule 56(f) relief cannot be deemed an abuse of discretion.     We\n\nexplain briefly.\n\n           Niemic cited three justifications for a postponement:\n\ndifficulty in accessing his legal papers; delayed access to medical\n\nrecords; and a \"ransacking\" of his prison cell.      The first, he\n\nexplained, was mainly due to his movement between prisons.     As to\n\nthe second, Niemic complained generally about requests for medical\n\nrecords or copies thereof being denied.       And the prison-cell\n\n                                -7-\n\fincident, which occurred in his absence shortly after the summary\n\njudgment motion arrived, allegedly resulted in his papers being\n\nstrewn about and several discovery requests going missing.\n\n            These reasons prove inadequate.                For one thing, Niemic\n\nacknowledged gaining access to all of his legal materials two and\n\none-half months before the summary judgment motion was filed.                   For\n\nanother, he not only failed to describe what medical records were\n\nallegedly withheld from him but, more important, failed to document\n\nthat any actually were withheld.                 The summary judgment motion\n\nitself was accompanied by over 300 pages of medical records, which\n\nNiemic has never described as being incomplete.                As to the alleged\n\nransacking, Niemic did not explain why any missing discovery\n\nrequests    could   not   have    been     promptly    redrafted    and   served.\n\nMoreover, the grievance he filed in connection with that incident\n\nonly complained of missing jewelry, not missing papers.\n\n            More generally, Niemic never explained in his Rule 56(f)\n\nfilings what additional facts likely existed or how they would be\n\nmaterial.     Nor   did   he     attempt    to   do   so    thereafter.    It    is\n\nnoteworthy that, in the wake of the summary judgment ruling, he\n\nasserted several times that he finally had gained complete access\n\n\"to his own (long sought) medical and legal records\" and that,\n\nbased thereon, a genuine issue of material fact \"could easily be\n\nshown.\"     But he never endeavored to make such a showing, either\n\nbelow or on appeal.\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f           In a final argument, Niemic faults the district court for\n\nnot advising him of the Rule 56 requirements, particularly \"the\n\nnecessity of filing affidavits.\"         Yet a court is under no duty to\n\ntutor a pro se litigant. Moreover, Niemic's professed ignorance is\n\nbelied by the record.     Approximately six months before the summary\n\njudgment   motion   was   filed   (and   twelve   months   before   it   was\n\ndecided), he submitted a document citing Rule 56(f) and stating\n\nthat, because of incomplete discovery, he was not then in a\n\nposition to \"submit[] the necessary affidavits or other evidence to\n\noppose\" a summary judgment motion.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f</pre>",
