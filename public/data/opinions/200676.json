This appeal concerns the scope of\n\nrestitution that may be awarded under the Mandatory Victim Witness\n\nRestitution Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3663A (\"MVRA\").          Defendant William E.\n\nCorey (\"Corey\") appeals the district court's order directing him to\n\npay more than $42,000 in restitution to Farm Credit of Maine (\"Farm\n\nCredit\"), a lending institution he stands guilty of defrauding. We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            The case arises from a fraudulent loan application.         On\n\nJuly 26, 1997, Corey submitted an application to Farm Credit for a\n\ncredit    line   loan   supported   by    documents   containing   material\n\nmisrepresentations about his credit status, including, inter alia,\n\na sham social security number, falsified letters of credit, and\n\nfederal income tax returns with substantial inaccuracies.               On\n\nSeptember 5, 1997, Farm Credit granted Corey a line of credit in\n\nthe amount of $54,997.      Corey borrowed the full amount authorized\n\nunder the loan.\n\n            From the outset, Corey failed to make loan repayments to\n\nFarm Credit.     In August 1998, Farm Credit foreclosed on the loan\n\nand obtained $22,500 in gross proceeds from the auction of real\n\nproperty that collateralized the credit line.              Eventually, on\n\nOctober 6, 1998, Farm Credit moved the account into non-accrual\n\nstatus.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f             In due course, the government charged Corey with bank\n\nfraud, see 18 U.S.C. § 1344, in a one-count information.1              On July\n\n18, 2001, Corey pleaded guilty to the information.                    Prior to\n\nsentencing, the probation department filed with the district court\n\na presentence report proposing a restitution award of $44,152.43.\n\nThe proposed award had four components: (1) a net loss on the loan\n\nof $28,925; (2) legal expenses of $8,910.01; (3) prejudgment\n\ninterest in the amount of $4,292.42; and (4) real estate sale costs\n\nof $2,025.      The government concurred in the probation department's\n\nproposal, but Corey objected to it to the extent that it proposed\n\ncompensating Farm Credit for losses other than its net loss on the\n\nloan.    In Corey's view, the other damages were \"consequential\" and\n\nthus beyond the reach of the MVRA.\n\n             In   pressing   his   objection,   Corey   relied   on    several\n\ndecisions from other circuits holding that the MVRA bars collateral\n\nconsequential damages in a restitution award.            At issue in those\n\n\n\n     1\n         18 U.S.C. § 1344 provides:\n\n          Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a\n          scheme or artifice--\n\n          (1)     to defraud a financial institution; or\n          (2)     to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets,\n                  securities, or other property owned by, or under the\n                  custody or control of, a financial institution, by\n                  means    of   false    or   fraudulent    pretenses,\n                  representations, or promises;    shall be fined not\n                  more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30\n                  years, or both.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcases was the scope of 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(b)(1), which pertains to\n\noffenses \"resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property\n\n. . .\"   In pertinent part, the statute states that a restitution\n\naward should be the greater of \"(I) the value of the property on\n\nthe date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or (II) the value of\n\nthe property on the date of sentencing, less [ ] the value (as of\n\nthe date the property is returned) of any part of the property that\n\nis returned.\"      As Corey correctly observed, courts have read this\n\nlanguage as limiting restitution awards to \"direct\" losses and\n\nprecluding the inclusion of \"consequential\" damages.             See e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Seward, 272 F.3d 831, 839 (7th Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Mikolajczyk, 137 F.3d 237, 245-46 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n          The government responded that the losses in question were\n\ndirectly related to the loan and, as such, recoverable.                   To\n\nestablish this link, the government presented the testimony of a\n\nbank official familiar with the Corey transaction.          A Farm Credit\n\nsenior vice president testified about the nature of Farm Credit's\n\nlosses. He stated that the bank suffered (1) foreclosure expenses;\n\n(2) $2,000    in   expenses   for   a   \"disclosure   hearing\"   to    gather\n\ninformation   about    Corey's   financial    position;   and    (3)    legal\n\nexpenses associated with Corey's bankruptcy, including a petition\n\nto release the collateral Corey used to secure the loan from the\n\nbankruptcy estate.      He also testified that the bank's costs from\n\nits sale of the secured collateral included auctioneer's fees and\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fpublication expenses. Finally, he stated that with respect to lost\n\ninterest, Farm Credit determined (on August 6, 1998) that the Corey\n\nloan was non-earning and, two months later the bank transferred the\n\nloan to non-accrual status.            The district court rejected Corey's\n\nargument that the MVRA permitted it only to award restitution for\n\nthe loan    principal.     The court found the cases Corey cited to be\n\ninapposite because Corey had not caused a loss or destruction of\n\nproperty within the meaning of § 3663A(b)(1).                      The court then\n\nlooked to the statutory definition of \"victim\" -- \"person directly\n\nand   proximately    harmed       as   a   result     of   the   commission    of   an\n\noffense,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(2) -- and concluded that a compensable\n\nloss includes all losses \"proximately caused\" by the subject\n\ncriminal conduct.        Applying this rationale and relying on the\n\ntestimony    summarized      in    the      preceding      paragraph,   the    court\n\nconcluded   that    Farm     Credit's       legal     expenses    and   prejudgment\n\ninterest    were    within    the      zone      of   foreseeability     and    thus\n\nrecoverable under the statute.               But the court was not persuaded\n\nthat Farm Credit's sales costs were proximately caused by Corey's\n\noffense and thus declined to award $2,025 in auctioneer's fees. In\n\nthe end, the court imposed a $42,127.43 restitution obligation.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                           II.\n\n            Although he presses it from a number of angles, Corey\n\nbases this appeal on an argument that the district court exceeded\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fits statutory authority when it compensated Farm Credit for its\n\nattorneys' fees and for the prejudgment interest it lost on Corey's\n\naccount.     Corey's thesis is straightforward: attorney's fees and\n\ninterest are not proper bases for a restitution award because they\n\nconstitute consequential damages -- i.e., \"such damage, loss, or\n\ninjury as does not flow directly and immediately from the act of\n\nthe party, but only from some of the consequences or results of\n\nsuch act.\"     Black's Law Dictionary 390 96th ed. 1990).           As he did\n\nbelow, he points to precedent from other circuits holding that\n\nattorney's fees and interest constitute impermissible consequential\n\ndamages.     See, e.g., Seward, 272 F.3d at 839.\n\n             While we have no quarrel with the abstract proposition\n\nthat unforeseeable consequential damages are beyond the scope of\n\nthe MVRA, Corey's one-size-fits-all categorical approach is not\n\nwell suited to carrying out the statute's purposes.               In the end,\n\nthe question is really whether the damages for which the district\n\ncourt awarded restitution were \"reasonably foreseeable\" to Corey.\n\nSee United States v. Collins, 209 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1999).            And\n\nin our view, the court permissibly concluded that they were.\n\n           As the district court concluded, Corey's restitution\n\norder   fell   within   the   compass   of   §   3663A,   which   requires   a\n\ndefendant to \"make restitution to the victim of the offense.\" 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3663A.     Under the statutory framework, sentencing courts\n\nwield considerable discretion \"to reach an expeditious, reasonable\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdetermination of appropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties\n\nwith a view toward achieving fairness to the victim.\"      S. Rep. No.\n\n97-532, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2515, 2537; United States v.\n\nBenjamin, 30 F.3d 196, 198 (1st Cir. 1994).     This broad discretion\n\nenables courts to resolve the complicated issues that may arise\n\nduring loss determinations.     United States v. Minneman, 143 F.3d\n\n274, 284 (7th Cir. 1998).\n\n          As   we   have   previously   observed,   Congress   did   not\n\ncontemplate a purely formalistic approach when it widened the scope\n\nof restitutionary remedies by enacting the MVRA. See United States\n\nv. Vaknin, 112 F.3d 579, 588 (1st Cir. 1997) (interpreting the\n\nVWPA). Rather, the focus of the district court's inquiry should be\n\non the relationship between the victim's loss and the defendant's\n\ncrime.   Under the VWPA, we have adopted a \"but for\" standard of\n\ncausation for restitution that requires the government to show not\n\nonly that a particular loss would not have occurred but for the\n\nconduct underlying the offense of conviction, but also that the\n\ncausal nexus between the conduct and the loss is not too attenuated\n\n(either factually or temporally). The watchword is reasonableness.\n\n\"A sentencing court should undertake an individualized inquiry;\n\nwhat constitutes sufficient causation can only be determined case\n\nby case, in a fact-specific probe.\"      Id. (emphasis added).2\n\n\n     2\n        In United States v. Cutter, 313 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002),\nwe held that because the VWPA and the MVRA contain the identical\ncausation provision, the statutes should be interpreted in tandem.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f               Fraud is distinct from other traditional offenses against\n\nphysical property.          Fraud constitutes \"[a]n intentional perversion\n\nof the truth.\"         Black's Law Dictionary 660 (6th Ed. 1990).                      The\n\nsubject criminal conduct is thus the misrepresentation itself\n\nrather than the theft of some tangible good.                  Where there is fraud,\n\nthen, the concept of loss comprehends all reasonably foreseeable\n\ninjuries \"sustained by [the] victim as a result of the underlying\n\noffense.\"          18 U.S.C. § 3664; see, also, e.g., United States v.\n\nSolares, 236 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 2000)(holding the defendant\n\nresponsible for the totality of banks' losses from conspiracy to\n\ncash       counterfeit      checks    because       such   losses   were   reasonably\n\nforeseeable). Thus, the task before us is to determine whether the\n\nlosses       for    which    the     court    ordered      restitution     can    be    so\n\ncategorized.\n\n               We begin with the question of attorney's fees.                    As Corey\n\nargued, in the context of § 3663A(b)(1) and its predecessor, §\n\n3663(b)(1)3,         the    clear     weight       of   authority   has    held        that\n\nrestitution does not encompass attorney's fees.4                    But these cases\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       See note 2, above; see also United States v. Simmonds, 235\nF.3d 826, 832 n.2 (3d Cir. 2000) (comparing § 3663(b)(1) and §\n3663A(b)(1)). Although Congress broadened the scope of restitution\nwhen it enacted § 3663A, it did not change the requirement that the\nvictim's damages be limited to its actual loss.\n       4\n       Seward, 272 F.3d. at 839 (holding that restitution does not\ncomprehend attorney's and executor's fees \"incurred in fighting a\nfraudulent scheme\" in probate court because they are consequential\n\n                                             -8-\n\fdo not address situations, as here, where the attorney's fees were\n\npart of the intrinsic worth of the subject property.\n\n           As the district court observed, the statute contains no\n\nlanguage limiting a court's authority to determine the appropriate\n\namount of loss where the underlying crime does not involve damage\n\nto   property.   In    analogous   cases,   several   circuits   have   not\n\nconfined restitution under the MVRA to the strict replacement value\n\nof the property.5     Implicit in these decisions is that the concept\n\n\nrather than direct damages); United States v. Simmonds, 235 F.3d\n826, 834 (3d Cir. 2000) (determining that the VWPA unambiguously\nlimited restitution to \"'the value of property' lost, damaged or\ndestroyed as a result of the [defendant's] crimes.\"); Mikolajczyk,\n137 F.3d at 245-46 (including the victim's attorney's fees in\nrestitution where they were a direct result of the defendant's\nfraud rather than a voluntary act taken by the victim to recover\nproperty or damages); Government of Virgin Islands v. Davis, 43\nF.3d 41, 45-46 (3rd Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1123 (1995)\n(concluding that an award of restitution pursuant to VWPA cannot\ninclude litigation costs to recover balance of funds in bank\naccounts because such expense are too far removed from the\nunderlying criminal conduct); United States v. Mullins, 971 F.2d\n1138, 1147-48 (4th Cir. 1992) (declining, under the VWPA, to award\nattorney's and investigator's fees expended to recover equipment\nobtained through a false credit application); United States v.\nBarany, 884 F.2d 1255 (9th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1034\n(1990) (holding that insurance company's legal expenses from a\n\"wholly separate\" civil suit were not recoverable under the VWPA).\n      5\n       Cummings, 281 F.3d at 1053 (9th Cir. 2002) (upholding\nrestitution award that included the victim's attorney's fees and\nexpenses for separate state and international civil proceedings\nbecause they were not \"wholly separate\" from the government's\nprosecution of the defendant); United States v. Akbani, 151 F.3d\n774, 779-780 (8th Cir. 1998)(holding that attorney’s fees are\npermissible where the underlying offense does not involve loss or\ndestruction to physical property); United States v. Blackburn, 9\nF.3d 353, 359 (5th Cir. 1993) (holding that attorney's fees\nincurred in defending civil suit were recoverable because they\ndirectly resulted from the underlying offense); see also United\n\n                                   -9-\n\fof \"replacement value\" is different where physical property is not\n\ninvolved, and an attendant acknowledgment that attorney’s fees in\n\nthose limited cases may be within the compass of foreseeable\n\nlosses.    Corey's argument presumes a per se rule that all legal\n\nexpenses are impermissible under the MVRA.      We see no statutory\n\nbasis for such a rule.      Frequently, attorney's fees will not be\n\nrecoverable.    But the determination whether a loss is recoverable\n\nentails a fact-intensive inquiry that is best conceptualized in\n\nterms of foreseeability.\n\n           Here, there was evidence that led the court to conclude\n\nthat Farm Credit's legal expenses arose directly from Corey's\n\nfraud.    Corey's misrepresentations divested Farm Credit of its\n\nability to bargain with the real facts when it granted him a line\n\nof credit.     The loan was premised upon a sham and, as a matter of\n\ncourse, Farm Credit's response to that fraud entailed routine legal\n\nexpenses that are necessarily incurred when a heavily regulated\n\nsecured lender mitigates its losses by foreclosing on collateral.\n\nThe fees at issue here are thus entirely different in kind from\n\nthose incurred where a crime victim initiates a civil lawsuit on\n\nthe basis of the underlying offense.     Barany, 884 F.2d at 1261.\n\n             The same reasoning defeats Corey's argument that the\n\ndistrict court erred by including prejudgment interest in its\n\n\nStates v. Patty, 992 F.2d 1045, 1049 (10th Cir. 1993) (concluding\nthat attorney’s fees may be recoverable under the VWPA if they are\ndirectly related to the defendant’s criminal conduct).\n\n                                 -10-\n\frestitution award.     Because the MVRA is silent on the issue of\n\nprejudgment interest, we turn to \"an appraisal of the congressional\n\npurpose.\"    Rodgers v. United States, 332 U.S. 371, 373 (1947).     The\n\nMVRA aims to provide victims with full and fair compensation,\n\nrendering the return of the principal loan amount inadequate\n\nbecause \"[f]oregone interest is one aspect of the victim's actual\n\nloss.\" United States v. Smith, 944 F.2d 618, 626 (9th Cir. 1991)\n\n(interpreting the VWPA).       Indeed, a majority of the circuits\n\naddressing the issue have held that restitution under the MVRA, or\n\nalternatively the VWPA, may include prejudgment interest. Id.\n\n(construing VWPA); Shepard, 269 F.3d at 886 (construing MVRA);\n\nDavis, 43 F.3d 47 (construing VWPA); United States v. Hoyle, 33\n\nF.3d 415 (5th Cir. 1994)(construing VWPA); Patty, 992 F.2d at 1050\n\n(construing VWPA); United States v. Rochester, 898 F.2d 971, 983\n\n(5th Cir. 1990) (construing VWPA).\n\n            In our view, placing prejudgment interest within the\n\ncategory of potentially recoverable losses in a restitution award\n\nis consistent with the MVRA.   As with attorney's fees, there are no\n\npredetermined wooden rules that govern whether prejudgment interest\n\non a loan falls within the ambit of a restitution award.         Rather,\n\nit is within the sound discretion of the district court to make\n\nthat determination.\n\n            Interest is the bread and butter of the business of any\n\nlending     institution.    \"Lost     interest   translates   into   lost\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fopportunities, as it reflects the victim's inability to use his or\n\nher money for productive purposes.\"   Davis, 43 F.3d at 47.   When\n\nFarm Credit, relying upon Corey's falsified application, loaned\n\nmoney to Corey, it presumably made a considered judgment about the\n\noptimal allocation of its resources, thereby passing up other\n\nrevenue-generating enterprises.   Accordingly there was sufficient\n\nevidence for the district court to find that Farm Credit's lost\n\ninterest was directly related to Corey's fraud.\n\n                              III.\n\n          Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the district court's\n\naward of restitution.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

This appeal concerns the scope of\n\nrestitution that may be awarded under the Mandatory Victim Witness\n\nRestitution Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3663A (\"MVRA\").          Defendant William E.\n\nCorey (\"Corey\") appeals the district court's order directing him to\n\npay more than $42,000 in restitution to Farm Credit of Maine (\"Farm\n\nCredit\"), a lending institution he stands guilty of defrauding. We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            The case arises from a fraudulent loan application.         On\n\nJuly 26, 1997, Corey submitted an application to Farm Credit for a\n\ncredit    line   loan   supported   by    documents   containing   material\n\nmisrepresentations about his credit status, including, inter alia,\n\na sham social security number, falsified letters of credit, and\n\nfederal income tax returns with substantial inaccuracies.               On\n\nSeptember 5, 1997, Farm Credit granted Corey a line of credit in\n\nthe amount of $54,997.      Corey borrowed the full amount authorized\n\nunder the loan.\n\n            From the outset, Corey failed to make loan repayments to\n\nFarm Credit.     In August 1998, Farm Credit foreclosed on the loan\n\nand obtained $22,500 in gross proceeds from the auction of real\n\nproperty that collateralized the credit line.              Eventually, on\n\nOctober 6, 1998, Farm Credit moved the account into non-accrual\n\nstatus.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f             In due course, the government charged Corey with bank\n\nfraud, see 18 U.S.C. § 1344, in a one-count information.1              On July\n\n18, 2001, Corey pleaded guilty to the information.                    Prior to\n\nsentencing, the probation department filed with the district court\n\na presentence report proposing a restitution award of $44,152.43.\n\nThe proposed award had four components: (1) a net loss on the loan\n\nof $28,925; (2) legal expenses of $8,910.01; (3) prejudgment\n\ninterest in the amount of $4,292.42; and (4) real estate sale costs\n\nof $2,025.      The government concurred in the probation department's\n\nproposal, but Corey objected to it to the extent that it proposed\n\ncompensating Farm Credit for losses other than its net loss on the\n\nloan.    In Corey's view, the other damages were \"consequential\" and\n\nthus beyond the reach of the MVRA.\n\n             In   pressing   his   objection,   Corey   relied   on    several\n\ndecisions from other circuits holding that the MVRA bars collateral\n\nconsequential damages in a restitution award.            At issue in those\n\n\n\n     1\n         18 U.S.C. § 1344 provides:\n\n          Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a\n          scheme or artifice--\n\n          (1)     to defraud a financial institution; or\n          (2)     to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets,\n                  securities, or other property owned by, or under the\n                  custody or control of, a financial institution, by\n                  means    of   false    or   fraudulent    pretenses,\n                  representations, or promises;    shall be fined not\n                  more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30\n                  years, or both.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcases was the scope of 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(b)(1), which pertains to\n\noffenses \"resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property\n\n. . .\"   In pertinent part, the statute states that a restitution\n\naward should be the greater of \"(I) the value of the property on\n\nthe date of the damage, loss, or destruction; or (II) the value of\n\nthe property on the date of sentencing, less [ ] the value (as of\n\nthe date the property is returned) of any part of the property that\n\nis returned.\"      As Corey correctly observed, courts have read this\n\nlanguage as limiting restitution awards to \"direct\" losses and\n\nprecluding the inclusion of \"consequential\" damages.             See e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Seward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775690\"><a href=\"/opinion/775690/united-states-v-laurence-seward/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839 (7th Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v.

To\n\nestablish this link, the government presented the testimony of a\n\nbank official familiar with the Corey transaction.          A Farm Credit\n\nsenior vice president testified about the nature of Farm Credit's\n\nlosses. He stated that the bank suffered (1) foreclosure expenses;\n\n(2) $2,000    in   expenses   for   a   \"disclosure   hearing\"   to    gather\n\ninformation   about    Corey's   financial    position;   and    (3)    legal\n\nexpenses associated with Corey's bankruptcy, including a petition\n\nto release the collateral Corey used to secure the loan from the\n\nbankruptcy estate.      He also testified that the bank's costs from\n\nits sale of the secured collateral included auctioneer's fees and\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fpublication expenses. Finally, he stated that with respect to lost\n\ninterest, Farm Credit determined (on August 6, 1998) that the Corey\n\nloan was non-earning and, two months later the bank transferred the\n\nloan to non-accrual status.            The district court rejected Corey's\n\nargument that the MVRA permitted it only to award restitution for\n\nthe loan    principal.     The court found the cases Corey cited to be\n\ninapposite because Corey had not caused a loss or destruction of\n\nproperty within the meaning of § 3663A(b)(1).                      The court then\n\nlooked to the statutory definition of \"victim\" -- \"person directly\n\nand   proximately    harmed       as   a   result     of   the   commission    of   an\n\noffense,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(2) -- and concluded that a compensable\n\nloss includes all losses \"proximately caused\" by the subject\n\ncriminal conduct.        Applying this rationale and relying on the\n\ntestimony    summarized      in    the      preceding      paragraph,   the    court\n\nconcluded   that    Farm     Credit's       legal     expenses    and   prejudgment\n\ninterest    were    within    the      zone      of   foreseeability     and    thus\n\nrecoverable under the statute.               But the court was not persuaded\n\nthat Farm Credit's sales costs were proximately caused by Corey's\n\noffense and thus declined to award $2,025 in auctioneer's fees. In\n\nthe end, the court imposed a $42,127.43 restitution obligation.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                           II.\n\n            Although he presses it from a number of angles, Corey\n\nbases this appeal on an argument that the district court exceeded\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fits statutory authority when it compensated Farm Credit for its\n\nattorneys' fees and for the prejudgment interest it lost on Corey's\n\naccount.     Corey's thesis is straightforward: attorney's fees and\n\ninterest are not proper bases for a restitution award because they\n\nconstitute consequential damages -- i.e., \"such damage, loss, or\n\ninjury as does not flow directly and immediately from the act of\n\nthe party, but only from some of the consequences or results of\n\nsuch act.\"     Black's Law Dictionary 390 96th ed. 1990).           As he did\n\nbelow, he points to precedent from other circuits holding that\n\nattorney's fees and interest constitute impermissible consequential\n\ndamages.     See, e.g., Seward, 272 F.3d at 839.\n\n             While we have no quarrel with the abstract proposition\n\nthat unforeseeable consequential damages are beyond the scope of\n\nthe MVRA, Corey's one-size-fits-all categorical approach is not\n\nwell suited to carrying out the statute's purposes.               In the end,\n\nthe question is really whether the damages for which the district\n\ncourt awarded restitution were \"reasonably foreseeable\" to Corey.\n\nSee United States v.

And\n\nin our view, the court permissibly concluded that they were.\n\n           As the district court concluded, Corey's restitution\n\norder   fell   within   the   compass   of   §   3663A,   which   requires   a\n\ndefendant to \"make restitution to the victim of the offense.\" 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3663A.     Under the statutory framework, sentencing courts\n\nwield considerable discretion \"to reach an expeditious, reasonable\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdetermination of appropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties\n\nwith a view toward achieving fairness to the victim.\"      S.

Corey's argument presumes a per se rule that all legal\n\nexpenses are impermissible under the MVRA.      We see no statutory\n\nbasis for such a rule.      Frequently, attorney's fees will not be\n\nrecoverable.

Corey's misrepresentations divested Farm Credit of its\n\nability to bargain with the real facts when it granted him a line\n\nof credit.     The loan was premised upon a sham and, as a matter of\n\ncourse, Farm Credit's response to that fraud entailed routine legal\n\nexpenses that are necessarily incurred when a heavily regulated\n\nsecured lender mitigates its losses by foreclosing on collateral.\n\nThe fees at issue here are thus entirely different in kind from\n\nthose incurred where a crime victim initiates a civil lawsuit on\n\nthe basis of the underlying offense.

Indeed, a majority of the circuits\n\naddressing the issue have held that restitution under the MVRA, or\n\nalternatively the VWPA, may include prejudgment interest.

As with attorney's fees, there are no\n\npredetermined wooden rules that govern whether prejudgment interest\n\non a loan falls within the ambit of a restitution award.         Rather,\n\nit is within the sound discretion of the district court to make\n\nthat determination.\n\n            Interest is the bread and butter of the business of any\n\nlending     institution.    \"Lost     interest   translates   into   lost\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fopportunities, as it reflects the victim's inability to use his or\n\nher money for productive purposes.\"   Davis, 43 F.3d at 47.   When\n\nFarm Credit, relying upon Corey's falsified application, loaned\n\nmoney to Corey, it presumably made a considered judgment about the\n\noptimal allocation of its resources, thereby passing up other\n\nrevenue-generating enterprises.   Accordingly there was sufficient\n\nevidence for the district court to find that Farm Credit's lost\n\ninterest was directly related to Corey's fraud.\n\n                              III.\n\n          Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the district court's\n\naward of restitution.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f</pre>",
