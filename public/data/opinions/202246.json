The parties in this case have\n\nbrought    what    are   effectively       cross-appeals        from   an   order   of\n\ndismissal entered by the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict    of    Massachusetts      on    March    23,   2005    (\"2005    District\n\nOrder\"), affirming the July 20, 2004 decision of the United States\n\nBankruptcy Court on second remand from the district court.\n\n     The dispute is between New Seabury Company Limited Partnership\n\n(the \"Debtor\") and New Seabury Properties, LLC (\"NSP\") over the\n\nDebtor's   claim    to   a   share    of    funds    in   the    Debtor's    general\n\noperating account (\"Operating Account\") following the Debtor's\n\ndeclaration of bankruptcy and the entry of a Stipulation between\n\nthe parties allowing the Debtor to retain the real estate brokerage\n\nsegment of the business while turning over its other assets to NSP.\n\n                     Procedural Background and Facts\n\n     The Debtor filed a Chapter 11 petition on March 31, 1997\n\npursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq.                 It owned and operated a\n\n2000-acre planned resort community in Mashpee, Massachusetts, known\n\nas \"New Seabury Resort.\"          The Debtor's business was made up of\n\nthree interrelated divisions:             the Recreation Division, the Hotel\n\nDivision, and the Real Estate Division.              The funds relative to the\n\ndivisions were commingled in the Debtor's single operating account.\n\nThe functions of the three divisions were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f     The Recreation Division maintained and operated two golf\n\ncourses and a golf club house, a tennis facility, a beach club, and\n\na swimming pool facility.\n\n     The Hotel Division managed and maintained a hotel facility\n\nusing Debtor and third-party-owned property for short term rental\n\nby guests of the New Seabury Resort.\n\n     The Real Estate Division operated a real estate brokerage (the\n\n\"Brokerage\").   The Brokerage operated one real estate company, New\n\nSeabury Real Estate, that sold Debtor and non-Debtor property on\n\nthe New Seabury Resort and another real estate company, Sound\n\nRealty, that brokered short-term and long-term rentals of property\n\nfor private individuals within New Seabury Resort.     Commissions\n\nprovided the Brokerage's primary source of revenue.   The Brokerage\n\nwas never a member of the Multiple Listing Service (\"MLS\") and, as\n\nthe exclusive broker, sold most of the property in New Seabury.\n\nMLS brokers not related to the Brokerage sold a small percentage of\n\nthe property; the Brokerage and unrelated MLS brokers would share\n\nsome sales.\n\n     During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Debtor and NSP offered\n\ncompeting plans for reorganization of the Debtor. On May 15, 1998,\n\nthe bankruptcy court entered an Order and Preliminary Decision\n\nstating that the Debtor's plan was not confirmable, but NSP's was.\n\nFor two days leading up to the confirmation hearing on May 29,\n\n1998, the Debtor and NSP engaged in negotiations to resolve the\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fdifferences between their competing plans.          Ultimately, on May 29,\n\nthe parties executed a stipulation (the \"Stipulation\"), pursuant to\n\nwhich the Debtor withdrew its own plan for reorganization.\n\n     The Stipulation noted that NSP's plan, to which the Debtor now\n\nconsented, provided for NSP to acquire substantially all of the\n\nDebtors' assets.      So as to resolve the parties' controversy,\n\nhowever, the Debtor and NSP stipulated that \"certain assets of the\n\nDebtor will not be acquired by NSP and will be retained by the\n\nDebtor free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims and\n\ninterest.\"      Thus, paragraph 9 of the Stipulation provided that\n\n\"[t]he real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business,\n\nincluding all licenses and permits required to operate that segment\n\nof the business, shall be retained by the Debtor.\"         Paragraph 10 of\n\nthe Stipulation went on to state that the parties would execute on\n\nthe plan's effective date (the \"Effective Date\") an agreement\n\ncontaining \"the following provisions, and failing the execution of\n\nsuch agreement the provisions as set forth herein shall constitute\n\nsuch agreement.\"\n\n     Clauses a, b, and c of paragraph 10 then provided that the\n\nDebtor, A + C Great Island, Inc., and Christopher Burden would\n\nretain a non-exclusive license to use the requested trade name \"New\n\nSeabury\"   in   connection   with   real   estate   brokerage   operations\n\nconducted by one or more of them for as long as Burden or his\n\nfamily maintained a majority ownership interest or were involved in\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fdaily operations.      The license would include the right to use the\n\nNew   Seabury   name   in   marketing    materials.     Additionally,    the\n\nBrokerage operations were to have access to all resort amenities,\n\nincluding related pictures and information, in its marketing and\n\nother   material   for   viewing   and    touring,    with   specified   free\n\nmembership rights to be granted to Christopher and Nancy Burden in\n\nthe New Seabury Club.         Non-exclusive signage rights were also\n\ngranted to the Brokerage operations relating to real estate service\n\noperations in NSP's post-confirmation New Seabury related property,\n\nwith various limitations spelled out as to the form and location of\n\nthe signage, its acceptability to the Debtor and NSP, and changes\n\ndesired by NSP.\n\n      Paragraph 11 of the Stipulation also contained details and\n\nlimitations relative to the retained Brokerage operation.                The\n\nDebtor would retain certain specified real property on which real\n\nestate service operations are conducted, including the main New\n\nSeabury real estate office and adjacent parking facilities, and\n\ncertain other parcels.      On and for a two-year period following the\n\nEffective Date, the Debtor was to allow NSP use of three desks on\n\none of these parcels rent-free, along with certain spelled-out\n\nrights to install phone lines and place its own reasonable office\n\nequipment.   Properties to be retained by the Debtor were to be free\n\nand clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims and interests with\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fadditional conditions specified as to a particular note held by\n\nBurden and a mortgage on one parcel.\n\n     Paragraph 12 of the Stipulation provided for execution by the\n\nparties of a limited non-competition agreement prohibiting NSP and\n\nits assignees, successors, and assigns from engaging in real estate\n\nbrokerage within New Seabury, except as to its own properties, and\n\nthe Debtor, A + C Great Island and Burden from engaging in resort\n\noperations within the boundaries of the New Seabury development and\n\nwithin a three-mile radius.         Nothing, however, was to prohibit NSP\n\nfrom employing a broker of its choice to market its properties.\n\n     Paragraph 13 specified that \"except as provided herein and\n\nexcept as to the obligations of NSP under the NSP Plan,\" all\n\nparties \"shall be deemed to have remised, released and forever\n\ndischarged     against   the      other    any   and    all   debts,   demands,\n\nobligations, avoidance actions, causes of action and any other\"\n\nclaims, through the Effective Date of the NSP plan.\n\n     The remaining paragraphs of the Stipulation dealt with the\n\ndischarge of debts, providing, inter alia, that NSP did not release\n\nits debts against the Debtor and that Burden released certain of\n\nhis debts.\n\n     Nothing    was   said   in    the    Stipulation    as   to   retention   or\n\nownership of monies held in the Debtor's operating account.                    In\n\nparticular, there was no reference to the disposition of any sums\n\ntherein derived from real estate brokerage activities.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f     At a hearing, the bankruptcy court confirmed NSP's plan and\n\nentered a formal order on June 15, 1998 (the \"Confirmation Date\").\n\nAfter the Confirmation Date, the Debtor continued to operate the\n\nBrokerage.\n\n     During   the   preparation   of    the   documents   to    close   the\n\ntransaction transferring the bulk of the Debtor's assets to NSP, a\n\ndispute arose regarding whether the Debtor was entitled to receive\n\nand retain the net cash the Brokerage had generated through the\n\nEffective Date of NSP's plan (the \"Disputed Funds\").             As noted,\n\nrevenue from the Brokerage operations was commingled with that from\n\nthe Debtor's two other divisions in a single Operating Account.\n\n     In order to complete the closing, the documents specifically\n\nexcluded the Disputed Funds pending resolution of the parties'\n\nrights (the specific language is quoted below).                The parties\n\nexecuted the final closing documents on September 17, 1998 (the\n\n\"Closing\"), which was also the Effective Date of the reorganization\n\nplan.   The bill of sale provided that the Debtor agreed to sell all\n\nof the Debtor's rights and title but specifically excluded:\n\n     (i) any assets being retained by New Seabury Company\n     Limited Partnership pursuant to the Stipulation Relating\n     to Competing Plans of Reorganization, Objections to\n     Confirmation, Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for\n     Plan Partnership, entered into on May 29, 1998 (the\n     \"Stipulation\"); (ii) telephone number (508) 477-9400\n     pending a further determination of the Debtor's right to\n     retain that number; and (iii) property, assets and\n     rights, generated by or associated with the Seller's Real\n     Estate Brokerage Operations (the \"Brokerage Operations\")\n     including net cash generated by the Brokerage Operations\n     from January 1, 1998 through September 16, 1998 in the\n\n                                  -7-\n\f     amount of $553,762.00, as estimated by the Seller which\n     amount shall remain in the Debtor's account in its\n     entirety until such time as the Court adjudicates the\n     rights of the Seller and NSP thereto, or until further\n     agreement of the parties, and any Purchased Assets\n     described on Schedules \"B,\" \"C,\" \"D\" and \"E\" hereto).\n\n     After the Closing, the Debtor retained the desks, computers,\n\nfixtures, independent contractor agreements, marketing materials,\n\nfurniture and other equipment at the Brokerage.              Pursuant to the\n\nStipulation, the Debtor retained the real property in which the\n\nBrokerage conducts business.\n\n     NSP moved for an order to compel the Debtor to transfer the\n\nDisputed Funds.      The Debtor resisted, contending that the Disputed\n\nFunds were an asset of the Brokerage which, under the terms of the\n\nStipulation,    it    was   entitled    to   retain.    It    insisted    that\n\nbrokerage-related revenues kept in the Operating Account went to\n\nthe Debtor by implication under paragraph 9 of the Stipulation,\n\nwhich allowed the Debtor to retain \"the real estate brokerage\n\nsegment   of   the   Debtor's   business.\"       NSP   responded   that   the\n\nStipulation made no reference to retention by the Debtor of any\n\nportion of the Operating Account, hence the Disputed Funds belonged\n\nto NSP.\n\nA.   The Bankruptcy Court's First Order\n\n     The bankruptcy court agreed that the language of paragraph 9\n\ndid not permit the Debtor to retain any portion of the Operating\n\nAccount, hence the Disputed Funds became the property of NSP.              In\n\nits March 11, 1999 Order on the case, the bankruptcy court analyzed\n\n                                       -8-\n\fparagraph 9 of the Stipulation and the Bill of Sale and concluded\n\nthat the two documents could not \"be read to transfer or permit the\n\nDebtor to retain any portion of the General Operating Account.\"\n\nParagraph 9 of the Stipulation reads:\n\n     The real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's\n     business, including all licenses and permits required to\n     operate that segment of the business, shall be retained\n     by the Debtor.\n\nThe pertinent part of the subsequent Bill of Sale reads:\n\n     [T]he   Purchased   Assets   conveyed   to  New   Seabury\n     Properties, LLC shall specifically exclude (i) any assets\n     being retained by New Seabury Company Limited Partnership\n     pursuant to the Stipulation Relating to Competing Plans\n     of Reorganization, Objections to Confirmation, Motion for\n     Reconsideration and Motion for Plan Modification between\n     New Seabury Properties, LLC and New Seabury Company\n     Limited Partnership, entered into on May 29, 1998 (ii)\n     telephone number (508) 477-9400 pending a further\n     determination of the Debtor's right to retain that number\n     and (iii) property, assets and rights, generated by or\n     associated with the Debtor's Real Estate Brokerage\n     Operations including net cash generated by the Brokerage\n     Operations from January 1, 1998 through September 16,\n     1998 in the amount of $553,762, as estimated by the\n     Seller which amount shall remain in the Debtor's account\n     in its entirety until such time as the Court adjudicates\n     the rights of the Seller and NSP thereto, or until\n     further agreement of the parties . . . .\n\nThe bankruptcy court wrote:\n\n     3.      The   Bill   of   Sale   dated   September    5,\n     1998 . . . provides in pertinent part as follows:\n\n          [T]he Purchased Assets conveyed to New Seabury\n          Properties,     LLC    shall     specifically\n          exclude . . . (iii) property, assets and\n          rights, generated by or associated with the\n          Debtor's Real Estate Brokerage Operations from\n          January 1, 1998 through September 16, 1998 in\n          the amount of $553,762, as estimated by the\n          Seller which amount shall remain the Debtor's\n\n                               -9-\n\f           account in its entirety until such time as the\n           Court adjudicates the rights of the Seller and\n           NSP thereto, or until further agreement of the\n           parties . . .\n\n     4. Paragraph 9 [of the Stipulation] [supra] . . . cannot\n     be read to transfer or to permit the Debtor to retain any\n     portion of the General Operating Account.\n\nThe bankruptcy court found that \"[b]ased on the language of the May\n\n29th Stipulation and the Bill of Sale, the Disputed Funds are\n\nproperty of NSP and NSP is entitled to possession thereof.\"      The\n\nDebtor appealed to the district court from the bankruptcy court's\n\nOrder.\n\nB.   The District Court's First Order on Appeal\n\n     The district court, in its October 21, 1999 Memorandum &\n\nOrder, concurred with the bankruptcy court that the contract\n\ndocuments were unambiguous1 but read the contract language as\n\nmandating a different outcome from that reached by the bankruptcy\n\njudge. Analogizing the situation to the construction of wills, the\n\ndistrict court noted that\n\n     [c]ourts have consistently concluded that a business\n     cannot be considered separately from the funds used to\n     run it . . . . I see no reason to come to a contrary\n     conclusion in respect of the brokerage operations here.\n     Its cash assets were part of the business and, as in any\n     business, are necessary to keep it operating.\n\nThe district judge looked to the language in paragraph 9 of the\n\nStipulation providing for retention of the Brokerage segment of the\n\n\n      1\n      Neither party contends that the Stipulation (or other\nrelevant contract document, if any) is ambiguous.        We see no\noccasion, therefore, to pass on that possibility, and do not do so.\n\n                               -10-\n\fbusiness, including all licenses and the permits required to\n\noperate that segment, and found that the list was \"an inclusive,\n\nrather than exclusive matter.\"      He stated that it was \"improbable\n\nthat the licenses and permits were the only assets\" retained by the\n\nDebtor and that the \"term brokerage operations itself indicates\n\nthat at least those assets essential to running the operations\n\nshould be retained\" by the Debtor.        He held that the cash assets of\n\nthe Brokerage were part of the business and were necessary to keep\n\nthe business operating, but specifically did not \"reach the issue\n\nas to whether any of the funds in the [Operating] [A]ccount were\n\ntruly attributable to the [Brokerage].\" The district court's Order\n\nremanded the case and directed the bankruptcy court \"to determine\n\nthe amount of cash in the general operating account which is\n\nattributable to the brokerage operations.\"\n\nC.   The Bankruptcy Court's Order on the First Remand\n\n     On remand, the bankruptcy court conducted a three-day trial.\n\nIt concluded first that the calculations of the amount in the fund\n\nwere to begin on January 1, 1998.         Determination of the amount to\n\nwhich each of the parties was entitled required consideration of\n\nthree   elements:    the   total    amount     of   Disputed   Funds;   the\n\napplication of real estate credits given to parties who bought real\n\nestate through the Brokerage; and the application of certain other\n\ncosts, which are discussed below.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f      In a pretrial stipulation in the bankruptcy court, entered\n\ninto prior to the hearing on remand, the parties had agreed that\n\nthe maximum amount of the Disputed Funds that the Debtor could\n\nrecover was the net revenue that the Brokerage earned from January\n\n1, 1998 until September 18, 1998, or $479,457, and that the amount\n\ninclusive of the Credits and Charges would be $55,670.\n\n      The Debtor offered parties that purchased real estate through\n\nthe Brokerage a \"credit\" (the \"Credit\" or the \"Credits\").                 The\n\npurchasers of the property could apply the Credit towards the\n\ninitiation fee required of new members to join the New Seabury\n\nCountry Club (the \"Club\").      The Recreation Division ran the Club.\n\nMembership in the Club enabled a member to use its facilities,\n\nincluding the golf courses.            The amount of the Credit was a\n\npercentage of the commission and could be applied towards the\n\ninitiation fee for as long as the homeowner remained a property\n\nowner at New Seabury Resort. Credits exercised during the relevant\n\nperiod totaled $298,866.\n\n      The \"real estate carrying costs\" (the \"Charges\") were costs\n\nassociated with unsold property of the Debtor such as landscaping\n\ncosts,   depreciation    and   condo    fees.     The     unsold   properties\n\nthemselves were placed under control of the Hotel Division and used\n\nas   short   term   rentals.   The     parties   agreed    in   the   pretrial\n\nstipulation that for the period of January 1, 1998 to September 17,\n\n1998, the Charges totaled $124,921.\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f     The Debtor historically maintained consolidated financial\n\nstatements for all of its revenue producing entities, including New\n\nSeabury Real Estate, Sound Realty, and the Club.             When homeowners\n\nutilized the Credits and joined the Club, the Debtor recorded the\n\ntotal amount of the initiation fee, including the Credit, as income\n\nto the Resort Division.       The Debtor recorded the amount of the\n\nCredit as an expense to the Real Estate Division at the time of its\n\nexercise.    The Charges were also treated as an expense of the\n\nBrokerage.      The bankruptcy court held that, treating the Brokerage\n\nas a separate entity, the historic treatment of the Credits and\n\nCharges   was    inappropriate   to    its    determination.        It   adopted\n\ntestimony    from   expert   witnesses       as   to   applicable   accounting\n\nprinciples and concluded that \"the Recreation Division would have\n\nrecorded both the income and expense of the Credit and, in essence,\n\nrecorded the transaction as a reduced price sale,\" and that the\n\nCharges were \"properly attributable to the Hotel Division for the\n\nCharges bore no relationship to the Brokerage.\"                The bankruptcy\n\ncourt ultimately concluded that the Debtor was entitled to the\n\nentire $479,457 of the Disputed Funds.\n\n     A second appeal to the district court followed.\n\nD.   The District Court's Second Order and Remand\n\n     In its March 5, 2004 Memorandum & Order, the district court\n\nreaffirmed its earlier ruling that cash in the Operating Account\n\nattributable to the Brokerage operation formed a part of the\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fBrokerage segment of Debtor's business which the Debtor was allowed\n\nto retain under the Stipulation.   However, it was unsatisfied with\n\nthe accounting rationale accepted by the bankruptcy court based\n\nupon a methodology not historically followed in the Debtor's own\n\nconsolidated financial statements.      Accordingly, it remanded for\n\nrecalculation of the sums applicable to the brokerage segment, the\n\nrecalculation to be based on the original accounting methodology,\n\nsee supra.   The court suggested this would lead the parties to the\n\n$55,970 figure earlier stipulated to in the bankruptcy court or to\n\n$83,846, the net income of the Real Estate Division reflected in\n\nearlier accounting statements.\n\n     In once again grappling with the case, the district court also\n\nnoted its own dissatisfaction with its earlier rationale for\n\nconcluding that cash traceable to real estate brokerage operations\n\nshould be treated as a part of the retained assets to which the\n\nDebtor was entitled.   The district court wrote:\n\n     Further reflection has persuaded me that this case law\n     [i.e., that resting on testamentary dispositions of\n     businesses] is not fully sufficient to support my earlier\n     conclusion.      Wills   involve   different   modes   of\n     construction than arm's-length commercial transactions,\n     let alone settlements in bankruptcy proceedings, because\n     the relationships between the parties, the ultimate goals\n     of the instruments, and the interpretive goals of the\n     court differ . . . .      In sum, courts are likely to\n     construe a bequest generously, because the testator\n     manifestly sought to give something of value to a worthy\n     beneficiary, and because any verbal missteps in the will\n     are neither the beneficiary's fault, nor errors against\n     which    the    beneficiary    could    have    protected\n     himself . . . .    A Chapter 11 bankrupt cannot fairly\n     claim the benefits of this analogy; it is, after all, not\n\n                                 -14-\n\f     a deserving child inheriting the family business, but\n     rather an insolvent permitted to remain in business for\n     the benefit of creditors. Nevertheless, the bankruptcy\n     court   should  treat   the   writings  surrounding   a\n     reorganization with an eye toward the equities of\n     reorganization.\n\nThe district court went on to affirm its conclusion that the term\n\n\"business\"   in   the     Stipulation   necessarily    included    cash   by\n\nreference    to   other    modes   of   analysis,     including    contract\n\ninterpretation, but noted that it was essentially performing a\n\n\"functional analysis of the parties' arrangement.\"\n\n     While it acknowledged that the relevant documents did not\n\nexplicitly mention cash as among the assets to be retained by the\n\nDebtor and that \"[a] reading of the Stipulation that excludes cash\n\nmight be consistent with the absence of a negotiated cash valuation\n\nmethod, and the bankruptcy context in which the primary goal is to\n\npay back the Debtor's creditors,\" the district court nonetheless\n\nconcluded that \"the loss should lie with NSP, because it was in a\n\nbetter position to protect its interests by writing more detailed\n\ncontractual language, and because its theory of the limits of a\n\n'business' does not lead to a coherent resolution.\"               The court\n\nadditionally noted that:\n\n     [t]he general rubrics for construction of analogous\n     writings do not provide a full answer to the question.\n     Nor does general business practice. A business may be\n     conveyed in a variety of states -- all assets, all assets\n     except cash, all nonliquid assets, goodwill and\n     intellectual and real property only, goodwill only, and\n     so on -- and therefore the answer must necessarily turn\n     on the degree that any default position has been refined.\n     In this context, the Debtor draws a simple and coherent\n\n                                   -15-\n\f      line: a 'business' includes all its assets unless stated\n      otherwise. NSP, having asserted that the line actually\n      falls somewhere inside the set of business assets, must\n      provide a logical place in which to draw it, but has not\n      done so.\n\n      On the issue of the proper way to account for the cash it\n\nfound Debtor was entitled to retain, the district court noted that\n\nwhile historically, the Debtor had recorded the initiation fee at\n\nthe country club as income to the Recreation Division, it had\n\nrecorded the amount of the credit as a loss to the Real Estate\n\ndivision.    In August 1998, after the Stipulation had been executed\n\nand   the   plan    had     been   confirmed,         the   Debtor's   principal,\n\nChristopher Burden, told his accountant to \"rework the figures for\n\nthe Real Estate Operations.\" The new accounting treated initiation\n\nfee credits as losses to the Recreation Division, not the Real\n\nEstate Division.         The effect of this new accounting system was to\n\nincrease    the    net    income   of   the    Real    Estate   Division   on   the\n\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\n      The district court concluded that, under its new analysis\n\nbased on the parties' intent to form a contract, it was only\n\npermissible for NSP to be found to have assented to the terms of\n\nthe bargain it could reasonably foresee.                     The district court\n\nobserved that NSP could not have foreseen the Debtor's change in\n\naccounting methodology:        \"It is one thing for a court to hold NSP\n\nto the reasonably foreseeable consequences of its ill-defined\n\nbargain with the Debtor; it is quite another for the court to hold\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fNSP to terms that could not possibly have been on the table.\"            The\n\ndistrict court thus vacated the bankruptcy court's calculation of\n\nthe    cash   attributable   to   the    Debtor   and   remanded   for    a\n\nrecalculation under the original accounting methodology.\n\n      The district court concluded:\n\n      If by March 22, 2004, the parties are unable to agree\n      upon a stipulated figure, I will remand to the Bankruptcy\n      Court to determine the amount of cash attributable to the\n      brokerage, using, January 1, 1998 as a start date, but\n      applying the accounting methodologies employed by the\n      Debtor on the date the Plan was confirmed. [footnote 13]\n      The parties shall file a status report by no later than\n      March 24, 2004 regarding the issues to be resolved. In\n      all other respects, the decision of the Bankruptcy Court\n      is AFFIRMED.\n\nIn the cited footnote, the district court stated:\n\n       I assume that the parties or the Bankruptcy Court will\n       naturally gravitate towards either the $55,670 figure in\n       the parties' joint pretrial stipulation, or $83,846, the\n       net income of the Real Estate Division reflected on\n       Debtor's financial statements, which treated both the\n       real estate credits and the carrying costs as losses to\n       the Real Estate Division. However, the parties and, if\n       necessary, the Bankruptcy Court are free to determine\n       the appropriate number under the former methodology\n       based on an independent review of the financial data.\n       If the parties are unable to agree, the Bankruptcy Court\n       may, but need not, receive new evidence beyond what has\n       already been presented to it.\n\nThe parties' status report indicated that:\n\n      In light of footnote 13 of the Memorandum and Order, NSP\n      offered to stipulate to the $55,670 figure in the\n      parties' join pretrial stipulation.     Debtor responded\n      that there was no figure within the range described in\n      footnote 13 of the Memorandum and Order to which it would\n      stipulate. Debtor did not provide a figure to which it\n      was willing to stipulate.\n\nE.    The Bankruptcy Court's Order on Second Remand\n\n                                  -17-\n\f     On remand, the bankruptcy court, \"mechanically applying the\n\naccounting principles historically used by Debtor,\" held that the\n\nDebtor was entitled to $55,670 of the Disputed Funds. The district\n\ncourt affirmed that order, and both parties appealed to this court.\n\n                            Discussion\n\n     NSP in its cross-appeal argues that the district court erred\n\nin reversing the bankruptcy court's initial ruling that the Debtor\n\nwas not entitled to any portion of the Operating Account, hence\n\ncould receive no part of the Disputed Funds.    Understandably, the\n\nDebtor sees no virtue in the initial bankruptcy court's rejection\n\nof its claim to funds in the Operating Account, and asks us to\n\nuphold its retention of $479,457 as found by the bankruptcy court\n\non the first remand.    The Debtor urges that the district court\n\nlater erred both in altering its own analysis after the first\n\nremand to limit recovery to the Debtor's historic accounting\n\nprinciples and in suggesting the much lower range of totals from\n\nwhich the bankruptcy court was to choose.\n\n     NSP responds that if we find the Debtor is owed some portion\n\nof the cash in the operating account, it should be the lowest\n\npossible amount.\n\n     While the issue is somewhat close, we incline towards the\n\nbankruptcy court's original finding denying to the Debtor retention\n\nof any of the funds in the Operating Account.   The plain language\n\nof the Stipulation and the fact that this transaction occurred in\n\n\n                               -18-\n\fthe context of a bankruptcy, not a traditional commercial sale,\n\namong other reasons, support this conclusion. Accordingly, we hold\n\nthat the Debtor is not entitled to receive any portion of the\n\nDisputed Funds.\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      The bankruptcy and district courts' rulings regarding the\n\nDebtor's entitlement under the Stipulation to the funds in the\n\nOperating Account are matters of law reviewed de novo, and any\n\nfindings of fact made by the bankruptcy court are reviewed for\n\nclear error.    In re LaRoche, 969 F.2d 1299, 1301 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nThis Court \"'cede[s] no special deference to the district court's\n\ninitial review'\" in examining a bankruptcy court's decision on\n\nappeal.   In re Merrimac Paper Co. v. Harrison, 420 F.3d 53, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting In re Bank of New Engl. Corp., 364 F.3d 355,\n\n361 (1st Cir. 2004)).      Rather, we review directly the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's determination.       Id.\n\nB.    Why the Debtor may not Retain Cash from the Operating Account\n\n      Preliminary to the issue of how much money might have been due\n\nthe Debtor is whether the Debtor is due any money at all.               As\n\nnoted, NSP now argues that the district court erred both in its\n\n1999 order when, using testamentary bequest analysis, it reversed\n\nthe   bankruptcy   court's    initial   conclusion   that   the   contract\n\ndocuments between the parties could not be read to leave any money\n\nfrom the operating account in the hands of the Debtor, and again in\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f2004 when it reaffirmed its theory underlying its 1999 Order but\n\napplied a \"functional\" analysis which concluded that NSP was more\n\ncapable of looking out for its interests than was the Debtor and\n\nthus was required to bear the loss.         NSP argues that the district\n\ncourt's   approach   ignores   the    standard   principles   of   contract\n\ninterpretation.\n\n     The Debtor, of course, agrees with the district court's\n\nreversal of the bankruptcy court's original ruling but not with its\n\nrevised order regarding accounting.          For the reasons explained\n\nbelow, we agree with the bankruptcy court that, under the language\n\nof the Stipulation and accompanying documents, the Debtor is not\n\nentitled to any of the cash in the Operating Account.\n\n     A plan of reorganization is a binding contract between the\n\ndebtor and the creditors and is subject to the general rules of\n\ncontract construction and interpretation.          See In re Sergi, 233\n\nB.R. 586, 589 (1st Cir. 1999). Likewise, stipulations entered into\n\nbetween parties are treated as contractual and are subject to the\n\nprinciples of contract interpretation.           Gomez v. Rodriguez, 344\n\nF.3d 103, 121 (1st Cir. 2003); TI Fed'l Credit Union v. DelBonis,\n\n72 F.3d 921, 928 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n     There were four documents related to the ownership of the\n\nfunds in the Operating Account:        NSP's plan, the Stipulation, the\n\nConfirmation Order, and the Bill of Sale.          As set forth in NSP's\n\nplan as affirmed in the Confirmation Order,\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f     On the Effective Date the Debtor shall close the Sale\n     Event by conveying to NSP all of the Debtor's right,\n     title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets\n     (exclusive of the Assets to be left with the Debtor under\n     the Stipulation).\n\nNSP's plan also provided that \"[N]SP shall have the right not to\n\ntake title to any Asset . . . .\"           The language in the plan and\n\nConfirmation Order indicates that any right the Debtor has to any\n\nassets would be determined by reference to the Stipulation.\n\n     In support of the initial ruling of the bankruptcy court\n\nrejecting   the   Debtor's    claim   to   cash,   NSP   argues   that   the\n\nStipulation itself makes no provision for the Debtor to retain any\n\nportion of the Operating Account.           It is true, as the Debtor\n\nemphasizes, that paragraph 9 of the Stipulation reads:\n\n     9. The real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's\n     business, including all licenses and permits required to\n     operate that segment of the business, shall be retained\n     by the Debtor.\n\nHowever,    the   paragraphs     immediately    following    describe    in\n\nconsiderable detail what assets within the real estate brokerage\n\nsegment, beyond licenses and permits required to operate that\n\nsegment, are to be retained by the Debtor -- and nowhere, either in\n\nparagraph 9 itself or thereafter, is reference made to any cash in\n\nthe Operating Account.       Paragraphs 10 and 11 read as follows:\n\n     10. NSP and the Debtor shall, on the Effective Date of\n     the NSP Plan, execute an agreement in a form reasonably\n     acceptable to NSP and the Debtor, binding on each\n     parties' successors and assigns, containing the following\n     provisions, and failing the execution of such agreement\n     the provisions as set forth herein shall constitute such\n     agreement:\n\n                                   -21-\n\f     a.    The Debtor, A&C Great Island, Inc., and\nChristopher Burden shall have and retain, or receive for\nnominal consideration, a non-exclusive license to use the\nregistered trade name \"New Seabury\" in connection with\nreal estate brokerage operations conducted by one or more\nof them, which license shall continue for as long as\nChristopher Burden or any member of his family maintain\na majority ownership interest in or is involved in daily\noperations of such business. The license shall include\na license to use the New Seabury name in marketing\nmaterial.\n\n     b. The brokerage operations will have access to all\nresort amenities and may include pictures and information\nregarding the resort amenities in its marketing and other\nmaterial for viewing and touring. Christopher and Nancy\nBurden will be afforded full membership rights in the New\nSeabury Club at no cost for as long as Mr. Burden has a\nmajority ownership interest in or participates in daily\noperations of the brokerage operations, or for as long as\neither Mr. Burden or Mrs. Burden reside at New Seabury.\n\n     c.   The brokerage operations will have the non-\nexclusive right to place reasonable temporary signage\n(e.g. open house signs) and permanent signage relating to\nreal estate service operations on NSP's post-confirmation\nNew Seabury related property.      The permanent signage\nshall be where presently located and shall be in its\npresent form, or in a form reasonably acceptable to the\nDebtor and NSP, provided however, that NSP may change the\npermanent signage so long as such signage is of equal\nvisibility.\n\n11.   Real property on which the real estate service\noperations are conducted, including and limited to, the\nmain New Seabury real estate office and the adjacent\nparking facilities, the Popponessett Real Estate Parcel\nas identified in the Debtor's Plan and the parcel at the\nMashpee Rotary on Routes 28 and 151 referred to as the\nSound Realty Parcel shall be retained by the Debtor. The\nDebtor shall, on and for a two-year period following the\nEffective Date, afford NSP use of three desks at the\nSound Realty location rent-free. NSP may, at its sole\noption and expense, install its own phone lines and place\nits own reasonable office equipment, including a\nfacsimile and copy machine in the Sound Realty property\nfor as long as it has the right to utilize that property.\nExcept as provided herein, the properties retained by the\n\n                          -22-\n\f      Debtor shall be free and clear of all liens,\n      encumbrances, claims and interests. NSP shall have no\n      obligation to the Debtor, Burden, or any affiliates with\n      respect to the Sound Realty Parcel, the New Seabury Real\n      Estate Office, or the Popponessett Real Estate Parcel,\n      including, without limitation, the note held by\n      Christopher Burden in the original principal, except for\n      the existing mortgage lien on the Popponnessett Real\n      Estate Parcel, which mortgage will be paid in accordance\n      with the NSP plan.\n\n      As noted, the Stipulation makes no reference to the retention\n\nby Debtor of any portion of the cash held in the Debtor's Operating\n\nAccount.      The Real Estate Division maintained no bank account of\n\nits   own.         All   the   cash   attributable     to    the   three   operating\n\ndivisions was held in the Debtor's single operating account, where\n\nthey were commingled.            One would expect, if the parties to the\n\nStipulation had intended the Debtor to retain up to $500,000 from\n\nthe commingled operating account, that they would have said so.\n\nEspecially would this be expected in a Stipulation settling a\n\nbankruptcy         which   specifies    in    detail   the    other      real   estate\n\nBrokerage assets of significance that were to be retained by the\n\nDebtor.      The need to specify a considerable sum of cash, if it was\n\nto be retained, would have seemed especially obvious in this\n\ncontext      not    only   because     sums   allocable      to    the   real   estate\n\nBrokerage were commingled with cash from elsewhere, but because a\n\ncomplicated system of credits and charges relative to real estate\n\ncommissions, implicating all three divisions, made it difficult to\n\nascertain what net sums were fairly attributable to the Brokerage\n\nsegment of the business.              Historically, some of the credits and\n\n                                         -23-\n\fcharges were treated so as to greatly reduce the sums allocated to\n\nthe real estate division on the Debtor's consolidated accounts,\n\nalthough in the hearing held after the first remand, the bankruptcy\n\njudge was persuaded by accounting experts that a methodology more\n\nfavorable to Debtor was correct.\n\n     In order to allow the Debtor to retain any of the Disputed\n\nFunds, a court would have to resolve accounting issues that are\n\nless than clear and read language into the Stipulation that does\n\nnot appear (language suggesting that the Debtor was entitled to\n\nsome of the funds, or giving a means of calculating the funds to\n\nwhich the Debtor was entitled). Courts will not read language into\n\na contract where it does not appear.   See Accusoft Corp. v. Palo,\n\n237 F.3d 31, 41-42 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing Mathewson Corp. v.\n\nAllied Marine Indus., Inc., 827 F.2d 850, 855 (1st Cir. 1987)).\n\n     The Debtor argues that the phrase \"the real estate brokerage\n\nsegment of the Debtor's business,\" which paragraph 9 allows the\n\nDebtor to retain, implies retention of monies belonging to that\n\naspect of the business.     Had the Brokerage segment been more\n\nclearly an independent business entity with, for example, its own\n\nbank account, it would perhaps be more plausible to infer inclusion\n\nof the latter among the retained assets.        But the Brokerage\n\n\"segment\" mentioned in paragraph 9 was just that--a segment of the\n\nlarger business; precisely what assets comprised that \"segment\" for\n\npurposes of this bankruptcy sale was not self-evident but required\n\n\n                               -24-\n\fthe considerable clarification provided in the latter part of the\n\nStipulation, which describes in detail the various elements to be\n\nretained.2\n\n     Debtor       would    have    it    that    paragraphs   10    and    11       merely\n\nenumerate     additional        assets    to     be   retained     by    the    Debtor.\n\nAccording    to    the     Debtor,      NSP's    interpretation     does       not    give\n\nadequate meaning to the language of paragraph 9.                        Debtor argues\n\nthat paragraph 9 becomes superfluous if paragraphs 10 and 11 are\n\nread to specify the assets to be retained by the Debtor, thus\n\nviolating a common tenet of contract construction:                       \"'every word\n\nand phrase of an instrument is if possible to be given meaning, and\n\nnone is to be rejected as surplusage if any other course is\n\nrationally possible.'\"            FDIC v. Singh, 977 F.2d 18, 22 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (quoting Tupper v. Hancock, 65 N.E.2d 441, 443 (Mass. 1946)).\n\nHowever,     paragraph      9     is    not    rendered   meaningless          by    NSP's\n\ninterpretation.           Paragraph 9 can be read as an introductory,\n\ngeneralized characterization of the portion of the business the\n\nDebtor was to retain, which assets (beyond the licenses and permits\n\nexpressly referenced in paragraph 9) were then more precisely\n\n\n\n     2\n      The district court was persuaded by the \"simple and coherent\nline\" drawn by the Debtor, to the effect that \"a 'business'\nincludes all its assets unless stated otherwise.\" See supra. It\nis notable, however, that what was to be retained here was not the\nDebtor's \"business,\" as such, but rather the real estate brokerage\n\"segment\" of the Debtor's business. It is thus largely irrelevant\nthat had Debtor's entire business been sold or retained, its cash\nassets might be deemed to be included as part thereof.\n\n                                          -25-\n\fexplicated in the following paragraphs, especially paragraphs 10\n\nand 11.\n\n      We do not agree that the items listed in paragraphs 10 and 11\n\nof the Stipulation can be written off merely as assets that the\n\nDebtor received in addition to the \"real estate brokerage segment.\"\n\nTo   the   contrary,   most   of   the   items   later   described   within\n\nparagraphs 10 and 11 would also fit under the general rubric of\n\n\"the real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business.\"          The\n\nsubsequent specific descriptions in paragraphs 10 and 11 were\n\nneeded so as to explicate the parties' understanding of exactly\n\nwhat items and rights were to be retained by the Debtor.                In\n\narguing the items in paragraph 10 and 11 are mere additions, the\n\nDebtor asserts the enumerated real estate parcels in paragraph 11\n\nwere not previously used exclusively by the Brokerage division.\n\nThey had, however, been used in some part by that division.             To\n\nshow the parties' present agreement as to the precise status and\n\nuse of the parcels, as well as the extent to which they would form\n\na part of the retained segment, it was necessary, as was done, to\n\nprovide the specifics in paragraph 11.           Much the same is true of\n\nthe cash now in dispute.           It is not enough that some of the\n\nunmentioned cash in the Operating Account may have derived from\n\npast real estate brokerage operations.           To show an intention to\n\ninclude that cash as part of the retained real estate brokerage\n\nsegment, that intention needed to be stated -- and given the\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\faccounting uncertainties, the amount of the cash to be retained\n\nneeded to be declared -- just as all the other items were listed\n\nand specified in paragraphs 10 and 11.\n\n     In the circumstances, we think it cannot be inferred simply\n\nfrom the general language in paragraph 9 that the parties meant the\n\nDebtor to retain any particular amount of the commingled cash.   In\n\na bankruptcy transaction such as this, it would not be at all\n\nunreasonable for the parties to have understood that Debtor would\n\nreceive the right to continue to operate the Brokerage segment\n\nwithout being entitled to retain the cash previously generated by\n\nbrokerage operations.    NSP needed cash assets to perform its\n\nobligations to pay off the bankrupt's indebtedness.     The Debtor\n\nmight be thought to benefit sufficiently from the right to operate\n\nthe real estate segment without receiving all or part of the cash\n\nattributable to past operations of that part of the business.\n\nWithout more specific reference, it is impossible to determine that\n\nthe parties necessarily meant to permit the Debtor to retain some\n\nportion of the Operating Account funds.\n\n     As already suggested, some of the current difficulty stems\n\nfrom the fact that \"the real estate brokerage segment of the\n\nDebtor's business\" was not a wholly independent business with its\n\nown bank accounts. Precisely what assets were meant to be included\n\nwithin the contours of that phrase were not self-explanatory,\n\nmaking it necessary for the parties to have described with some\n\n\n                               -27-\n\freasonable degree of clarity, the particular items intended to be\n\nretained.    That description appears principally in paragraphs 10,\n\n11 et seq.\n\n     In this respect, a further aspect of the Stipulation should be\n\nmentioned.   This is the wording at the start of paragraph 10, which\n\ndeclares that NSP and the Debtor shall, on the effective date of\n\nthe NSP plan, execute a binding agreement containing the following\n\nprovisions -- provisions which themselves shall constitute such\n\nagreement if none is executed. This indication that paragraphs 10,\n\n11 and beyond are to be a separate agreement reinforces the notion\n\nthat they are to spell out the essential details of the real estate\n\nbrokerage segment earlier said to be retained.         And, indeed,\n\nparagraph 10 goes on to specify just such details, delineating\n\nitems such as the right of the Debtor, A+C Great Island, Inc., and\n\nBurden to have and retain a non-exclusive license to use the\n\nregistered \"New Seabury\" trade name and marketing materials \"in\n\nconnection with real estate brokerage operations conducted by one\n\nor more of them,\" access to resort amenities and signage, and even\n\nmaintenance of membership in the New Seabury Club for Christopher\n\nBurden and his wife.   Given the extent of the detail in paragraphs\n\n10 and 11, the omission therefrom of any reference to the cash in\n\nthe operating account is highly significant. The parties would\n\nscarcely have overlooked mention of inclusion of a substantial\n\nshare of the commingled cash from the operating account, and the\n\n\n                                -28-\n\famount   thereof,   had   this,   too,   been   part   of   their    completed\n\nbargain, especially where it would be unclear simply from the\n\ngeneral language in paragraph 9 how much of an uncertain amount of\n\ncash Debtor was to retain, if it was to retain any at all.\n\n     In addition to the lack of specific reference to the cash\n\nassociated with the Brokerage segment and absence of any declared\n\nmethod to account for such cash, NSP also relies for a supplemental\n\nargument on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, which\n\nmandates that when parties list specific items in a document, any\n\ndocument not so listed is excluded.         Lohnes v. Level 3 Commc'n,\n\nInc., 272 F.3d 49, 61 (1st Cir. 2001).                 The absence of any\n\nreference to cash when other items were delineated in paragraphs 10\n\nand 11 indicates, according to NSP, that the cash was not intended\n\nto be retained by the Debtor.       The Debtor replies that the use of\n\nthe word \"including\" in paragraph 9 does not preclude the Debtor\n\nfrom retaining the cash.          See St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v.\n\nLexington Ins. Co., 78 F.3d 202, 206 (5th Cir. 1996) (\"[W]e are not\n\nconvinced that the rule of expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n\napplies in the instant case as the challenged list of provisions in\n\nSt. Paul's contract is prefaced by the word 'including,' which is\n\ngenerally given an expansive reading, even without the additional\n\nif not redundant language of 'without limitation.'\").               NSP notes,\n\nhowever, that unlike in the cases relied upon by the Debtor, the\n\nword \"including\" in paragraph 9 is in a separate paragraph from the\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\flanguage in paragraphs 10 and 11, thereby limiting the relevance of\n\nthose cases in the instant situation.   Paragraph 9 can be read as\n\nan introductory paragraph referring to the licenses and permits and\n\nthen leading into the specifics of paragraphs 10 and 11 regarding\n\nthe shared property that would be retained by Debtor.\n\n     The Debtor argues that its position is supported by a review\n\nof the associated transaction documents.   In the first exhibit to\n\nthe Bill of Sale, Schedule A, the assets to be transferred from the\n\nDebtor to NSP upon the Closing are described as \"all properties,\n\nassets and rights of [Debtor] not associated with or generated by\n\nthe Real Estate Brokerage Operations.\" The Debtor claims that cash\n\nis one such asset \"generated by\" the Brokerage Division.   Further,\n\nDebtor argues that if it were to retain only a limited set of\n\nassets of the Brokerage Division, rather than the entirety of the\n\n\"real estate brokerage segment,\" then Schedule F, which sets forth\n\na list of assets that were to be transferred to NSP despite being\n\nlocated in the real estate Brokerage segment's offices, would have\n\nbeen unnecessary.    Moreover, the list of enumerated items in\n\nSchedule F including \"5 Wastebaskets,\" \"1 Casio Calculator,\" and \"1\n\nLamp\" further suggests that NSP was cognizant of the need to\n\ndistinguish specific items from the all-encompassing (and thus\n\ncash-including language) of the \"real estate brokerage segment\"\n\nlanguage in paragraph 9.\n\n\n\n\n                               -30-\n\f      The Debtor's arguments are not supported by the full language\n\nand context of the Bill of Sale.      The sentence cited by the Debtor\n\nincludes a parenthetical specifically noting that the distribution\n\nof the cash will be resolved by the court.        The complete language\n\nin Schedule A provides that \"in addition to any assets being\n\nretained by [the Debtor] pursuant to the [Stipulation] . . . the\n\nPurchased Assets shall not include any personalty located in the\n\nreal property to be retained by [the Debtor] under the Stipulation\n\nunless set forth on Schedule F hereto . . .\" (emphasis added).       The\n\nBill of Sale recognized that the Debtor would retain only the\n\nassets listed in the Stipulation and therefore specified in the\n\nSchedule that the Debtor could retain the inconsequential property\n\ninside the offices as well.\n\n      The Debtor's Schedule F argument likewise seems limited by the\n\nfact that Schedule A provides for the retention by the Debtor of\n\nthe real estate office in which the real estate business is\n\nconducted, so that it would have been important for NSP to identify\n\nany   objects   it   wished   to   take   from   that   property.   Such\n\nspecification does not necessarily imply that the parties assumed\n\nthat larger assets, like the cash, were included in the paragraph\n\n9 reference to the \"real estate brokerage segment.\"\n\n      In its reversal of the bankruptcy court's ruling that the\n\nDebtor was not entitled to the cash, the district court noted the\n\ntraditional commercial practice of a seller's retaining the cash\n\n\n                                   -31-\n\fassociated with the business it sells.        It further observed,\n\nhowever, that the instant case is complicated by the fact that it\n\nis not a simple commercial transaction but a bankruptcy proceeding.\n\n\"The interpretation of a stipulated amendment to a bankruptcy\n\nreorganization plan must . . . recognize certain concerns lurking\n\nin the background:     that creditors be paid; that the debtor be\n\nrehabilitated; and that neither the debtor nor any creditor receive\n\na windfall.\"     Here, NSP assumed the cost of nearly $8 million to\n\nsatisfy the Debtor's creditors. It is not unreasonable to read the\n\nStipulation and associated documentation to be maximizing the total\n\ntransfer of cash assets to NSP while still allowing the Debtor to\n\nmaintain the real estate Brokerage for future use. As the district\n\ncourt noted, \"a 'segment of . . . business' can be a valuable and\n\ncoherent asset if limited to goodwill, real property, equipment,\n\nand intellectual property needed to operate the business, even\n\nwithout cash.\"    Additionally, \"[a] reading of the Stipulation that\n\nexcludes cash might be consistent with the absence of a negotiated\n\ncash valuation method, and the bankruptcy context in which the\n\nprimary goal is to pay back the Debtor's creditors.\"   The district\n\ncourt observed that the Debtor has been able to operate the\n\nBrokerage for several years without the use of the Disputed Funds.\n\nChristopher Burden put an undisclosed amount of his personal\n\ncapital into the business.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -32-\n\f     The district court ultimately concluded that NSP should bear\n\nthe loss because it was in a better position to protect its assets\n\nin the drafting of the Stipulation.       We are unable to accept that\n\nrationale.     Both   parties   were   represented   by   attorneys.   If\n\nretention of the cash was an item of importance to the Debtor, it\n\nis not unreasonable to believe that it would have sought to\n\nnegotiate a reference thereto in the Stipulation.              We see no\n\nunfairness in holding against the Debtor in the absence of such a\n\nreference, such absence being indicative that the parties formed no\n\nsuch agreement. While doubtless the bankrupt party was in a weaker\n\nnegotiating position, that cannot justify rewriting the parties'\n\nagreement for presumed equitable reasons.\n\n     We believe the bankruptcy court's initial conclusion (and the\n\ndistrict court's acknowledgment of the reasoning underlying it) was\n\ncorrect.     The plain language of the Stipulation and associated\n\ndocumentation does not support a conclusion that the Disputed Funds\n\nor some portion of them were intended to be retained by the Debtor.\n\nThe funds were in the Operating Account, and the Stipulation\n\nprovided neither express reference to the cash nor any reference to\n\na method of accounting for the Brokerage's share of the cash.          By\n\ncontrast, paragraph 11 itemizes the real property to be retained by\n\nthe Debtor which had not been exclusive property of the Brokerage\n\ndivision.    The bankruptcy court's conclusion that the Debtor was\n\nnot entitled to retain the cash is in keeping with the plain\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\flanguage of the contract documents and also acknowledges the unique\n\nposture of the bankruptcy proceeding which sets this case apart\n\nfrom a traditional commercial transaction.\n\n     Remanded with directions to affirm the initial judgment of the\n\nbankruptcy court and to vacate the contrary judgments of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                               -34-\n\f",

The funds relative to the divisions were commingled in the Debtor's single operating account. The functions of the three divisions were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Recreation Division maintained and operated two golf courses and a golf club house, a tennis facility, a beach club, and a swimming pool facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hotel Division managed and maintained a hotel facility using Debtor and third-party-owned property for short term rental by guests of the New Seabury Resort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Real Estate Division operated a real estate brokerage (the \"Brokerage\"). The Brokerage operated one real estate company, New Seabury Real Estate, that sold Debtor and non-Debtor property on the New Seabury Resort and another real estate company, Sound Realty, that brokered short-term and long-term rentals of property for private individuals within New Seabury Resort. Commissions provided the Brokerage's primary source of revenue. The Brokerage was never a member of the Multiple Listing Service (\"MLS\") and, as the exclusive broker, sold most of the property in New Seabury. MLS brokers not related to the Brokerage sold a small percentage of the property; the Brokerage and unrelated MLS brokers would share some sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Debtor and NSP offered competing plans for reorganization of the Debtor. On May 15, 1998, the bankruptcy court entered an Order and Preliminary Decision stating that the Debtor's plan was not confirmable, but NSP's was. For two days leading up to the confirmation hearing on May 29, 1998, the Debtor and NSP engaged in negotiations to resolve the differences between their competing plans. Ultimately, on May 29, the parties executed a stipulation (the \"Stipulation\"), pursuant to which the Debtor withdrew its own plan for reorganization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Stipulation noted that NSP's plan, to which the Debtor now consented, provided for NSP to acquire substantially all of the Debtors' assets. So as to resolve the parties' controversy, however, the Debtor and NSP stipulated that \"certain assets of the Debtor will not be acquired by NSP and will be retained by the Debtor free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims and interest.\" Thus, paragraph 9 of the Stipulation provided that \"[t]he real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business, including all licenses and permits required to operate that segment of the business, shall be retained by the Debtor.\" Paragraph 10 of the Stipulation went on to state that the parties would execute on the plan's effective date (the \"Effective Date\") an agreement containing \"the following provisions, and failing the execution of such agreement the provisions as set forth herein shall constitute such agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clauses a, b, and c of paragraph 10 then provided that the Debtor, A + C Great Island, Inc., and Christopher Burden would retain a non-exclusive license to use the requested trade name \"New Seabury\" in connection with real estate brokerage operations conducted by one or more of them for as long as Burden or his family maintained a majority ownership interest or were involved in daily operations. The license would include the right to use the New Seabury name in marketing materials. Additionally, the Brokerage operations were to have access to all resort amenities, including related pictures and information, in its marketing and other material for viewing and touring, with specified free membership rights to be granted to Christopher and Nancy Burden in the New Seabury Club. Non-exclusive signage rights were also granted to the Brokerage operations relating to real estate service operations in NSP's post-confirmation New Seabury related property, with various limitations spelled out as to the form and location of the signage, its acceptability to the Debtor and NSP, and changes desired by NSP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 11 of the Stipulation also contained details and limitations relative to the retained Brokerage operation. The Debtor would retain certain specified real property on which real estate service operations are conducted, including the main New Seabury real estate office and adjacent parking facilities, and certain other parcels. On and for a two-year period following the Effective Date, the Debtor was to allow NSP use of three desks on one of these parcels rent-free, along with certain spelled-out rights to install phone lines and place its own reasonable office equipment. Properties to be retained by the Debtor were to be free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims and interests with additional conditions specified as to a particular note held by Burden and a mortgage on one parcel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 12 of the Stipulation provided for execution by the parties of a limited non-competition agreement prohibiting NSP and its assignees, successors, and assigns from engaging in real estate brokerage within New Seabury, except as to its own properties, and the Debtor, A + C Great Island and Burden from engaging in resort operations within the boundaries of the New Seabury development and within a three-mile radius. Nothing, however, was to prohibit NSP from employing a broker of its choice to market its properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 13 specified that \"except as provided herein and except as to the obligations of NSP under the NSP Plan,\" all parties \"shall be deemed to have remised, released and forever discharged against the other any and all debts, demands, obligations, avoidance actions, causes of action and any other\" claims, through the Effective Date of the NSP plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining paragraphs of the Stipulation dealt with the discharge of debts, providing, inter alia, that NSP did not release its debts against the Debtor and that Burden released certain of his debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing was said in the Stipulation as to retention or ownership of monies held in the Debtor's operating account.

As noted, revenue from the Brokerage operations was commingled with that from the Debtor's two other divisions in a single Operating Account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to complete the closing, the documents specifically excluded the Disputed Funds pending resolution of the parties' rights (the specific language is quoted below). The parties executed the final closing documents on September 17, 1998 (the \"Closing\"), which was also the Effective Date of the reorganization plan. The bill of sale provided that the Debtor agreed to sell all of the Debtor's rights and title but specifically excluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) any assets being retained by New Seabury Company Limited Partnership pursuant to the Stipulation Relating to Competing Plans of Reorganization, Objections to Confirmation, Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Plan Partnership, entered into on May 29, 1998 (the \"Stipulation\"); (ii) telephone number (508) 477-9400 pending a further determination of the Debtor's right to retain that number; and (iii) property, assets and rights, generated by or associated with the Seller's Real Estate Brokerage Operations (the \"Brokerage Operations\") including net cash generated by the Brokerage Operations from January 1, 1998 through September 16, 1998 in the amount of $553,762.00, as estimated by the Seller which amount shall remain in the Debtor's account in its entirety until such time as the Court adjudicates the rights of the Seller and NSP thereto, or until further agreement of the parties, and any Purchased Assets described on Schedules (\"B,\" \"C,\" \"D\" and \"E\" hereto).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Closing, the Debtor retained the desks, computers, fixtures, independent contractor agreements, marketing materials, furniture and other equipment at the Brokerage.

The Debtor resisted, contending that the Disputed Funds were an asset of the Brokerage which, under the terms of the Stipulation, it was entitled to retain. It insisted that brokerage-related revenues kept in the Operating Account went to the Debtor by implication under paragraph 9 of the Stipulation, which allowed the Debtor to retain \"the real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business.\" NSP responded that the Stipulation made no reference to retention by the Debtor of any portion of the Operating Account, hence the Disputed Funds belonged to NSP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Analogizing the situation to the construction of wills, the district court noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[c]ourts have consistently concluded that a business cannot be considered separately from the funds used to run it .... I see no reason to come to a contrary conclusion in respect of the brokerage operations here. Its cash assets were part of the business and, as in any business, are necessary to keep it operating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge looked to the language in paragraph 9 of the Stipulation providing for retention of the Brokerage segment of the business, including all licenses and the permits required to operate that segment, and found that the list was \"an inclusive, rather than exclusive matter.\" He stated that it was \"improbable that the licenses and permits were the only assets\" retained by the Debtor and that the \"term brokerage operations itself indicates that at least those assets essential to running the operations should be retained\" by the Debtor. He held that the cash assets of the Brokerage were part of the business and were necessary to keep the business operating, but specifically did not \"reach the issue as to whether any of the funds in the [Operating] [A]ccount were truly attributable to the [Brokerage].\" The district court's Order remanded the case and directed the bankruptcy court \"to determine the amount of cash in the general operating account which is attributable to the brokerage operations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Bankruptcy Court's Order on the First Remand</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the bankruptcy court conducted a three-day trial. It concluded first that the calculations of the amount in the fund were to begin on January 1, 1998. Determination of the amount to which each of the parties was entitled required consideration of three elements: the total amount of Disputed Funds; the application of real estate credits given to parties who bought real estate through the Brokerage; and the application of certain other costs, which are discussed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pretrial stipulation in the bankruptcy court, entered into prior to the hearing on remand, the parties had agreed that the maximum amount of the Disputed Funds that the Debtor could recover was the net revenue that the Brokerage earned from January 1, 1998 until September 18, 1998, or $479,457, and that the amount inclusive of the Credits and Charges would be $55,670.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor offered parties that purchased real estate through the Brokerage a \"credit\" (the \"Credit\" or the \"Credits\"). The purchasers of the property could apply the Credit towards the initiation fee required of new members to join the New Seabury Country Club (the \"Club\"). The Recreation Division ran the Club. Membership in the Club enabled a member to use its facilities, including the golf courses. The amount of the Credit was a percentage of the commission and could be applied towards the initiation fee for as long as the homeowner remained a property owner at New Seabury Resort. Credits exercised during the relevant period totaled $298,866.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"real estate carrying costs\" (the \"Charges\") were costs associated with unsold property of the Debtor such as landscaping costs, depreciation and condo fees. The unsold properties themselves were placed under control of the Hotel Division and used as short term rentals. The parties agreed in the pretrial stipulation that for the period of January 1, 1998 to September 17, 1998, the Charges totaled $124,921.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor historically maintained consolidated financial statements for all of its revenue producing entities, including New Seabury Real Estate, Sound Realty, and the Club. When homeowners utilized the Credits and joined the Club, the Debtor recorded the total amount of the initiation fee, including the Credit, as income to the Resort Division. The Debtor recorded the amount of the Credit as an expense to the Real Estate Division at the time of its exercise. The Charges were also treated as an expense of the Brokerage. The bankruptcy court held that, treating the Brokerage as a separate entity, the historic treatment of the Credits and Charges was inappropriate to its determination. It adopted testimony from expert witnesses as to applicable accounting principles and concluded that \"the Recreation Division would have recorded both the income and expense of the Credit and, in essence, recorded the transaction as a reduced price sale,\" and that the Charges were \"properly attributable to the Hotel Division for the Charges bore no relationship to the Brokerage.\" The bankruptcy court ultimately concluded that the Debtor was entitled to the entire $479,457 of the Disputed Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second appeal to the district court followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. The District Court's Second Order and Remand</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its March 5, 2004 Memorandum &amp; Order, the district court reaffirmed its earlier ruling that cash in the Operating Account attributable to the Brokerage operation formed a part of the Brokerage segment of Debtor's business which the Debtor was allowed to retain under the Stipulation. However, it was unsatisfied with the accounting rationale accepted by the bankruptcy court based upon a methodology not historically followed in the Debtor's own consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, it remanded for recalculation of the sums applicable to the brokerage segment, the recalculation to be based on the original accounting methodology, <i>see supra.</i> The court suggested this would lead the parties to the $55,970 figure earlier stipulated to in the bankruptcy court or to $83,846, the net income of the Real Estate Division reflected in earlier accounting statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In once again grappling with the case, the district court also noted its own dissatisfaction with its earlier rationale for concluding that cash traceable to real estate brokerage operations should be treated as a part of the retained assets to which the Debtor was entitled. The district court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further reflection has persuaded me that this case law [i.e., that resting on testamentary dispositions of businesses] is not fully sufficient to support my earlier conclusion. Wills involve different modes of construction than arm's-length commercial transactions, let alone settlements in bankruptcy proceedings, because the relationships between the parties, the ultimate goals of the instruments, and the interpretive goals of the court differ.... In sum, courts are likely to construe a bequest generously, because the testator manifestly sought to give something of value to a worthy beneficiary, and because any verbal missteps in the will are neither the beneficiary's fault, nor errors against which the beneficiary could have protected himself.... A Chapter 11 bankrupt cannot fairly claim the benefits of this analogy; it is, after all, not a deserving child inheriting the family business, but rather an insolvent permitted to remain in business for the benefit of creditors. Nevertheless, the bankruptcy court should treat the writings surrounding a reorganization with an eye toward the equities of reorganization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to affirm its conclusion that the term \"business\" in the Stipulation necessarily included cash by reference to other modes of analysis, including contract interpretation, but noted that it was essentially performing a \"functional analysis of the parties' arrangement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it acknowledged that the relevant documents did not explicitly mention cash as among the assets to be retained by the Debtor and that \"[a] reading of the Stipulation that excludes cash might be consistent with the absence of a negotiated cash valuation method, and the bankruptcy context in which the primary goal is to pay back the Debtor's creditors,\" the district court nonetheless concluded that \"the loss should lie with NSP, because it was in a better position to protect its interests by writing more detailed contractual language, and because its theory of the limits of a `business' does not lead to a coherent resolution.\" The court additionally noted that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he general rubrics for construction of analogous writings do not provide a full answer to the question. Nor does general business practice. A business may be conveyed in a variety of states &#8212; all assets, all assets except cash, all nonliquid assets, goodwill and intellectual and real property only, goodwill only, and so on &#8212; and therefore the answer must necessarily turn on the degree that any default position has been refined. In this context, the Debtor draws a simple and coherent line: a `business' includes all its assets unless stated otherwise. NSP, having asserted that the line actually falls somewhere <i>inside</i> the set of business assets, must provide a logical place in which to draw it, but has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the issue of the proper way to account for the cash it found Debtor was entitled to retain, the district court noted that while historically, the Debtor had recorded the initiation fee at the country club as income to the Recreation Division, it had recorded the amount of the credit as a loss to the Real Estate division. In August 1998, after the Stipulation had been executed and the plan had been confirmed, the Debtor's principal, Christopher Burden, told his accountant to \"rework the figures for the Real Estate Operations.\" The new accounting treated initiation fee credits as losses to the Recreation Division, not the Real Estate Division. The effect of this new accounting system was to increase the net income of the Real Estate Division on the consolidated financial statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that, under its new analysis based on the parties' intent to form a contract, it was only permissible for NSP to be found to have assented to the terms of the bargain it could reasonably foresee. The district court observed that NSP could not have foreseen the Debtor's change in accounting methodology: \"It is one thing for a court to hold NSP to the reasonably foreseeable consequences of its ill-defined bargain with the Debtor; it is quite another for the court to hold NSP to terms that could not possibly have been on the table.\" The district court thus vacated the bankruptcy court's calculation of the cash attributable to the Debtor and remanded for a recalculation under the original accounting methodology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If by March 22, 2004, the parties are unable to agree upon a stipulated figure, I will remand to the Bankruptcy Court to determine the amount of cash attributable to the brokerage, using, January 1, 1998 as a start date, but applying the accounting methodologies employed by the Debtor on the date the Plan was confirmed. [footnote 13] The parties shall file a status report by no later than March 24, 2004 regarding the issues to be resolved. In all other respects, the decision of the Bankruptcy Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the cited footnote, the district court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I assume that the parties or the Bankruptcy Court will naturally gravitate towards either the $55,670 figure in the parties' joint pretrial stipulation, or $83,846, the net income of the Real Estate Division reflected on Debtor's financial statements, which treated both the real estate credits and the carrying costs as losses to the Real Estate Division. However, the parties and, if necessary, the Bankruptcy Court are free to determine the appropriate number under the former methodology based on an independent review of the financial data. If the parties are unable to agree, the Bankruptcy Court may, but need not, receive new evidence beyond what has already been presented to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The parties' status report indicated that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of footnote 13 of the Memorandum and Order, NSP offered to stipulate to the $55,670 figure in the parties' join pretrial stipulation. Debtor responded that there was no figure within the range described in footnote 13 of the Memorandum and Order to which it would stipulate. Debtor did not provide a figure to which it was willing to stipulate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. The Bankruptcy Court's Order on Second Remand</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the bankruptcy court, \"mechanically applying the accounting principles historically used by Debtor,\" held that the Debtor was entitled to $55,670 of the Disputed Funds. The district court affirmed that order, and both parties appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NSP in its cross-appeal argues that the district court erred in reversing the bankruptcy court's initial ruling that the Debtor was not entitled to any portion of the Operating Account, hence could receive no part of the Disputed Funds. Understandably, the Debtor sees no virtue in the initial bankruptcy court's rejection of its claim to funds in the Operating Account, and asks us to uphold its retention of $479,457 as found by the bankruptcy court on the first remand. The Debtor urges that the district court later erred both in altering its own analysis after the first remand to limit recovery to the Debtor's historic accounting principles and in suggesting the much lower range of totals from which the bankruptcy court was to choose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NSP responds that if we find the Debtor is owed some portion of the cash in the operating account, it should be the lowest possible amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the issue is somewhat close, we incline towards the bankruptcy court's original finding denying to the Debtor retention of any of the funds in the Operating Account. The plain language of the Stipulation and the fact that this transaction occurred in the context of a bankruptcy, not a traditional commercial sale, among other reasons, support this conclusion. Accordingly, we hold that the Debtor is not entitled to receive any portion of the Disputed Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy and district courts' rulings regarding the Debtor's entitlement under the Stipulation to the funds in the Operating Account are matters of law reviewed de novo, and any findings of fact made by the bankruptcy court are reviewed for clear error. <i>In re LaRoche,</i> 969 F.2d 1299, 1301 (1st Cir.1992). This Court \"`cede[s] no special deference to the district court's initial review'\" in examining a bankruptcy court's decision on appeal. <i>In re Merrimac Paper Co. v. Harrison,</i> 420 F.3d 53, 58 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>In re Bank of New Engl. Corp.,</i> 364 F.3d 355, 361 (1st Cir.2004)). Rather, we review directly the bankruptcy court's determination. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Why the Debtor may not Retain Cash from the Operating Account</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Preliminary to the issue of how much money might have been due the Debtor is whether the Debtor is due any money at all. As noted, NSP now argues that the district court erred both in its 1999 order when, using testamentary bequest analysis, it reversed the bankruptcy court's initial conclusion that the contract documents between the parties could not be read to leave any money from the operating account in the hands of the Debtor, and again in 2004 when it reaffirmed its theory underlying its 1999 Order but applied a \"functional\" analysis which concluded that NSP was more capable of looking out for its interests than was the Debtor and thus was required to bear the loss. NSP argues that the district court's approach ignores the standard principles of contract interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor, of course, agrees with the district court's reversal of the bankruptcy court's original ruling but not with its revised order regarding accounting. For the reasons explained below, we agree with the bankruptcy court that, under the language of the Stipulation and accompanying documents, the Debtor is not entitled to any of the cash in the Operating Account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plan of reorganization is a binding contract between the debtor and the creditors and is subject to the general rules of contract construction and interpretation. <i>See In re Sergi,</i> 233 B.R. 586, 589 (1st Cir.1999). Likewise, stipulations entered into between parties are treated as contractual and are subject to the principles of contract interpretation. <i>Gomez v. Rodriguez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 121 (1st Cir. 2003); <i>TI Fed'l Credit Union v. DelBonis,</i> 72 F.3d 921, 928 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were four documents related to the ownership of the funds in the Operating Account: NSP's plan, the Stipulation, the Confirmation Order, and the Bill of Sale. As set forth in NSP's plan as affirmed in the Confirmation Order,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the Effective Date the Debtor shall close the Sale Event by conveying to NSP all of the Debtor's right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets (exclusive of the Assets to be left with the Debtor under the Stipulation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NSP's plan also provided that \"[N]SP shall have the right not to take title to any Asset....\" The language in the plan and Confirmation Order indicates that any right the Debtor has to any assets would be determined by reference to the Stipulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of the initial ruling of the bankruptcy court rejecting the Debtor's claim to cash, NSP argues that the Stipulation itself makes no provision for the Debtor to retain any portion of the Operating Account. It is true, as the Debtor emphasizes, that paragraph 9 of the Stipulation reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. The real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business, including all licenses and permits required to operate that segment of the business, shall be retained by the Debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the paragraphs immediately following describe in considerable detail what assets within the real estate brokerage segment, beyond licenses and permits required to operate that segment, are to be retained by the Debtor &#8212; and nowhere, either in paragraph 9 itself or thereafter, is reference made to any cash in the Operating Account. Paragraphs 10 and 11 read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. NSP and the Debtor shall, on the Effective Date of the NSP Plan, execute an agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to NSP and the Debtor, binding on each parties' successors and assigns, containing the following provisions, and failing the execution of such agreement the provisions as set forth herein shall constitute such agreement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The Debtor, A &amp; C Great Island, Inc., and Christopher Burden shall have and retain, or receive for nominal consideration, a non-exclusive license to use the registered trade name \"New Seabury\" in connection with real estate brokerage operations conducted by one or more of them, which license shall continue for as long as Christopher Burden or any member of his family maintain a majority ownership interest in or is involved in daily operations of such business. The license shall include a license to use the New Seabury name in marketing material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. The brokerage operations will have access to all resort amenities and may include pictures and information regarding the resort amenities in its marketing and other material for viewing and touring. Christopher and Nancy Burden will be afforded full membership rights in the New Seabury Club at no cost for as long as Mr. Burden has a majority ownership interest in or participates in daily operations of the brokerage operations, or for as long as either Mr. Burden or Mrs. Burden reside at New Seabury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. The brokerage operations will have the non-exclusive right to place reasonable temporary signage (e.g. open house signs) and permanent signage relating to real estate service operations on NSP's post-confirmation New Seabury related property. The permanent signage shall be where presently located and shall be in its present form, or in a form reasonably acceptable to the Debtor and NSP, provided however, that NSP may change the permanent signage so long as such signage is of equal visibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11. Real property on which the real estate service operations are conducted, including and limited to, the main New Seabury real estate office and the adjacent parking facilities, the Popponessett Real Estate Parcel as identified in the Debtor's Plan and the parcel at the Mashpee Rotary on Routes 28 and 151 referred to as the Sound Realty Parcel shall be retained by the Debtor. The Debtor shall, on and for a two-year period following the Effective Date, afford NSP use of three desks at the Sound Realty location rent-free. NSP may, at its sole option and expense, install its own phone lines and place its own reasonable office equipment, including a facsimile and copy machine in the Sound Realty property for as long as it has the right to utilize that property. Except as provided herein, the properties retained by the Debtor shall be free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims and interests. NSP shall have no obligation to the Debtor, Burden, or any affiliates with respect to the Sound Realty Parcel, the New Seabury Real Estate Office, or the Popponessett Real Estate Parcel, including, without limitation, the note held by Christopher Burden in the original principal, except for the existing mortgage lien on the Popponnessett Real Estate Parcel, which mortgage will be paid in accordance with the NSP plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the Stipulation makes no reference to the retention by Debtor of any portion of the cash held in the Debtor's Operating Account. The Real Estate Division maintained no bank account of its own. All the cash attributable to the three operating divisions was held in the Debtor's single operating account, where they were commingled. One would expect, if the parties to the Stipulation had intended the Debtor to retain up to $500,000 from the commingled operating account, that they would have said so. Especially would this be expected in a Stipulation settling a bankruptcy which specifies in detail the other real estate Brokerage assets of significance that were to be retained by the Debtor. The need to specify a considerable sum of cash, if it was to be retained, would have seemed especially obvious in this context not only because sums allocable to the real estate Brokerage were commingled with cash from elsewhere, but because a complicated system of credits and charges relative to real estate commissions, implicating all three divisions, made it difficult to ascertain what net sums were fairly attributable to the Brokerage segment of the business. Historically, some of the credits and charges were treated so as to greatly reduce the sums allocated to the real estate division on the Debtor's consolidated accounts, although in the hearing held after the first remand, the bankruptcy judge was persuaded by accounting experts that a methodology more favorable to Debtor was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to allow the Debtor to retain any of the Disputed Funds, a court would have to resolve accounting issues that are less than clear and read language into the Stipulation that does not appear (language suggesting that the Debtor was entitled to some of the funds, or giving a means of calculating the funds to which the Debtor was entitled). Courts will not read language into a contract where it does not appear. <i>See AccuSoft Corp. v. Palo,</i> 237 F.3d 31, 41-42 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Indus., Inc.,</i> 827 F.2d 850, 855 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor argues that the phrase \"the real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business,\" which paragraph 9 allows the Debtor to retain, implies retention of monies belonging to that aspect of the business. Had the Brokerage segment been more clearly an independent business entity with, for example, its own bank account, it would perhaps be more plausible to infer inclusion of the latter among the retained assets. But the Brokerage \"segment\" mentioned in paragraph 9 was just that &#8212; a segment of the larger business; precisely what assets comprised that \"segment\" for purposes of this bankruptcy sale was not self-evident but required the considerable clarification provided in the latter part of the Stipulation, which describes in detail the various elements to be retained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Debtor would have it that paragraphs 10 and 11 merely enumerate additional assets to be retained by the Debtor. According to the Debtor, NSP's interpretation does not give adequate meaning to the language of paragraph 9. Debtor argues that paragraph 9 becomes superfluous if paragraphs 10 and 11 are read to specify the assets to be retained by the Debtor, thus violating a common tenet of contract construction: \"`every word and phrase of an instrument is if possible to be given meaning, and none is to be rejected as surplusage if any other course is rationally possible.'\" <i>FDIC v. Singh,</i> 977 F.2d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting <i>Tupper v. Hancock,</i> 319 Mass. 105, 64 N.E.2d 441, 443 (1946)). However, paragraph 9 is not rendered meaningless by NSP's interpretation. Paragraph 9 can be read as an introductory, generalized characterization of the portion of the business the Debtor was to retain, which assets (beyond the licenses and permits expressly referenced in paragraph 9) were then more precisely explicated in the following paragraphs, especially paragraphs 10 and 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree that the items listed in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Stipulation can be written off merely as assets that the Debtor received in addition to the \"real estate brokerage segment.\" To the contrary, most of the items later described within paragraphs 10 and 11 would also fit under the general rubric of \"the real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business.\" The subsequent specific descriptions in paragraphs 10 and 11 were needed so as to explicate the parties' understanding of exactly what items and rights were to be retained by the Debtor. In arguing the items in paragraph 10 and 11 are mere additions, the Debtor asserts the enumerated real estate parcels in paragraph 11 were not previously used <i>exclusively</i> by the Brokerage division. They had, however, been used in some part by that division. To show the parties' present agreement as to the precise status and use of the parcels, as well as the extent to which they would form a part of the retained segment, it was necessary, as was done, to provide the specifics in paragraph 11. Much the same is true of the cash now in dispute. It is not enough that some of the unmentioned cash in the Operating Account may have derived from past real estate brokerage operations. To show an intention to include that cash as part of the retained real estate brokerage segment, that intention needed to be stated &#8212; and given the accounting uncertainties, the amount of the cash to be retained needed to be declared &#8212; just as all the other items were listed and specified in paragraphs 10 and 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances, we think it cannot be inferred simply from the general language in paragraph 9 that the parties meant the Debtor to retain any particular amount of the commingled cash. In a bankruptcy transaction such as this, it would not be at all unreasonable for the parties to have understood that Debtor would receive the right to continue to operate the Brokerage segment without being entitled to retain the cash previously generated by brokerage operations. NSP needed cash assets to perform its obligations to pay off the bankrupt's indebtedness. The Debtor might be thought to benefit sufficiently from the right to operate the real estate segment without receiving all or part of the cash attributable to past operations of that part of the business. Without more specific reference, it is impossible to determine that the parties necessarily meant to permit the Debtor to retain some portion of the Operating Account funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already suggested, some of the current difficulty stems from the fact that \"the real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business\" was not a wholly independent business with its own bank accounts. Precisely what assets were meant to be included within the contours of that phrase were not self-explanatory, making it necessary for the parties to have described with some reasonable degree of clarity, the particular items intended to be retained. That description appears principally in paragraphs 10, 11 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this respect, a further aspect of the Stipulation should be mentioned. This is the wording at the start of paragraph 10, which declares that NSP and the Debtor shall, on the effective date of the NSP plan, execute a binding agreement containing the following provisions &#8212; provisions which themselves shall constitute such agreement if none is executed. This indication that paragraphs 10, 11 and beyond are to be a separate agreement reinforces the notion that they are to spell out the essential details of the real estate brokerage segment earlier said to be retained. And, indeed, paragraph 10 goes on to specify just such details, delineating items such as the right of the Debtor, A + C Great Island, Inc., and Burden to have and retain a non-exclusive license to use the registered \"New Seabury\" trade name and marketing materials \"in connection with real estate brokerage operations conducted by one or more of them,\" access to resort amenities and signage, and even maintenance of membership in the New Seabury Club for Christopher Burden and his wife. Given the extent of the detail in paragraphs 10 and 11, the omission therefrom of any reference to the cash in the operating account is highly significant. The parties would scarcely have overlooked mention of inclusion of a substantial share of the commingled cash from the operating account, and the amount thereof, had this, too, been part of their completed bargain, especially where it would be unclear simply from the general language in paragraph 9 how much of an uncertain amount of cash Debtor was to retain, if it was to retain any at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the lack of specific reference to the cash associated with the Brokerage segment and absence of any declared method to account for such cash, NSP also relies for a supplemental argument on the maxim <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius,</i> which mandates that when parties list specific items in a document, any document not so listed is excluded. <i>Lohnes v. Level 3 Commc'n, Inc.,</i> 272 F.3d 49, 61 (1st Cir.2001). The absence of any reference to cash when other items were delineated in paragraphs 10 and 11 indicates, according to NSP, that the cash was not intended to be retained by the Debtor. The Debtor replies that the use of the word \"including\" in paragraph 9 does not preclude the Debtor from retaining the cash. <i>See St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Lexington Ins. Co.,</i> 78 F.3d 202, 206 (5th Cir.1996) (\"[W]e are not convinced that the rule of <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> applies in the instant case as the challenged list of provisions in St. Paul's contract is prefaced by the word `including,' which is generally given an <i>expansive</i> reading, even without the additional if not redundant language of `without limitation.'\"). NSP notes, however, that unlike in the cases relied upon by the Debtor, the word \"including\" in paragraph 9 is in a separate paragraph from the language in paragraphs 10 and 11, thereby limiting the relevance of those cases in the instant situation. Paragraph 9 can be read as an introductory paragraph referring to the licenses and permits and then leading into the specifics of paragraphs 10 and 11 regarding the shared property that would be retained by Debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor argues that its position is supported by a review of the associated transaction documents. In the first exhibit to the Bill of Sale, Schedule A, the assets to be transferred from the Debtor to NSP upon the Closing are described as \"all properties, assets and rights of [Debtor] not associated with or generated by the Real Estate Brokerage Operations.\" The Debtor claims that cash is one such asset \"generated by\" the Brokerage Division. Further, Debtor argues that if it were to retain only a limited set of assets of the Brokerage Division, rather than the entirety of the \"real estate brokerage segment,\" then Schedule F, which sets forth a list of assets that were to be transferred to NSP despite being located in the real estate Brokerage segment's offices, would have been unnecessary. Moreover, the list of enumerated items in Schedule F including \"5 Wastebaskets,\" \"1 Casio Calculator,\" and \"1 Lamp\" further suggests that NSP was cognizant of the need to distinguish specific items from the all-encompassing (and thus cash-including language) of the \"real estate brokerage segment\" language in paragraph 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor's arguments are not supported by the full language and context of the Bill of Sale. The sentence cited by the Debtor includes a parenthetical specifically noting that the distribution of the cash will be resolved by the court. The complete language in Schedule A provides that \"<i>in addition to</i> any assets being retained by [the Debtor] pursuant to the [Stipulation]... the Purchased Assets <i>shall not include any personalty located in the real property</i> to be retained by [the Debtor] under the Stipulation unless set forth on Schedule F hereto ...\" (emphasis added). The Bill of Sale recognized that the Debtor would retain only the assets listed in the Stipulation and therefore specified in the Schedule that the Debtor could retain the inconsequential property inside the offices as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor's Schedule F argument likewise seems limited by the fact that Schedule A provides for the retention by the Debtor of the real estate office in which the real estate business is conducted, so that it would have been important for NSP to identify any objects it wished to take from that property. Such specification does not necessarily imply that the parties assumed that larger assets, like the cash, were included in the paragraph 9 reference to the \"real estate brokerage segment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its reversal of the bankruptcy court's ruling that the Debtor was not entitled to the cash, the district court noted the traditional commercial practice of a seller's retaining the cash associated with the business it sells. It further observed, however, that the instant case is complicated by the fact that it is not a simple commercial transaction but a bankruptcy proceeding. \"The interpretation of a stipulated amendment to a bankruptcy reorganization plan must ... recognize certain concerns lurking in the background: that creditors be paid; that the debtor be rehabilitated; and that neither the debtor nor any creditor receive a windfall.\" Here, NSP assumed the cost of nearly $8 million to satisfy the Debtor's creditors. It is not unreasonable to read the Stipulation and associated documentation to be maximizing the total transfer of cash assets to NSP while still allowing the Debtor to maintain the real estate Brokerage for future use. As the district court noted, \"a `segment of ... business' can be a valuable and coherent asset if limited to goodwill, real property, equipment, and intellectual property needed to operate the business, even without cash.\" Additionally, \"[a] reading of the Stipulation that excludes cash might be consistent with the absence of a negotiated cash valuation method, and the bankruptcy context in which the primary goal is to pay back the Debtor's creditors.\" The district court observed that the Debtor has been able to operate the Brokerage for several years without the use of the Disputed Funds. Christopher Burden put an undisclosed amount of his personal capital into the business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ultimately concluded that NSP should bear the loss because it was in a better position to protect its assets in the drafting of the Stipulation. We are unable to accept that rationale. Both parties were represented by attorneys. If retention of the cash was an item of importance to the Debtor, it is not unreasonable to believe that it would have sought to negotiate a reference thereto in the Stipulation. We see no unfairness in holding against the Debtor in the absence of such a reference, such absence being indicative that the parties formed no such agreement. While doubtless the bankrupt party was in a weaker negotiating position, that cannot justify rewriting the parties' agreement for presumed equitable reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the bankruptcy court's initial conclusion (and the district court's acknowledgment of the reasoning underlying it) was correct. The plain language of the Stipulation and associated documentation does not support a conclusion that the Disputed Funds or some portion of them were intended to be retained by the Debtor. The funds were in the Operating Account, and the Stipulation provided neither express reference to the cash nor any reference to a method of accounting for the Brokerage's share of the cash. By contrast, paragraph 11 itemizes the real property to be retained by the Debtor which had not been exclusive property of the Brokerage division. The bankruptcy court's conclusion that the Debtor was not entitled to retain the cash is in keeping with the plain language of the contract documents and also acknowledges the unique posture of the bankruptcy proceeding which sets this case apart from a traditional commercial transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Remanded</i> with directions to affirm the initial judgment of the bankruptcy court and to vacate the contrary judgments of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Neither party contends that the Stipulation (or other relevant contract document, if any) is ambiguous.

It is thus largely irrelevant that had Debtor's entire business been sold or retained, its cash assets might be deemed to be included as part thereof.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The funds relative to the divisions were commingled in the Debtor's single operating account. The functions of the three divisions were as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Recreation Division maintained and operated two golf courses and a golf club house, a tennis facility, a beach club, and a swimming pool facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hotel Division managed and maintained a hotel facility using Debtor and third-party-owned property for short term rental by guests of the New Seabury Resort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Real Estate Division operated a real estate brokerage (the \"Brokerage\"). The Brokerage operated one real estate company, New Seabury Real Estate, that sold Debtor and non-Debtor property on the New Seabury Resort and another real estate company, Sound Realty, that brokered short-term and long-term rentals of property for private individuals within New Seabury Resort. Commissions provided the Brokerage's primary source of revenue. The Brokerage was never a member of the Multiple Listing Service (\"MLS\") and, as the exclusive broker, sold most of the property in New Seabury. MLS brokers not related to the Brokerage sold a small percentage of the property; the Brokerage and unrelated MLS brokers would share some sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the bankruptcy proceedings, the Debtor and NSP offered competing plans for reorganization of the Debtor. On May 15, 1998, the bankruptcy court entered an Order and Preliminary Decision stating that the Debtor's plan was not confirmable, but NSP's was. For two days leading up to the confirmation hearing on May 29, 1998, the Debtor and NSP engaged in negotiations to resolve the differences between their competing plans. Ultimately, on May 29, the parties executed a stipulation (the \"Stipulation\"), pursuant to which the Debtor withdrew its own plan for reorganization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Stipulation noted that NSP's plan, to which the Debtor now consented, provided for NSP to acquire substantially all of the Debtors' assets. So as to resolve the parties' controversy, however, the Debtor and NSP stipulated that \"certain assets of the Debtor will not be acquired by NSP and will be retained by the Debtor free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims and interest.\" Thus, paragraph 9 of the Stipulation provided that \"[t]he real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business, including all licenses and permits required to operate that segment of the business, shall be retained by the Debtor.\" Paragraph 10 of the Stipulation went on to state that the parties would execute on the plan's effective date (the \"Effective Date\") an agreement containing \"the following provisions, and failing the execution of such agreement the provisions as set forth herein shall constitute such agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clauses a, b, and c of paragraph 10 then provided that the Debtor, A + C Great Island, Inc., and Christopher Burden would retain a non-exclusive license to use the requested trade name \"New Seabury\" in connection with real estate brokerage operations conducted by one or more of them for as long as Burden or his family maintained a majority ownership interest or were involved in daily operations. The license would include the right to use the New Seabury name in marketing materials. Additionally, the Brokerage operations were to have access to all resort amenities, including related pictures and information, in its marketing and other material for viewing and touring, with specified free membership rights to be granted to Christopher and Nancy Burden in the New Seabury Club. Non-exclusive signage rights were also granted to the Brokerage operations relating to real estate service operations in NSP's post-confirmation New Seabury related property, with various limitations spelled out as to the form and location of the signage, its acceptability to the Debtor and NSP, and changes desired by NSP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 11 of the Stipulation also contained details and limitations relative to the retained Brokerage operation. The Debtor would retain certain specified real property on which real estate service operations are conducted, including the main New Seabury real estate office and adjacent parking facilities, and certain other parcels. On and for a two-year period following the Effective Date, the Debtor was to allow NSP use of three desks on one of these parcels rent-free, along with certain spelled-out rights to install phone lines and place its own reasonable office equipment. Properties to be retained by the Debtor were to be free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims and interests with additional conditions specified as to a particular note held by Burden and a mortgage on one parcel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 12 of the Stipulation provided for execution by the parties of a limited non-competition agreement prohibiting NSP and its assignees, successors, and assigns from engaging in real estate brokerage within New Seabury, except as to its own properties, and the Debtor, A + C Great Island and Burden from engaging in resort operations within the boundaries of the New Seabury development and within a three-mile radius. Nothing, however, was to prohibit NSP from employing a broker of its choice to market its properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 13 specified that \"except as provided herein and except as to the obligations of NSP under the NSP Plan,\" all parties \"shall be deemed to have remised, released and forever discharged against the other any and all debts, demands, obligations, avoidance actions, causes of action and any other\" claims, through the Effective Date of the NSP plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining paragraphs of the Stipulation dealt with the discharge of debts, providing, inter alia, that NSP did not release its debts against the Debtor and that Burden released certain of his debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing was said in the Stipulation as to retention or ownership of monies held in the Debtor's operating account.

After the Confirmation Date, the Debtor continued to operate the Brokerage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the preparation of the documents to close the transaction transferring the bulk of the Debtor's assets to NSP, a dispute arose regarding whether the Debtor was entitled to receive and retain the net cash the Brokerage had generated through the Effective Date of NSP's plan (the \"Disputed Funds\"). As noted, revenue from the Brokerage operations was commingled with that from the Debtor's two other divisions in a single Operating Account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to complete the closing, the documents specifically excluded the Disputed Funds pending resolution of the parties' rights (the specific language is quoted below). The parties executed the final closing documents on September 17, 1998 (the \"Closing\"), which was also the Effective Date of the reorganization plan. The bill of sale provided that the Debtor agreed to sell all of the Debtor's rights and title but specifically excluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) any assets being retained by New Seabury Company Limited Partnership pursuant to the Stipulation Relating to Competing Plans of Reorganization, Objections to Confirmation, Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Plan Partnership, entered into on May 29, 1998 (the \"Stipulation\"); (ii) telephone number (508) 477-9400 pending a further determination of the Debtor's right to retain that number; and (iii) property, assets and rights, generated by or associated with the Seller's Real Estate Brokerage Operations (the \"Brokerage Operations\") including net cash generated by the Brokerage Operations from January 1, 1998 through September 16, 1998 in the amount of $553,762.00, as estimated by the Seller which amount shall remain in the Debtor's account in its entirety until such time as the Court adjudicates the rights of the Seller and NSP thereto, or until further agreement of the parties, and any Purchased Assets described on Schedules (\"B,\" \"C,\" \"D\" and \"E\" hereto).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Closing, the Debtor retained the desks, computers, fixtures, independent contractor agreements, marketing materials, furniture and other equipment at the Brokerage.

The Debtor resisted, contending that the Disputed Funds were an asset of the Brokerage which, under the terms of the Stipulation, it was entitled to retain. It insisted that brokerage-related revenues kept in the Operating Account went to the Debtor by implication under paragraph 9 of the Stipulation, which allowed the Debtor to retain \"the real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business.\" NSP responded that the Stipulation made no reference to retention by the Debtor of any portion of the Operating Account, hence the Disputed Funds belonged to NSP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

In its March 11, 1999 Order on the case, the bankruptcy court analyzed paragraph 9 of the Stipulation and the Bill of Sale and concluded that the two documents could not \"be read to transfer or permit the Debtor to retain any portion of the General Operating Account.\" Paragraph 9 of the Stipulation reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business, including all licenses and permits required to operate that segment of the business, shall be retained by the Debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent part of the subsequent Bill of Sale reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Purchased Assets conveyed to New Seabury Properties, LLC shall specifically exclude (i) any assets being retained by New Seabury Company Limited Partnership pursuant to the Stipulation Relating to Competing Plans of Reorganization, Objections to Confirmation, Motion for Reconsideration and Motion for Plan Modification between New Seabury Properties, LLC and New Seabury Company Limited Partnership, entered into on May 29, 1998(ii) telephone number (508) 477-9400 pending a further determination of the Debtor's right to retain that number and (iii) property, assets and rights, generated by or associated with the Debtor's Real Estate Brokerage Operations including net cash generated by the Brokerage Operations from January 1, 1998 through September 16, 1998 in the amount of $553,762, as estimated by the Seller which amount shall remain in the Debtor's account in its entirety until such time as the Court adjudicates the rights of the Seller and NSP thereto, or until further agreement of the parties....</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court wrote:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Analogizing the situation to the construction of wills, the district court noted that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[c]ourts have consistently concluded that a business cannot be considered separately from the funds used to run it ....

He held that the cash assets of the Brokerage were part of the business and were necessary to keep the business operating, but specifically did not \"reach the issue as to whether any of the funds in the [Operating] [A]ccount were truly attributable to the [Brokerage].\" The district court's Order remanded the case and directed the bankruptcy court \"to determine the amount of cash in the general operating account which is attributable to the brokerage operations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Bankruptcy Court's Order on the First Remand</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the bankruptcy court conducted a three-day trial. It concluded first that the calculations of the amount in the fund were to begin on January 1, 1998. Determination of the amount to which each of the parties was entitled required consideration of three elements: the total amount of Disputed Funds; the application of real estate credits given to parties who bought real estate through the Brokerage; and the application of certain other costs, which are discussed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a pretrial stipulation in the bankruptcy court, entered into prior to the hearing on remand, the parties had agreed that the maximum amount of the Disputed Funds that the Debtor could recover was the net revenue that the Brokerage earned from January 1, 1998 until September 18, 1998, or $479,457, and that the amount inclusive of the Credits and Charges would be $55,670.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor offered parties that purchased real estate through the Brokerage a \"credit\" (the \"Credit\" or the \"Credits\"). The purchasers of the property could apply the Credit towards the initiation fee required of new members to join the New Seabury Country Club (the \"Club\"). The Recreation Division ran the Club. Membership in the Club enabled a member to use its facilities, including the golf courses. The amount of the Credit was a percentage of the commission and could be applied towards the initiation fee for as long as the homeowner remained a property owner at New Seabury Resort. Credits exercised during the relevant period totaled $298,866.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"real estate carrying costs\" (the \"Charges\") were costs associated with unsold property of the Debtor such as landscaping costs, depreciation and condo fees. The unsold properties themselves were placed under control of the Hotel Division and used as short term rentals. The parties agreed in the pretrial stipulation that for the period of January 1, 1998 to September 17, 1998, the Charges totaled $124,921.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor historically maintained consolidated financial statements for all of its revenue producing entities, including New Seabury Real Estate, Sound Realty, and the Club. When homeowners utilized the Credits and joined the Club, the Debtor recorded the total amount of the initiation fee, including the Credit, as income to the Resort Division. The Debtor recorded the amount of the Credit as an expense to the Real Estate Division at the time of its exercise. The Charges were also treated as an expense of the Brokerage. The bankruptcy court held that, treating the Brokerage as a separate entity, the historic treatment of the Credits and Charges was inappropriate to its determination. It adopted testimony from expert witnesses as to applicable accounting principles and concluded that \"the Recreation Division would have recorded both the income and expense of the Credit and, in essence, recorded the transaction as a reduced price sale,\" and that the Charges were \"properly attributable to the Hotel Division for the Charges bore no relationship to the Brokerage.\" The bankruptcy court ultimately concluded that the Debtor was entitled to the entire $479,457 of the Disputed Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second appeal to the district court followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. The District Court's Second Order and Remand</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its March 5, 2004 Memorandum &amp; Order, the district court reaffirmed its earlier ruling that cash in the Operating Account attributable to the Brokerage operation formed a part of the Brokerage segment of Debtor's business which the Debtor was allowed to retain under the Stipulation. However, it was unsatisfied with the accounting rationale accepted by the bankruptcy court based upon a methodology not historically followed in the Debtor's own consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, it remanded for recalculation of the sums applicable to the brokerage segment, the recalculation to be based on the original accounting methodology, <i>see supra.</i> The court suggested this would lead the parties to the $55,970 figure earlier stipulated to in the bankruptcy court or to $83,846, the net income of the Real Estate Division reflected in earlier accounting statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In once again grappling with the case, the district court also noted its own dissatisfaction with its earlier rationale for concluding that cash traceable to real estate brokerage operations should be treated as a part of the retained assets to which the Debtor was entitled. The district court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further reflection has persuaded me that this case law [i.e., that resting on testamentary dispositions of businesses] is not fully sufficient to support my earlier conclusion. Wills involve different modes of construction than arm's-length commercial transactions, let alone settlements in bankruptcy proceedings, because the relationships between the parties, the ultimate goals of the instruments, and the interpretive goals of the court differ.... In sum, courts are likely to construe a bequest generously, because the testator manifestly sought to give something of value to a worthy beneficiary, and because any verbal missteps in the will are neither the beneficiary's fault, nor errors against which the beneficiary could have protected himself.... A Chapter 11 bankrupt cannot fairly claim the benefits of this analogy; it is, after all, not a deserving child inheriting the family business, but rather an insolvent permitted to remain in business for the benefit of creditors. Nevertheless, the bankruptcy court should treat the writings surrounding a reorganization with an eye toward the equities of reorganization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court went on to affirm its conclusion that the term \"business\" in the Stipulation necessarily included cash by reference to other modes of analysis, including contract interpretation, but noted that it was essentially performing a \"functional analysis of the parties' arrangement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it acknowledged that the relevant documents did not explicitly mention cash as among the assets to be retained by the Debtor and that \"[a] reading of the Stipulation that excludes cash might be consistent with the absence of a negotiated cash valuation method, and the bankruptcy context in which the primary goal is to pay back the Debtor's creditors,\" the district court nonetheless concluded that \"the loss should lie with NSP, because it was in a better position to protect its interests by writing more detailed contractual language, and because its theory of the limits of a `business' does not lead to a coherent resolution.\" The court additionally noted that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[t]he general rubrics for construction of analogous writings do not provide a full answer to the question. Nor does general business practice. A business may be conveyed in a variety of states &#8212; all assets, all assets except cash, all nonliquid assets, goodwill and intellectual and real property only, goodwill only, and so on &#8212; and therefore the answer must necessarily turn on the degree that any default position has been refined. In this context, the Debtor draws a simple and coherent line: a `business' includes all its assets unless stated otherwise. NSP, having asserted that the line actually falls somewhere <i>inside</i> the set of business assets, must provide a logical place in which to draw it, but has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the issue of the proper way to account for the cash it found Debtor was entitled to retain, the district court noted that while historically, the Debtor had recorded the initiation fee at the country club as income to the Recreation Division, it had recorded the amount of the credit as a loss to the Real Estate division. In August 1998, after the Stipulation had been executed and the plan had been confirmed, the Debtor's principal, Christopher Burden, told his accountant to \"rework the figures for the Real Estate Operations.\" The new accounting treated initiation fee credits as losses to the Recreation Division, not the Real Estate Division. The effect of this new accounting system was to increase the net income of the Real Estate Division on the consolidated financial statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that, under its new analysis based on the parties' intent to form a contract, it was only permissible for NSP to be found to have assented to the terms of the bargain it could reasonably foresee. The district court observed that NSP could not have foreseen the Debtor's change in accounting methodology: \"It is one thing for a court to hold NSP to the reasonably foreseeable consequences of its ill-defined bargain with the Debtor; it is quite another for the court to hold NSP to terms that could not possibly have been on the table.\" The district court thus vacated the bankruptcy court's calculation of the cash attributable to the Debtor and remanded for a recalculation under the original accounting methodology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If by March 22, 2004, the parties are unable to agree upon a stipulated figure, I will remand to the Bankruptcy Court to determine the amount of cash attributable to the brokerage, using, January 1, 1998 as a start date, but applying the accounting methodologies employed by the Debtor on the date the Plan was confirmed. [footnote 13] The parties shall file a status report by no later than March 24, 2004 regarding the issues to be resolved. In all other respects, the decision of the Bankruptcy Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the cited footnote, the district court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I assume that the parties or the Bankruptcy Court will naturally gravitate towards either the $55,670 figure in the parties' joint pretrial stipulation, or $83,846, the net income of the Real Estate Division reflected on Debtor's financial statements, which treated both the real estate credits and the carrying costs as losses to the Real Estate Division. However, the parties and, if necessary, the Bankruptcy Court are free to determine the appropriate number under the former methodology based on an independent review of the financial data. If the parties are unable to agree, the Bankruptcy Court may, but need not, receive new evidence beyond what has already been presented to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The parties' status report indicated that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of footnote 13 of the Memorandum and Order, NSP offered to stipulate to the $55,670 figure in the parties' join pretrial stipulation. Debtor responded that there was no figure within the range described in footnote 13 of the Memorandum and Order to which it would stipulate. Debtor did not provide a figure to which it was willing to stipulate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. The Bankruptcy Court's Order on Second Remand</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the bankruptcy court, \"mechanically applying the accounting principles historically used by Debtor,\" held that the Debtor was entitled to $55,670 of the Disputed Funds. The district court affirmed that order, and both parties appealed to this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NSP in its cross-appeal argues that the district court erred in reversing the bankruptcy court's initial ruling that the Debtor was not entitled to any portion of the Operating Account, hence could receive no part of the Disputed Funds. Understandably, the Debtor sees no virtue in the initial bankruptcy court's rejection of its claim to funds in the Operating Account, and asks us to uphold its retention of $479,457 as found by the bankruptcy court on the first remand. The Debtor urges that the district court later erred both in altering its own analysis after the first remand to limit recovery to the Debtor's historic accounting principles and in suggesting the much lower range of totals from which the bankruptcy court was to choose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NSP responds that if we find the Debtor is owed some portion of the cash in the operating account, it should be the lowest possible amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the issue is somewhat close, we incline towards the bankruptcy court's original finding denying to the Debtor retention of any of the funds in the Operating Account. The plain language of the Stipulation and the fact that this transaction occurred in the context of a bankruptcy, not a traditional commercial sale, among other reasons, support this conclusion. Accordingly, we hold that the Debtor is not entitled to receive any portion of the Disputed Funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy and district courts' rulings regarding the Debtor's entitlement under the Stipulation to the funds in the Operating Account are matters of law reviewed de novo, and any findings of fact made by the bankruptcy court are reviewed for clear error. <i>In re LaRoche,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587244\"><a href=\"/opinion/587244/in-re-david-f-laroche-david-f-laroche-v-amoskeag-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span>, 1301 (1st Cir.1992).

As noted, NSP now argues that the district court erred both in its 1999 order when, using testamentary bequest analysis, it reversed the bankruptcy court's initial conclusion that the contract documents between the parties could not be read to leave any money from the operating account in the hands of the Debtor, and again in 2004 when it reaffirmed its theory underlying its 1999 Order but applied a \"functional\" analysis which concluded that NSP was more capable of looking out for its interests than was the Debtor and thus was required to bear the loss. NSP argues that the district court's approach ignores the standard principles of contract interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor, of course, agrees with the district court's reversal of the bankruptcy court's original ruling but not with its revised order regarding accounting. For the reasons explained below, we agree with the bankruptcy court that, under the language of the Stipulation and accompanying documents, the Debtor is not entitled to any of the cash in the Operating Account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plan of reorganization is a binding contract between the debtor and the creditors and is subject to the general rules of contract construction and interpretation. <i>See In re Sergi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022326/in-re-sergi/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 589 (1st Cir.1999).

Christopher and Nancy Burden will be afforded full membership rights in the New Seabury Club at no cost for as long as Mr. Burden has a majority ownership interest in or participates in daily operations of the brokerage operations, or for as long as either Mr. Burden or Mrs. Burden reside at New Seabury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. The brokerage operations will have the non-exclusive right to place reasonable temporary signage (e.g. open house signs) and permanent signage relating to real estate service operations on NSP's post-confirmation New Seabury related property. The permanent signage shall be where presently located and shall be in its present form, or in a form reasonably acceptable to the Debtor and NSP, provided however, that NSP may change the permanent signage so long as such signage is of equal visibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11. Real property on which the real estate service operations are conducted, including and limited to, the main New Seabury real estate office and the adjacent parking facilities, the Popponessett Real Estate Parcel as identified in the Debtor's Plan and the parcel at the Mashpee Rotary on Routes 28 and 151 referred to as the Sound Realty Parcel shall be retained by the Debtor. The Debtor shall, on and for a two-year period following the Effective Date, afford NSP use of three desks at the Sound Realty location rent-free. NSP may, at its sole option and expense, install its own phone lines and place its own reasonable office equipment, including a facsimile and copy machine in the Sound Realty property for as long as it has the right to utilize that property. Except as provided herein, the properties retained by the Debtor shall be free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims and interests. NSP shall have no obligation to the Debtor, Burden, or any affiliates with respect to the Sound Realty Parcel, the New Seabury Real Estate Office, or the Popponessett Real Estate Parcel, including, without limitation, the note held by Christopher Burden in the original principal, except for the existing mortgage lien on the Popponnessett Real Estate Parcel, which mortgage will be paid in accordance with the NSP plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the Stipulation makes no reference to the retention by Debtor of any portion of the cash held in the Debtor's Operating Account. The Real Estate Division maintained no bank account of its own. All the cash attributable to the three operating divisions was held in the Debtor's single operating account, where they were commingled. One would expect, if the parties to the Stipulation had intended the Debtor to retain up to $500,000 from the commingled operating account, that they would have said so. Especially would this be expected in a Stipulation settling a bankruptcy which specifies in detail the other real estate Brokerage assets of significance that were to be retained by the Debtor. The need to specify a considerable sum of cash, if it was to be retained, would have seemed especially obvious in this context not only because sums allocable to the real estate Brokerage were commingled with cash from elsewhere, but because a complicated system of credits and charges relative to real estate commissions, implicating all three divisions, made it difficult to ascertain what net sums were fairly attributable to the Brokerage segment of the business. Historically, some of the credits and charges were treated so as to greatly reduce the sums allocated to the real estate division on the Debtor's consolidated accounts, although in the hearing held after the first remand, the bankruptcy judge was persuaded by accounting experts that a methodology more favorable to Debtor was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to allow the Debtor to retain any of the Disputed Funds, a court would have to resolve accounting issues that are less than clear and read language into the Stipulation that does not appear (language suggesting that the Debtor was entitled to some of the funds, or giving a means of calculating the funds to which the Debtor was entitled). Courts will not read language into a contract where it does not appear. <i>See AccuSoft Corp. v. Palo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771700\"><a href=\"/opinion/771700/accusoft-corporation-appellantcross-appellee-v-james-l-palo-simon/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 41-42 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>Mathewson Corp. v.

Had the Brokerage segment been more clearly an independent business entity with, for example, its own bank account, it would perhaps be more plausible to infer inclusion of the latter among the retained assets. But the Brokerage \"segment\" mentioned in paragraph 9 was just that &#8212; a segment of the larger business; precisely what assets comprised that \"segment\" for purposes of this bankruptcy sale was not self-evident but required the considerable clarification provided in the latter part of the Stipulation, which describes in detail the various elements to be retained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Debtor would have it that paragraphs 10 and 11 merely enumerate additional assets to be retained by the Debtor. According to the Debtor, NSP's interpretation does not give adequate meaning to the language of paragraph 9. Debtor argues that paragraph 9 becomes superfluous if paragraphs 10 and 11 are read to specify the assets to be retained by the Debtor, thus violating a common tenet of contract construction: \"`every word and phrase of an instrument is if possible to be given meaning, and none is to be rejected as surplusage if any other course is rationally possible.'\" <i>FDIC v. Singh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592214\"><a href=\"/opinion/592214/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-pritam-singh/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting <i>Tupper v. Hancock,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></span>, 443 (1946)). However, paragraph 9 is not rendered meaningless by NSP's interpretation. Paragraph 9 can be read as an introductory, generalized characterization of the portion of the business the Debtor was to retain, which assets (beyond the licenses and permits expressly referenced in paragraph 9) were then more precisely explicated in the following paragraphs, especially paragraphs 10 and 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree that the items listed in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Stipulation can be written off merely as assets that the Debtor received in addition to the \"real estate brokerage segment.\" To the contrary, most of the items later described within paragraphs 10 and 11 would also fit under the general rubric of \"the real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business.\" The subsequent specific descriptions in paragraphs 10 and 11 were needed so as to explicate the parties' understanding of exactly what items and rights were to be retained by the Debtor. In arguing the items in paragraph 10 and 11 are mere additions, the Debtor asserts the enumerated real estate parcels in paragraph 11 were not previously used <i>exclusively</i> by the Brokerage division. They had, however, been used in some part by that division. To show the parties' present agreement as to the precise status and use of the parcels, as well as the extent to which they would form a part of the retained segment, it was necessary, as was done, to provide the specifics in paragraph 11. Much the same is true of the cash now in dispute. It is not enough that some of the unmentioned cash in the Operating Account may have derived from past real estate brokerage operations. To show an intention to include that cash as part of the retained real estate brokerage segment, that intention needed to be stated &#8212; and given the accounting uncertainties, the amount of the cash to be retained needed to be declared &#8212; just as all the other items were listed and specified in paragraphs 10 and 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the circumstances, we think it cannot be inferred simply from the general language in paragraph 9 that the parties meant the Debtor to retain any particular amount of the commingled cash. In a bankruptcy transaction such as this, it would not be at all unreasonable for the parties to have understood that Debtor would receive the right to continue to operate the Brokerage segment without being entitled to retain the cash previously generated by brokerage operations. NSP needed cash assets to perform its obligations to pay off the bankrupt's indebtedness. The Debtor might be thought to benefit sufficiently from the right to operate the real estate segment without receiving all or part of the cash attributable to past operations of that part of the business. Without more specific reference, it is impossible to determine that the parties necessarily meant to permit the Debtor to retain some portion of the Operating Account funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already suggested, some of the current difficulty stems from the fact that \"the real estate brokerage segment of the Debtor's business\" was not a wholly independent business with its own bank accounts. Precisely what assets were meant to be included within the contours of that phrase were not self-explanatory, making it necessary for the parties to have described with some reasonable degree of clarity, the particular items intended to be retained. That description appears principally in paragraphs 10, 11 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this respect, a further aspect of the Stipulation should be mentioned. This is the wording at the start of paragraph 10, which declares that NSP and the Debtor shall, on the effective date of the NSP plan, execute a binding agreement containing the following provisions &#8212; provisions which themselves shall constitute such agreement if none is executed. This indication that paragraphs 10, 11 and beyond are to be a separate agreement reinforces the notion that they are to spell out the essential details of the real estate brokerage segment earlier said to be retained. And, indeed, paragraph 10 goes on to specify just such details, delineating items such as the right of the Debtor, A + C Great Island, Inc., and Burden to have and retain a non-exclusive license to use the registered \"New Seabury\" trade name and marketing materials \"in connection with real estate brokerage operations conducted by one or more of them,\" access to resort amenities and signage, and even maintenance of membership in the New Seabury Club for Christopher Burden and his wife. Given the extent of the detail in paragraphs 10 and 11, the omission therefrom of any reference to the cash in the operating account is highly significant. The parties would scarcely have overlooked mention of inclusion of a substantial share of the commingled cash from the operating account, and the amount thereof, had this, too, been part of their completed bargain, especially where it would be unclear simply from the general language in paragraph 9 how much of an uncertain amount of cash Debtor was to retain, if it was to retain any at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the lack of specific reference to the cash associated with the Brokerage segment and absence of any declared method to account for such cash, NSP also relies for a supplemental argument on the maxim <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius,</i> which mandates that when parties list specific items in a document, any document not so listed is excluded. <i>Lohnes v. Level 3 Commc'n, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199704\"><a href=\"/opinion/199704/lohnes-v-level-3-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir.2001). The absence of any reference to cash when other items were delineated in paragraphs 10 and 11 indicates, according to NSP, that the cash was not intended to be retained by the Debtor. The Debtor replies that the use of the word \"including\" in paragraph 9 does not preclude the Debtor from retaining the cash. <i>See St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Lexington Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8876\"><a href=\"/opinion/8876/st-paul-mercury-ins-v-lexington-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 206 (5th Cir.1996) (\"[W]e are not convinced that the rule of <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> applies in the instant case as the challenged list of provisions in St. Paul's contract is prefaced by the word `including,' which is generally given an <i>expansive</i> reading, even without the additional if not redundant language of `without limitation.'\"). NSP notes, however, that unlike in the cases relied upon by the Debtor, the word \"including\" in paragraph 9 is in a separate paragraph from the language in paragraphs 10 and 11, thereby limiting the relevance of those cases in the instant situation. Paragraph 9 can be read as an introductory paragraph referring to the licenses and permits and then leading into the specifics of paragraphs 10 and 11 regarding the shared property that would be retained by Debtor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor argues that its position is supported by a review of the associated transaction documents. In the first exhibit to the Bill of Sale, Schedule A, the assets to be transferred from the Debtor to NSP upon the Closing are described as \"all properties, assets and rights of [Debtor] not associated with or generated by the Real Estate Brokerage Operations.\" The Debtor claims that cash is one such asset \"generated by\" the Brokerage Division. Further, Debtor argues that if it were to retain only a limited set of assets of the Brokerage Division, rather than the entirety of the \"real estate brokerage segment,\" then Schedule F, which sets forth a list of assets that were to be transferred to NSP despite being located in the real estate Brokerage segment's offices, would have been unnecessary. Moreover, the list of enumerated items in Schedule F including \"5 Wastebaskets,\" \"1 Casio Calculator,\" and \"1 Lamp\" further suggests that NSP was cognizant of the need to distinguish specific items from the all-encompassing (and thus cash-including language) of the \"real estate brokerage segment\" language in paragraph 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor's arguments are not supported by the full language and context of the Bill of Sale. The sentence cited by the Debtor includes a parenthetical specifically noting that the distribution of the cash will be resolved by the court. The complete language in Schedule A provides that \"<i>in addition to</i> any assets being retained by [the Debtor] pursuant to the [Stipulation]... the Purchased Assets <i>shall not include any personalty located in the real property</i> to be retained by [the Debtor] under the Stipulation unless set forth on Schedule F hereto ...\" (emphasis added). The Bill of Sale recognized that the Debtor would retain only the assets listed in the Stipulation and therefore specified in the Schedule that the Debtor could retain the inconsequential property inside the offices as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Debtor's Schedule F argument likewise seems limited by the fact that Schedule A provides for the retention by the Debtor of the real estate office in which the real estate business is conducted, so that it would have been important for NSP to identify any objects it wished to take from that property. Such specification does not necessarily imply that the parties assumed that larger assets, like the cash, were included in the paragraph 9 reference to the \"real estate brokerage segment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its reversal of the bankruptcy court's ruling that the Debtor was not entitled to the cash, the district court noted the traditional commercial practice of a seller's retaining the cash associated with the business it sells. It further observed, however, that the instant case is complicated by the fact that it is not a simple commercial transaction but a bankruptcy proceeding. \"The interpretation of a stipulated amendment to a bankruptcy reorganization plan must ... recognize certain concerns lurking in the background: that creditors be paid; that the debtor be rehabilitated; and that neither the debtor nor any creditor receive a windfall.\" Here, NSP assumed the cost of nearly $8 million to satisfy the Debtor's creditors. It is not unreasonable to read the Stipulation and associated documentation to be maximizing the total transfer of cash assets to NSP while still allowing the Debtor to maintain the real estate Brokerage for future use. As the district court noted, \"a `segment of ... business' can be a valuable and coherent asset if limited to goodwill, real property, equipment, and intellectual property needed to operate the business, even without cash.\" Additionally, \"[a] reading of the Stipulation that excludes cash might be consistent with the absence of a negotiated cash valuation method, and the bankruptcy context in which the primary goal is to pay back the Debtor's creditors.\" The district court observed that the Debtor has been able to operate the Brokerage for several years without the use of the Disputed Funds. Christopher Burden put an undisclosed amount of his personal capital into the business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ultimately concluded that NSP should bear the loss because it was in a better position to protect its assets in the drafting of the Stipulation. We are unable to accept that rationale. Both parties were represented by attorneys. If retention of the cash was an item of importance to the Debtor, it is not unreasonable to believe that it would have sought to negotiate a reference thereto in the Stipulation. We see no unfairness in holding against the Debtor in the absence of such a reference, such absence being indicative that the parties formed no such agreement. While doubtless the bankrupt party was in a weaker negotiating position, that cannot justify rewriting the parties' agreement for presumed equitable reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe the bankruptcy court's initial conclusion (and the district court's acknowledgment of the reasoning underlying it) was correct. The plain language of the Stipulation and associated documentation does not support a conclusion that the Disputed Funds or some portion of them were intended to be retained by the Debtor. The funds were in the Operating Account, and the Stipulation provided neither express reference to the cash nor any reference to a method of accounting for the Brokerage's share of the cash. By contrast, paragraph 11 itemizes the real property to be retained by the Debtor which had not been exclusive property of the Brokerage division. The bankruptcy court's conclusion that the Debtor was not entitled to retain the cash is in keeping with the plain language of the contract documents and also acknowledges the unique posture of the bankruptcy proceeding which sets this case apart from a traditional commercial transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Remanded</i> with directions to affirm the initial judgment of the bankruptcy court and to vacate the contrary judgments of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Neither party contends that the Stipulation (or other relevant contract document, if any) is ambiguous. We see no occasion, therefore, to pass on that possibility, and do not do so</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court was persuaded by the \"simple and coherent line\" drawn by the Debtor, to the effect that \"a `business' includes all its assets unless stated otherwise.\"<i>See supra.</i> It is notable, however, that what was to be retained here was not the Debtor's \"business,\" as such, but rather the real estate brokerage \"segment\" of the Debtor's business. It is thus largely irrelevant that had Debtor's entire business been sold or retained, its cash assets might be deemed to be included as part thereof.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
