Byron      Barber,    an    inmate    at   the   Adult\n\nCorrectional Institute (\"ACI\") in Rhode Island, appeals pro se from\n\nthe     district      court's   dismissal      of     his    complaint,       upon    the\n\nrecommendation of a magistrate judge, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6).       Defendants-appellees, employees and officials of ACI,\n\nhave moved for summary affirmance.\n\n               Barber    asserted     due    process        and    equal    protection\n\nviolations arising out of a debit from Barber's inmate account of\n\na total of $237.03 in satisfaction of two orders of restitution\n\nentered against him by the prison disciplinary review board for\n\ndestruction of government property.                 Barber also alleged that the\n\ndebit constituted an unlawful taking in violation of the Fifth\n\nAmendment.           However,   Barber's     own    allegations       state    that    he\n\nreceived disciplinary reports which gave him notice of the charges\n\nand of the estimated repair costs, and that he was afforded a\n\ndisciplinary hearing as well as administrative review; indeed,\n\nBarber asserts that he \"challenged and contested [the disciplinary\n\ncharges and orders of restitution] to the extent of administrative\n\nremedies within the Department of Corrections.\"                    These allegations\n\nmake clear that Barber received all the process he was due.                           See\n\nWolff     v.    McDonnell,      418   U.S.     445,     454       (1974);     Smith    v.\n\nMassachusetts Dep't of Correction, 936 F.2d 1390, 1398-1400 (1st\n\nCir. 1991); Campbell v. Miller, 787 F.2d 217, 222 (7th Cir. 1986).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f          Moreover, to the extent Barber's allegations can be read\n\nto assert a substantive challenge to defendants' actions, his\n\nallegations fail to state a claim of constitutional dimension. See\n\nCoyne v. City of Somerville, 972 F.2d 440, 444 (1st Cir. 1992)(\"It\n\nis bedrock law in this circuit . . . that violations of state\n\nlaw–even where arbitrary, capricious, or undertaken in bad faith–do\n\nnot, without more, give rise to a denial of substantive due process\n\nunder the U.S. Constitution\").\n\n          Barber's   equal   protection   and   takings   claims   were\n\nlikewise properly dismissed by the district court. Barber fails to\n\nallege that the law was somehow applied differently to him based\n\nupon a \"suspect classification\" or that any application of law\n\naffected a fundamental right, see Plyer v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216-\n\n17 (1982), and it is clear that the debiting of funds from Barber's\n\naccount in satisfaction of a properly imposed restitution order\n\ndoes not amount to a taking or other wrongful interference with a\n\nproperty interest.   See Splude v. Apfel, 165 F.3d 85, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n          Finally, we reject Barber's contention on appeal that the\n\nevaluation of his claims by a magistrate judge, rather than a\n\ndistrict court judge, violated 28 U.S.C. § 636; the magistrate's\n\npreparation of the report and recommendation on defendants' motion\n\nto dismiss was entirely appropriate and in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of § 636(b)(1)(B).\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fAffirmed.
