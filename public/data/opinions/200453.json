Ernest C. Torres, Chief U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Farris, Senior Circuit Judge,*\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Randy Olen, with whom John M. Cicilline was on brief, for\nappellant.\n\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Zechariah\nChafee, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n                            May 6, 2003\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.          Immediately after a buy-and-bust\n\nsting,    government      agents      conducted     a    warrantless       search      of\n\ndefendant-appellant          Raul    Luciano's    \"stash      house\"    and    found    a\n\nsizable   quantity     of     heroin,     drug    paraphernalia,        and    two   9mm\n\nhandguns.    Later, a two-count indictment issued, charging Luciano\n\nwith possession with intent to distribute over 100 grams of heroin,\n\nsee 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and possession of a firearm\n\nin furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A).\n\n            Before the case went to trial, Luciano unsuccessfully\n\nmoved to suppress the evidence discovered during the search.                         The\n\ntrial itself lasted less than two days.                 After barely two hours of\n\ndeliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both\n\ncounts.     The    court      sentenced    Luciano       to   sixty-three      months'\n\nimprisonment      on   the    drug    possession     count     and     sixty   months'\n\nimprisonment on the gun possession count, the terms to be served\n\nconsecutively as required by the gun possession statute.                       See id.\n\n§ 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).\n\n            On appeal, Luciano presents two claims. First, he argues\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he had\n\npossessed a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime.\n\nSecond, he claims that government agents failed to obtain his\n\nvoluntary consent before conducting a warrantless search, and that\n\nthe district      court      therefore    erred    in    denying     his   motion      to\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fsuppress the drugs and firearms evidence.                 Rejecting both of\n\nLuciano's claims, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n               Most of the underlying facts in this case are not in\n\ndispute.1      On February 20, 2001, agents from the Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration (\"DEA\") convinced a female cooperating individual\n\n(\"CI\")    to    contact   Luciano   and    schedule   a   drug   purchase   in\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island.      The CI met Luciano on Wayland Avenue in\n\nProvidence, and they drove in separate cars to a three-story\n\ntenement building located at 31 Grape Street.                Unbeknownst to\n\nLuciano, DEA agents followed in unmarked vehicles.\n\n               While Luciano was in the apartment building, agents\n\nestablished positions around the premises.            A few minutes later,\n\nAgent Philip Bernal saw Luciano walk down the driveway towards the\n\nCI, who was waiting in her car parked on the street.             Luciano was\n\ncarrying a small parcel.      When Luciano opened the door to the CI's\n\ncar, Bernal approached with his gun drawn, identified himself as\n\nlaw enforcement, and told Luciano to put his hands in the air.\n\nLuciano complied, stepping back from the car and dropping the\n\nparcel.        Bernal placed Luciano in handcuffs as four or five\n\n\n\n     1\n       The first morning of trial, before the jury was empaneled,\ndefense counsel indicated in open court that his client would be\nwilling to plead guilty to and accept responsibility for the drug\npossession count, but for the government's refusal to drop the gun\npossession charge (which would, in effect, double Luciano's\nsentence).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fadditional agents came to the scene.   The parcel was later found to\n\ncontain a total of 6.5 grams of 92% pure heroin, divided into 800\n\nglassine packets, each packet containing an individual dose.    Some\n\nof the packets were stamped with a \"bad boy\" figure.2\n\n            Immediately after Bernal arrested Luciano, Special Agent\n\nJames McCormick asked Luciano where he had just been inside the\n\nbuilding.    Luciano replied, \"[t]hird floor.\"   Several agents were\n\nthen dispatched to the third floor of the building to conduct a\n\n\"protective sweep.\"    Agent Roberto DaSilva approached Luciano and\n\nadvised him of his Miranda rights — first in English, then in\n\nSpanish.     Luciano indicated to DaSilva that he understood his\n\nrights.     DaSilva then asked Luciano for permission to search the\n\nthird-floor apartment.    Luciano responded, \"[g]o ahead.\"\n\n            Agents led Luciano up to the sparsely-furnished third-\n\nfloor apartment where he was uncuffed and placed in a chair at the\n\nkitchen table.     DaSilva, who is bilingual, once again informed\n\nLuciano of his Miranda rights in English and in Spanish.     Luciano\n\nwas then given a consent-to-search form which provided in English:\n\n            1.     I have been asked to permit special\n                   agents   of    the   Drug   Enforcement\n                   Administration to search . . . 31 Grape\n                   Street, Apt #3 (3rd floor), Providence,\n                   RI;\n            2.     I have not been threatened nor forced\n                   in any way;\n\n\n     2\n      At trial, Agent Bernal described the \"bad boy\" figure as \"an\nindividual with a crew cut . . . giving the finger.\" The stamp is\nused to identify the heroin as a particular \"brand.\"\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           3.      I freely consent to this search.\n\nThe address had been written in by hand on the pre-printed form by\n\nSpecial Agent John O'Donoghue.      O'Donoghue asked Luciano if he\n\nunderstood English, and Luciano responded in the affirmative.\n\nO'Donoghue then read the consent form to Luciano and asked Luciano\n\nto read it.     Luciano, after reading the form, volunteered that he\n\nunderstood it.    O'Donoghue then asked Luciano again, \"are you sure\n\nyou understand?\"     Luciano again answered in the affirmative and\n\nsigned the form, which O'Donoghue and another agent signed as\n\nwitnesses.\n\n           During the subsequent search, agent Bernal noticed a\n\nsquare panel in the ceiling that appeared to give access to an\n\nattic or crawl-space.    Bernal mounted a chair and pushed the panel\n\naside.   Looking into the crawl-space, Bernal noticed a large black\n\nplastic bag near the edge, which he could reach without actually\n\nclimbing into the opening.    Bernal took the bag down and inspected\n\nthe contents.     Inside the black bag was another bag containing\n\n371.6 grams of heroin — potentially over 40,000 individual doses.\n\nIt also contained a digital scale with heroin residue on it, two\n\ncoffee grinders with heroin residue on them, a sifter and spoon\n\nwith residue, and ten boxes of glassine packets identical to those\n\nfound in the parcel that Luciano had dropped on the ground outside\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe building.3      Like those in the parcel, some of the packets were\n\nstamped with a \"bad boy\" figure. At trial, Bernal, O'Donoghue, and\n\nDaSilva all testified that when the bag was brought into the\n\nkitchen, Luciano stated, \"you got me\" (or words to that effect),\n\nand admitted that the bag belonged to him.\n\n            Agent O'Donoghue then returned to the opening in the\n\nceiling and climbed into the crawl-space. Using his flashlight, he\n\ndiscovered a smaller bag, at least eighteen inches from the edge of\n\nthe opening.       That bag contained two 9mm handguns and two loaded\n\n(but detached) magazines.       Subsequent tests demonstrated that the\n\nmagazines fit the guns and that the guns worked.\n\n            Luciano was then removed to DEA headquarters where he was\n\nquestioned    again    by   Agent     DaSilva.   The    interrogation    was\n\naudiotaped and ultimately entered into evidence at trial.             At the\n\nbeginning of the interrogation, DaSilva advised Luciano of his\n\nMiranda rights a third time in English and Spanish, and Luciano\n\nindicated that he understood those rights.             DaSilva and Special\n\nAgent    Anthony    Cardello   then    interviewed   Luciano   in   English.\n\nLuciano again admitted that the drugs and the drug paraphernalia in\n\nthe crawl-space belonged to him.         While initially equivocating, he\n\nultimately admitted that the guns were his as well:\n\n\n\n     3\n      At trial, Agent Bernal testified that these sundry items are\nused by heroin dealers to process heroin from the rock-hard\nsubstance imported from overseas into the powder form that is sold\non the street.\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          DaSilva:    That stuff that we found in your\n                      apartment, that was yours?\n          Luciano:    Yeah.\n\n          [. . . .]\n\n          DaSilva:    OK, so the stuff is yours, how\n                      about the guns?    Are . . . are\n                      they yours too?\n          Luciano:    I don't know.\n          Cardello:   What do you mean you don't know?\n          Luciano:    The stuff is mine.\n          DaSilva:    The stuff was yours, ah, how much,\n                      how much heroin was there?\n          Luciano:    I don't know.\n          DaSilva:    What would you guess?\n          Luciano:    Two to three hundred . . .\n          DaSilva:    Two to three hundred grams?\n          Luciano:    Yeah.\n          DaSilva:    How about the, ah, all the\n                      packaging materials and all that,\n                      was that all yours also?\n          Luciano:    Yeah.\n\n          [. . . .]\n\nAfter some overlapping voices and unintelligible conversation, the\n\nquestioning returned to the guns:\n\n          Cardello:   The guns and the heroin?\n          Luciano:    Everything is mine and that's it.\n\nLuciano then requested a lawyer, and the agents immediately stopped\n\ntheir questioning.\n\n                               II.\n\n          Luciano claims that the government presented insufficient\n\nevidence at trial to sustain a conviction for the second count —\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\fthe   gun   possession    charge.4    See    18    U.S.C.    §     924(c)(1)(A).5\n\nSpecifically, Luciano argues that the guns found in the crawl-space\n\n\"played no role whatsoever in the drug transaction; no 'nexus'\n\nexisted between the firearms and the drug selling operation.\"\n\nThus, he maintains, his possession of the firearms was not, as the\n\nstatute     requires,    \"in   furtherance   of\"    his     drug    trafficking.\n\nTherefore, the argument goes, his conviction under § 924 must be\n\nreversed.\n\n             Before considering the merits of Luciano's claim, we note\n\nthat Luciano did not make this argument to the district court.                In\n\nfact, he never made a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal —\n\nnot at the close of the government's case, not at the close of his\n\nown case, and not after the jury had returned its verdict.                We have\n\nconsistently held that claims of insufficient evidence must be\n\npresented in the first instance to the district court.                See United\n\nStates v. Van Horn, 277 F.3d 48, 54 (1st Cir. 2002).               Since Luciano\n\n\n      4\n       Luciano does not challenge on appeal his conviction for the\nfirst count of the indictment — the drug possession charge.\n      5\n          Section 924 provides in pertinent part:\n\n      [A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of\n      violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries\n      a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime,\n      possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment\n      provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking\n      crime . . . be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not\n      less than 5 years . . . .\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\ffailed to make his insufficiency argument below, he \"must . . .\n\ndemonstrate 'clear and gross' injustice, or 'manifest injustice'\n\nbefore the conviction is overturned on that ground.\" United States\n\nv.   Kilcullen,   546   F.2d   435,    441   (1st   Cir.   1976)   (quoting\n\nMalatkofski v. United States, 179 F.2d 905, 910 (1st Cir. 1950),\n\nand United States v. Principe, 482 F.2d 60, 61 n.1 (1st Cir.\n\n1973)); see United States v. Serafino, 281 F.3d 327, 333 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (indicating that appellant must demonstrate \"clear and gross\n\ninjustice\" to succeed on unpreserved insufficiency claim); Van\n\nHorn, 277 F.3d at 54 (same); United States v. Santiago, 83 F.3d 20,\n\n23 (1st Cir. 1996) (same); United States v. Concemi, 957 F.2d         942,\n\n950 (1st Cir. 1992) (same); United States v. Jiminez-Perez, 869\n\nF.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1989) (same); United States v. Greenleaf, 692\n\nF.2d 182, 185 (1st Cir. 1982) (same).6\n\n           The \"in furtherance of\" language that Luciano puts at\n\nissue on appeal is a relatively recent addition to § 924.          Congress\n\nadded the phrase following the Supreme Court's decision in Bailey\n\n\n\n     6\n       While our review for \"clear and gross injustice\" may sound\nakin to plain error review's \"miscarriage of justice\" standard, see\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 736 (1993), we have generally\navoided framing the review of unpreserved insufficiency claims in\nterms of \"plain error,\" as the cases cited in the text attest. But\nsee United States v. Pena-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(using \"clear and gross injustice\" standard for reversal when\nreviewing unpreserved insufficiency claim for \"plain error\").\nOther circuits characterize the review as one for plain error only.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 238 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir.\n2001); United States v. Villasenor, 236 F.3d 220, 222 (5th Cir.\n2000) (per curiam).\n\n                                      -9-\n\fv. United States, 516 U.S. 137 (1995).      The prior version of the\n\nstatute applied only where a defendant \"during and in relation to\n\nany . . . drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries a firearm.\"\n\n18 U.S.C.A. § 924(c)(1) (West 1995).          Bailey held that this\n\nlanguage required the government to produce \"evidence sufficient to\n\nshow an active employment of the firearm by the defendant, a use\n\nthat makes the firearm an operative factor in relation to the\n\npredicate offense.\"    516 U.S. at 143.    Congress then amended the\n\nstatute so that it would apply when a defendant merely \"possesses\"\n\na firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime.     See Act of\n\nNov. 13, 1998, Pub. L. 105-386, § 1(a), 112 Stat. 3469 (amending 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924);   United States v. Timmons, 283 F.3d 1246, 1252–53\n\n(11th Cir. 2002) (describing legislative history).\n\n          We do not have to explore exhaustively the semantic\n\ncontours of \"in furtherance of\" in order to resolve this appeal.\n\nHowever, we must address Luciano's contention that he was entitled\n\nto a judgment of acquittal on the gun possession charge because\n\nthere was no nexus linking the firearms in the crawl-space to the\n\nattempted drug sale that took place in front of 31 Grape Street.\n\n          In   his   brief,   Luciano   focuses   exclusively   on   his\n\nencounter with the CI outside the building.        He states:   \"It is\n\nundisputed that the illegal transaction took place outside of the\n\napartment which housed the firearms.\"       Since \"[n]o part of the\n\ntransaction took place within the apartment,\" he maintains, the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\ffirearms that were subsequently found there were not possessed \"in\n\nfurtherance of\" that transaction, as required by the statute.   See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A).\n\n          Luciano's argument suffers from a fatal misapprehension\n\nof the underlying \"drug trafficking crime.\"   The drug trafficking\n\ncrime underlying Luciano's § 924 conviction was Count I of the\n\nindictment — possession with intent to distribute more than 100\n\ngrams of heroin, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B).   See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924 (c)(2).7   As indicated above, Luciano does not challenge his\n\nconviction on Count I.    The parcel that Luciano brought from the\n\nhouse to the CI in the car, however, contained a mere 6.5 grams of\n\nheroin.   Thus, when the jury found Luciano guilty of possession\n\nwith intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin (Count I),\n\nthe jury inescapably found that Luciano possessed the drugs found\n\nin the crawl-space. Hence the predicate drug trafficking crime for\n\nLuciano's § 924 conviction pertained to the heroin found in the\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       Subparagraph (c)(2) provides:\n     For purposes of this subsection, the term \"drug\n     trafficking crime\" means any felony punishable under the\n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the\n     Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C.\n     951 et seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act\n     (46 U.S.C. App. 1901 et seq.).\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924 (c)(2).\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fparcel and the drugs found in the crawl-space — the same crawl-\n\nspace where the firearms and loaded magazines were discovered.8\n\n          The government offered uncontradicted testimony that the\n\nheroin in the crawl-space had a retail street value of over\n\n$200,000, and that firearms are often used by drug dealers to\n\nprotect drug stockpiles, to preempt encroachment into a dealer's\n\n\"territory\" by rival dealers, and for retaliation.   Presented with\n\nthis evidence, the jury found that Luciano had possessed a firearm\n\nin furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.        Given the close\n\nproximity of the firearms and loaded magazines to the significant\n\nstockpile of heroin, we have no difficulty concluding that there\n\nwas a sufficient nexus between the drug trafficking crime and the\n\nfirearms to sustain a conviction under § 924.   See United States v.\n\nCeballos-Torres, 218 F.3d 409, 415 (5th Cir. 2000) (\"Together,\n\nthese factors reasonably support a finding that [the firearms]\n\nprotected his drugs and money against robbery. Possession of the\n\n[firearms] was, therefore, in furtherance of drug trafficking.\").9\n\n\n     8\n       Indeed, Luciano admitted during his interrogation that the\ndrugs, the drug paraphernalia, and the firearms in the crawl-space\nwere his.\n     9\n       Although we have applied the \"clear and gross injustice\"\nstandard of review because of Luciano's failure to present his\ninsufficiency claim below, we would come to the same conclusion if\nhe had properly objected to the sufficiency of the evidence and we\nwere applying the de novo standard of review. See United States v.\nFrankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 650 (1st Cir. 1996) (in reviewing\nproperly preserved insufficiency claim, \"we examine the record in\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, drawing all reasonable\ninferences and credibility determinations in its favor, in an\n\n                               -12-\n\f                                   III.\n\n            The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nprohibits \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend.\n\nIV. A warrantless search of a residence violates this proscription\n\nunless    the   search   comes   within   one   of   a   \"few    specifically\n\nestablished     and   well-delineated     exceptions.\"      Schneckloth    v.\n\nBustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973) (quoting Katz v.

Before the\n\ndistrict court, Luciano moved to suppress the evidence discovered\n\nin the crawl-space as the fruit of an unlawful, nonconsensual\n\nsearch.    The district court conducted a suppression hearing and\n\nheard testimony from four agents and from Luciano himself.             At the\n\nend of the hearing, the court ruled from the bench that Luciano\n\nlacked credibility as a witness and that Luciano had consented to\n\nthe search verbally and in writing. Moreover, the court found that\n\nLuciano sufficiently understood English to render his consent\n\nmeaningful, and that his ability to consent was not impaired by\n\nalcohol intoxication.\n\n            \"A district court's findings of fact on a motion to\n\nsuppress are reviewable only for clear error as to consent.\"\n\nUnited States v.

At the hearing, DaSilva authenticated a copy of the\n\nstandard-issue card from which he read the warnings.              He also\n\ntestified that Luciano had orally consented to a search of the\n\napartment immediately after Da Silva had delivered his first set of\n\nMiranda warnings.    Other agents testified that they had witnessed\n\nthese exchanges between DaSilva and Luciano.             Luciano, however,\n\ntestified that none of the foregoing had taken place — no verbal\n\nMiranda   warnings   and   no   oral   consent.     The    district   court\n\nexplicitly   rejected   Luciano's      testimony   as   incredible,   while\n\ncrediting the testimony of the agents.\n\n           The   district court was more than justified in rejecting\n\nthe testimony of Luciano as \"preposterous.\"             The court observed\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fthat Luciano offered patently incredible testimony regarding the\n\nparcel he delivered to the car — that he had found it under some\n\ngrass in the backyard of the building.       Luciano made inconsistent\n\nrepresentations concerning the amount of time he had spent in the\n\nUnited States.    He also claimed not to understand English, despite\n\nhaving spent twelve of his thirty years — including third through\n\neighth grades — in the United States, despite the transcript from\n\nhis interrogation in which he indicated that he understood English,\n\nand despite correcting the court interpreter as he translated\n\nduring the suppression hearing.     Finally, Luciano's testimony was\n\npeppered with implausibilities and suspicious lapses in memory.\n\n           More damning is the written, signed consent form executed\n\nby Luciano himself and witnessed by two agents.          Luciano claims\n\nthat he had failed to understand the substance of what he was\n\nsigning. Agent O'Donoghue testified, however, that he had read the\n\nform out loud to Luciano, that Luciano had read it himself, and\n\nthat Luciano affirmatively indicated his understanding of it.\n\nMoreover, the form was in simple English.             As the preceding\n\nparagraph indicates, the district court was justified in concluding\n\nthat   Luciano   possessed   sufficient   English   language   skills   to\n\nunderstand that he was consenting to a search.\n\n           Luciano argues that, even if he understood that he was\n\nconsenting, his consent was involuntary and therefore invalid. See\n\nBumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548 (1968) (\"When a\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fprosecutor seeks to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of\n\na search, he has the burden of proving that the consent was, in\n\nfact,   freely    and    voluntarily     given.\").      He    relies   on   three\n\nconsiderations.         First, Luciano argues that his judgment was\n\nimpaired by his intoxication.            See United States v. Johnson, 563\n\nF.2d 936, 939 (8th Cir. 1977) (\"If the trial court had found that\n\nby reason of extreme intoxication the defendant's consent was not\n\nthe product of a rational intellect and a free will, then the\n\nconsent   would    not    have   been    valid.\").      The    district     court\n\nexplicitly found, however, that Luciano was not so intoxicated as\n\nto render his consent ineffective.              The court noted that Luciano\n\nwas sober enough to drive from Wayland Avenue to Grape Street to\n\neffectuate his drug sale.        Moreover, several agents testified that\n\nLuciano did not appear drunk or behave as if he were so intoxicated\n\nthat he could not understand the rights he was explicitly waiving.\n\n            Second, Luciano argues that the consent was coerced\n\nbecause agents had threatened his girlfriend.                Luciano relies on\n\nUnited States v. Bolin, 514 F.2d 554 (7th Cir. 1975), in support of\n\nthis argument.     See id. at 560–61. (\"In view of the fact that the\n\ndefendant   signed      the   consent    form   while   undergoing     custodial\n\ninterrogation and only after he had been impliedly threatened that\n\nhis girl friend would be arrested if he did not sign, we hold that\n\nthe consent was involuntary and therefore invalid.\"); see also\n\nBumper, 391 U.S. at 550 (\"Where there is coercion there cannot be\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fconsent.\").   At the suppression hearing, Luciano testified that he\n\nhad signed the consent form because agents told him that \"they were\n\ngoing to find my girlfriend and do something to her, and I was very\n\nscared.\"   In its statement of reasons for denying the motion to\n\nsuppress, the district court did not make an explicit finding\n\nregarding Luciano's claim of coercion or duress.                However, given\n\nthe   district   court's      rejection      of   Luciano's      testimony      as\n\n\"preposterous,\" the district court impliedly rejected any claim of\n\ncoercion on the part of the government agents.            The district court\n\ndid not err in that finding.\n\n           Finally,    Luciano    argues      that   he   was    coerced      into\n\nconsenting because immediately after Agent Bernal handcuffed him —\n\nand before the government claims Luciano gave his consent — agents\n\nwere dispatched to the third-floor apartment to conduct a search.\n\nSince the search was already well underway when he was asked for\n\nhis consent, he claims he could not have reasonably known that he\n\ncould still refuse the search. See United States v. Tovar-Rico, 61\n\nF.3d 1529, 1536 (11th Cir. 1995) (\"[Defendant] had already observed\n\nofficers   explore    every   room   in     the   apartment     and   could   not\n\nreasonably have known that she could still refuse a search.\").\n\n           Luciano never made this argument to the district court in\n\nsupport of his motion to suppress. Therefore, we will not consider\n\nit for the first time on appeal.          United States v. Santos Batista,\n\n239 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"Failure to raise suppression\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\farguments before trial shall constitute waiver thereof.\"); United\n\nStates v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[W]hen a party\n\nfails to raise a theory at the district court level, that theory is\n\ngenerally    regarded   as   forfeited   and   cannot   be   advanced   on\n\nappeal.\").    This case underscores the importance of this rule.        As\n\nthe government persuasively argues, if Luciano had made this claim\n\nbelow, the government would have introduced evidence and arguments\n\nregarding the timing and nature of the search, whether exigent\n\ncircumstances mandated a protective sweep, and (assuming that the\n\nsearch was improper) whether the discovered evidence was admissible\n\nunder some other theory.10\n\n             \"The voluntariness of a consent to search turns on an\n\nassessment of the totality of the circumstances.\"            Barnett, 989\n\nF.3d at 554–55.      Having carefully considered all of Luciano's\n\narguments regarding the facts and circumstances relating to the\n\nsearch, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding\n\nthat Luciano had validly consented to the search of the third-floor\n\napartment.     The district court properly denied the motion to\n\nsuppress.\n\n\n\n\n     10\n       Since the record is undeveloped concerning the timing of the\nagents' entry, the nature of their initial presence in the\napartment, and the scope of any protective sweep, Luciano cannot\neven avail himself of plain error review. See Torres, 162 F.3d at\n11 n.2 (\"[Plain error review] has no applicability where, as here,\nthe defendant has failed to develop the necessary factual record\nundergirding a particular suppression claim.\").\n\n                                  -18-\n\fAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n            -19-\n\f",

Later, a two-count indictment issued, charging Luciano with possession with intent to distribute over 100 grams of heroin, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the case went to trial, Luciano unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence discovered during the search. The trial itself lasted less than two days. After barely two hours of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts. The court sentenced Luciano to sixty-three months' imprisonment on the drug possession count and sixty months' imprisonment on the gun possession count, the terms to be served consecutively as required by the gun possession statute. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Luciano presents two claims. First, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that he had possessed a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime. Second, he claims that government agents failed to obtain his voluntary consent before conducting a warrantless search, and that the district court therefore erred in denying his motion to suppress the drugs and firearms evidence. Rejecting both of Luciano's claims, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the underlying facts in this case are not in dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On February 20, 2001, agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") convinced a female cooperating individual (\"CI\") to contact Luciano and schedule a drug purchase in Providence, Rhode Island. The CI met Luciano on Wayland Avenue in Providence, and they drove in separate cars to a three-story tenement building located at 31 Grape Street. Unbeknownst to Luciano, DEA agents followed in unmarked vehicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Luciano was in the apartment building, agents established positions around the premises. A few minutes later, Agent Philip Bernal saw Luciano walk down the driveway towards the CI, who was waiting in her car parked on the street. Luciano was carrying a small parcel. When Luciano opened the door to the CI's car, Bernal approached with his gun drawn, identified himself as law enforcement, and told Luciano to put his hands in the air. Luciano complied, stepping back from the car and dropping the parcel. Bernal placed Luciano in handcuffs as four or five additional agents came to the scene. The parcel was later found to contain a total of 6.5 grams of 92% pure heroin, divided into 800 glassine packets, each packet containing an individual dose. Some of the packets were stamped with a \"bad boy\" figure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after Bernal arrested Luciano, Special Agent James McCormick asked Luciano where he had just been inside the building. Luciano replied, \"[t]hird floor.\" Several agents were then dispatched to the third floor of the building to conduct a \"protective sweep.\" Agent Roberto DaSilva approached Luciano and advised him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights &#8212; first in English, then in Spanish. Luciano indicated to DaSilva that he understood his rights. DaSilva then asked Luciano for permission to search the third-floor apartment. Luciano responded, \"[g]o ahead.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agents led Luciano up to the sparsely-furnished third-floor apartment where he was uncuffed and placed in a chair at the kitchen table. DaSilva, who is bilingual, once again informed Luciano of his <i>Miranda</i> rights in English and in Spanish. Luciano was then given a consent-to-search form which provided in English:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. I have been asked to permit special agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration to search ... 31 Grape Street, Apt # 3 (3rd floor), Providence, RI;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

O'Donoghue asked Luciano if he understood English, and Luciano responded in the affirmative. O'Donoghue then read the consent form to Luciano and asked Luciano to read it. Luciano, after reading the form, volunteered that he understood it. O'Donoghue then asked Luciano again, \"are you sure you understand?\" Luciano again answered in the affirmative and signed the form, which O'Donoghue and another agent signed as witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the subsequent search, agent Bernal noticed a square panel in the ceiling that appeared to give access to an attic or crawl-space. Bernal mounted a chair and pushed the panel aside. Looking into the crawl-space, Bernal noticed a large black plastic bag near the edge, which he could reach without actually climbing into the opening. Bernal took the bag down and inspected the contents. Inside the black bag was another bag containing 371.6 grams of heroin &#8212; potentially over 40,000 individual doses. It also contained a digital scale with heroin residue on it, two coffee grinders with heroin residue on them, a sifter and spoon with residue, and ten boxes of glassine packets identical to those found in the parcel that Luciano had dropped on the ground outside the building.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Like those in the parcel, some of the packets were stamped with a \"bad boy\" figure. At trial, Bernal, O'Donoghue, and DaSilva all testified that when the bag was brought into the kitchen, Luciano stated, \"you got me\" (or words to that effect), and admitted that the bag belonged to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent O'Donoghue then returned to the opening in the ceiling and climbed into the crawl space. Using his flashlight, he discovered a smaller bag, at least eighteen inches from the edge of the opening. That bag contained two 9mm handguns and two loaded (but detached) magazines. Subsequent tests demonstrated that the magazines fit the guns and that the guns worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano was then removed to DEA headquarters where he was questioned again by Agent DaSilva. The interrogation was audiotaped and ultimately entered into evidence at trial. At the beginning of the interrogation, DaSilva advised Luciano of his <i>Miranda</i> rights a third time in English and Spanish, and Luciano indicated that he understood those rights. DaSilva and Special Agent Anthony Cardello then interviewed Luciano in English. Luciano again admitted that the drugs and the drug paraphernalia in the crawl space belonged to him. While initially equivocating, he ultimately admitted that the guns were his as well:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DaSilva: That stuff that we found in your apartment, that was yours?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano: Yeah.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[....]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DaSilva: OK, so the stuff is yours, how about the guns?

In fact, he never made a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal &#8212; not at the close of the government's case, not at the close of his own case, and not after the jury had returned its verdict. We have consistently held that claims of insufficient evidence must be presented in the first instance to the district court. <i>See United States v. Van Horn,</i> 277 F.3d 48, 54 (1st Cir.2002). Since Luciano failed to make his insufficiency argument below, he \"must... demonstrate `clear and gross' injustice, or `manifest injustice' before the conviction is overturned on that ground.\" <i>United States v. Kilcullen,</i> 546 F.2d 435, 441 (1st Cir.1976) (quoting <i>Malatkofski v. United States,</i> 179 F.2d 905, 910 (1st Cir.1950), and <i>United States v.

Congress added the phrase following the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Bailey v. United States,</i> 516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). The prior version of the statute applied only where a defendant \"during and in relation to any ... drug trafficking crime... uses or carries a firearm.\" 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 924(c)(1) (West 1995). <i>Bailey</i> held that this language required the government to produce \"evidence sufficient to show an active employment of the firearm by the defendant, a use that makes the firearm an operative factor in relation to the predicate offense.\" 516 U.S. at 143, 116 S.Ct. 501. Congress then amended the statute so that it would apply when a defendant merely \"possesses\" a firearm \"in furtherance of\" a drug trafficking crime. <i>See</i> Act of Nov. 13, 1998, Pub.L. 105-386, &#167; 1(a), 112 Stat. 3469 (amending 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924); <i>United States v. Timmons,</i> 283 F.3d 1246, 1252-53 (11th Cir.2002) (describing legislative history).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not have to explore exhaustively the semantic contours of \"in furtherance of\" in order to resolve this appeal. However, we must address Luciano's contention that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the gun possession charge because there was no nexus linking the firearms in the crawl-space to the attempted drug sale that took place in front of 31 Grape Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, Luciano focuses exclusively on his encounter with the CI outside the building. He states: \"It is undisputed that the illegal transaction took place outside of the apartment which housed the firearms.\" Since \"[n]o part of the transaction took place within the apartment,\" he maintains, the firearms that were subsequently found there were not possessed \"in furtherance of\" that transaction, as required by the statute. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano's argument suffers from a fatal misapprehension of the underlying \"drug trafficking crime.\" The drug trafficking crime underlying Luciano's &#167; 924 conviction was Count I of the indictment-possession with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B). <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As indicated above, Luciano does not challenge his conviction on Count I. The parcel that Luciano brought from the house to the CI in the car, however, contained a mere 6.5 grams of heroin. Thus, when the jury found Luciano guilty of possession with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin (Count I), the jury inescapably found that Luciano possessed the drugs found in the crawl-space. Hence the predicate drug trafficking crime for Luciano's &#167; 924 conviction pertained to the heroin found in the parcel <i>and</i> the drugs found in the crawl-space &#8212; the same crawl-space where the firearms and loaded magazines were discovered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government offered uncontradicted testimony that the heroin in the crawl-space had a retail street value of over $200,000, and that firearms are often used by drug dealers to protect drug stockpiles, to preempt encroachment into a dealer's \"territory\" by rival dealers, and for retaliation. Presented with this evidence, the jury found that Luciano had possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Given the close proximity of the firearms and loaded magazines to the significant stockpile of heroin, we have no difficulty concluding that there was a sufficient nexus between the drug trafficking crime and the firearms to sustain a conviction under &#167; 924. <i>See United States v. Ceballos-Torres,</i> 218 F.3d 409, 415 (5th Cir.2000) (\"Together, these factors reasonably support a finding that [the firearms] protected his drugs and money against robbery. Possession of the [firearms] was, therefore, in furtherance of drug trafficking.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. A warrantless search of a residence violates this proscription unless the search comes within one of a \"few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\" <i>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,</i> 412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973) (quoting <i>Katz v. United States,</i> 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)). One such exception is a search undertaken with the consent of the homeowner. <i>Id.</i> Before the district court, Luciano moved to suppress the evidence discovered in the crawl-space as the fruit of an unlawful, nonconsensual search. The district court conducted a suppression hearing and heard testimony from four agents and from Luciano himself. At the end of the hearing, the court ruled from the bench that Luciano lacked credibility as a witness and that Luciano had consented to the search verbally and in writing. Moreover, the court found that Luciano sufficiently understood English to render his consent meaningful, and that his ability to consent was not impaired by alcohol intoxication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A district court's findings of fact on a motion to suppress are reviewable only for clear error as to consent.\" <i>United States v.

Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d 546, 556 (1st Cir.1993) (citations omitted). \"The question of whether a consent to a search was in fact `voluntary' or was the product of duress or coercion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of the circumstances.\" <i>Schneckloth,</i> 412 U.S. at 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the suppression hearing, Agent DaSilva testified that he had \"Mirandized\" Luciano twice &#8212; once outside 31 Grape Street, and once again in the third-floor apartment &#8212; both times in English and Spanish. At the hearing, DaSilva authenticated a copy of the standard-issue card from which he read the warnings. He also testified that Luciano had orally consented to a search of the apartment immediately after Da Silva had delivered his first set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Other agents testified that they had witnessed these exchanges between DaSilva and Luciano. Luciano, however, testified that none of the foregoing had taken place &#8212; no verbal <i>Miranda</i> warnings and no oral consent. The district court explicitly rejected Luciano's testimony as incredible, while crediting the testimony of the agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was more than justified in rejecting the testimony of Luciano as \"preposterous.\" The court observed that Luciano offered patently incredible testimony regarding the parcel he delivered to the car &#8212; that he had found it under some grass in the backyard of the building. Luciano made inconsistent representations concerning the amount of time he had spent in the United States. He also claimed not to understand English, despite having spent twelve of his thirty years &#8212; including third through eighth grades &#8212; in the United States, despite the transcript from his interrogation in which he indicated that he understood English, and despite correcting the court interpreter as he translated during the suppression hearing. Finally, Luciano's testimony was peppered with implausibilities and suspicious lapses in memory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More damning is the written, signed consent form executed by Luciano himself and witnessed by two agents. Luciano claims that he had failed to understand the substance of what he was signing. Agent O'Donoghue testified, however, that he had read the form out loud to Luciano, that Luciano had read it himself, and that Luciano affirmatively indicated his understanding of it. Moreover, the form was in simple English. As the preceding paragraph indicates, the district court was justified in concluding that Luciano possessed sufficient English language skills to understand that he was consenting to a search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano argues that, even if he understood that he was consenting, his consent was involuntary and therefore invalid. <i>See Bumper v. North Carolina,</i> 391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968) (\"When a prosecutor seeks to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of a search, he has the burden of proving that the consent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given.\"). He relies on three considerations. First, Luciano argues that his judgment was impaired by his intoxication. <i>See United States v. Johnson,</i> 563 F.2d 936, 939 (8th Cir.1977) (\"If the trial court had found that by reason of extreme intoxication the defendant's consent was not the product of a rational intellect and a free will, then the consent would not have been valid.\"). The district court explicitly found, however, that Luciano was not so intoxicated as to render his consent ineffective. The court noted that Luciano was sober enough to drive from Wayland Avenue to Grape Street to effectuate his drug sale. Moreover, several agents testified that Luciano did not appear drunk or behave as if he were so intoxicated that he could not understand the rights he was explicitly waiving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Luciano argues that the consent was coerced because agents had threatened his girlfriend. Luciano relies on <i>United States v. Bolin,</i> 514 F.2d 554 (7th Cir.1975), in support of this argument. <i>See id.</i> at 560-61. (\"In view of the fact that the defendant signed the consent form while undergoing custodial interrogation and only after he had been impliedly threatened that his girl friend would be arrested if he did not sign, we hold that the consent was involuntary and therefore invalid.\"); <i>see also Bumper,</i> 391 U.S. at 550, 88 S.Ct. 1788 (\"Where there is coercion there cannot be consent.\"). At the suppression hearing, Luciano testified that he had signed the consent form because agents told him that \"they were going to find my girlfriend and do something to her, and I was very scared.\" In its statement of reasons for denying the motion to suppress, the district court did not make an explicit finding regarding Luciano's claim of coercion or duress. However, given the district court's rejection of Luciano's testimony as \"preposterous,\" the district court impliedly rejected any claim of coercion on the part of the government agents. The district court did not err in that finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Luciano argues that he was coerced into consenting because immediately after Agent Bernal handcuffed him &#8212; and before the government claims Luciano gave his consent &#8212; agents were dispatched to the third-floor apartment to conduct a search. Since the search was already well underway when he was asked for his consent, he claims he could not have reasonably known that he could still refuse the search. <i>See United States v. Tovar-Rico,</i> 61 F.3d 1529, 1536 (11th Cir.1995) (\"[Defendant] had already observed officers explore every room in the apartment and could not reasonably have known that she could still refuse a search.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano never made this argument to the district court in support of his motion to suppress. Therefore, we will not consider it for the first time on appeal. <i>United States v. Santos Batista,</i> 239 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Failure to raise suppression arguments before trial shall constitute waiver thereof.\"); <i>United States v. Torres,</i> 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[W]hen a party fails to raise a theory at the district court level, that theory is generally regarded as forfeited and cannot be advanced on appeal.\"). This case underscores the importance of this rule. As the government persuasively argues, if Luciano had made this claim below, the government would have introduced evidence and arguments regarding the timing and nature of the search, whether exigent circumstances mandated a protective sweep, and (assuming that the search was improper) whether the discovered evidence was admissible under some other theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The voluntariness of a consent to search turns on an assessment of the totality of the circumstances.\" <i>Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d at 554-55. Having carefully considered all of Luciano's arguments regarding the facts and circumstances relating to the search, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Luciano had validly consented to the search of the third-floor apartment. The district court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>AFFIRMED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The first morning of trial, before the jury was empaneled, defense counsel indicated in open court that his client would be willing to plead guilty to and accept responsibility for the drug possession count, but for the government's refusal to drop the gun possession charge (which would, in effect, double Luciano's sentence)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> At trial, Agent Bernal described the \"bad boy\" figure as \"an individual with a crew cut... giving the finger.\" The stamp is used to identify the heroin as a particular \"brand.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> At trial, Agent Bernal testified that these sundry items are used by heroin dealers to process heroin from the rock-hard substance imported from overseas into the powder form that is sold on the street</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Luciano does not challenge on appeal his conviction for the first count of the indictment &#8212; the drug possession charge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Section 924 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, <i>in furtherance of</i> any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> While our review for \"clear and gross injustice\" may sound akin to plain error review's \"miscarriage of justice\" standard,<i>see United States v.

Later, a two-count indictment issued, charging Luciano with possession with intent to distribute over 100 grams of heroin, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the case went to trial, Luciano unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence discovered during the search.

The CI met Luciano on Wayland Avenue in Providence, and they drove in separate cars to a three-story tenement building located at 31 Grape Street.

A few minutes later, Agent Philip Bernal saw Luciano walk down the driveway towards the CI, who was waiting in her car parked on the street. Luciano was carrying a small parcel. When Luciano opened the door to the CI's car, Bernal approached with his gun drawn, identified himself as law enforcement, and told Luciano to put his hands in the air. Luciano complied, stepping back from the car and dropping the parcel. Bernal placed Luciano in handcuffs as four or five additional agents came to the scene. The parcel was later found to contain a total of 6.5 grams of 92% pure heroin, divided into 800 glassine packets, each packet containing an individual dose.

Luciano replied, \"[t]hird floor.\" Several agents were then dispatched to the third floor of the building to conduct a \"protective sweep.\" Agent Roberto DaSilva approached Luciano and advised him of his <i>Miranda</i> rights &#8212; first in English, then in Spanish.

DaSilva, who is bilingual, once again informed Luciano of his <i>Miranda</i> rights in English and in Spanish. Luciano was then given a consent-to-search form which provided in English:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

O'Donoghue asked Luciano if he understood English, and Luciano responded in the affirmative. O'Donoghue then read the consent form to Luciano and asked Luciano to read it. Luciano, after reading the form, volunteered that he understood it. O'Donoghue then asked Luciano again, \"are you sure you understand?\" Luciano again answered in the affirmative and signed the form, which O'Donoghue and another agent signed as witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the subsequent search, agent Bernal noticed a square panel in the ceiling that appeared to give access to an attic or crawl-space. Bernal mounted a chair and pushed the panel aside. Looking into the crawl-space, Bernal noticed a large black plastic bag near the edge, which he could reach without actually climbing into the opening. Bernal took the bag down and inspected the contents. Inside the black bag was another bag containing 371.6 grams of heroin &#8212; potentially over 40,000 individual doses. It also contained a digital scale with heroin residue on it, two coffee grinders with heroin residue on them, a sifter and spoon with residue, and ten boxes of glassine packets identical to those found in the parcel that Luciano had dropped on the ground outside the building.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Like those in the parcel, some of the packets were stamped with a \"bad boy\" figure. At trial, Bernal, O'Donoghue, and DaSilva all testified that when the bag was brought into the kitchen, Luciano stated, \"you got me\" (or words to that effect), and admitted that the bag belonged to him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agent O'Donoghue then returned to the opening in the ceiling and climbed into the crawl space. Using his flashlight, he discovered a smaller bag, at least eighteen inches from the edge of the opening. That bag contained two 9mm handguns and two loaded (but detached) magazines.

At the beginning of the interrogation, DaSilva advised Luciano of his <i>Miranda</i> rights a third time in English and Spanish, and Luciano indicated that he understood those rights. DaSilva and Special Agent Anthony Cardello then interviewed Luciano in English. Luciano again admitted that the drugs and the drug paraphernalia in the crawl space belonged to him.

However, we must address Luciano's contention that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the gun possession charge because there was no nexus linking the firearms in the crawl-space to the attempted drug sale that took place in front of 31 Grape Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his brief, Luciano focuses exclusively on his encounter with the CI outside the building. He states: \"It is undisputed that the illegal transaction took place outside of the apartment which housed the firearms.\" Since \"[n]o part of the transaction took place within the apartment,\" he maintains, the firearms that were subsequently found there were not possessed \"in furtherance of\" that transaction, as required by the statute. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano's argument suffers from a fatal misapprehension of the underlying \"drug trafficking crime.\" The drug trafficking crime underlying Luciano's &#167; 924 conviction was Count I of the indictment-possession with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B). <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> As indicated above, Luciano does not challenge his conviction on Count I. The parcel that Luciano brought from the house to the CI in the car, however, contained a mere 6.5 grams of heroin. Thus, when the jury found Luciano guilty of possession with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin (Count I), the jury inescapably found that Luciano possessed the drugs found in the crawl-space. Hence the predicate drug trafficking crime for Luciano's &#167; 924 conviction pertained to the heroin found in the parcel <i>and</i> the drugs found in the crawl-space &#8212; the same crawl-space where the firearms and loaded magazines were discovered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government offered uncontradicted testimony that the heroin in the crawl-space had a retail street value of over $200,000, and that firearms are often used by drug dealers to protect drug stockpiles, to preempt encroachment into a dealer's \"territory\" by rival dealers, and for retaliation. Presented with this evidence, the jury found that Luciano had possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Given the close proximity of the firearms and loaded magazines to the significant stockpile of heroin, we have no difficulty concluding that there was a sufficient nexus between the drug trafficking crime and the firearms to sustain a conviction under &#167; 924. <i>See United States v.

At the hearing, DaSilva authenticated a copy of the standard-issue card from which he read the warnings. He also testified that Luciano had orally consented to a search of the apartment immediately after Da Silva had delivered his first set of <i>Miranda</i> warnings. Other agents testified that they had witnessed these exchanges between DaSilva and Luciano. Luciano, however, testified that none of the foregoing had taken place &#8212; no verbal <i>Miranda</i> warnings and no oral consent.

Luciano made inconsistent representations concerning the amount of time he had spent in the United States. He also claimed not to understand English, despite having spent twelve of his thirty years &#8212; including third through eighth grades &#8212; in the United States, despite the transcript from his interrogation in which he indicated that he understood English, and despite correcting the court interpreter as he translated during the suppression hearing.

Agent O'Donoghue testified, however, that he had read the form out loud to Luciano, that Luciano had read it himself, and that Luciano affirmatively indicated his understanding of it. Moreover, the form was in simple English. As the preceding paragraph indicates, the district court was justified in concluding that Luciano possessed sufficient English language skills to understand that he was consenting to a search.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano argues that, even if he understood that he was consenting, his consent was involuntary and therefore invalid. <i>See Bumper v. North Carolina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107716\"><a href=\"/opinion/107716/bumper-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span>, 548, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107716\"><a href=\"/opinion/107716/bumper-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1788</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107716\"><a href=\"/opinion/107716/bumper-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span> (1968) (\"When a prosecutor seeks to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of a search, he has the burden of proving that the consent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given.\"). He relies on three considerations. First, Luciano argues that his judgment was impaired by his intoxication. <i>See United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349599\"><a href=\"/opinion/349599/united-states-v-gary-don-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></a></span>, 939 (8th Cir.1977) (\"If the trial court had found that by reason of extreme intoxication the defendant's consent was not the product of a rational intellect and a free will, then the consent would not have been valid.\"). The district court explicitly found, however, that Luciano was not so intoxicated as to render his consent ineffective. The court noted that Luciano was sober enough to drive from Wayland Avenue to Grape Street to effectuate his drug sale. Moreover, several agents testified that Luciano did not appear drunk or behave as if he were so intoxicated that he could not understand the rights he was explicitly waiving.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Luciano argues that the consent was coerced because agents had threatened his girlfriend. Luciano relies on <i>United States v. Bolin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"326933\"><a href=\"/opinion/326933/united-states-v-robert-c-bolin-aka-bob-bolin/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1975), in support of this argument. <i>See id.</i> at 560-61. (\"In view of the fact that the defendant signed the consent form while undergoing custodial interrogation and only after he had been impliedly threatened that his girl friend would be arrested if he did not sign, we hold that the consent was involuntary and therefore invalid.\"); <i>see also Bumper,</i> 391 U.S. at 550, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107716\"><a href=\"/opinion/107716/bumper-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1788</span></a></span> (\"Where there is coercion there cannot be consent.\"). At the suppression hearing, Luciano testified that he had signed the consent form because agents told him that \"they were going to find my girlfriend and do something to her, and I was very scared.\" In its statement of reasons for denying the motion to suppress, the district court did not make an explicit finding regarding Luciano's claim of coercion or duress. However, given the district court's rejection of Luciano's testimony as \"preposterous,\" the district court impliedly rejected any claim of coercion on the part of the government agents. The district court did not err in that finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Luciano argues that he was coerced into consenting because immediately after Agent Bernal handcuffed him &#8212; and before the government claims Luciano gave his consent &#8212; agents were dispatched to the third-floor apartment to conduct a search. Since the search was already well underway when he was asked for his consent, he claims he could not have reasonably known that he could still refuse the search. <i>See United States v. Tovar-Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701300\"><a href=\"/opinion/701300/united-states-v-clara-inez-tovar-rico-united-states-of-america-v-clara/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1529</span></a></span>, 1536 (11th Cir.1995) (\"[Defendant] had already observed officers explore every room in the apartment and could not reasonably have known that she could still refuse a search.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano never made this argument to the district court in support of his motion to suppress. Therefore, we will not consider it for the first time on appeal. <i>United States v. Santos Batista,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199226\"><a href=\"/opinion/199226/united-states-v-santos-batista/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Failure to raise suppression arguments before trial shall constitute waiver thereof.\"); <i>United States v. Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198221\"><a href=\"/opinion/198221/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1998) (\"[W]hen a party fails to raise a theory at the district court level, that theory is generally regarded as forfeited and cannot be advanced on appeal.\"). This case underscores the importance of this rule. As the government persuasively argues, if Luciano had made this claim below, the government would have introduced evidence and arguments regarding the timing and nature of the search, whether exigent circumstances mandated a protective sweep, and (assuming that the search was improper) whether the discovered evidence was admissible under some other theory.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The voluntariness of a consent to search turns on an assessment of the totality of the circumstances.\" <i>Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d at 554-55. Having carefully considered all of Luciano's arguments regarding the facts and circumstances relating to the search, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Luciano had validly consented to the search of the third-floor apartment. The district court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>AFFIRMED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The first morning of trial, before the jury was empaneled, defense counsel indicated in open court that his client would be willing to plead guilty to and accept responsibility for the drug possession count, but for the government's refusal to drop the gun possession charge (which would, in effect, double Luciano's sentence)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> At trial, Agent Bernal described the \"bad boy\" figure as \"an individual with a crew cut... giving the finger.\" The stamp is used to identify the heroin as a particular \"brand.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> At trial, Agent Bernal testified that these sundry items are used by heroin dealers to process heroin from the rock-hard substance imported from overseas into the powder form that is sold on the street</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Luciano does not challenge on appeal his conviction for the first count of the indictment &#8212; the drug possession charge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Section 924 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, <i>in furtherance of</i> any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> While our review for \"clear and gross injustice\" may sound akin to plain error review's \"miscarriage of justice\" standard,<i>see United States v.
