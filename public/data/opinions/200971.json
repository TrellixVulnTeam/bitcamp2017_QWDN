Jean Prosper Elien, a Haitian\n\nnational     and   citizen,      petitions        for   review   of    the   Board   of\n\nImmigration Appeal’s (BIA) denial of his motion to reopen his\n\ndeportation proceeding on account of changed conditions in Haiti.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                            I\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n             Elien entered the United States in 1981, as a non-\n\nimmigrant     visitor,     and    remained        beyond   his   authorized      stay.\n\nThirteen years later, in 1994, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (INS) finally commenced deportation proceedings against\n\nhim.       Elien   proceeded     to    concede      deportability,       then    sought\n\nsuspension of deportation or voluntary departure.                     In August 1996,\n\nan immigration judge (IJ) denied both requests, and ordered Elien\n\ndeported.1     Elien appealed to the BIA.\n\n             In    2000,   while      the    BIA    appeal   was      pending,    Haiti\n\nimplemented a new policy, whereby it detained all repatriated\n\nHaitians who had incurred a criminal record while residing in the\n\nUnited States, based on the presumption that their exposure to\n\n\n\n       1\n      The IJ determined that Elien was not entitled to suspension\nof deportation because:      (1) a 1994 conviction for theft\nconstituted a crime of moral turpitude which precluded the\nrequisite finding of “good moral character,” and (2) Elien's\nnumerous arrests, use of aliases, as well as his use of cocaine,\nprecluded a discretionary suspension. Finally, the IJ found that\nElien’s failure to demonstrate good moral character precluded a\ngrant of voluntary departure as well.\n\n                                            -2-\n\fAmerican violence and crime predisposed them to recidivist criminal\n\nbehavior upon their return to Haiti.              The United States State\n\nDepartment and press reports suggest that Haitian authorities\n\nsubject detainees to indefinite terms of imprisonment, inhumane\n\nprison conditions, and in some cases, torture.\n\n          In July 2001,2 the BIA denied Elien’s appeal from the\n\ndeportation order issued by the IJ in 1996.                Elien submitted a\n\nmotion to reopen the deportation proceeding in order to adjudicate\n\nan   application   for   asylum,     withholding     of    deportation,    and\n\nprotection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT), claiming that Haiti would detain him indefinitely based upon\n\nhis convictions for two “minor” criminal offenses committed while\n\nin the United States.    In due course, the BIA denied the motion to\n\nreopen, and Elien now petitions for review.\n\n                                     II\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Asylum Application\n\n          Elien    contends   that    the   BIA   has     neither   adequately\n\nexplained its rationale for determining that he is not entitled to\n\nasylum under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), nor\n\n\n\n     2\n      In 1999, the BIA closed the Elien case, so as to enable him\nto apply for relief under the newly enacted Haitian Refugee\nImmigration Fairness Act (HRIFA), Pub. L. No. 104-277, 112 Stat.\n2681 (1998). The INS denied his HRIFA application, and in May 2001,\nthe BIA reinstated Elien's deportation appeal. The HRIFA interlude\nplays no part in this appeal.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fcited to substantial record evidence supporting its decision.\n\nUnder the INA the term “refugee” is defined as a person unable or\n\nunwilling to return to the country of nationality “because of\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion.”            8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).        Before\n\nthe BIA, Elien contended that (i) he is a member of a “particular\n\nsocial     group,”   consisting     of   deported       Haitian   nationals     with\n\ncriminal records in the United States; and (2) undisputed evidence\n\n–   such    as   State   Department      reports    –    establishes    that    his\n\nmembership in that \"particular social group\" will render him\n\nsubject to “persecution,” viz., indefinite detainment, inhumane\n\nprison conditions, and torture.\n\n             Since   motions   to   reopen     deportation        proceedings   are\n\nstrongly disfavored, see Mabikas v. INS, 358 F.3d 145, 148 (1st\n\nCir. 2004), we review the BIA’s denial of such a motion only for an\n\nabuse of discretion, id., and the movant bears the burden to prove\n\nan entitlement to asylum, 8 C.F.R. § 208.13.                      The BIA tersely\n\nrejected the asylum claim filed by Elien:\n\n             To support his motion, [Elien], through\n             counsel, makes the interesting but unavailing\n             argument that his extensive and serious\n             criminal history during his presence in the\n             United States has now rendered him a “refugee”\n             within the meaning of the [INA] and, because\n             of the many crimes he has committed in this\n             country, he faces persecution in his native\n             Haiti. In other words, by repeatedly flouting\n             the criminal laws of this country, [Elien]\n\n                                         -4-\n\f            allegedly now warrants relief from deportation\n            under the immigration laws of this country.\n            However, the evidence submitted with the\n            motion does not, in our view[,] demonstrate\n            that   [Elien]    faces  the   likelihood   of\n            persecution    on   account   of   his   race,\n            nationality, religion, political opinion, or\n            membership in a particular social group.\n\nElien maintains that the BIA’s treatment of his claim violates due\n\nprocess, principally because its final sentence does not specify\n\nwhich     element   of   the       “refugee”         definition    in    subsection\n\n1101(a)(42)(A) he failed to establish – viz., his membership in a\n\nprotected class or a well-founded fear of persecution.                        A BIA\n\ndecision need not be encyclopedic, however, and normally will\n\nsatisfy    the   dictates     of   due    process       provided   its   essential\n\nrationale    and    factual    findings        are    clear   enough     to   enable\n\nmeaningful appellate review.          See, e.g., Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d\n\n323, 328 (1st Cir. 2000).          Such is the case here.          Characterizing\n\nElien’s argument as “unavailing,” the BIA explicitly stated that\n\nits recognition of a “social group” consisting of deported Haitian\n\nnationals with criminal records in the United States would serve to\n\nencourage and reward aliens who committed crimes while in the\n\nUnited States, thus immunizing them from deportation.                    Elien has\n\nposited no other conceivable connotation for the language employed\n\nby the BIA.\n\n            Next, we turn to the merits of the contention that the\n\nINA recognizes deported Haitian nationals with criminal records in\n\nthe United States as a protected “social group” eligible for\n\n                                         -5-\n\fasylum.   As the scope of the statutory term “particular social\n\ngroup” presents a pure issue of law, we review the BIA decision de\n\nnovo.   See Meguenine v. INS, 139 F.3d 25, 27 n.2 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nThe INA   does   not    define   the    term   “particular   social   group,”\n\nhowever, nor is the term free from ambiguity.          See Lwin v. INS, 144\n\nF.3d 505, 510 (7th Cir. 1998) (noting that “the meaning of ‘social\n\ngroup’ remains elusive”).        Presumably, the term refers to “a[ny]\n\ngroup with some immutable trait (such as an ethnic group) or a\n\nmutable trait which a member of that group should not, in good\n\nconscience, be required to change (such as a religious adherent’s\n\nbeliefs),” Meguenine, 139 F.3d at 27 n.2; see also In Matter of\n\nAcosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985) (noting that examples\n\nof   common,   immutable    characteristics      may   include   sex,   race,\n\nkinship, and past experiences such as former military service or\n\nland ownership).       Yet, even this judicial gloss leaves ample room\n\nfor case-by-case definition.       Elien nonetheless maintains that the\n\nclass of repatriated criminals with which he identifies himself has\n\ntwo immutable characteristics: its members have permanent criminal\n\nrecords in the United States, and the Haitian government thus\n\nperceives them as likely recidivists.\n\n           As immigration law frequently implicates some expertise\n\nin matters of foreign policy, BIA interpretations of the statutes\n\nand regulations it administers are accorded substantial deference.\n\nSee INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 425 (1999) (“[J]udicial\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdeference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the\n\nimmigration context where officials ‘exercise especially sensitive\n\npolitical    functions    that   implicate     questions     of   foreign\n\nrelations.’”) (citation omitted).       \"The power of an administrative\n\nagency to administer a congressionally created and funded program\n\nnecessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of\n\nrules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\"\n\nMorton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974).3\n\n            When a statute is silent or ambiguous, therefore, we\n\nuphold the implementing agency's statutory interpretation, provided\n\nit   is   “reasonable”   and   consistent    with   the   statute.    See\n\nUrena-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 51, 54 n.3 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(citing INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 448-49 (1987));\n\nPenobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. FAA, 164 F.3d 713, 719 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (noting that agency rationale need only be reasonable,\n\n\n\n     3\n      See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,\n467 U.S. 837, 866 (1984) (“Federal judges – who have no\nconstituency – have a duty to respect legitimate policy choices\nmade by those who do. The responsibilities for assessing the wisdom\nof such policy choices and resolving the struggle between competing\nviews of the public interest are not judicial ones: ‘Our\nConstitution vests such responsibilities in the political\nbranches.’\"); Gonzalez v. Reno, 212 F.3d 1338, 1349 (11th Cir.\n2000) (“In this case, because the law – particularly section 1158\n– is silent about the validity of Plaintiff's purported asylum\napplications, it fell to the INS to make a discretionary policy\nchoice.”); cf. Hernandez-Patino v. INS, 831 F.2d 750, 753 (7th Cir.\n1987) (“The better view may be to accept the fact that Congress, in\nrefusing to define ‘extreme’ hardship fully, avoided the\nsubstantive   policy   decision   and   has  deferred   to   agency\nexpertise.”).\n\n                                  -7-\n\flogical, and nonarbitrary); see also Capric v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d\n\n1075, 1086 n.4 (7th Cir. 2004).             Accordingly, we are to defer to\n\nthe interpretation given the term “social group” by the BIA even if\n\nwe   conclude    that    the   term    is   susceptible    to   more   than   one\n\npermissible interpretation.           See Mugalli v. Ashcroft, 258 F.3d 52,\n\n55 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n           The BIA determined that, whether or not Haitians who\n\ncommit crimes in the United States are subjected to “persecution”\n\nupon repatriation, it would be unsound policy to recognize them as\n\na    “social    group”   safeguarded        by   the   asylum   statute.       See\n\nBastanipour v. INS, 980 F.2d 1129, 1132 (7th Cir. 1992) (rejecting\n\ncomparable argument that “drug traffickers” were protected “social\n\ngroup” under INA, precluding their deportation to Iran).4                     Such\n\nrecognition unquestionably would create a perverse incentive for\n\nHaitians coming to or residing in the United States to commit\n\ncrimes, thereby immunizing themselves from deportation to Haiti.\n\nMoreover, the BIA has never extended the term “social group” to\n\nencompass persons who voluntarily engaged in illicit activities.\n\nCf. In Matter of Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. at 233 (noting that\n\nexamples of common, immutable characteristics may include sex,\n\nrace, kinship, and past experiences such as former military service\n\n\n\n      4\n      Elien cites to dicta from Bastanipour, suggesting that aliens\nwho commit only “minor” crimes might be entitled to protection as\nrefugees.    In exercising its interpretative prerogative under\nChevron, however, the BIA obviously is not bound by such dicta.\n\n                                        -8-\n\for land ownership).      Finally, as the BIA has held, although some of\n\nHaiti’s detention practices may violate detainee rights, in general\n\n“Haiti    has   a   legitimate     national    interest    in   protecting      its\n\ncitizens from increased criminal activity.”           In re J-E-, 23 I. & N.\n\nDec. 291, 300 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the\n\nchoice the BIA has made between these competing policies is either\n\nunreasonable or impermissible.5\n\n            As the BIA rationale turned entirely upon the legal issue\n\nrelating to the proper interpretation of “social group,” the\n\nargument Elien advances on appeal – that the BIA did not cite any\n\nrecord    evidence,    such   as   State     Department   reports    describing\n\nHaiti’s indefinite detention policy and inhumane prison conditions\n\n– is unavailing as well.         Such record evidence relates only to the\n\nsecond prong of his argument, viz., that he had a “well-founded\n\nfear of    persecution,”      which   inquiry    becomes    moot    once   it   is\n\ndetermined that Elien is not a member of a social group protected\n\nby the asylum statute.        See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A) (requiring\n\nthat persecution be “on account of . . . membership in a particular\n\nsocial group”) (emphasis added).6\n\n\n     5\n      While the instant petition for review of the BIA decision was\npending, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was removed from power.\nThe potential effect of these events upon Haiti’s detention policy\nis unknown.\n     6\n      Elien argues that the BIA committed reversible error                       in\nadverting to “his extensive and serious criminal history.”                       He\ncontends that the record instead shows but two convictions                      for\n“minor” criminal offenses. See Mansour v. INS, 230 F.3d 902,                    908\n\n                                       -9-\n\fB. Convention Against Torture\n\n          Finally,   Elien   contends   that   the   BIA   inadequately\n\nexplained its rationale for holding that he was not entitled to\n\nprotection under Article 3 of CAT, and failed to cite substantial\n\nrecord evidence supporting that decision. The BIA decision states:\n\n          Nor does the evidence demonstrate that the\n          Haitian government will, more likely than not,\n          torture [Elien] or acquiesce in his torture by\n          others.   The respondent may or may not be\n          detained on his return to Haiti; since he has\n          committed no crimes in that country, at least\n          since his presence here, he may be detained\n          for screening prior to release back into the\n          population.   While the prison conditions in\n          Haiti may not equal the standards of those in\n          the United States, the record does not support\n          the conclusory allegation that, more likely\n          than not, the respondent will be tortured. In\n          the absence of persuasive evidence of the\n          likelihood of torture, we find no basis for\n          reopening to remand to the [IJ] to adjudicate\n          a claim for which [Elien] has not shown\n          eligibility.\n\n          The CAT, as implemented by the Foreign Affairs Reform and\n\n\n\n(7th Cir. 2000) (reversing BIA denial of asylum application based\non BIA’s clear misunderstanding of record). We disagree. Elien\nhas been convicted of theft and possession of a controlled\nsubstance, and it is primarily a matter of opinion (not one of\nfact) whether such offenses are to be characterized as “serious” or\n“minor.” In his brief before the BIA, moreover, Elien alternately\nadvocated that the BIA define the protected relevant “social group”\nas all Haitians with U.S. criminal records, viz., subject to\ndetention without any individualized review of the nature and\nseverity of the offenses of conviction, while at other times he\nsuggested that the “social group” be defined narrowly as Haitians\nwith “minor” criminal records.      Given this incertitude, Elien\ncannot fault the BIA for characterizing his argument as an\ninvitation to create a comprehensive class which includes both\nserious and “minor” criminals.\n\n                                -10-\n\fRestructuring Act (FARRA), Pub. L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat 2681-761,\n\n2681-822 (1998), prohibits the “involuntary return of any person to\n\na country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the\n\nperson   would    be    in    danger   of     being   subjected   to   torture.”\n\nAlthough   FARRA       does    not   define    the    term   “torture,”   the   INS\n\nimplementing regulations interpret it as \"any act by which severe\n\npain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally\n\ninflicted on a person . . . when such pain or suffering is\n\ninflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\n\nacquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an\n\nofficial capacity.\"           8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1); see also Saint Fort\n\nv. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 191, 196 (1st Cir. 2003).                   “For an act to\n\nconstitute torture it must be: (1) an act causing severe physical\n\nor mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for\n\na proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the\n\nconsent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or\n\nphysical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful\n\nsanctions.”      In re J-E-, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 297 (citing 8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.18(a)).      The alien applying for CAT protection must bear the\n\nburden to prove, by objective evidence, that it is more likely than\n\nnot that he will be tortured if he is deported.                        8 C.F.R. §\n\n208.16(c)(2); § 208.17(a) (emphasis added).\n\n           In interpreting the statutory term “torture,” the BIA\n\npreviously has held that a Haitian national failed to meet his\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fburden of proof by simply adducing anecdotal evidence of “isolated\n\nacts of torture” in Haiti’s detention facilities, such as burning\n\nwith cigarettes and electric shock, and no record evidence was\n\nadduced that Haiti used torture pervasively or as a matter of\n\npolicy on detainees.         In re J-E-, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 303; see\n\nKhouzam v.

Thirteen years later, in 1994, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) finally commenced deportation proceedings against him. Elien proceeded to concede deportability, then sought suspension of deportation or voluntary departure. In August 1996, an immigration judge (IJ) denied both requests, and ordered Elien deported.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Elien appealed to the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, while the BIA appeal was pending, Haiti implemented a new policy, whereby it detained all repatriated Haitians who had incurred a criminal record while residing in the United States, based on the presumption that their exposure to American violence and crime predisposed them to recidivist criminal behavior upon their return to Haiti. The United States State Department and press reports suggest that Haitian authorities subject detainees to indefinite terms of imprisonment, inhumane prison conditions, and in some cases, torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2001,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the BIA denied Elien's appeal from the deportation order issued by the IJ in 1996. Elien submitted a motion to reopen the deportation proceeding in order to adjudicate an application for asylum, withholding of deportation, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), claiming that Haiti would detain him indefinitely based upon his convictions for two \"minor\" criminal offenses committed while in the United States. In due course, the BIA denied the motion to reopen, and Elien now petitions for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Asylum Application</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elien contends that the BIA has neither adequately explained its rationale for determining that he is not entitled to asylum under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), nor cited to substantial record evidence supporting its decision. Under the INA the term \"refugee\" is defined as a person unable or unwilling to return to the country of nationality \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). Before the BIA, Elien contended that (i) he is a member of a \"particular social group,\" consisting of deported Haitian nationals with criminal records in the United States; and (2) undisputed evidence &#8212; such as State Department reports &#8212; establishes that his membership in that \"particular social group\" will render him subject to \"persecution,\" <i>viz.,</i> indefinite detainment, inhumane prison conditions, and torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since motions to reopen deportation proceedings are strongly disfavored, <i>see Mabikas v. INS,</i> 358 F.3d 145, 148 (1st Cir.2004), we review the BIA's denial of such a motion only for an abuse of discretion, <i>id.,</i> and the movant bears the burden to prove an entitlement to asylum, 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13. The BIA tersely rejected the asylum claim filed by Elien:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his motion, [Elien], through counsel, makes the interesting but unavailing argument that his extensive and serious criminal history during his presence in the United States has now rendered him a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the [INA] and, because of the many crimes he has committed in this country, he faces persecution in his native Haiti. In other words, by repeatedly flouting the criminal laws of this country, [Elien] allegedly now warrants relief from deportation under the immigration laws of this country. However, the evidence submitted with the motion does not, in our view [,] demonstrate that [Elien] faces the likelihood of persecution on account of his race, nationality, religion, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elien maintains that the BIA's treatment of his claim violates due process, principally because its final sentence does not specify which element of the \"refugee\" definition in subsection 1101(a)(42)(A) he failed to establish &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> his membership in a protected class <i>or</i> a well-founded fear of persecution. A BIA decision need not be encyclopedic, however, and normally will satisfy the dictates of due process provided its essential rationale and factual findings are clear enough to enable meaningful appellate review. <i>See, e.g., Morales v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.2000). Such is the case here. Characterizing Elien's argument as \"unavailing,\" the BIA explicitly stated that its recognition of a \"social group\" consisting of deported Haitian nationals with criminal records in the United States would serve to encourage and reward aliens who committed crimes while in the United States, thus immunizing them from deportation. Elien has posited no other conceivable connotation for the language employed by the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we turn to the merits of the contention that the INA recognizes deported Haitian nationals with criminal records in the United States as a protected \"social group\" eligible for asylum. As the scope of the statutory term \"particular social group\" presents a pure issue of law, we review the BIA decision <i>de novo. See Meguenine v. INS,</i> 139 F.3d 25, 27 n. 2 (1st Cir.1998). The INA does not define the term \"particular social group,\" however, nor is the term free from ambiguity. <i>See Lwin v. INS,</i> 144 F.3d 505, 510 (7th Cir.1998) (noting that \"the meaning of `social group' remains elusive\"). Presumably, the term refers to \"a[ny] group with some immutable trait (such as an ethnic group) or a mutable trait which a member of that group should not, in good conscience, be required to change (such as a religious adherent's beliefs),\" <i>Meguenine,</i> 139 F.3d at 27 n. 2; <i>see also In Matter of Acosta,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233, 1985 WL 56042 (BIA 1985) (noting that examples of common, immutable characteristics may include sex, race, kinship, and past experiences such as former military service or land ownership). Yet, even this judicial gloss leaves ample room for case-by-case definition. Elien nonetheless maintains that the class of repatriated criminals with which he identifies himself has two immutable characteristics: its members have permanent criminal records in the United States, and the Haitian government thus perceives them as likely recidivists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As immigration law frequently implicates some expertise in matters of foreign policy, BIA interpretations of the statutes and regulations it administers are accorded substantial deference. <i>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. 415, 425, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999) (\"[J]udicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials `exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.'\") (citation omitted). \"The power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created and funded program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\" <i>Morton v. Ruiz,</i> 415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a statute is silent or ambiguous, therefore, we uphold the implementing agency's statutory interpretation, provided it is \"reasonable\" and consistent with the statute. <i>See Urena-Ramirez v. Ashcroft,</i> 341 F.3d 51, 54 n. 3 (1st Cir.2003) (citing <i>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</i> 480 U.S. 421, 448-49, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)); <i>Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. FAA,</i> 164 F.3d 713, 719 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that agency rationale need only be reasonable, logical, and nonarbitrary); <i>see also Capric v. Ashcroft,</i> 355 F.3d 1075, 1086 n. 4 (7th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we are to defer to the interpretation given the term \"social group\" by the BIA even if we conclude that the term is susceptible to more than one permissible interpretation. <i>See Mugalli v. Ashcroft,</i> 258 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA determined that, whether or not Haitians who commit crimes in the United States are subjected to \"persecution\" upon repatriation, it would be unsound policy to recognize them as a \"social group\" safeguarded by the asylum statute. <i>See Bastanipour v. INS,</i> 980 F.2d 1129, 1132 (7th Cir.1992) (rejecting comparable argument that \"drug traffickers\" were protected \"social group\" under INA, precluding their deportation to Iran).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Such recognition unquestionably would create a perverse incentive for Haitians coming to or residing in the United States to commit crimes, thereby immunizing themselves from deportation to Haiti. Moreover, the BIA has never extended the term \"social group\" to encompass persons who voluntarily engaged in illicit activities. <i>Cf. In Matter of Acosta,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 233 (noting that examples of common, immutable characteristics may include sex, race, kinship, and past experiences such as former military service or land ownership). Finally, as the BIA has held, although some of Haiti's detention practices may violate detainee rights, in general \"Haiti has a legitimate national interest in protecting its citizens from increased criminal activity.\" <i>In re J-E-,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 291, 300, 2002 WL 481156 (BIA 2002). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the choice the BIA has made between these competing policies is either unreasonable or impermissible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the BIA rationale turned entirely upon the legal issue relating to the proper interpretation of \"social group,\" the argument Elien advances on appeal &#8212; that the BIA did not cite any record evidence, such as State Department reports describing Haiti's indefinite detention policy and inhumane prison conditions &#8212; is unavailing as well. Such record evidence relates only to the second prong of his argument, <i>viz.,</i> that he had a \"well-founded fear of persecution,\" which inquiry becomes moot once it is determined that Elien is not a member of a social group protected by the asylum statute. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A) (requiring that persecution be \"<i>on account of</i> ... membership in a particular social group\") (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Convention Against Torture</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Elien contends that the BIA inadequately explained its rationale for holding that he was not entitled to protection under Article 3 of CAT, and failed to cite substantial record evidence supporting that decision. The BIA decision states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the evidence demonstrate that the Haitian government will, more likely than not, torture [Elien] or acquiesce in his torture by others. The respondent may or may not be detained on his return to Haiti; since he has committed no crimes in that country, at least since his presence here, he may be detained for screening prior to release back into the population. While the prison conditions in Haiti may not equal the standards of those in the United States, the record does not support the conclusory allegation that, more likely than not, the respondent will be tortured. In the absence of persuasive evidence of the likelihood of torture, we find no basis for reopening to remand to the [IJ] to adjudicate a claim for which [Elien] has not shown eligibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CAT, as implemented by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), Pub.L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681-761, 2681-822 (1998), prohibits the \"involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\" Although FARRA does not define the term \"torture,\" the INS implementing regulations interpret it as \"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.18(a)(1); <i>see also Saint Fort v. Ashcroft,</i> 329 F.3d 191, 196 (1st Cir.2003). \"For an act to constitute torture it must be: (1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.\" <i>In re J-E-,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 297 (citing 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.18(a)). The alien applying for CAT protection must bear the burden to prove, by objective evidence, that it is <i>more likely than not</i> that he will be tortured if he is deported. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.16(c)(2); &#167; 208.17(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting the statutory term \"torture,\" the BIA previously has held that a Haitian national failed to meet his burden of proof by simply adducing anecdotal evidence of \"isolated acts of torture\" in Haiti's detention facilities, such as burning with cigarettes and electric shock, and no record evidence was adduced that Haiti used torture pervasively or as a matter of policy on detainees. <i>In re J-E-,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 303; <i>see Khouzam v. Ashcroft,</i> 361 F.3d 161, 170 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that \"the [<i>In re J-E-</i>] respondent had failed to show that the torture was `pervasive and widespread'\") (citation omitted). For this reason, J-Ecould not prove that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he were deported. <i>In re J-E-,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 304 (contrasting <i>Al-Saher v. INS,</i> 268 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir.2001), where alien proved that Iranian authorities \"<i>routinely</i> tortured detainees\") (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elien acknowledges the import of the <i>In re J-E-</i> decision, but simply contends that he should be given a chance to adduce his own factual record and to prove that the torture of Haitian detainees is more pervasive. While we acknowledge the general principle that Elien is not limited <i>per se</i> to the evidentiary record developed by J-E-, he has made no attempt on appeal to demonstrate in what respect his proffer is qualitatively different than or superior to the <i>In re J-E-</i> record, which likewise was supported by comparable State Department and media reports. In order to be entitled to reopen his deportation proceeding in the wake of <i>In re J-E-,</i> Elien was required &#8212; at least &#8212; to make a proffer before the BIA which would permit a finding by an IJ that torture of detainees was widespread in Haiti.

In August 1996, an immigration judge (IJ) denied both requests, and ordered Elien deported.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Elien appealed to the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, while the BIA appeal was pending, Haiti implemented a new policy, whereby it detained all repatriated Haitians who had incurred a criminal record while residing in the United States, based on the presumption that their exposure to American violence and crime predisposed them to recidivist criminal behavior upon their return to Haiti. The United States State Department and press reports suggest that Haitian authorities subject detainees to indefinite terms of imprisonment, inhumane prison conditions, and in some cases, torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 2001,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the BIA denied Elien's appeal from the deportation order issued by the IJ in 1996. Elien submitted a motion to reopen the deportation proceeding in order to adjudicate an application for asylum, withholding of deportation, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), claiming that Haiti would detain him indefinitely based upon his convictions for two \"minor\" criminal offenses committed while in the United States. In due course, the BIA denied the motion to reopen, and Elien now petitions for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Asylum Application</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elien contends that the BIA has neither adequately explained its rationale for determining that he is not entitled to asylum under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), nor cited to substantial record evidence supporting its decision. Under the INA the term \"refugee\" is defined as a person unable or unwilling to return to the country of nationality \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). Before the BIA, Elien contended that (i) he is a member of a \"particular social group,\" consisting of deported Haitian nationals with criminal records in the United States; and (2) undisputed evidence &#8212; such as State Department reports &#8212; establishes that his membership in that \"particular social group\" will render him subject to \"persecution,\" <i>viz.,</i> indefinite detainment, inhumane prison conditions, and torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since motions to reopen deportation proceedings are strongly disfavored, <i>see Mabikas v.

The BIA tersely rejected the asylum claim filed by Elien:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support his motion, [Elien], through counsel, makes the interesting but unavailing argument that his extensive and serious criminal history during his presence in the United States has now rendered him a \"refugee\" within the meaning of the [INA] and, because of the many crimes he has committed in this country, he faces persecution in his native Haiti. In other words, by repeatedly flouting the criminal laws of this country, [Elien] allegedly now warrants relief from deportation under the immigration laws of this country. However, the evidence submitted with the motion does not, in our view [,] demonstrate that [Elien] faces the likelihood of persecution on account of his race, nationality, religion, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Elien maintains that the BIA's treatment of his claim violates due process, principally because its final sentence does not specify which element of the \"refugee\" definition in subsection 1101(a)(42)(A) he failed to establish &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> his membership in a protected class <i>or</i> a well-founded fear of persecution. A BIA decision need not be encyclopedic, however, and normally will satisfy the dictates of due process provided its essential rationale and factual findings are clear enough to enable meaningful appellate review. <i>See, e.g., Morales v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768205\"><a href=\"/opinion/768205/juan-antonio-morales-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 328 (1st Cir.2000). Such is the case here. Characterizing Elien's argument as \"unavailing,\" the BIA explicitly stated that its recognition of a \"social group\" consisting of deported Haitian nationals with criminal records in the United States would serve to encourage and reward aliens who committed crimes while in the United States, thus immunizing them from deportation. Elien has posited no other conceivable connotation for the language employed by the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we turn to the merits of the contention that the INA recognizes deported Haitian nationals with criminal records in the United States as a protected \"social group\" eligible for asylum. As the scope of the statutory term \"particular social group\" presents a pure issue of law, we review the BIA decision <i>de novo. See Meguenine v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197852\"><a href=\"/opinion/197852/meguenine-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27 n. 2 (1st Cir.1998). The INA does not define the term \"particular social group,\" however, nor is the term free from ambiguity. <i>See Lwin v.

Presumably, the term refers to \"a[ny] group with some immutable trait (such as an ethnic group) or a mutable trait which a member of that group should not, in good conscience, be required to change (such as a religious adherent's beliefs),\" <i>Meguenine,</i> 139 F.3d at 27 n. 2; <i>see also In Matter of Acosta,</i> 19 I. &amp; N.

Yet, even this judicial gloss leaves ample room for case-by-case definition. Elien nonetheless maintains that the class of repatriated criminals with which he identifies himself has two immutable characteristics: its members have permanent criminal records in the United States, and the Haitian government thus perceives them as likely recidivists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As immigration law frequently implicates some expertise in matters of foreign policy, BIA interpretations of the statutes and regulations it administers are accorded substantial deference. <i>See INS v.

Such record evidence relates only to the second prong of his argument, <i>viz.,</i> that he had a \"well-founded fear of persecution,\" which inquiry becomes moot once it is determined that Elien is not a member of a social group protected by the asylum statute. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A) (requiring that persecution be \"<i>on account of</i> ... membership in a particular social group\") (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Convention Against Torture</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Elien contends that the BIA inadequately explained its rationale for holding that he was not entitled to protection under Article 3 of CAT, and failed to cite substantial record evidence supporting that decision.

Elien has been convicted of theft and possession of a controlled substance, and it is primarily a matter of opinion (not one of fact) whether such offenses are to be characterized as \"serious\" or \"minor.\" In his brief before the BIA, moreover, Elien alternately advocated that the BIA define the protected relevant \"social group\" as all Haitians with U.S. criminal records, <i>viz.,</i> subject to detention without any individualized review of the nature and severity of the offenses of conviction, while at other times he suggested that the \"social group\" be defined narrowly as Haitians with \"minor\" criminal records. Given this incertitude, Elien cannot fault the BIA for characterizing his argument as an invitation to create a comprehensive class which includes both serious and \"minor\" criminals.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
