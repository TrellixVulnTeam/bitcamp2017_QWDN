In this political discrimination case,\n\nplaintiff-appellant Sonji A. Ortiz García appeals the district\n\ncourt’s award of summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees\n\nFernando Toledo Fernández, Francisco Aponte, Carmen Oliver, Alma\n\nHernández and Luis Rivera Cubano.        We affirm.\n\n            Ortiz asserted a claim that she was subject to working\n\nconditions    so    unreasonable   as    \"to   cause    reasonably   hardy\n\nindividuals to compromise their political beliefs and associations\n\nin favor of the prevailing party.\"       Agosto-De-Feliciano v. Aponte-\n\nRoque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1217 (1st Cir. 1989).       She also claimed that\n\npolitical discrimination led to a denial of a promotion and being\n\nsubjected to unwarranted discipline. As best as we can understand,\n\nOrtiz's appeal focuses on the inferior working conditions and\n\nunwarranted discipline claims.1\n\n            We recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable\n\nto Ortiz.    See Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).      Ortiz is a career employee in the Puerto Rico\n\nDepartment of Agriculture’s Market Inspection Office, where she\n\nholds the position of Agronomist IV.        In that office, agronomists\n\nare   specialists   in   agriculture,    specifically   land   and   cattle\n\n\n\n      1\n      The appellant's brief was particularly confused, making it\ndifficult for the court to identify Oritz's appellate claims. We\nhave read the brief liberally but, to the extent that Oritz sought\nto include claims which we have not considered, she has waived\nthem. See United States v. Zannino,895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fsciences.    Ortiz began working at the Market Inspection Office as\n\nan Agronomist I in 1993, became a career employee there in 1994,\n\nand was promoted to the position of Agronomist IV in 1997.                Ortiz\n\nis an active member of Puerto Rico’s New Progressive Party (“NPP”).\n\nIn 1998, she left her Agronomist IV position to hold various trust\n\npositions for the NPP, which was in power at the time.\n\n            In    November   2000,    Sila   María   Calderón,     a    Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (“PDP”) candidate, was elected Governor of Puerto\n\nRico.   Ortiz subsequently resigned from her trust position and was\n\nreinstated to her career position as Agronomist IV in January 2001.\n\nThe   alleged     discrimination     began   immediately   after       she   was\n\nreinstated.      Defendants are all members of the PDP and work either\n\ndirectly in the Market Inspection Office or at the Department of\n\nAgriculture.\n\n            Shortly after her reinstatement as an agronomist, Ortiz\n\nreceived a letter informing her that she would be required to\n\nprepare statistical reports for the whole office.          She wrote three\n\nletters to defendant Toledo (the Secretary of the Department of\n\nAgriculture) to complain about the assignment, arguing that the\n\nreport writing would force her to perform the functions of a data\n\nentry clerk.       Soon thereafter, some of the report writing was\n\nredistributed to other agronomists.\n\n            During the same time period, Ortiz was also told that she\n\nwould do field activities only once a week while other agronomists\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhad daily field responsibilities.                  In addition, her decisions were\n\nundercut by lower-ranking office members.                   And while Ortiz oversaw\n\ncertain inspectors, she did not supervise other agronomists.                        This\n\nresponsibility was given to lower-ranking employees.\n\n                 Soon after Ortiz began work in 2001, another agronomist,\n\nJulia Santa, was reclassified from Agronomist III to Agronomist\n\nSupervisor.            When   an   additional       supervisory        position   became\n\navailable, Ortiz applied but another individual was selected.\n\nAccording         to   Ortiz,      between    seven       and   nine    PDP-affiliated\n\nagronomists were reclassified to higher positions when the PDP took\n\npower.2\n\n                 In May 2002, disciplinary action was taken against Ortiz\n\nfor leaving the workplace without authorization and for writing a\n\nfalse travel order.           Ortiz has averred that she left the workplace\n\nto participate in official charitable activities, and she claimed\n\nthat       the   disciplinary      action     was    in   contravention      of   agency\n\nregulations and customary practice.\n\n                 At the conclusion of discovery, defendants moved for\n\nsummary judgment on the political discrimination claims.                             The\n\ndistrict court awarded summary judgment on two grounds. First, the\n\ncourt found that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether the deprivations suffered by Ortiz were severe enough to\n\n\n       2\n      Ortiz has not developed a discriminatory failure-to-promote\nclaim but presents this evidence to bolster her showing of\ndiscriminatory treatment in her own Agronomist IV position.\n\n                                             -4-\n\festablish an “unreasonably inferior” work environment. Second, the\n\ncourt decided that Ortiz did not provide sufficient evidence to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of discriminatory animus.3\n\n          We review the grant of summary judgment de novo.            See\n\nFigueroa-Serrano,   221   F.3d   at   4.   To   succeed   on   her   work\n\nenvironment claim, Ortiz has to show, by clear and convincing\n\nevidence, that she was subjected to an unreasonably inferior\n\nenvironment.4   Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1217-20.       If that\n\nburden is met, Ortiz has to show that her political affiliation was\n\na substantial factor in the establishment of the unreasonably\n\ninferior work environment.   See id. at 1218-20.    If she makes this\n\nprima facie showing, the burden shifts to the defendants to show\n\nthat they would have acted in the same way regardless of Oritz's\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Ortiz also brought a due process claim which the district\ncourt rejected. Ortiz does not develop an argument challenging\nthis ruling on appeal.\n     4\n      We have questioned, without resolving, the extent to which\nAgosto-de-Feliciano's \"unreasonably inferior work environment\"\nstandard applies after the Supreme Court's decision in Rutan v.\nRepublican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62 (1990). See Acevedo-Garcia\nv. Vera-Monroig, 204 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2000) ; Nerida-Gonzalez\nv. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 705 (1st Cir. 1993). But we have\noffered a rationale for retaining the \"unreasonably inferior rule\"\nin cases such as this. See Acosta-Orozco v. Rodriguez-de-Rivera,\n132 F.3d 97, 101 n.5 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"We do not regard [Rutan] as\nnecessarily foreclosing something like the 'unreasonably inferior'\nrule for personnel actions short of demotions or transfers.\"). In\nany event, this case was argued before the district court and this\ncourt on the ground that Agosto-de-Feliciano provides the governing\nstandard. We will therefore assume arguendo that this standard\napplies.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fpolitical affiliation.             See Mount Healthy Sch. Dist. v. Doyle, 429\n\nU.S. 274, 286-87 (1977).\n\n            Ortiz’s inferior work environment claim falters at the\n\nthreshold.      To establish her claim, Ortiz must identify evidence\n\nfrom    which        a   factfinder     could       conclude    that    her   job    is\n\n“unreasonably inferior to the norm for the position.”                     Agosto-de-\n\nFeliciano, 889 F.2d at 1220.               To determine whether an environment\n\nis unreasonably inferior, a factfinder should “canvass the specific\n\nways in which the plaintiff’s job has changed.”                        Id.; see also\n\nRivera-Ruiz v. Gonzalez-Rivera, 983 F.2d 332, 335 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nOrtiz argues that she was forced to endure an unreasonably inferior\n\nwork environment because she lost certain benefits (including a\n\nparking     space        and    personal    telephone);        was   assigned     tasks\n\nunsuitable for an Agronomist IV; and received less favorable\n\ntreatment than other employees.\n\n            Ortiz’s evidence of mistreatment is insufficient to meet\n\nthe    demanding         requirement   for     an    unreasonably      inferior     work\n\nenvironment claim.             First, in this situation a parking space and a\n\npersonal telephone are perquisites. Of the twenty employees at the\n\nMarket Inspection Office, four had parking spots, and three had\n\nphones on their desks.              Ortiz's job description says nothing to\n\nindicate that she had a right to them or a need for them.                            The\n\ndeprivation of such perquisites ordinarily does not support an\n\ninference       of       an    “unreasonably      inferior”     work    environment.\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fSee Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1219 (“An employee who has\n\nlost merely the ‘perks’ of his position--for example, the best\n\noffice or secretary in the agency, unlimited telephone access or\n\nunusually    minimal    oversight--would   not   meet   the   ‘unreasonably\n\ninferior’ standard.”).\n\n             Second, there is no evidence of substantially changed\n\nworking conditions.       Ortiz’s account of her job assignments fits\n\nsquarely within the job description of an Agronomist IV.          Further,\n\nwhile Ortiz held the Agronomist IV position before being promoted\n\nto a trust position, she has not presented evidence comparing her\n\npresent   duties   to    her   duties   when   she   previously   held   the\n\nposition.5    Thus, a factfinder would have no way to know whether\n\nthe position she occupies now materially differs from the position\n\nas it existed previously.      Moreover, while Ortiz claims that other\n\nagronomists were better treated, she provides little information\n\nabout these individuals or their work assignments from which a\n\nmeaningful comparison of work environments could be made.6                In\n\n     5\n      Ortiz began her second tour of duty in the Agronomist IV\nposition when the new administration was installed at the\nDepartment of Agriculture. Because she was not an Agronomist IV\nimmediately prior to the start of the alleged inferior treatment,\ncomparison with her circumstances immediately prior to the change\nin power is not relevant.\n     6\n      Ortiz does not compare her treatment with that of the other\neight employees occupying Agronomist IV positions. Instead, she\nrelies heavily upon evidence regarding the reclassification of one\nemployee, Julia Santa (a PDP member), from Agronomist III to\nAgronomist Supervisor. But Ortiz does not adduce evidence that\nSanta was not qualified for the reclassification or that she was\npromoted in an inequitable way. The same holds true for the person\n\n                                    -7-\n\fshort, the record is inadequate for a reasonable factfinder to\n\nconclude that Ortiz was subjected to an unreasonably inferior work\n\nenvironment after her return to the Agronomist IV position.\n\n            The unwarranted discipline claim fails for a lack of\n\ncompetent    comparative   evidence    suggesting   political   animus.\n\nCf. Rathbun v. Autozone, Inc., 361 F.3d 61, 76 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(explaining that, for Title VII claims, comparative evidence must\n\n\"show[] that others similarly situated . . . in all relevant\n\nrespects were treated differently\" than the individual alleging\n\ndiscrimination) (quoting Conward v. Cambridge Sc. Comm., 171 F.3d\n\n12, 20 (1st Cir. 1999).     Ortiz claimed ten other employees were\n\naccused of absence from the workplace without authorization but\n\nthat none were disciplined.    She failed, however, to identify them\n\nor provide other information necessary to compare her situation to\n\ntheirs, including their party membership.       See Kaufmann v. P.R.\n\nTel. Co., 841 F.2d 1169, 1172 n.5 (1st Cir. 1988).        Without this\n\ninformation, no inference of discriminatory motive can be drawn.\n\nIn addition, Ortiz was charged not just with being absent from the\n\nworkplace, but also with writing a false travel order.             She\n\npresented no evidence disputing this charge.        Nor did she provide\n\nevidence that any other employee was similarly accused but was\n\ntreated more leniently.       The summary judgment record is thus\n\n\n\n\npromoted to the Agronomist Supervisor position that Ortiz applied\nfor but did not receive.\n\n                                 -8-\n\finsufficient to support the inference that Ortiz was placed in the\n\ndisciplinary hearing because of her political affiliation.\n\n          Ortiz has failed to establish that she was subjected to\n\nan unreasonably inferior work environment or that the disciplinary\n\nproceeding against her was motivated by political animus.      We\n\ntherefore affirm the district court’s award of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

In that office, agronomists are specialists in agriculture, specifically land and cattle sciences. Ortiz began working at the Market Inspection Office as an Agronomist I in 1993, became a career employee there in 1994, and was promoted to the position of Agronomist IV in 1997.

The deprivation of such perquisites ordinarily does not support an inference of an \"unreasonably inferior\" work environment. <i>See Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1219 (\"An employee who has lost merely the `perks' of his position &#8212; for example, the best office or secretary in the agency, unlimited telephone access or unusually minimal oversight &#8212; would not meet the `unreasonably inferior' standard.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is no evidence of substantially changed working conditions. Ortiz's account of her job assignments fits squarely within the job description of an Agronomist IV. Further, while Ortiz held the Agronomist IV position before being promoted to a trust position, she has not presented evidence comparing her present duties to her duties when she previously held the position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Thus, a factfinder would have no way to know whether the position she occupies now materially differs from the position as it existed previously. Moreover, while Ortiz claims that other agronomists were better treated, she provides little information about these individuals or their work assignments from which a meaningful comparison of work environments could be made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> In short, the record is inadequate for a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Ortiz was subjected to an unreasonably inferior work environment after her return to the Agronomist IV position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unwarranted discipline claim fails for a lack of competent comparative evidence suggesting political animus. <i>Cf. Rathbun v. Autozone, Inc.,</i> 361 F.3d 62, 76 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that, for Title VII claims, comparative evidence must \"show[ ] that others similarly situated ... in all relevant respects were treated differently\" than the individual alleging discrimination) (quoting <i>Conward v. Cambridge Sc. Comm.,</i> 171 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir.1999)). Ortiz claimed ten other employees were accused of absence from the workplace without authorization but that none were disciplined. She failed, however, to identify them or provide other information necessary to compare her situation to theirs, including their party membership. <i>See Kauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 841 F.2d 1169, 1172 n. 5 (1st Cir.1988). Without this information, no inference of discriminatory motive can be drawn. In addition, Ortiz was charged not just with being absent from the workplace, but also with writing a false travel order. She presented no evidence disputing this charge. Nor did she provide evidence that any other employee was similarly accused but was treated more leniently. The summary judgment record is thus insufficient to support the inference that Ortiz was placed in the disciplinary hearing because of her political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz has failed to establish that she was subjected to an unreasonably inferior work environment or that the disciplinary proceeding against her was motivated by political animus.

She also claimed that political discrimination led to a denial of a promotion and being subjected to unwarranted discipline.

Ortiz is a career employee in the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture's Market Inspection Office, where she holds the position of Agronomist IV. In that office, agronomists are specialists in agriculture, specifically land and cattle sciences. Ortiz began working at the Market Inspection Office as an Agronomist I in 1993, became a career employee there in 1994, and was promoted to the position of Agronomist IV in 1997. Ortiz is an active member of Puerto Rico's New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"). In 1998, she left her Agronomist IV position to hold various trust positions for the NPP, which was in power at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2000, Sila Maria Calderon, a Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") candidate, was elected Governor of Puerto Rico. Ortiz subsequently resigned from her trust position and was reinstated to her career position as Agronomist IV in January 2001. The alleged discrimination began immediately after she was reinstated. Defendants are all members of the PDP and work either directly in the Market Inspection Office or at the Department of Agriculture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after her reinstatement as an agronomist, Ortiz received a letter informing her that she would be required to prepare statistical reports for the whole office. She wrote three letters to defendant Toledo (the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture) to complain about the assignment, arguing that the report writing would force her to perform the functions of a data entry clerk. Soon thereafter, some of the report writing was redistributed to other agronomists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the same time period, Ortiz was also told that she would do field activities only once a week while other agronomists had daily field responsibilities. In addition, her decisions were undercut by lower-ranking office members. And while Ortiz oversaw certain inspectors, she did not supervise other agronomists. This responsibility was given to lower-ranking employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after Ortiz began work in 2001, another agronomist, Julia Santa, was reclassified from Agronomist III to Agronomist Supervisor. When an additional supervisory position became available, Ortiz applied but another individual was selected. According to Ortiz, between seven and nine PDP-affiliated agronomists were reclassified to higher positions when the PDP took power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2002, disciplinary action was taken against Ortiz for leaving the workplace without authorization and for writing a false travel order. Ortiz has averred that she left the workplace to participate in official charitable activities, and she claimed that the disciplinary action was in contravention of agency regulations and customary practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment on the political discrimination claims. The district court awarded summary judgment on two grounds. First, the court found that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the deprivations suffered by Ortiz were severe enough to establish an \"unreasonably inferior\" work environment. Second, the court decided that Ortiz did not provide sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory animus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of summary judgment <i>de novo. See Figueroa-Serrano,</i> 221 F.3d at 4. To succeed on her work environment claim, Ortiz has to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that she was subjected to an unreasonably inferior environment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1217-20. If that burden is met, Ortiz has to show that her political affiliation was a substantial factor in the establishment of the unreasonably inferior work environment. <i>See id.</i> at 1218-20. If she makes this prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the defendants to show that they would have acted in the same way regardless of Ortiz's political affiliation. <i>See Mount Healthy Sch.

To establish her claim, Ortiz must identify evidence from which a factfinder could conclude that her job is \"unreasonably inferior to the norm for the position.\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1220. To determine whether an environment is unreasonably inferior, a factfinder should \"canvass the specific ways in which the plaintiff's job has changed.\" <i>Id.; see also Rivera-Ruiz v. Gonzalez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597804\"><a href=\"/opinion/597804/damaris-rivera-ruiz-v-leonardo-gonzalez-rivera-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 335 (1st Cir.1993). Ortiz argues that she was forced to endure an unreasonably inferior work environment because she lost certain benefits (including a parking space and personal telephone); was assigned tasks unsuitable for an Agronomist IV; and received less favorable treatment than other employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz's evidence of mistreatment is insufficient to meet the demanding requirement for an unreasonably inferior work environment claim. First, in this situation a parking space and a personal telephone are perquisites. Of the twenty employees at the Market Inspection Office, four had parking spots, and three had phones on their desks. Ortiz's job description says nothing to indicate that she had a right to them or a need for them. The deprivation of such perquisites ordinarily does not support an inference of an \"unreasonably inferior\" work environment. <i>See Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1219 (\"An employee who has lost merely the `perks' of his position &#8212; for example, the best office or secretary in the agency, unlimited telephone access or unusually minimal oversight &#8212; would not meet the `unreasonably inferior' standard.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is no evidence of substantially changed working conditions.
