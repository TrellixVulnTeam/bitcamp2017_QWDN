McCallum, Jr., Assistant Attorney General,\nCivil Division, and Terri J. Scadron, Senior Litigation Counsel,\nOffice of Immigration, Department of Justice, were on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n\n                            December 20, 2002\n\f             Per Curiam.    This petition for review challenges a Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA) order. The challenged order dismissed\n\nan appeal from an immigration judge's denial of a motion to reopen\n\ndeportation proceedings.       Petitioner Donatilo Cabrera-Alvarado, a\n\ncitizen of El Salvador, entered the United States unlawfully in\n\nlate 1987 and was ordered deported on June 6, 1988.        Petitioner did\n\nnot comply with the deportation order.        Instead, he moved to the\n\nBoston area, where he resided for the next decade.\n\n             On September 11, 1998, petitioner moved to reopen his\n\ndeportation proceedings.       In his motion, petitioner stated that he\n\nintended to apply for suspension of deportation under section 203\n\nof the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA),\n\nPub. L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2193, 2196, amended by Pub. L. No.\n\n105-139, 111 Stat. 2644.        This statutory provision restored, to\n\ncertain classes of aliens for a period of time, a right to apply\n\nfor suspension of deportation that had been eliminated by the\n\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996\n\n(IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546.         See generally\n\nAppiah v. INS, 202 F.3d 704, 707-10 (4th Cir. 2000).           A related\n\nregulation established November 18, 1999 as the deadline for filing\n\nwith   the    Immigration    Court   the   underlying   application   for\n\nsuspension of deportation.       See 8 C.F.R. § 3.43(c).\n\n             Petitioner did not file an application for suspension of\n\ndeportation with the Immigration Court on or before November 18,\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f1999. Instead, he appears to have mailed his application to an INS\n\nservice center in St. Albans, Vermont on or around November 12,\n\n1999.     There is some evidence indicating that the St. Albans\n\nservice center may have received the application as early as\n\nNovember    15,   1999.      On    December    14,    1999,      the   center   sent\n\npetitioner notice that it had received his application.                     But on\n\nApril 24, 2000, an immigration judge denied petitioner’s motion to\n\nreopen    because     petitioner    \"has    not   filed    an     application    for\n\nrelief.\"\n\n             Petitioner filed a pro se appeal to the BIA challenging\n\nthe     immigration     judge’s    finding     that   he    had    not   filed    an\n\napplication for suspension of deportation.                    In his BIA brief,\n\npetitioner stated that, in fact, he had filed such an application\n\nwith the St. Albans service center \"[o]n or about November 29,\n\n1999.\" Petitioner also asserted that he \"was never made aware that\n\nsaid application for relief was to be filed with the Immigration\n\nCourt.\"     In a decision dated January 24, 2002, the BIA dismissed\n\npetitioner’s appeal for failure to comply with the procedural\n\nrequirements of the NACARA.            In so doing, the BIA explicitly noted\n\npetitioner had admitted that he did not file his application with\n\nthe St. Albans service center until November 29, 1999, which was\n\nseveral days after the regulatory deadline.\n\n             In   his    brief    to    this   court,      the    now-represented\n\npetitioner argues that, because the St. Albans service center\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\factually received the application for suspension of deportation on\n\nNovember 15, 1999, the application should receive consideration on\n\nthe merits.    As petitioner concedes, we must uphold the BIA’s\n\ndecision unless the Board abused its discretion.       See INS v.\n\nDoherty, 502 U.S. 314, 323 (1992).      Two   independent reasons\n\nsupport our conclusion that no abuse of discretion occurred here.\n\nFirst, petitioner’s linchpin assertion that he in fact met the\n\nNovember 18, 1999, deadline for filing his application directly\n\ncontradicts his statement to the BIA that he filed his application\n\nwith the St. Albans service center on November 29, 1999.   See Sousa\n\nv. INS, 226 F.3d 28, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2000) (declining to decide\n\nwhether we might address a meritorious claim not first presented to\n\nthe BIA but making clear that only exceptional circumstances, if\n\nany, warrant an award of relief on a basis not first aired at the\n\nadministrative level).   Second, petitioner has not developed any\n\nargument at all that mailing his application to the St. Albans\n\nservice center was adequate to satisfy his regulatory obligation to\n\nfile the application with the Immigration Court.    See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n3.43(c).\n\n           Petition dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
