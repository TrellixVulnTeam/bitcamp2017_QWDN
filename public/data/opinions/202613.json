Fidencio Jimenez petitions for review of a\n\ndecision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the\n\nImmigration Judge's (IJ's) decision finding Jimenez removable as an\n\naggravated    felon     and    denying    his   applications   for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (CAT).       Under the REAL ID Act this Court has jurisdiction\n\nto review only issues of law and constitutional issues.\n\n          Petitioner contends that the IJ erred in determining that\n\nhis predicate federal conviction for money laundering, in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1956 constituted an aggravated felony under the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).1               Such a\n\ndetermination \"presents a pure question of law and, accordingly,\n\nengenders de novo review.\" Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45, 52 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n          The IJ relied upon Count One of the Information, to which\n\npetitioner    pled    guilty.      This   count   stated   that   the    money\n\nlaundering involved at least $15,000.           The IJ also noted that the\n\nsentencing judge ordered petitioner to forfeit $15,000.              Reliance\n\nupon the Information and the forfeiture order (included as part of\n\nthe judgment) was permissible.           \"These documents are part of the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       \"Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of\nthe IJ, we review the decision of the IJ.\" Mihaylov v. Ashcroft,\n379 F.3d 15, 18 n.3 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\frecord of conviction and, accordingly, . . . the BIA's consultation\n\nof them in aggravated felony cases is proper.\" Id. at 59.2\n\n           The government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction\n\nto review Jimenez's claims that the IJ erred in determining that he\n\nwas ineligible for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT.\n\n\"Section   242(a)(2)(C)      (codified         at   8   U.S.C.   §   1252(a)(2)(C))\n\nprovides in relevant part that 'no court shall have jurisdiction to\n\nreview any final order of removal against an alien who is removable\n\nby reason of having committed a criminal offense covered' by the\n\nstatutory provision making aggravated felons removable.\" Sousa v.\n\nINS, 226 F.3d 28, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2000).                     An exception to the\n\njurisdictional bar was added by the REAL ID Act of 2005, permitting\n\nthis court to review \"constitutional claims or questions of law.\"\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).           However, \"[u]nder the terms of this\n\nlimited      jurisdictional      grant,         'discretionary         or   factual\n\ndeterminations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the\n\ncourt of appeals.'\" Mehilli v. Gonzales, 433 F.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n           Petitioner argues that the IJ erred in determining that\n\nhe had failed to show that it was likely that petitioner would be\n\npersecuted    because   of    any   of    the       five   protected   grounds,   or\n\n\n     2\n       Petitioner's argument that the IJ failed to provide an\nadequate explanation for his removability determination is\nmeritless. The IJ clearly explained the basis for his ruling that\nJimenez was removable as an aggravated felon under 8 U.S.C. §\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n\n                                         -3-\n\ftortured   by    or   with    the   acquiescence         of   a    public   official.\n\nEssentially, his argument is that the IJ's determinations were\n\n\"against the weight of the evidence.\" Such a claim does not fall\n\nwithin the exception created by the REAL ID Act for constitutional\n\nclaims   or     questions     of    law.         Therefore,       this   court    lacks\n\njurisdiction over petitioner's claims that the IJ erred in denying\n\nwithholding of removal or relief under the CAT.3\n\n           The     petition     for    review       is   denied      insofar     as   it\n\nchallenges the order of removal on the ground that Jimenez is not\n\nan aggravated felon; and it is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction\n\nwith respect to the remaining claims.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Even if    we had jurisdiction to review those claims, we would\nnot find that    petitioner's evidence would compel a factfinder to\nconclude that    the requested relief was warranted.
