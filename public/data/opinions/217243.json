David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f     SOUTER, Associate Justice.            When the plaintiff-appellant,\n\nJesus   Ramos,    was   committed   to   the   Worcester     County   House     of\n\nCorrection in Massachusetts as a pre-trial detainee on April 4,\n\n2003, he was addicted to heroin, from which he was forced to\n\nabstain.    In anticipation of his physical reaction he was given\n\nmedication at the direction of the defendant-appellee, Dr. Thomas\n\nPatnaude,   the    institution’s    medical    director,     according     to    a\n\nprotocol    designed     to   mitigate   the    agony   of    withdrawal      and\n\nprescribed by the doctor in thousands of previous cases.                      The\n\ntreatment spanned a three-day period and was repeated twice over\n\nthe nine days after commitment, during which Ramos was taken on two\n\noccasions to the nearest hospital for outpatient and inpatient care\n\nthat included intravenous fluid for dehydration and exploratory\n\nchest surgery.      All told, the following distressing and in some\n\ninstances threatening conditions were noted: “extreme dehydration,\n\nacute renal failure, advanced respiratory distress, subcutaneous\n\nemphysema, mediastinal emphysema, presumed esophageal perforation,\n\nmalnourishment, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and pneumothorax\n\nof the right chest and total collapse of the right lung.”             Ramos v.\n\nFlynn, No. 06-10645-GAO, 2009 WL 2207191, at *1 (D. Mass. July 22,\n\n2009). These clinical notations do not, however, fully capture the\n\nreality of Ramos’s account of the course of his withdrawal, being\n\nleft to lie, as he alleged, in the foul products of chronic\n\nincontinence and vomiting, on occasion unprotected from the chill\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fof cold weather outside as windows were opened to mitigate the\n\nresulting stench.\n\n     In the aftermath of the allegedly horrific experience, Ramos\n\nbrought suits in state and federal courts, including the present\n\naction, which was originally against seventeen defendants.                     Under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 he claimed a violation of the Due Process Clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment for reckless indifference to his\n\nmedical needs and, as to some defendants, for failure to train\n\ninstitutional personnel to respond to inmates’ medical needs.                       He\n\nalso invoked the federal court’s supplemental jurisdiction by\n\nadding    state   law    tort   claims      for    intentional      infliction     of\n\nemotional distress.       The trial court granted summary judgment to\n\nthe present appellees on all claims, on various procedural and\n\nsubstantive    grounds.         It   held    for    them    on     procedure   after\n\nconcluding that Ramos had failed to avail himself of the House of\n\nCorrection’s grievance procedure for raising his complaints and\n\nshould accordingly be barred from federal litigation under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1997e(a), a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act\n\nof 1995 requiring exhaustion of available administrative remedies\n\nbefore resorting to the federal courts, and the court drew a\n\ncomparable conclusion as to the tort claims under state law.                       The\n\ncourt nonetheless considered the merits and held that facts not\n\nsubject   to   genuine    dispute     and    disputed      facts    that   might    be\n\nresolved in Ramos’s favor failed to show any action or failure to\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fact   going   beyond   negligence    or    malpractice     to   the    point   of\n\ndeliberate indifference to substantial risk of serious harm to\n\nhealth, which would be necessary in order to state a § 1983 claim\n\nunder the Due Process Clause; it drew a comparable                    conclusion\n\nabout the state law tort claims, and entered summary judgment for\n\nthe appellees. On de novo review, Sullivan v. City of Springfield,\n\n561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2009), we affirm.\n\n       Ramos brought this appeal only as to five of the original\n\ndefendants. Subsequently, the number dropped to four, upon removal\n\nof    the   former   Sheriff   of   Worcester    County,    John      Flynn,   by\n\nagreement, and then down to two, with the dismissal of Correctional\n\nOfficers Hill and Larame.      The only remaining appellees from among\n\nthe original defendants are Dr. Patnaude and Worcester Internal\n\nMedicine, Inc.\n\n                                      I\n\n       Further simplification is in order, beginning with the claim\n\nagainst Worcester Internal Medicine, which is totally devoid of\n\nevidentiary support in the record.              The practice group’s only\n\nconnection with the acts complained of seems to be Dr. Patnaude’s\n\nmembership in it, and that of another physician who sometimes\n\ncovered for Dr. Patnaude but was not shown to have had any part in\n\nthe events of this case.       Since the group had no contract with the\n\nHouse of Correction, and in any case because respondeat superior is\n\nnot a channel of derivative liability in a § 1983 action, Whitfield\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fv. Melendez-Rivera, 431 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2005), the trial judge\n\ncould not understand why the medical practice group had been sued,\n\nand neither can we.\n\n     The issues, too, are subject to reduction, beginning with one\n\nalternative    ground     for     judgment,     the   failure      to    exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies, which is the subject of a substantial\n\nportion of the briefing before us.             So far as it concerns the\n\nfederal claim, satisfaction of the exhaustion requirement of §\n\n1997e(a) turns on whether prisoners at the House of Correction were\n\non notice that complaints about denial of access to medical care\n\nwere subject to the administrative grievance procedure (as distinct\n\nfrom complaints about the merit of medical care actually rendered,\n\nwhich clearly are not), and on whether Ramos’s claims here are\n\nabout denial of access rather than the quality of treatment. Ramos\n\nargues, with color of support, that no such grievance opportunity\n\nwas made known, and thus aims at reversing both the adverse ruling\n\non exhaustion, and (if he succeeds on that) at vacating the equally\n\nadverse rulings on the merits, which he says were beyond the\n\ndistrict court’s jurisdiction once it held Ramos had failed to\n\nexhaust.   The appellees counter that failure to exhaust was the\n\ncorrect conclusion, but that the merits ruling was independently\n\nwithin   the   trial    court’s    power,     since   exhaustion    is    not   a\n\njurisdictional requirement.\n\n     We take a third position, for economy of disposition, in\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fchoosing to bypass the exhaustion issue just because it is not\n\njurisdictional, and because the merits decision is sound, as we\n\nwill explain.    The Supreme Court made it plain in Woodford v. Ngo,\n\n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006), that exhaustion under § 1997e(a) is not a\n\njurisdictional condition, and has held it to be an affirmative\n\ndefense, Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 212 (2007).          Ramos tries to\n\ndeflect Ngo by pointing out, perplexingly, that the Court there was\n\nspeaking only of what it called “proper” exhaustion. But the Court\n\nused that adjective simply to describe the action that would\n\nqualify    as   exhaustion,    to   distinguish     it   from    resort   to\n\nadministrative process after the time allowed: a claim barred by\n\ntime is not “exhausted” by raising it late.           See Ngo 548 U.S. at\n\n90-93.    So, even on the assumption that Ramos failed to exhaust a\n\nHouse of Correction’s grievance procedure that had been made known\n\nto him, the district court had, and this court has, jurisdiction to\n\nreach the merits.         Our choice to consider the merits without\n\nworking   through   the    exhaustion     issue   eliminates    the   further\n\nassignment of error that before acting on the summary judgment\n\nmotions the district court unreasonably denied Ramos further time\n\n(requested under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)) to depose a corrections\n\nofficer, Sgt. Germano, on the scope of the subject matter of\n\npossible administrative grievance.\n\n     Two other issues may be resolved by brief discussion, these on\n\ntheir merits.    Ramos sought to show that his state tort claims for\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\femotional distress did not suffer from failure to satisfy a state\n\nexhaustion requirement, for he moved for certification of the issue\n\nto the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts as allowed by Mass.\n\nS.J.C. R. 1:03.     His argument that it was error to deny that motion\n\nis answered by the fact that his brief in this court fails to\n\naddress    the   merits    of   the   tort   claims,   and   thus     waives     any\n\nobjection to the trial court’s conclusion that the claims were\n\nwanting in evidentiary support on which liability of any defendant\n\ncould be based.       See Lumataw v. Holder, 582 F.3d 78, 80 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 2009). Because the merits issue is waived, the related matter\n\nof certification is inconsequential.\n\n     Waiver by inattention also disposes of any claims against Dr.\n\nPatnaude for failure to train or supervise subordinate personnel.\n\nSee id.\n\n                                        II\n\n     What remains is the § 1983 claim against Dr. Patnaude for a\n\nfailure    to    provide   medical    care   that    amounted    to    deliberate\n\nindifference to substantial risk of serious harm to Ramos as he\n\nsuffered withdrawal when deprived of heroin.                    See Burrell v.\n\nHampshire County, 307 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002) (applying the\n\nEighth    Amendment    deliberate     indifference     standard       to   the   due\n\nprocess claim of a pre-trial detainee).             There is no question that\n\nDr. Patnaude owed a duty to Ramos when acting on behalf of the\n\nHouse of Correction under his contract to serve as its medical\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fdirector.     But the district court understood the record to show\n\nonly arguable negligence, with no reasonable possibility of a jury\n\nfinding that the doctor was deliberately indifferent, that is, that\n\nhe actually understood that such a substantial risk existed and was\n\nactually     indifferent   to   it   in    failing   to   take   appropriate\n\nmitigating action. See Farmer v. Brennan, 551 U.S. 825, 837 (1994)\n\n(§ 1983 liability attaches only when the “official knows of and\n\ndisregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety”); Feeney\n\nv. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., 834 F.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (in cases alleging deliberate indifference to medical risk,\n\n“[t]he care provided must have been ‘so inadequate as to shock the\n\nconscience’”) (quoting Torraco v. Maloney, 923 F.2d 231, 234 (1st\n\nCir. 1991)). Dr. Patnaude points to the following undisputed facts\n\nas supporting that judgment and barring any reasonable possibility\n\nof inferring the culpable state of mind required for a due process\n\nviolation.\n\n     He    treated   Ramos’s    withdrawal     reaction    by    following   a\n\npharmaceutical protocol he had applied in thousands of instances of\n\ndrug withdrawal at the House of Correction with overwhelming\n\nsuccess over a period of 30 years, a procedure that Ramos’s own\n\nexpert believed to be generally appropriate. During the time Ramos\n\nwas held at the House of Correction, Dr. Patnaude placed him on so-\n\ncalled medical watch, calling for observation on at least 25\n\nseparate occasions by nursing personnel, and the doctor himself\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fconducted at least one examination.        Despite his skepticism that\n\nRamos’s continuing complaints were genuine, he twice ordered the\n\nnursing staff to repeat application of the three-day drug treatment\n\nprotocol.    He ordered a blood analysis and on two successive days\n\nresponded to staff reports by ordering Ramos to be taken to the\n\nemergency room of St. Vincent’s Hospital for examination and\n\ntreatment.    No factfinder, Dr. Patnaude argues, could reasonably\n\nconclude he had been deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk\n\nof serious harm to Ramos with these undisputed facts in the record.\n\n     Ramos attacks that conclusion on several grounds.            First,\n\nthere are claims that the undisputed record shows no specific\n\norders from the doctor requiring prompt action, as in drawing the\n\nblood sample (it was not done until the next day) and obtaining\n\ntest results (which took several days), in reinstituting the\n\ntreatment protocol and even in requiring speedy arrival of an\n\nambulance to take Ramos to the hospital the second time.        Ramos is\n\nquite right that a mere formality of some ostensible medical\n\ntreatment    is   no   conclusive    bar   to   finding   constitutional\n\nindifference.     See Hathaway v. Coughlin, 37 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir.\n\n1994); Warran v. Fanning, 950 F.2d 1370, 1373 (8th Cir. 1991); Hunt\n\nv. Uphoff, 199 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 1999).      He is right again\n\nthat a jury could conclude that adequate medical care would have\n\nshown more promptitude, as indeed two experts stated in describing\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fthe level of treatment as inadequate under professional norms.1\n\nBut   insufficient       zeal    for    efficiency    cannot    be    equated    with\n\ndeliberate indifference, however much it may amount to negligence.\n\nSee Acosta v. U.S. Marshals Service, 445 F.3d 509, 514 (1st Cir.\n\n2006)      (§   1983   liability        attaches    “only   for      constitutional\n\nviolations . . . and not for mere negligence”).\n\n       Ramos next argues that the undisputed facts of treatment could\n\nnot reasonably be taken as evidence barring a finding of deliberate\n\nindifference, for the very reason that all of Dr. Patnaude’s\n\ndecisions made after he examined Ramos at the conclusion of the\n\nfirst 3-day medication sequence were tainted by the belief that\n\nRamos was faking complaints about the continuing severity of his\n\nreaction. But on its face, this belief is flatly inconsistent with\n\nthe required finding of subjective deliberate indifference to a\n\nsubstantial risk, and there is nothing in the record that would\n\nsuggest the doctor was saying “fake” as a smokescreen for a\n\ndecision to let Ramos suffer whatever chance might bring his way.\n\nTo    be   sure,   the    undisputed      facts    indicate    that      the   doctor\n\nunderestimated         the      risk;    Ramos     apparently        presented    an\n\nunrepresentative         case.          But     misjudgment,      even    negligent\n\n\n       1\n      One expert also concluded that Dr. Patnaude’s conduct amounted\nto deliberate indifference. But this was a conclusion of mixed\nfact and law, not a medical proposition that could qualify as fact\nin applying the summary judgement evidentiary test.        There is\nmoreover, no foundation to find that the expert had been instructed\non the elements of the deliberate indifference test, including its\nsubjective component.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fmisjudgment, is not deliberate indifference.\n\n     Finally, there is a more diffuse point that Ramos insists upon\n\nthroughout his presentation to us: he was forced to subsist in\n\npervasive filth during much or all of his stay at the House of\n\nCorrection.      One cannot read the descriptions he gives without\n\nfeeling revulsion.          But we see no point in parsing through Ramos’s\n\naccounts of the conditions to determine which may be supported by\n\nevidence of fact beyond genuine dispute or subject to disputed\n\nclaims that might be resolved in Ramos’s favor, for we see no basis\n\nto treat them as material to the claim against Dr. Patnaude, who is\n\nsued for deliberate indifference to substantial medical risk of\n\nserious harm, not for inhumane sanitation in running the House of\n\nCorrection.      Which is not to deny that there is a point at which\n\nmedical treatment requires attention to prison housing, but there\n\nis no claim of supervisory liability now in the case, and Ramos’s\n\nresponses   to    the   summary       judgment   motion     raise   no   basis   for\n\nattributing      to   the    doctor    such    subjective    knowledge    of     cell\n\nconditions as might indicate deliberate indifference on his part in\n\ntaking no steps to require improvement.             One cannot infer anything\n\nbeyond the undisputed record indication that any detoxification of\n\na substantial drug user will involve vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n     We read the record just as the district court did.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f",

The treatment spanned a three-day period and was repeated twice over the nine days after commitment, during which Ramos was taken on two occasions to the nearest hospital for outpatient and inpatient care that included intravenous fluid for dehydration and exploratory chest surgery. All told, the following distressing and in some instances threatening conditions were noted: \"extreme dehydration, acute renal failure, advanced respiratory distress, subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal emphysema, presumed esophageal perforation, malnourishment, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and pneumothorax of the right chest and total collapse of the right lung.\" <i>Ramos v.

He also invoked the federal court's supplemental jurisdiction by adding state law tort claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court granted summary judgment to the present appellees on all claims, on various procedural and substantive grounds. It held for them on procedure after concluding that Ramos had failed to avail himself of the House of Correction's grievance procedure for raising his complaints and should accordingly be barred from federal litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 requiring exhaustion of available administrative remedies before resorting to the federal courts, and the court drew a comparable conclusion as to the tort claims under state law.

Melendez-Rivera,</i> 431 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir.2005), the trial judge could not understand why the medical practice group had been sued, and neither can we.</p>\n<p>The issues, too, are subject to reduction, beginning with one alternative ground for judgment, the failure to exhaust administrative remedies, which is the subject of a substantial portion of the briefing before us. So far as it concerns the federal claim, satisfaction of the exhaustion requirement of § 1997e(a) turns on whether prisoners at the House of Correction were on notice that complaints about denial of access to medical care were subject to the administrative grievance procedure (as distinct from complaints about the merit of medical care actually rendered, which clearly are not), and on whether Ramos's claims here are about denial of access rather than the quality of treatment. Ramos argues, with color of support, that no such grievance opportunity was made known, and thus aims at reversing both the adverse ruling on exhaustion, and (if he succeeds on that) at vacating the equally adverse rulings on the merits, which he says were beyond the district court's jurisdiction once it held Ramos had failed to exhaust. The appellees counter that failure to exhaust was the correct conclusion, but that the merits ruling was independently within the trial court's power, since exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement.</p>\n<p>We take a third position, for economy of disposition, in choosing to bypass the exhaustion issue just because it is not jurisdictional, and because the merits decision is sound, as we will explain. The Supreme Court made it plain in <i>Woodford v. Ngo,</i> 548 U.S. 81, 101, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006), that exhaustion under § 1997e(a) is not a jurisdictional condition, and has held it to be an affirmative defense, <i>Jones v. Bock,</i> 549 U.S. 199, 212, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Ramos tries to deflect <i>Ngo</i> by pointing out, perplexingly, that the Court there was speaking only of what it called \"proper\" exhaustion. But the Court used that adjective simply to describe the action that would qualify as exhaustion, to distinguish it from resort to administrative process after the time allowed: a claim barred by time is not \"exhausted\" by raising it late. <i>See Ngo</i> 548 U.S. at 90-93, 126 S.Ct. 2378. So, even on the assumption that Ramos <span class=\"star-pagination\">*489</span> failed to exhaust a House of Correction's grievance procedure that had been made known to him, the district court had, and this court has, jurisdiction to reach the merits. Our choice to consider the merits without working through the exhaustion issue eliminates the further assignment of error that before acting on the summary judgment motions the district court unreasonably denied Ramos further time (requested under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f)) to depose a corrections officer, Sgt. Germano, on the scope of the subject matter of possible administrative grievance.</p>\n<p>Two other issues may be resolved by brief discussion, these on their merits. Ramos sought to show that his state tort claims for emotional distress did not suffer from failure to satisfy a state exhaustion requirement, for he moved for certification of the issue to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts as allowed by Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03. His argument that it was error to deny that motion is answered by the fact that his brief in this court fails to address the merits of the tort claims, and thus waives any objection to the trial court's conclusion that the claims were wanting in evidentiary support on which liability of any defendant could be based. <i>See </i><i>Lumataw v. Holder,</i> 582 F.3d 78, 80 n. 1 (1st Cir.2009). Because the merits issue is waived, the related matter of certification is inconsequential.</p>\n<p>Waiver by inattention also disposes of any claims against Dr. Patnaude for failure to train or supervise subordinate personnel. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>What remains is the § 1983 claim against Dr. Patnaude for a failure to provide medical care that amounted to deliberate indifference to substantial risk of serious harm to Ramos as he suffered withdrawal when deprived of heroin. <i>See </i><i>Burrell v. Hampshire County,</i> 307 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2002) (applying the Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference standard to the due process claim of a pre-trial detainee). There is no question that Dr. Patnaude owed a duty to Ramos when acting on behalf of the House of Correction under his contract to serve as its medical director. But the district court understood the record to show only arguable negligence, with no reasonable possibility of a jury finding that the doctor was deliberately indifferent, that is, that he actually understood that such a substantial risk existed and was actually indifferent to it in failing to take appropriate mitigating action. <i>See </i><i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (§ 1983 liability attaches only when the \"official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety\"); <i>Sires v. Berman,</i> 834 F.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1987) (in cases alleging deliberate indifference to medical risk, \"[t]he care provided must have been `so inadequate as to shock the conscience'\") (quoting <i>Torraco v. Maloney,</i> 923 F.2d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1991)). Dr. Patnaude points to the following undisputed facts as supporting that judgment and barring any reasonable possibility of inferring the culpable state of mind required for a due process violation.</p>\n<p>He treated Ramos's withdrawal reaction by following a pharmaceutical protocol he had applied in thousands of instances of drug withdrawal at the House of Correction with overwhelming success over a period of 30 years, a procedure that Ramos's own expert believed to be generally appropriate. During the time Ramos was held at the House of Correction, Dr. Patnaude placed him on so-called medical watch, calling for observation on at least 25 separate occasions by nursing personnel, and the doctor himself conducted at least one examination. Despite his skepticism that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*490</span> Ramos's continuing complaints were genuine, he twice ordered the nursing staff to repeat application of the three-day drug treatment protocol. He ordered a blood analysis and on two successive days responded to staff reports by ordering Ramos to be taken to the emergency room of St. Vincent's Hospital for examination and treatment. No factfinder, Dr. Patnaude argues, could reasonably conclude he had been deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm to Ramos with these undisputed facts in the record.</p>\n<p>Ramos attacks that conclusion on several grounds. First, there are claims that the undisputed record shows no specific orders from the doctor requiring prompt action, as in drawing the blood sample (it was not done until the next day) and obtaining test results (which took several days), in reinstituting the treatment protocol and even in requiring speedy arrival of an ambulance to take Ramos to the hospital the second time. Ramos is quite right that a mere formality of some ostensible medical treatment is no conclusive bar to finding constitutional indifference. <i>See </i><i>Hathaway v. Coughlin,</i> 37 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir. 1994); <i>Warren v. Fanning,</i> 950 F.2d 1370, 1373 (8th Cir.1991); <i>Hunt v. Uphoff,</i> 199 F.3d 1220, 1224 (10th Cir. 1999). He is right again that a jury could conclude that adequate medical care would have shown more promptitude, as indeed two experts stated in describing the level of treatment as inadequate under professional norms.<sup>[1]</sup> But insufficient zeal for efficiency cannot be equated with deliberate indifference, however much it may amount to negligence. <i>See </i><i>Acosta v. U.S. Marshals Service,</i> 445 F.3d 509, 514 (1st Cir.2006) (§ 1983 liability attaches \"only for constitutional violations . . . and not for mere negligence\").</p>\n<p>Ramos next argues that the undisputed facts of treatment could not reasonably be taken as evidence barring a finding of deliberate indifference, for the very reason that all of Dr. Patnaude's decisions made after he examined Ramos at the conclusion of the first 3-day medication sequence were tainted by the belief that Ramos was faking complaints about the continuing severity of his reaction. But on its face, this belief is flatly inconsistent with the required finding of subjective deliberate indifference to a substantial risk, and there is nothing in the record that would suggest the doctor was saying \"fake\" as a smokescreen for a decision to let Ramos suffer whatever chance might bring his way. To be sure, the undisputed facts indicate that the doctor underestimated the risk; Ramos apparently presented an unrepresentative case. But misjudgment, even negligent misjudgment, is not deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a more diffuse point that Ramos insists upon throughout his presentation to us: he was forced to subsist in pervasive filth during much or all of his stay at the House of Correction. One cannot read the descriptions he gives without feeling revulsion. But we see no point in parsing through Ramos's accounts of the conditions to determine which may be supported by evidence of fact beyond genuine dispute or subject to disputed claims that might be resolved in Ramos's favor, for we see no basis to treat them as material to the claim against Dr. Patnaude, who is sued for deliberate indifference to substantial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*491</span> medical risk of serious harm, not for inhumane sanitation in running the House of Correction. Which is not to deny that there is a point at which medical treatment requires attention to prison housing, but there is no claim of supervisory liability now in the case, and Ramos's responses to the summary judgment motion raise no basis for attributing to the doctor such subjective knowledge of cell conditions as might indicate deliberate indifference on his part in taking no steps to require improvement. One cannot infer anything beyond the undisputed record indication that any detoxification of a substantial drug user will involve vomiting and diarrhea.</p>\n<p>We read the record just as the district court did.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon.

In anticipation of his physical reaction he was given medication at the direction of the defendant-appellee, Dr. Thomas Patnaude, the institution's medical director, according to a protocol designed to mitigate the agony of withdrawal and prescribed by the doctor in thousands of previous cases. The treatment spanned a three-day period and was repeated twice over the nine days after commitment, during which Ramos was taken on two occasions to the nearest hospital for outpatient and inpatient care that included intravenous fluid for dehydration and exploratory chest surgery. All told, the following distressing and in some instances threatening conditions were noted: \"extreme dehydration, acute renal failure, advanced respiratory distress, subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal emphysema, presumed esophageal perforation, malnourishment, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and pneumothorax of the right chest and total collapse of the right lung.\" <i>Ramos v. Flynn,</i> No. 06-10645-GAO, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2207191</span></span>, at *1 (D.Mass. July 22, 2009). These clinical notations do not, however, fully capture the reality of Ramos's account of the course of his withdrawal, being left to lie, as he alleged, in the foul products of chronic incontinence and vomiting, on occasion unprotected from the chill of cold weather outside as windows were opened to mitigate the resulting stench.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the allegedly horrific experience, Ramos brought suits in state and federal courts, including the present action, which was originally against seventeen defendants. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 he claimed a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for reckless indifference to his medical needs and, as to some defendants, for failure to train institutional personnel to respond to inmates' medical needs. He also invoked the federal court's supplemental jurisdiction by adding state law tort claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court granted summary judgment to the present appellees on all claims, on various procedural and substantive grounds. It held for them on procedure after concluding that Ramos had failed to avail himself of the House of Correction's grievance procedure for raising his complaints and should accordingly be barred from federal litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 requiring exhaustion of available administrative remedies before resorting to the federal courts, and the court drew a comparable conclusion as to the tort claims under state law. The court nonetheless considered the merits and held that facts not subject to genuine dispute and disputed facts that might be resolved in Ramos's favor failed to show any action or failure to act going beyond negligence or malpractice to the point of deliberate indifference to substantial risk <span class=\"star-pagination\">*488</span> of serious harm to health, which would be necessary in order to state a § 1983 claim under the Due Process Clause; it drew a comparable conclusion about the state law tort claims, and entered summary judgment for the appellees. On de novo review, <i>Sullivan v. City of Springfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203736\"><a href=\"/opinion/203736/sullivan-v-city-of-springfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2009), we affirm.</p>\n<p>Ramos brought this appeal only as to five of the original defendants. Subsequently, the number dropped to four, upon removal of the former Sheriff of Worcester County, John Flynn, by agreement, and then down to two, with the dismissal of Correctional Officers Hill and Larame. The only remaining appellees from among the original defendants are Dr. Patnaude and Worcester Internal Medicine, Inc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Further simplification is in order, beginning with the claim against Worcester Internal Medicine, which is totally devoid of evidentiary support in the record.
