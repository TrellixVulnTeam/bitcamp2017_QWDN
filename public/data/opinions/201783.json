George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                   Torruella, Lynch and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Marvin H. Glazier, with whom Vafiades, Brountas & Kominsky,\nwere on brief, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney,\nAppellate Chief, with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney,\nwas on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 25, 2005\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.                Defendant-appellant Gerardo\n\nMartín   Meléndez-Torres    appeals          his     conviction     and   sentence,\n\nfollowing a bench trial, for re-entering the United States after\n\ndeportation due to a manslaughter conviction, in violation of 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1326(a).        Specifically, Meléndez challenges (1) the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence for his conviction, (2) the district\n\ncourt's refusal to grant a downward departure from the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines based on his \"cultural assimilation\" into American\n\nsociety, and (3) the absence of a \"fast track\" program in the\n\nDistrict of Maine to process immigration cases.                     After careful\n\nreview, we affirm.\n\n                                         I\n\n           On August 18, 1998, Meléndez -- a Mexican citizen who had\n\nlived in the United States from the age of three and who claims a\n\nMaine residency -- was ordered deported due to a 1997 manslaughter\n\nconviction in Florida. He was flown to Laredo, Texas to consummate\n\nthe deportation process on January 11, 2001, but was subsequently\n\nfound in Bucksport, Maine more than a year later, on May 30, 2002.\n\n           On June 12, 2003, Meléndez submitted to a bench trial,\n\nhaving   waived   his   right   to   a       jury    trial,   for   the   one-count\n\nindictment of re-entering the United States after being deported\n\nsubsequent to an aggravated felony.                 The parties stipulated, and\n\nthe court accepted, that Meléndez was an \"alien\" under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326(a)(2), that he was convicted of manslaughter in Florida,\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthat he was on board a Justice Prisoner Alien Transportation System\n\n(JPATS) flight that arrived in Laredo, Texas on January 11, 2001,\n\nand that he was found in Bucksport, Maine on May 30, 2002.\n\n           During the trial, John Remsen, a special agent of the\n\nBureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified that\n\nMeléndez's \"A file\" -- which records every contact an alien has\n\nwith the immigration service -- included a Form I-205 warrant of\n\nremoval and deportation reflecting Meléndez's deportation.                The\n\nfile also contained a Form I-170, a deportation case checklist,\n\nshowing that a Form I-294 -- which gives the reasons for the\n\ndeportation and the number of years an alien must wait before\n\nreturning to the country legally -- had been given to Meléndez,\n\nalthough such form could not found.          Remsen also testified that\n\nMeléndez never applied for, nor received, permission to re-enter\n\nthe United States.\n\n           The    next   testimony    came   from     Frances    González,   a\n\nDetention Enforcement Officer with the Department of Homeland\n\nSecurity, Immigration Customs Enforcement (formerly the Immigration\n\nand Naturalization Service).          González, who had worked at the\n\nLaredo, Texas port of entry for eight years and was on duty on\n\nJanuary   11,    2001,   recounted   the   agency's    routine    deportation\n\nprocedures.      When a JPATS plane arrives, the prisoners -- who\n\nnumber 50 to 120 per day -- are individually released from leg\n\nirons, handcuffs, and belly chains and are boarded into government\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fbuses or vans under the supervision of United States Marshals and\n\nImmigration      and   Customs    officers.       The    prisoners   are   then\n\ntransported to a secure area with barriers on all sides, placed\n\ninto groups of five, and visually observed as they cross the border\n\non foot.   Afterward, the officers complete individual I-205 forms,\n\nwhich record the name of the transporting officer, the means of\n\narrival,   the    port,   date,   and    manner   of    removal,   the   alien's\n\nphotograph and right index fingerprint, and the signature of the\n\nofficer who witnessed the alien's departure.               González testified\n\nthat she had signed Meléndez's I-205 form on January 11, 2001, and\n\nthat although she could not remember specific events of that day,\n\nshe \"would not sign a form if [she] was not sure that person did\n\nexit the United States.\"         Tr. 76.\n\n           On June 30, 2004, Meléndez was found guilty and sentenced\n\nto 70 months' imprisonment1 and three years' supervised release.\n\nIn so holding, the court rejected Meléndez's argument that he never\n\nleft the United States, because although no witness testified to\n\nactually seeing him leave the country, \"the practice of signing\n\n[the relevant paperwork] after seeing all of the people [who are\n\nbeing deported] go across without specifically looking for one is\n\n\n1\n   The court calculated Meléndez's total adjusted offense level to\nbe 24 -- with a base offense level of 8 for violation of 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1326(a), see U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(a), plus 16 levels for a prior\ndeportation after a criminal conviction on an aggravated felony,\nsee U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Combined with Meléndez's Criminal\nHistory Category of III, the applicable Guideline range was 63 to\n78 months.\n\n                                        -4-\n\fsufficient to document that they saw this individual being deported\n\nacross the border.\"      Tr. 91.        The court also denied Meléndez's\n\nmotion for a downward departure based on \"cultural assimilation,\"\n\nstating     that   Meléndez's    case        is    \"not   extraordinary,\"   that\n\nMeléndez's \"assimilation . . . in the criminal justice system\n\nperhaps     weighs   against     this        request,\"     and   that    cultural\n\nassimilation is similar to \"family ties responsibility,\" which is\n\na discouraged factor.     S. Tr. 11-12.             Finally, the court rejected\n\nMeléndez's argument that        the absence of a \"Fast Track\" program in\n\nthe District of Maine forms a \"basis for a downward departure[,]\n\nconstitutional or otherwise.\"        Id.          This appeal follows.\n\n                                        II\n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Meléndez first argues that the evidence presented at\n\ntrial was insufficient to support a conviction for illegal re-entry\n\nafter deportation subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction, in\n\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a)(2)(b)(2) and § 1101(a)(43)(F).                We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nfollowing bench trials \"de novo, evaluating whether, after viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"               United States v. Grace, 367\n\nF.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citations\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fomitted). Moreover, \"we draw all reasonable evidentiary inferences\n\nin harmony with the verdict and resolve all issues of credibility\n\nin the light most favorable to the government.\"     Id.    Thus, and we\n\nnow emphasize, \"'[t]he evidence may be entirely circumstantial, and\n\nneed not exclude every hypothesis of innocence; that is, the\n\nfactfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the\n\nevidence.'\"   United States v. Scantleberry-Frank,        158 F.3d 612,\n\n616 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927\n\nF.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\n           In the instant case, the court -- to convict Meléndez of\n\nviolating 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a)(2) and (b)(2) -- must have necessarily\n\nfound that the Government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nMeléndez (1) was an alien, (2) whose deportation was subsequent to\n\na conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, and (3) that\n\nhe entered or attempted to enter or was later found in the United\n\nStates, (4) without the express consent of the Attorney General for\n\nsuch entry.   Scantleberry-Frank, 158 F.3d at 616   (citing 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1326).\n\n           Meléndez's sole sufficiency challenge is directed at the\n\nthird element: mainly, that the Government offered no conclusive\n\nproof that Meléndez actually left the country and was therefore not\n\n\"deported.\"   See United States v. Romo-Romo, 246 F.3d 1272, 1274\n\n(9th Cir. 2001) (holding that an alien cannot be said to have been\n\ndeported and to have re-entered when the alien never left the\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fcountry at all).        Specifically, Meléndez argues that González's\n\ninability to remember the specific events of January 11, 2001 --\n\nincluding the day of the week, the weather, her specific duties\n\nthat day, where she was positioned, and the actual number of\n\ndeportees, as well as her inability to recognize Meléndez and\n\nwhether    she     actually    saw    him   cross    the   border    --   renders\n\ninsufficient the Government's proof that Meléndez actually left the\n\ncountry.    The missing I-294 form also allegedly detracts from the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence regarding actual deportation.                      We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            To the contrary, we find that the evidence adduced at\n\ntrial     amply     supports    Meléndez's       deportation.       The    routine\n\nprocedures        recounted    --    including     the   significant      physical\n\nrestraints on the deportees, the close monitoring by U.S. Marshals\n\nand Immigration and Customs officers, the physical barriers to the\n\nport of entry, the close surveillance of deportees as they walk\n\nacross the border in groups of five,2 and the Form I-205 checklist\n\nindicating that the officer witnessed the deportee cross the border\n\n-- could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude, beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, that Meléndez was actually deported.                 See Grace,\n\n367 F.3d at 34.       The absence of direct evidence -- e.g., the lack\n\nof testimony of any individual who personally witnessed Meléndez\n\n\n2\n    González testified that the security for ensuring actual\ndeportation is so tight that no alien had tried to escape during\nher eight years at Laredo.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fdepart the United States, or of any photograph or videotape showing\n\nthe same -- is irrelevant.        As we have repeatedly emphasized,\n\n\"circumstantial evidence, if it meets all the other criteria of\n\nadmissibility, is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is\n\nentitled to be given whatever weight the [fact finder] deems it\n\nshould be given.\"     United States v. Gamache, 156 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).   In fact, \"[t]he evidence [supporting the conviction]\n\nmay be entirely circumstantial.\"       Scantleberry-Frank, 158 F.3d at\n\n616.\n\n          Meléndez    nonetheless    urges   us   to   follow    the   Ninth\n\nCircuit's holding in Romo-Romo, 246 F.3d at 1272, which we find\n\ninapposite.   There, the issue pertained to the propriety of a jury\n\ninstruction, not the sufficiency of the evidence at a bench trial.\n\nId. at 1274 (district court erroneously instructing the jury that\n\n\"[a]n alien who is subject to a lawful deportation order . . ., but\n\nwho never actually enters Mexico because of his own guile or\n\ndeceit, may be considered to have been deported\").              We find no\n\ninaccurate    or   misconceived     perception    of   this     element   of\n\ndeportation in the instant case. Moreover, unlike the defendant in\n\nRomo-Romo, Meléndez presents no evidence that he actually escaped\n\nfrom the port of entry, but merely urges the court to speculate\n\nabout such an escape.    Id. at 1274.     We refuse to do so now.\n\n          Meléndez's remaining challenges -- Remsen's inability to\n\nfind the Form I-294 in Meléndez's \"A file,\" as well as González's\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\finability to recall seeing Meléndez actually cross the border --\n\nalso falter because these are credibility issues for the fact-\n\nfinder to resolve; we will not second-guess them on appeal.                 See\n\nGrace, 367 F.3d at 34.\n\n           For the reasons stated, we reject Meléndez's challenge to\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction.\n\nB.   Sentencing\n\n           Meléndez further argues that the district court erred in\n\nrefusing to depart downward from the Sentencing Guidelines based on\n\nhis cultural assimilation into American society, and that the\n\nsentence   imposed   under   the   now-advisory      Guidelines    should   be\n\nvacated in light of the Supreme Court's intervening decision in\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).               These arguments\n\nalso fail.\n\n           It has long been established that \"a sentencing court's\n\ndiscretionary     refusal   to   depart    is   [generally]    unreviewable.\"\n\nUnited States v. Sánchez, 354 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir. 2004); see also\n\nUnited States v. Woodward, 277 F.3d 87, 92-93 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nUnited States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 30 (1st Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Morrison, 46 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir. 1995); United States\n\nv. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994).          Narrow exceptions do\n\nexist, such as when the sentencing court \"bases its decision on a\n\nview that it lacks the legal authority to consider a departure,\"\n\nUnited States v. Mejía, 309 F.3d 67, 69 (1st Cir. 2002), or when\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthe court \"base[s] its decision on an error of law,\" Woodward, 277\n\nF.3d at 92-93.     Thus, \"we review de novo a district court's\n\ndetermination of its authority to depart, but lack jurisdiction to\n\nreview a discretionary decision not to depart from the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.\"   Mejía, 309 F.3d at 70 (emphasis added).\n\n          Booker, however, has since made the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nadvisory, giving district courts substantially more discretion in\n\nsentencing above or below the Guideline range.   Booker, 125 S. Ct.\n\nat 767.   Although Booker excised the statutory provision of the\n\nSentencing Reform Act that provides the standard of review for\n\nsentences on appeal, 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), it left intact the\n\nprovision pertaining to appellate review of sentences, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3742(a).     Id. at 765.    Pursuant to § 3742(a), this Court\n\ntherefore continues to possess the same jurisdiction to review\n\nGuidelines sentences as before Booker, and accordingly, also still\n\nlacks jurisdiction to review a sentencing court's refusal to depart\n\ndownward based on its belief that the defendant's circumstances\n\nfail to warrant such departure. See United States v. Kornegay, 410\n\nF.3d 89, 98 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding that if \"the defendant's claim\n\nis only that the district court unreasonably declined to exercise\n\nits discretion to grant a departure, we may not review it\"); see\n\nalso United States v. Monteiro, --- F.3d ---, 2005 WL 1869918 at\n\n*11 (1st Cir. Aug. 9, 2005) (declining to review a sentencing\n\njudge's refusal to grant a downward departure where the judge did\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fnot evince an understanding that he was constrained from doing so).\n\nHere,    given   that   the   sentencing   judge   believed   that   he    had\n\n\"discretion for downward departure on th[e] [cultural assimilation]\n\nbasis,\" but chose not to do so given the defendant's circumstances,\n\nwe find ourselves without jurisdiction to review that refusal.3\n\n              We still review, however, whether a Booker error has\n\noccurred.      \"The Booker error is that the defendant's Guidelines\n\nsentence was imposed under a mandatory system.\"           United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005). In reviewing such\n\nerror, we examine whether the error was preserved below; for\n\nexample, \"whether the defendant below argued that a guideline\n\napplication transgressed either Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S.\n\n466 (2000), or Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).\" United\n\nStates v. Martins, --- F.3d ---, 2005 WL 1502939 at *11 (1st Cir.\n\nJune    27,   2005).    Here,   given   that   Meléndez   argued,    and   the\n\nGovernment agreed, to reduce Meléndez's criminal history category\n\n\n\n\n3\n   We nonetheless note the difficulty of Meléndez's position, who,\nat the time of sentencing, had lived in the United States for 52\nyears, has a wife and four children in the United States, and can\nneither speak nor write Spanish.     We recognize that the Ninth\nCircuit allows \"cultural assimilation [as] a proper basis for\ngranting a downward departure in 8 U.S.C. § 1326 cases for persons\nbrought to the United States as children, who had adapted to\nAmerican culture in a strong way and who, after deportation,\nreturned to the United States for cultural rather than economic\nreasons.\" United States v. Rivas-González, 384 F.3d 1034, 1044\n(9th Cir. 2004) (citing United States v. Lipman, 133 F.3d 726 (9th\nCir. 1998)). Nonetheless, given our lack of jurisdiction, we need\nnot address this issue at the current juncture.\n\n                                    -11-\n\fbecause of Blakely, we will assume that the Booker error is\n\npreserved.\n\n          In preserved error cases, \"the government has the burden\n\nof proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect\n\nthe   defendant's     substantial       rights.\"       United       States   v.\n\nVázquez-Rivera,     407   F.3d   476,   489   (1st   Cir.   2005)    (internal\n\ncitations omitted).        Under this \"extremely difficult, but not\n\nimpossible, standard,\" id. at 489-90, \"we must be convinced that a\n\nlower sentence would not have been imposed had the Guidelines been\n\nadvisory,\" id. at 489.\n\n          In the instant case, the judge twice denied Meléndez's\n\nrequests for downward departures -- despite finding that he had\n\ndiscretion to do so -- given \"the assimilation that this defendant\n\nhas had over in the criminal justice system.\"4              The judge chided\n\nMeléndez for \"the lack of respect you have for the United States\n\nlaws as reflected both in your criminal record and your actions in\n\nthis case.\" The judge further stated that \"[v]ery clearly you knew\n\n\n4\n  Meléndez's Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) indicates: (1)\n3 points for a 1998 Indiana conviction for possession of a schedule\nII substance that produced a ten-year sentence that was\nsubsequently reduced to six years with four years suspension and\ntwo years probation; and (2) 3 points for a 1997 Florida conviction\nfor homicide/manslaughter that produced a ten-year sentence. No\npoints were assigned to two convictions for auto theft, a 1977 drug\nand weapons offense, a 1977 conviction for possession of a stolen\nvehicle, a 1982 conviction for bail jumping, or a conviction for\nunlawful acquisition of a firearm. There are also charges with\nunknown dispositions, including a 1970 aggravated assault, a 1970\nunlawful use of a weapon, a 1976 possession of a controlled\nsubstance, and a 1977 theft and possession of heroin.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fthat you were deported and you figured if you came back and were\n\ncaptured you would serve a light sentence, the worse that happens\n\nis they would send you back                 again as many people have gone\n\nthrough.\"    Thus, although the judge said that \"I am not . . . going\n\nto sentence you to the high end of the guideline range, that is\n\nreserved for people worse than you,\" he also chose not to sentence\n\nMeléndez at the lower range, despite his discretion to do so.                           See\n\nUnited States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 505 (1st Cir. 2005) (denying\n\nBooker remand and noting that since defendant \"was sentenced in the\n\nmiddle of the guideline range, rather than at the bottom, and so\n\nthe district court could have given him a lower sentence under the\n\nold regime . . . speaks volumes\").                 Given that we are \"convinced\n\nthat   a   lower     sentence      would    not    have    been    imposed        had   the\n\nGuidelines been advisory,\"             Vázquez-Rivera, 407 F.3d at 489, we\n\nfind no Booker error.\n\nC.   Fast Track Program\n\n             Finally, Meléndez argues that the absence of a \"fast\n\ntrack\"     program      in   the   district       of    Maine   violated       his    equal\n\nprotection rights.           We are not convinced.\n\n             Fast track programs -- which were initially established\n\nin federal district courts along the southwestern United States to\n\naccommodate       the    large     number   of     immigration         cases     --   offer\n\ndefendants    a    sentence        reduction,      in    the    form    of   a   downward\n\ndeparture or some other benefit, in exchange for the defendant's\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fwaiver   of    certain    procedural      rights.

Rev. 827.\n\nSection 5K3.1 of the Guidelines provides: \"Upon motion of the\n\nGovernment, the court may depart downward not more than 4 levels\n\npursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the Attorney\n\nGeneral of the United States and the United States Attorney for the\n\ndistrict in which the court resides.\"                U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\n\nManual § 5K3.1 (2004) (emphasis added); see also Pub. L. 108-21\n\n§   401(m)(2)(B),       117   Stat.      650    (2003).         These    programs   --\n\npromulgated by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to the 2003\n\nPROTECT Act,     Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003) -- require,\n\nat a minimum, that the defendant agree to the factual basis and\n\nwaive the rights to file pretrial motions, to appeal, and to seek\n\ncollateral relief (except for ineffective assistance of counsel).\n\nMemorandum      from    Attorney    General       John     Ashcroft,      \"Department\n\nPrinciples for Implementing an Expedited Disposition or Fast-Track\n\nProsecution Program in a District\" (July 28, 2003).                         Moreover,\n\nthese programs are authorized only when they are clearly warranted\n\nby local conditions within a particular district.

Doe, 509\n\nU.S. 312, 319 (1993)).   Meléndez cites no case law holding that the\n\ndistinction between aliens sentenced in fast-track versus non-fast-\n\ntrack jurisdictions constitutes a suspect classification, nor does\n\nhe offer support that the resulting inequity involves fundamental\n\nrights.   Thus, \"[s]uch a classification must be upheld if it is\n\nrationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.\"            Id.\n\n(citing Heller, 509 U.S. at 320).\n\n           Here, the U.S. Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney for\n\nthe District of Maine are in the best position to evaluate whether\n\nthe local conditions in Maine warrant such a program.         They could\n\nvery well find that the low volume of crimes involving illegal\n\naliens in Maine, as compared to southwestern states, enable them to\n\nput their resources to better use.       For example, they may find that\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fthe absence of the program could permit swifter adjudication with\n\ncorresponding benefits to aliens, or that it could achieve greater\n\ndeterrence through harsher sentences. We find that these proffered\n\nreasons constitute a \"reasonably conceivable set of facts that\n\ncould provide a rational basis for the classification,\" id. (citing\n\nHeller,   509   U.S.   at   320),   and    as   such,   no   equal   protection\n\nviolation exists.5\n\n                                     III\n\n           For the reasons stated, the defendant's sentence and\n\nconviction are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n5\n   We also note that at least three circuits have held that \"where\n[sentencing]   disparities   arise    from   varying  charging   and\nplea-bargaining   policies   of   the    individual  United   States\nAttorneys,\" it is inappropriate for a judge to grant a downward\ndeparture. United States v. Armenta-Castro, 227 F.3d 1255, 1257\n(10th Cir. 2000). See also United States v. Banuelos-Rodríguez,\n215 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc ); United States v.\nBonnet-Grullón, 212 F.3d 692, 710 (2d Cir. 2000). In any event, we\ncould find no Constitutional mandate that all U.S. Attorneys\ninstitute fast track programs and offer them to all defendants,\nparticularly since Meléndez does not allege that the Government had\nan impermissible motive in deciding not to implement the program.\nCf. Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181 (1992) (holding that a\nprosecutor has discretion to make a downward departure motion under\nU.S.S.G. § 5K1.1, and that the prosecutor's decision not to file a\nmotion is reviewable only if defendant \"makes a substantial\nthreshold showing of improper motive\").\n\n                                     -16-\n\f",

Specifically, Mel&#233;ndez challenges (1) the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction, (2) the district court's refusal to grant a downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines based on his \"cultural assimilation\" into American society, and (3) the absence of a \"fast track\" program in the District of Maine to process immigration cases. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* On August 18, 1998, Mel&#233;ndez &#8212;a Mexican citizen who had lived in the United States from the age of three and who claims a Maine residency &#8212; was ordered deported due to a 1997 manslaughter conviction in Florida. He was flown to Laredo, Texas to consummate the deportation process on January 11, 2001, but was subsequently found in Bucksport, Maine more than a year later, on May 30, 2002.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, 2003, Mel&#233;ndez submitted to a bench trial, having waived his right to a jury trial, for the one-count indictment of re-entering the United States after being deported subsequent to an aggravated felony. The parties stipulated, and the court accepted, that Mel&#233;ndez was an \"alien\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a)(2), that he was convicted of manslaughter in Florida, that he was on board a Justice Prisoner Alien Transportation System (JPATS) flight that arrived in Laredo, Texas on January 11, 2001, and that he was found in Bucksport, Maine on May 30, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, John Remsen, a special agent of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified that Mel&#233;ndez's \"A file\" &#8212; which records every contact an alien has with the immigration service &#8212; included a Form I-205 warrant of removal and deportation reflecting Mel&#233;ndez's deportation. The file also contained a Form I-170, a deportation case checklist, showing that a Form I-294 &#8212; which gives the reasons for the deportation and the number of years an alien must wait before returning to the country legally &#8212; had been given to Mel&#233;ndez, although such form could not found. Remsen also testified that Mel&#233;ndez never applied for, nor received, permission to re-enter the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next testimony came from Frances Gonz&#225;lez, a Detention Enforcement Officer with the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration Customs Enforcement (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). Gonz&#225;lez, who had worked at the Laredo, Texas port of entry for eight years and was on duty on January 11, 2001, recounted the agency's routine deportation procedures. When a JPATS plane arrives, the prisoners &#8212; who number 50 to 120 per day &#8212; are individually released from leg irons, handcuffs, and belly chains and are boarded into government buses or vans under the supervision of United States Marshals and Immigration and Customs officers. The prisoners are then transported to a secure area with barriers on all sides, placed into groups of five, and visually observed as they cross the border on foot. Afterward, the officers complete individual I-205 forms, which record the name of the transporting officer, the means of arrival, the port, date, and manner of removal, the alien's photograph and right index fingerprint, and the signature of the officer who witnessed the alien's departure. Gonz&#225;lez testified that she had signed Mel&#233;ndez's I-205 form on January 11, 2001, and that although she could not remember specific events of that day, she \"would not sign a form if [she] was not sure that person did exit the United States.\" Tr. 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 2004, Mel&#233;ndez was found guilty and sentenced to 70 months' imprisonment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and three years' supervised release. In so holding, the court rejected Mel&#233;ndez's argument that he never left the United States, because although no witness testified to actually seeing him leave the country, \"the practice of signing [the relevant paperwork] after seeing all of the people [who are being deported] go across without specifically looking for one is sufficient to document that they saw this individual being deported across the border.\" Tr. 91. The court also denied Mel&#233;ndez's motion for a downward departure based on \"cultural assimilation,\" stating that Mel&#233;ndez's case is \"not extraordinary,\" that Mel&#233;ndez's \"assimilation ... in the criminal justice system perhaps weighs against this request,\" and that cultural assimilation is similar to \"family ties responsibility,\" which is a discouraged factor. S. Tr. 11-12. Finally, the court rejected Mel&#233;ndez's argument that the absence of a \"Fast Track\" program in the District of Maine forms a \"basis for a downward departure[,] constitutional or otherwise.\" <i>Id.</i> This appeal follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez first argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support a conviction for illegal re-entry after deportation subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction, in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a)(2)(b)(2) and &#167; 1101(a)(43)(F). We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence following bench trials \"de novo, evaluating whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>United States v. Grace,</i> 367 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Moreover, \"we draw all reasonable evidentiary inferences in harmony with the verdict and resolve all issues of credibility in the light most favorable to the government.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, and we now emphasize, \"`[t]he evidence may be entirely circumstantial, and need not exclude every hypothesis of innocence; that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.'\" <i>United States v. Scantleberry-Frank,</i> 158 F.3d 612, 616 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>United States v. Batista-Polanco,</i> 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the court &#8212; to convict Mel&#233;ndez of violating 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a)(2) and (b)(2) &#8212;must have necessarily found that the Government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mel&#233;ndez (1) was an alien, (2) whose deportation was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, and (3) that he entered or attempted to enter or was later found in the United States, (4) without the express consent of the Attorney General for such entry. <i>Scantleberry-Frank,</i> 158 F.3d at 616 (citing 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez's sole sufficiency challenge is directed at the third element: mainly, that the Government offered no conclusive proof that Mel&#233;ndez actually left the country and was therefore not \"deported.\" <i>See United States v. Romo-Romo,</i> 246 F.3d 1272, 1274 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that an alien cannot be said to have been deported and to have re-entered when the alien never left the country at all). Specifically, Mel&#233;ndez argues that Gonz&#225;lez's inability to remember the specific events of January 11, 2001 &#8212; including the day of the week, the weather, her specific duties that day, where she was positioned, and the actual number of deportees, as well as her inability to recognize Mel&#233;ndez and whether she actually saw him cross the border &#8212; renders insufficient the Government's proof that Mel&#233;ndez actually left the country. The missing I-294 form also allegedly detracts from the sufficiency of the evidence regarding actual deportation. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the contrary, we find that the evidence adduced at trial amply supports Mel&#233;ndez's deportation. The routine procedures recounted &#8212; including the significant physical restraints on the deportees, the close monitoring by U.S. Marshals and Immigration and Customs officers, the physical barriers to the port of entry, the close surveillance of deportees as they walk across the border in groups of five,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the Form I-205 checklist indicating that the officer witnessed the deportee cross the border &#8212; could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mel&#233;ndez was actually deported. <i>See Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 34. The absence of direct evidence &#8212; <i>e.g.,</i> the lack of testimony of any individual who personally witnessed Mel&#233;ndez depart the United States, or of any photograph or videotape showing the same &#8212; is irrelevant. As we have repeatedly emphasized, \"circumstantial evidence, if it meets all the other criteria of admissibility, is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is entitled to be given whatever weight the [fact finder] deems it should be given.\" <i>United States v. Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1998). In fact, \"[t]he evidence [supporting the conviction] may be entirely circumstantial.\" <i>Scantleberry-Frank,</i> 158 F.3d at 616.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez nonetheless urges us to follow the Ninth Circuit's holding in <i>Romo-Romo,</i> 246 F.3d at 1272, which we find inapposite. There, the issue pertained to the propriety of a jury instruction, not the sufficiency of the evidence at a bench trial. <i>Id.</i> at 1274 (district court erroneously instructing the jury that \"[a]n alien who is subject to a lawful deportation order ..., but who never actually enters Mexico because of his own guile or deceit, may be considered to have been deported\"). We find no inaccurate or misconceived perception of this element of deportation in the instant case. Moreover, unlike the defendant in <i>Romo-Romo,</i> Mel&#233;ndez presents no evidence that he actually escaped from the port of entry, but merely urges the court to speculate about such an escape. <i>Id.</i> at 1274. We refuse to do so now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez's remaining challenges &#8212; Remsen's inability to find the Form I-294 in Mel&#233;ndez's \"A file,\" as well as Gonz&#225;lez's inability to recall seeing Mel&#233;ndez actually cross the border &#8212; also falter because these are credibility issues for the fact-finder to resolve; we will not second-guess them on appeal. <i>See Grace,</i> 367 F.3d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we reject Mel&#233;ndez's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Sentencing</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez further argues that the district court erred in refusing to depart downward from the Sentencing Guidelines based on his cultural assimilation into American society, and that the sentence imposed under the now-advisory Guidelines should be vacated in light of the Supreme Court's intervening decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). These arguments also fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has long been established that \"a sentencing court's discretionary refusal to depart is [generally] unreviewable.\" <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 354 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also United States v. Woodward,</i> 277 F.3d 87, 92-93 (1st Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 30 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 46 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir.1994). Narrow exceptions do exist, such as when the sentencing court \"bases its decision on a view that it lacks the legal authority to consider a departure,\" <i>United States v. Mejia,</i> 309 F.3d 67, 69 (1st Cir.2002), or when the court \"base[s] its decision on an error of law,\" <i>Woodward,</i> 277 F.3d at 92-93. Thus, \"we review de novo a district court's determination of its authority to depart, but <i>lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision not to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines.</i>\" <i>Mejia,</i> 309 F.3d at 70 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Booker,</i> however, has since made the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, giving district courts substantially more discretion in sentencing above or below the Guideline range. <i>Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 767. Although <i>Booker</i> excised the statutory provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that provides the standard of review for sentences on appeal, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e), it left intact the provision pertaining to appellate review of sentences, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a). <i>Id.</i> at 765. Pursuant to &#167; 3742(a), this Court therefore continues to possess the same jurisdiction to review Guidelines sentences as before <i>Booker,</i> and accordingly, also still lacks jurisdiction to review a sentencing court's refusal to depart downward based on its belief that the defendant's circumstances fail to warrant such departure. <i>See United States v. Kornegay,</i> 410 F.3d 89, 98 (1st Cir.2005) (holding that if \"the defendant's claim is only that the district court unreasonably declined to exercise its discretion to grant a departure, we may not review it\"); <i>see also United States v. Monteiro,</i> 417 F.3d 208, 214 (1st Cir.2005) (declining to review a sentencing judge's refusal to grant a downward departure where the judge did not evince an understanding that he was constrained from doing so). Here, given that the sentencing judge believed that he had \"discretion for downward departure on th[e] [cultural assimilation] basis,\" but chose not to do so given the defendant's circumstances, we find ourselves without jurisdiction to review that refusal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We still review, however, whether a <i>Booker</i> error has occurred. \"The Booker error is that the defendant's Guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory system.\" <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir.2005). In reviewing such error, we examine whether the error was preserved below; for example, \"whether the defendant below argued that a guideline application transgressed either <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).\" <i>United States v. Martins,</i> 413 F.3d 139, 154 (1st Cir.2005).

Mel&#233;ndez cites no case law holding that the distinction between aliens sentenced in fast-track versus non-fast-track jurisdictions constitutes a suspect classification, nor does he offer support that the resulting inequity involves fundamental rights.

Specifically, Mel&#233;ndez challenges (1) the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction, (2) the district court's refusal to grant a downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines based on his \"cultural assimilation\" into American society, and (3) the absence of a \"fast track\" program in the District of Maine to process immigration cases. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* On August 18, 1998, Mel&#233;ndez &#8212;a Mexican citizen who had lived in the United States from the age of three and who claims a Maine residency &#8212; was ordered deported due to a 1997 manslaughter conviction in Florida. He was flown to Laredo, Texas to consummate the deportation process on January 11, 2001, but was subsequently found in Bucksport, Maine more than a year later, on May 30, 2002.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, 2003, Mel&#233;ndez submitted to a bench trial, having waived his right to a jury trial, for the one-count indictment of re-entering the United States after being deported subsequent to an aggravated felony. The parties stipulated, and the court accepted, that Mel&#233;ndez was an \"alien\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a)(2), that he was convicted of manslaughter in Florida, that he was on board a Justice Prisoner Alien Transportation System (JPATS) flight that arrived in Laredo, Texas on January 11, 2001, and that he was found in Bucksport, Maine on May 30, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, John Remsen, a special agent of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified that Mel&#233;ndez's \"A file\" &#8212; which records every contact an alien has with the immigration service &#8212; included a Form I-205 warrant of removal and deportation reflecting Mel&#233;ndez's deportation. The file also contained a Form I-170, a deportation case checklist, showing that a Form I-294 &#8212; which gives the reasons for the deportation and the number of years an alien must wait before returning to the country legally &#8212; had been given to Mel&#233;ndez, although such form could not found. Remsen also testified that Mel&#233;ndez never applied for, nor received, permission to re-enter the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next testimony came from Frances Gonz&#225;lez, a Detention Enforcement Officer with the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration Customs Enforcement (formerly the Immigration and Naturalization Service). Gonz&#225;lez, who had worked at the Laredo, Texas port of entry for eight years and was on duty on January 11, 2001, recounted the agency's routine deportation procedures. When a JPATS plane arrives, the prisoners &#8212; who number 50 to 120 per day &#8212; are individually released from leg irons, handcuffs, and belly chains and are boarded into government buses or vans under the supervision of United States Marshals and Immigration and Customs officers. The prisoners are then transported to a secure area with barriers on all sides, placed into groups of five, and visually observed as they cross the border on foot. Afterward, the officers complete individual I-205 forms, which record the name of the transporting officer, the means of arrival, the port, date, and manner of removal, the alien's photograph and right index fingerprint, and the signature of the officer who witnessed the alien's departure. Gonz&#225;lez testified that she had signed Mel&#233;ndez's I-205 form on January 11, 2001, and that although she could not remember specific events of that day, she \"would not sign a form if [she] was not sure that person did exit the United States.\" Tr. 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 2004, Mel&#233;ndez was found guilty and sentenced to 70 months' imprisonment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and three years' supervised release. In so holding, the court rejected Mel&#233;ndez's argument that he never left the United States, because although no witness testified to actually seeing him leave the country, \"the practice of signing [the relevant paperwork] after seeing all of the people [who are being deported] go across without specifically looking for one is sufficient to document that they saw this individual being deported across the border.\" Tr. 91. The court also denied Mel&#233;ndez's motion for a downward departure based on \"cultural assimilation,\" stating that Mel&#233;ndez's case is \"not extraordinary,\" that Mel&#233;ndez's \"assimilation ... in the criminal justice system perhaps weighs against this request,\" and that cultural assimilation is similar to \"family ties responsibility,\" which is a discouraged factor. S. Tr. 11-12. Finally, the court rejected Mel&#233;ndez's argument that the absence of a \"Fast Track\" program in the District of Maine forms a \"basis for a downward departure[,] constitutional or otherwise.\" <i>Id.</i> This appeal follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez first argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support a conviction for illegal re-entry after deportation subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction, in violation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(a)(2)(b)(2) and &#167; 1101(a)(43)(F).

Specifically, Mel&#233;ndez argues that Gonz&#225;lez's inability to remember the specific events of January 11, 2001 &#8212; including the day of the week, the weather, her specific duties that day, where she was positioned, and the actual number of deportees, as well as her inability to recognize Mel&#233;ndez and whether she actually saw him cross the border &#8212; renders insufficient the Government's proof that Mel&#233;ndez actually left the country. The missing I-294 form also allegedly detracts from the sufficiency of the evidence regarding actual deportation.

The absence of direct evidence &#8212; <i>e.g.,</i> the lack of testimony of any individual who personally witnessed Mel&#233;ndez depart the United States, or of any photograph or videotape showing the same &#8212; is irrelevant.

We find no inaccurate or misconceived perception of this element of deportation in the instant case.
