Appellant  Jose Para  was sentenced  to a\n          Per Curiam\n                    \n\nthree-year  prison term  and  a  three-year  term  of  supervised\n\nrelease  on December 1, 1987,  for distributing four and one-half\n\nounces  of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1),(b)(1)(-\n\nC), on  or about  May 6,  1987 (\"first  offense\").   On or  about\n\nMay 6, 1989,  after Para had  served two years of  the three-year\n\nprison term, the  United States Parole Commission  authorized his\n\nrelease on  parole.  On  February 2, 1992, while still  on super-\n\nvised  release, Para was  arrested for distributing  a detectable\n\namount of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1),(b)(1)(C)\n\n(\"second offense\").  In 1993, Para was convicted and sentenced to\n\na sixteen-month prison term for  the second offense.  Following a\n\nviolation hearing  before the district  court in the wake  of the\n\nsecond offense, Para was sentenced to a consecutive sixteen-month\n\nprison term for violating the supervised  release term imposed in\n\nconnection with the first offense.\n\n          We summarily  reject Para's mischaracterization  of the\n\nplain  language of the  December 1, 1987, judgment  of conviction\n\nand sentence, as imposing a  term of \"special parole\" rather than\n\na term of \"supervised release.\"  The judgment  explicitly imposed\n\n\"a  term of  supervised  release  for a  period  of three  years\"\n\nfollowing  Para's release from  prison.  Undaunted,  Para insists\n\nthat, in  fact, he must have been sentenced to a \"special parole\"\n\nterm, because he was paroled  by the United States Parole Commis-\n\nsion.   \"Special  parole,\" prior  to  its elimination  under  the\n\nSentencing  Reform Act  of 1984  (SRA),  Gozlon-Peretz v.  United\n                                                                 \n\nStates, 498  U.S. 395, 397 (1991), was a mandatory element in any\n                                                                 \n\nprison sentence imposed for a federal  drug offense.  The form of\n               \n\nparole on which  Para was released from prison  in 1989, however,\n\nis merely a  post-sentencing administrative ruling by  the Parole\n\nCommission  that the defendant  should be  conditionally released\n\ninto the community prior  to the completion  of the full term  of\n\nimprisonment imposed by  the sentencing court.  See  Morrissey v.\n                                                              \n\nBrewer, 408 U.S. 471, 477 (1972).\n      \n\n          Para's alternate claim is that the sixteen-month prison\n\nterm the district court imposed in 1993 for committing the second\n\noffense while on  supervised release is an invalid  ex post facto\n                                                                 \n\npunishment.

Para reasons that in May of 1987     the date of the\n\nfirst offense     a lawful  term of supervised release  could not\n\nhave been imposed, no matter  what the judgment of conviction and\n\nsentence  stated,  because the  SRA  did  not  take effect  until\n\nNovember 1, 1987, well after the commission of the first offense.\n\n          This claim is  foreclosed by Gozlon-Peretz, which  held\n                                                    \n\nthat,  \"in the  interim  period  between  October 27,  1986,  and\n\nNovember 1, 1987, supervised release applies for all drug offens-\n\nes in the  categories specified by ADAA   1002\"  [Section 1002 of\n\nthe  Anti Drug Abuse  Act of 1986,  Pub.

Since the first offense was for an ADAA\n\n  1002  violation (distribution  of cocaine  in  violation of  21\n\nU.S.C.   841(a)(1),(b)(1)(C))  and ADAA    1002 became  effective\n\nupon  its  enactment on  October  27,  1986, the  district  court\n\n                                3\n\ncorrectly  sentenced Para  to  a  mandatory  term  of  supervised\n\nrelease  on December 1,  1987, see  21  U.S.C.   841(a)(1),  (b)-\n                                  \n\n(1)(C).\n\n          The district court judgment is summarily affirmed.
