This bankruptcy case requires us to\n\ndecide whether the post-petition sale of the debtor's home, for\n\nwhich he had obtained a homestead exemption under the law of\n\nMassachusetts protecting it from creditors, causes the proceeds of\n\nthe sale to lose their exempt status under the Bankruptcy Code and\n\nbecome subject to pre-petition, nondischargeable debt. We conclude\n\nthat the proceeds from the sale of the home retain the exempt\n\nstatus of the home itself.            We therefore affirm the district\n\ncourt's ruling that the proceeds from the sale of Maurice F.\n\nCunningham's homesteaded property cannot be liable for his pre-\n\npetition debt to William J. Pasquina.\n\n                                       I.\n\n     Pasquina hired Cunningham, a former high school classmate, to\n\nwork in his legal practice in 1982.          In 1995, Pasquina was injured\n\nin a car accident and was unable to continue to practice law.\n\nTherefore,   Pasquina   wanted        to    sell   his    legal   practice     to\n\nCunningham, but they were unable to come to an agreement. Pasquina\n\nthen entered unsuccessful negotiations with Pierce & Associates\n\n(\"Pierce\") for the sale of his practice.                 During the course of\n\nPasquina's   negotiations      with    Pierce,     Cunningham     misled     both\n\nPasquina and Pierce into believing that he would join Pierce.\n\nInstead, Cunningham secretly removed clients' files from Pasquina's\n\nrecords,   covertly   opened    his    own    practice,     and   continued    to\n\nrepresent Pasquina's former clients without paying Pasquina his\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fshare of the earned legal fees or reimbursing him for the expenses\n\nhe had advanced the clients.     In response to Pasquina's lawsuit,\n\nthe Massachusetts Superior Court entered its initial judgement of\n\n$191,072.30 on June 20, 2001, having found that Cunningham breached\n\nhis fiduciary duties to Pasquina during the period after the\n\naccident.1\n\n     In November 2001, by filing a Declaration of Homestead with\n\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts Registry of Deeds, Cunningham\n\ndesignated his residence at 795 Johnson Street in North Andover,\n\nMassachusetts as his homestead.    Once property is properly claimed\n\nas a homestead pursuant to the Massachusetts Homestead Act, it is\n\nshielded from most of an owner's creditors:\n\n     An estate of homestead to the extent of $300,000 in the\n     land and buildings may be acquired pursuant to this\n     chapter by an owner or owners of a home or one or all who\n     rightfully possess the premise by lease or otherwise and\n     who occupy or intend to occupy said home as a principal\n     residence. Said estate shall be exempt from the laws of\n     conveyance, descent, devise, attachment, levy on\n     execution and sale for payment of debts or legacies\n     except [in certain listed exceptions].\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1.2   Soon after Cunningham's declaration\n\nof homestead, Pasquina attempted to collect upon his superior court\n\n\n     1\n      The court adjusted its judgement on April 1, 2003 to account\nfor the revenue that Cunningham had subsequently received from\ncases that originated with Pasquina.      The final judgment was\n$291,554.55 with the accumulation of interest.\n     2\n       In 2004, the homestead protection increased from $300,000 to\n$500,000. See 2004 Mass. Legis. Serv. ch. 218. Since Cunningham\nfiled for bankruptcy prior to the increase, his homestead exemption\nis limited to $300,000.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fjudgment on December 12, 2002 by obtaining a $250,000 writ of\n\nattachment against the Johnson Street property.\n\n      On February 28, 2003, Cunningham filed for bankruptcy under\n\nChapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 701 et. seq., and\n\nclaimed    in   the    bankruptcy   proceedings     a    $300,000   homestead\n\nexemption on the Johnson Street property pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §\n\n522(b).    He also disclosed Pasquina's lien on the residence.3\n\n      Under 11 U.S.C. § 522(f) a debtor can avoid the fixing of a\n\njudicial lien on property that is exempted from the bankruptcy\n\nestate.4   Therefore, before the bankruptcy court, Cunningham moved\n\npursuant to § 522(f) for an order avoiding Pasquina's $250,000 writ\n\nof attachment.5       On February 4, 2004, Pasquina filed an objection\n\nto   Cunningham's     motion   to   avoid   the   writ   of   attachment   and\n\n\n\n      3\n       As our chronology indicates, Pasquina obtained the superior\ncourt judgment against Cunningham prior to Cunningham's filing of\nthe declaration of homestead.     The Massachusetts Homestead Act\ncontains an exception for \"a debt contracted prior to the\nacquisition of said estate of homestead.\" However, we ruled in In\nre Weinstein that the Massachusetts prior debt exception is pre-\nempted by the Bankruptcy Code. 164 F.3d 677, 682 (1st Cir. 1999).\nUnderstandably, Pasquina does not invoke the Massachusetts prior\ncontracted debt exception in his arguments here.\n      4\n       While a debtor can typically avoid the fixing of a judicial\nlien on his interest in exempt property, he cannot avoid the fixing\nof a judicial lien for domestic support obligations. 11 U.S.C. §\n522(f)(1)(A).\n      5\n       Cunningham stated in this motion that the Johnson Street\nproperty was appraised at $495,000 and was subject to $260,000 in\noutstanding mortgages.    Therefore, absent the lien, his equity\ninterest in the property would be less than $235,000, all of which\nwould be eligible for the homestead exemption.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fCunningham's claim of a homestead exemption.    The bankruptcy court\n\ndenied Pasquina's objections both on the merits and because the\n\nobjections were time-barred,6 thereby allowing Cunningham to avoid\n\nthe lien on the Johnson Street property.\n\n     Subsequently, Pasquina filed a timely motion in the bankruptcy\n\ncourt requesting that the court determine that Cunningham's debt to\n\nhim was nondischargeable.   In July 2005, the court found that the\n\ndebt should not be discharged because Cunningham acted fraudulently\n\nwhile in a fiduciary capacity, see 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4), and\n\nbecause Cunningham caused willful and malicious financial injury to\n\nPasquina, see 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6).7 On September 20, 2005, the\n\nbankruptcy court closed its adversary proceedings.\n\n     Meanwhile, Pasquina learned that Cunningham had listed his\n\nJohnson Street property for sale.      On August 18, 2005, Pasquina\n\nfiled a motion in the Massachusetts Superior Court arguing that the\n\nhomestead exemption for the Johnson Street property would terminate\n\nupon the sale of the property.        Moreover, he claimed that the\n\n\n\n     6\n       For these reasons, the bankruptcy court deemed Pasquina's\nobjections to be frivolous and sanctioned him for filing them.\nPasquina did not appeal this decision.\n     7\n       Section 523(a) provides that certain types of debts are not\nsubject to the Bankruptcy Code's discharge provisions.         More\nspecifically, a debtor who files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy is not\ndischarged from debt obtained by \"fraud or defalcation while acting\nin a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny,\" 11 U.S.C. §\n523(a)(4), or by \"willful and malicious injury by the debtor to\nanother entity or to the property of another entity,\" 11 U.S.C. §\n523(a)(6).\n\n                                -5-\n\fproceeds that would belong to Cunningham's wife, which Pasquina\n\nalleged would constitute at least half of the total proceeds, would\n\nnot be protected by the homestead exemption.      In response to this\n\nmotion, the superior court enjoined Cunningham and his wife from\n\ndistributing or using any of the sale proceeds if they were to sell\n\nthe Johnson Street property.       Then, Pasquina filed an emergency\n\nmotion with the superior court arguing that if the Johnson Street\n\nproperty was sold, the proceeds from the sale of the Johnson Street\n\nproperty should be available to satisfy Pasquina's debt because the\n\nhomestead exemption would be terminated.\n\n     On November 3, 2005, Cunningham filed in bankruptcy court \"A\n\nMotion for Order Confirming Sale Proceeds . . . as Exempt,\" asking\n\nthe bankruptcy court to rule that the proceeds from the post-\n\npetition sale of the Johnson Street property were exempt from\n\nnondischarged debt just as the homestead had been exempt.             On\n\nNovember 21, Cunningham and his wife sold the Johnson Street\n\nproperty and moved to a condominium in Florida.8      Net proceeds from\n\nthe sale of the homestead property were about $150,000.\n\n     On   December    7,   2005,   the   bankruptcy   court   ruled   on\n\nCunningham's motion, deciding that under 11 U.S.C. § 522(c) the\n\nsale proceeds from the homestead were exempt from liability for\n\nPasquina's debt.     That provision states:\n\n\n     8\n       Title to the Florida residence was held only in the name of\nCunningham's wife. The record indicates that the residence was\npurchased before Cunningham filed the bankruptcy petition.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f       [P]roperty exempted under this section is not liable\n       during or after the case for any debt of the debtor that\n       arose . . . before the commencement of the case, except\n       [for certain debts, such as tax and child support\n       obligations].\n\nThe bankruptcy court also found that it could not adjudicate the\n\nrights of Cunningham's wife because it had no jurisdiction over\n\nher.\n\n       Pasquina appealed to the district court.         In a thorough and\n\nwell-reasoned opinion, the court found that the conversion of the\n\nhomestead property into proceeds by means of voluntary sale does\n\nnot remove the protections of § 522(c) from the property.            In re\n\nCunningham, 354 B.R. 547, 557 (D. Mass. 2006).           On appeal to us,\n\nPasquina claims that the district court incorrectly applied federal\n\nbankruptcy law to protect funds that should have been available to\n\nsatisfy a nondischargeable debt.         He argues that Massachusetts\n\nstate   law   governs   the   disposition   of   the   proceeds   from   the\n\nvoluntary sale of a homestead and that these proceeds became\n\nsubject to pre-petition debts for which the debtor remains liable.\n\nAs the relevant facts are undisputed and the issue before us turns\n\nentirely on the interpretation of law, our review is plenary.            See\n\nUnited States v. Hyde, 497 F.3d 103, 106 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                   II.\n\n       The bankruptcy estate, created upon the filing of a Chapter 7\n\npetition, is comprised of a debtor's legal and equitable interests\n\nin property at the time of the petition.          Owen v. Owen, 500 U.S.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f305, 308 (1991).      Typically, assets in the estate are distributed\n\nto creditors pursuant to a statutory scheme that assigns priorities\n\nto various types of debt.           However, particular assets, including a\n\nhomestead, may be exempted from the bankruptcy estate and retained\n\nby the debtor in accordance with the federal Bankruptcy Code.                 \"An\n\nexemption is an interest withdrawn from the estate (and hence from\n\nthe creditors) for the benefit of the debtor.\"                    Id.    Under §\n\n522(b), a debtor can choose to use either the federal list of\n\nexemptions set forth in § 522(d) or the exemptions provided by his\n\nstate.9       See 11 U.S.C. § 522(b), (d); Owen, 500 U.S. at 308.\n\nCunningham opted to use Massachusetts's exemption list.\n\n     Pasquina      objected    to     Cunningham's   claim   of    a    homestead\n\nexemption and his motion to avoid Pasquina's judicial lien, 11\n\nU.S.C.    §    522(c).10      The    bankruptcy   court   properly       rejected\n\n\n     9\n       A state is also allowed to \"opt-out\" of the federal\nexemption list, in which case the debtor is restricted to the\nexemptions provided by his state. See Owen, 500 U.S. at 308; 11\nU.S.C. § 522(b)(1) (stating that a debtor could select from either\nlist \"unless the State law that is applicable to the debtor . . .\nspecifically does not so authorize\").      Massachusetts has not\n\"opted-out,\" thereby allowing its residents to elect the federal\nexemption list.\n     10\n       While § 522(c) allows states to define their own exemptions\nunder § 522(b), the Bankruptcy Code is not required to take those\nexemptions with all of the built-in limitations provided by the\nstate exemption. See Owen, 500 U.S. at 313-314 (\"[W]e conclude\nthat Florida's exclusion of certain liens from the scope of its\nhomestead protection does not achieve a similar exclusion from the\nBankruptcy Code's lien avoidance provision.\").      In Weinstein,\ntaking our cue from Owen, we emphasized that \"the state's ability\nto define its exemptions is not absolute and must yield to\nconflicting policies in the Bankruptcy Code.\" 164 F.3d at 683. We\n\n                                        -8-\n\fPasquina's   claims, thereby permanently immunizing the homestead\n\nfrom pre-bankruptcy debt by withdrawing the property from the\n\nbankruptcy estate.    Property that is properly exempted under § 522\n\nis immunized against liability for prebankruptcy debts, subject\n\nonly to a few exceptions.   Those exceptions include: (1) debt from\n\ncertain taxes and customs duties, (2) debt related to domestic\n\nsupport obligations, (3) liens that cannot be avoided or voided,\n\nincluding tax liens, and (4) debts for a breach of fiduciary duty\n\nto a federal depository institution.     See 11 U.S.C. § 522(c)(1)-\n\n(3); In re Weinstein, 164 F.3d 677, 682 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n     Pasquina's claim that the post-petition voluntary sale of the\n\nexempt property makes the proceeds of the sale available to satisfy\n\na nondischargeable pre-petition debt is at odds with the immunizing\n\neffect of § 522(c).    Section 522(c) states: \"[P]roperty exempted\n\nunder this section is not liable during or after the case for any\n\ndebt of the debtor that arose . . . before the commencement of the\n\ncase . . . .\"   11 U.S.C. § 522(c)(emphasis added).    By the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute, exemptions under § 522(c) persist beyond\n\nthe termination of the case, making the property subject to an\n\nexemption unavailable for the satisfaction of pre-petition debt\n\n(other than for the categories of debt noted in § 522(c) itself).\n\nThere is only one other proviso to this rule: exempted property is\n\n\ndecided in Weinstein that, \"because the Massachusetts prior\ncontracted debt exception is not one of the types of debt specified\nin § 522(c), it is invalid in bankruptcy.\" Id. at 682.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fnot   liable   during       or    after    the    case   \"[u]nless     the     case    is\n\ndismissed.\"     Id.    Cunningham's bankruptcy case was not dismissed;\n\nit was adjudicated.\n\n      Moreover, it is a basic principle of bankruptcy law that\n\nexemptions     are    determined      when    a    petition    is    filed.      In    re\n\nFriedman, 38 B.R. 275, 276 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1984) (\"It is hornbook\n\nbankruptcy law that a debtor's exemptions are determined as of the\n\ntime of the filing of his petition.\"); see also Cunningham, 354\n\nB.R. at 553.          To interpret § 522(c) as conferring merely an\n\nephemeral exemption,             subject to post-termination events, would\n\nundermine that basic principle and its relationship to the fresh\n\nstart policy of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n      The Supreme Court has stated that \"a central purpose of the\n\nBankruptcy     Code    is   to     provide    a    procedure    by    which     certain\n\ninsolvent debtors can reorder their affairs, make peace with their\n\ncreditors, and enjoy 'a new opportunity in life and a clear field\n\nfor future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of\n\npreexisting     debt.'\"           Grogan    v.     Garner,    498    U.S.     279,    286\n\n(1991)(quoting Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 244 (1934)).\n\nThe Bankruptcy Code facilitates a fresh start, in part, by allowing\n\nproperty properly exempted under § 522 to be immunized against\n\nliability for pre-petition debts.                 See Owen, 500 U.S. at 309.\n\n      The efficacy of the fresh start policy requires finality that\n\nallows a debtor to rebuild his life without fear of lingering\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fcreditors.    In In re Reed, a Texas debtor sold his homestead, which\n\nhe had taken as an exemption pursuant to the state exemption list,\n\nduring the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings.            184 B.R. 733\n\n(Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1995).       The trustee for the bankruptcy estate\n\nargued that the post-petition sale of the exempt homestead property\n\nmade the proceeds available to satisfy pre-petition debt.                  The\n\nbankruptcy court disagreed.         Id. at 738-39. If \"estates could be\n\nreopened to administer such proceeds at virtually any time, [the\n\nreopening would be] robbing bankruptcy administration of any sort\n\nof meaningful finality, and robbing bankruptcy discharge of its\n\nefficacy.\"    Id. at 738.\n\n       Pasquina argues that the fresh start and finality interests\n\nare inapplicable in this case because Cunningham is a dishonest\n\ndebtor unworthy of the Bankruptcy Code's protection.          It is simply\n\nunfair, Pasquina argues, to limit his ability to collect on his\n\njudgement against Cunningham.        Congress has not been unresponsive\n\nto such concerns.      When Congress chose to impose limits on the\n\nfresh start policy, it did so by providing explicitly that certain\n\ndebts are nondischargeable.         See 11 U.S.C. § 523(a); Grogan, 498\n\nU.S.   at   287   (finding   that   by   allowing   certain   debts   to   be\n\nnondischargeable, such as \"child support, alimony, and certain\n\nunpaid educational loans and taxes, as well as liabilities for\n\nfraud[,] Congress evidently concluded that the creditors' interest\n\nin recovering full payment of debts in these categories outweighed\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fthe debtors' interest in a complete fresh start\").                        In fact,\n\nPasquina    successfully      argued       to   the   bankruptcy    court       that\n\nCunningham's debt arising from the Massachusetts Superior Court\n\njudgement in favor of Pasquina was nondischargeable because of\n\nCunningham's fraudulent conduct.            However, in deciding which pre-\n\npetition debts could be satisfied from otherwise exempt property,\n\nCongress   did   not   list    such    a     nondischargeable      debt    in   the\n\nitemization set forth in § 522(c)(1)-(3).             Therefore, in asking us\n\nto limit the protections afforded Cunningham because he is a\n\ndishonest debtor, Pasquina is effectively asking us to rewrite §\n\n522(c).    We cannot do that.11\n\n                                      III.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\njudgement that the post-petition sale of Cunningham's home, for\n\nwhich he had obtained a homestead exemption under the law of\n\n\n     11\n       We do not break new ground with our decision here, which is\nconsistent with the decisions of the few courts that have\nconsidered whether proceeds from the post-petition sale of exempt\nproperty are exempt from pre-petition nondischargeable debts.

We conclude that the proceeds from the sale of the home retain the exempt status of the home itself. We therefore affirm the district court's ruling that the proceeds from the sale of Maurice F. Cunningham's homesteaded property cannot be liable for his pre-petition debt to William J. Pasquina.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Pasquina hired Cunningham, a former high school classmate, to work in his legal practice in 1982. In 1995, Pasquina was injured in a car accident and was unable to continue to practice law. Therefore, Pasquina wanted to sell his legal practice to Cunningham, but they were unable to come to an agreement. Pasquina then entered unsuccessful negotiations with Pierce &amp; Associates (\"Pierce\") for the sale of his practice. During the course of Pasquina's negotiations with Pierce, Cunningham misled both Pasquina and Pierce into believing that he would join Pierce. Instead, Cunningham secretly removed clients' files from Pasquina's records, covertly opened his own practice, and continued to represent Pasquina's former clients without paying Pasquina his share of the earned legal fees or reimbursing him for the expenses he had advanced the clients. In response to Pasquina's lawsuit, the Massachusetts Superior Court entered its initial judgement of $191,072.30 on June <span class=\"star-pagination\">*321</span> 20, 2001, having found that Cunningham breached his fiduciary duties to Pasquina during the period after the accident.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In November 2001, by filing a Declaration of Homestead with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Registry of Deeds, Cunningham designated his residence at 795 Johnson Street in North Andover, Massachusetts as his homestead. Once property is properly claimed as a homestead pursuant to the Massachusetts Homestead Act, it is shielded from most of an owner's creditors:</p>\n<blockquote>An estate of homestead to the extent of $300,000 in the land and buildings may be acquired pursuant to this chapter by an owner or owners of a home or one or all who rightfully possess the premise by lease or otherwise and who occupy or intend to occupy said home as a principal residence. Said estate shall be exempt from the laws of conveyance, descent, devise, attachment, levy on execution and sale for payment of debts or legacies except [in certain listed exceptions].</blockquote>\n<p>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1.<sup>[2]</sup> Soon after Cunningham's declaration of homestead, Pasquina attempted to collect upon his superior court judgment on December 12, 2002 by obtaining a $250,000 writ of attachment against the. Johnson Street property.</p>\n<p>On February 28, 2003, Cunningham filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 701 et. seq., and claimed in, the bankruptcy proceedings a $300,000 homestead exemption on the Johnson Street property pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 522(b). He also disclosed Pasquina's lien on the residence.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Under 11 U.S.C. § 522(0 a debtor can avoid the fixing of a judicial lien on property that is exempted from the bankruptcy estate.<sup>[4]</sup> Therefore, before the bankruptcy court, Cunningham moved pursuant to § 522(f) for an order avoiding Pasquina's $250,000 writ of attachment.<sup>[5]</sup> On February 4, 2004, Pasquina filed an objection to Cunningham's motion to avoid the writ of attachment and Cunningham's claim of a homestead exemption. The bankruptcy court denied Pasquina's objections both on the merits and because the objections were time-barred,<sup>[6]</sup> thereby allowing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*322</span> Cunningham to avoid the lien on the Johnson Street property.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Pasquina filed a timely motion in the bankruptcy court requesting that the court determine that Cunningham's debt to him was nondischargeable. In July 2005, the court found that the debt should not be discharged because Cunningham acted fraudulently while in a fiduciary capacity, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4), and because Cunningham caused willful and malicious financial injury to Pasquina, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6).<sup>[7]</sup> On September 20, 2005, the bankruptcy court closed its adversary proceedings.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Pasquina learned that Cunningham had listed his Johnson Street property for sale. On August 18, 2005, Pasquina filed a motion in the Massachusetts Superior Court arguing that the homestead exemption for the Johnson Street property would terminate upon the sale of the property. Moreover, he claimed that the proceeds that would belong to Cunningham's wife, which Pasquina alleged would constitute at least half of the total proceeds, would not be protected by the homestead exemption. In response to this motion, the superior court enjoined Cunningham and his wife from distributing or using any of the sale proceeds if they were to sell the Johnson Street property. Then, Pasquina filed an emergency motion with the superior court arguing that if the Johnson Street property was sold, the proceeds from the sale of the Johnson Street property should be available to satisfy Pasquina's debt because the homestead exemption would be terminated.</p>\n<p>On November 3, 2005, Cunningham filed in bankruptcy court \"A Motion for Order Confirming Sale Proceeds as Exempt,\" asking the bankruptcy court to rule that the proceeds from the post-petition sale of the Johnson Street property were exempt from nondischarged debt just as the homestead had been exempt. On November 21, Cunningham and his wife sold the Johnson Street property and moved to a condominium in Florida.<sup>[8]</sup> Net proceeds from the sale of the homestead property were about $150,000.</p>\n<p>On December 7, 2005, the bankruptcy court ruled on Cunningham's motion, deciding that under 11 U.S.C. § 522(c) the sale proceeds from the homestead were exempt from liability for Pasquina's debt. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote>[P]roperty exempted under this section is not liable during or after the case for any debt of the debtor that arose . . . before the commencement of the case, except [for certain debts, such as tax and child support obligations].</blockquote>\n<p>The bankruptcy court also found that it could not adjudicate the rights of Cunningham's wife because it had no jurisdiction over her.</p>\n<p>Pasquina appealed to the district court. In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the court found that the conversion of the homestead property into proceeds by means of voluntary sale does not remove the protections of § 522(c) from the property. <i>In re Cunningham,</i> 354 B.R. 547, 557 (D.Mass.2006). On appeal to us, Pasquina claims that the district court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*323</span> incorrectly applied federal bankruptcy law to protect funds that should have been available to satisfy a nondischargeable debt. He argues that Massachusetts state law governs the disposition of the proceeds from the voluntary sale of a homestead and that these proceeds became subject to pre-petition debts for which the debtor remains liable. As the relevant facts are undisputed and the issue before us turns entirely on the interpretation of law, our review is plenary. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hyde,</i> 497 F.3d 103, 106 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The bankruptcy estate, created upon the filing of a Chapter 7 petition, is comprised of a debtor's legal and equitable interests in property at the time of the petition. <i>Owen v. Owen,</i> 500 U.S. 305, 308, 111 S.Ct. 1833, 114 L.Ed.2d 350 (1991). Typically, assets in the estate are distributed to creditors pursuant to a statutory scheme that assigns priorities to various types of debt. However, particular assets, including a homestead, may be exempted from the bankruptcy estate and retained by the debtor in accordance with the federal Bankruptcy Code. \"An exemption is an interest withdrawn from the estate (and hence from the creditors) for the benefit of the debtor.\" <i>Id.</i> Under § 522(b), a debtor can choose to use either the federal list of exemptions set forth in § 522(d) or the exemptions provided by his state.<sup>[9]</sup><i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. § 522(b), (d); <i>Owen,</i> 500 U.S. at 308, 111 S.Ct. 1833. Cunningham opted to use Massachusetts's exemption list.</p>\n<p>Pasquina objected to Cunningham's claim of a homestead exemption and his motion to avoid Pasquina's judicial lien, 11 U.S.C. § 522(c).<sup>[10]</sup> The bankruptcy court properly rejected Pasquina's claims, thereby permanently immunizing the homestead from pre-bankruptcy debt by withdrawing the property from the bankruptcy estate. Property that is properly exempted under § 522 is immunized against liability for prebankruptcy debts, subject only to a few exceptions. Those exceptions include: (1) debt from certain taxes and customs duties, (2) debt related to domestic support obligations, (3) liens that cannot be avoided or voided, including tax liens, and (4) debts for a breach of fiduciary duty to a federal depository institution. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. § 522(c)(1)-(3); <i>In re Weinstein,</i> 164 F.3d 677, 682 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>Pasquina's claim that the post-petition voluntary sale of the exempt property makes the proceeds of the sale available to satisfy a nondischargeable pre-petition debt is at odds with the immunizing effect of § 522(c). Section 522(c) states: \"[P]roperty exempted under this section is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*324</span> not liable <i>during or after</i> the case for any debt of the debtor that arose . . . before' the commencement of the case . .\" 11 U.S.C. § 522(c)(emphasis added). By the plain language of the statute, exemptions under § 522(c) persist beyond the termination of the case, making the property subject to an exemption unavailable for the satisfaction of pre-petition debt (other than for the categories of debt noted in § 522(c) itself). There is only one other proviso to this rule: exempted property is not liable during or after the case \"[u]nless the case is dismissed.\" <i>Id.</i> Cunningham's bankruptcy case was not dismissed; it was adjudicated.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is a basic principle of bankruptcy law that exemptions are determined when a petition is filed. <i>In re Friedman,</i> 38 B.R. 275, 276 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.1984) (\"It is hornbook bankruptcy law that a debtor's exemptions are determined as of the time of the filing of his petition.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Cunningham,</i> 354 B.R. at 553. To interpret § 522(c) as conferring merely an ephemeral exemption, subject to post-termination events, would undermine that basic principle and its relationship to the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has stated that \"a central purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is to provide a procedure by which certain insolvent debtors can reorder their affairs, make peace with their creditors, and enjoy `a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.'\" <i>Grogan v. Garner,</i> 498 U.S. 279, 286, 111 S.Ct. 654, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991)(quoting Local <i>Loan Co. v. Hunt,</i> 292 U.S. 234, 244, 54 S.Ct. 695, 78 L.Ed. 1230 (1934)). The Bankruptcy. Code facilitates a fresh start, in part, by allowing property properly exempted under § 522 to be immunized against liability for pre-petition debts. <i>See </i><i>Owen,</i> 500 U.S. at 309, 111 S.Ct. 1833.</p>\n<p>The efficacy of the fresh start policy requires finality that allows a debtor to rebuild his life without fear of lingering creditors. In <i>In re Reed,</i> a Texas debtor sold his homestead, which he had taken as an exemption pursuant to the state exemption list, during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings. 184 B.R. 733 (Bankr. W.D.Tex.1995). The trustee for the bankruptcy estate argued that the post-petition sale of the exempt homestead property made the proceeds available to satisfy pre-petition debt. The bankruptcy court disagreed. <i>Id.</i> at 738-39. If \"estates could be reopened to administer such proceeds at virtually any time, [the reopening would be] robbing bankruptcy administration of any sort of meaningful finality, and robbing bankruptcy discharge of its efficacy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 738.</p>\n<p>Pasquina argues that the fresh start and finality interests are inapplicable in this case because Cunningham is a dishonest debtor unworthy of the Bankruptcy Code's protection. It is simply unfair, Pasquina argues, to limit his ability to collect on his judgement against Cunningham. Congress has not been unresponsive to such concerns. When Congress chose to impose limits on the fresh start policy, it did so by providing explicitly that certain debts are nondischargeable. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. § 523(a); Grogan, 498 U.S. at 287, 111 S.Ct. 654 (finding that by allowing certain debts to be nondischargeable, such as \"child support, alimony, and certain unpaid educational loans and taxes, as well as liabilities for fraud[,] Congress evidently concluded that the creditors' interest in recovering full payment of debts in these categories outweighed the debtors' interest in a complete fresh start\"). In fact, Pasquina successfully argued to the bankruptcy court that Cunningham's debt arising from the Massachusetts Superior Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*325</span> judgement in favor of Pasquina was nondischargeable because of Cunningham's fraudulent conduct. However, in deciding which pre-petition debts could be satisfied from otherwise exempt property, Congress did not list such a nondischargeable debt in the itemization set forth in § 522(c)(1)(3). Therefore, in asking us to limit the protections afforded Cunningham because he is a dishonest debtor, Pasquina is effectively asking us to rewrite § 522(c). We cannot do that.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's judgement that the post-petition sale of Cunningham's home, for which he had obtained a homestead exemption under the law of Massachusetts, did not cause the proceeds of the sale to lose their exempt status under the Bankruptcy Code and become subject to Pasquina's pre-petition nondischargeable debt.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The court adjusted its judgement on April 1, 2003 to account for the revenue that Cunningham had subsequently received from cases that originated with Pasquina. The final judgment was $291,554.55 with the accumulation of interest.</p>\n<p>[2]  In 2004, the homestead protection increased from $300,000 to $500,000. <i>See</i> 2004 Mass. Legis. Serv. ch. 218. Since Cunningham filed for bankruptcy prior to the increase, his homestead exemption is limited to $300,000.</p>\n<p>[3]  As our chronology indicates, Pasquina obtained the superior court judgment against Cunningham prior to Cunningham's filing of the declaration of homestead. The Massachusetts Homestead Act contains an exception for \"a debt contracted prior to the acquisition of said estate of homestead.\" However, we ruled in <i>In re Weinstein</i> that the Massachusetts prior debt exception is pre-empted by the Bankruptcy Code, 164 F.3d 677, 682 (1st Cir.1999). Understandably, Pasquina does not invoke the Massachusetts prior contracted debt exception in his arguments here.</p>\n<p>[4]  While a debtor can typically avoid the fixing of a judicial lien on his interest in exempt property, he cannot avoid the fixing of a judicial lien for domestic support obligations. 11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[5]  Cunningham stated in this motion that the Johnson Street property was appraised at $495,000 and was subject to $260,000 in outstanding mortgages. Therefore, absent the lien, his equity interest in the property would be less than $235,000, all of which would be eligible for the homestead exemption:</p>\n<p>[6]  For these reasons, the bankruptcy court deemed Pasquina's objections to be frivolous and sanctioned him for filing them. Pasquina did not appeal this decision.</p>\n<p>[7]  Section 523(a) provides that certain types of debts are not subject to the Bankruptcy Code's discharge provisions. More specifically, a debtor who files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy is not discharged from debt obtained by \"fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny,\" 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4), or by \"willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity,\" 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6).</p>\n<p>[8]  Title to the Florida residence was held only in the name of Cunningham's wife. The record indicates that the residence was purchased before Cunningham filed the bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p>[9]  A state is also allowed to \"opt-out\" of the federal exemption list, in which case the debtor is restricted to the exemptions provided by his state. <i>See </i><i>Owen,</i> 500 U.S. at 308, 111 S.Ct. 1833; 11 U.S.C. § 522(b)(1) (stating that a debtor could select from either list \"unless the State law that is applicable to the debtor . . . specifically does not so authorize\"). Massachusetts has not \"opted-out,\" thereby allowing its residents to elect the federal exemption list.</p>\n<p>[10]  While § 522(c) allows states to define their own exemptions under § 522(b), the Bankruptcy Code is not required to take those exemptions with all of the built-in limitations provided by the state exemption. <i>See </i><i>Owen,</i> 500 U.S. at 313-314, 111 S.Ct. 1833 (\"[W]e conclude that Florida's exclusion of certain liens from the scope of its homestead protection does not achieve a similar exclusion from the Bankruptcy Code's lien avoidance provision.\"). In <i>Weinstein,</i> taking our cue from <i>Owen,</i> we emphasized that \"the state's ability to define its exemptions is not absolute and must yield to conflicting policies in the Bankruptcy Code.\" 164 F.3d at 683. We decided in <i>Weinstein</i> that, \"because the Massachusetts prior contracted debt exception is not one of the types of debt specified in § 522(c), it is invalid in bankruptcy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 682.</p>\n<p>[11]  We do not break new ground with our decision here, which is consistent with the decisions of the few courts that have considered whether proceeds from the post-petition sale of exempt property are exempt from pre-petition nondischargeable debts. In <i>Reed,</i> as noted, the bankrupt debtor opted for the state exemption list and made a post-petition sale of the exempted homestead. 184 B.R. at 735. The Texas bankruptcy court found that \"[n]othing in section 522(c) even vaguely suggests that, as a precondition to enjoying the protections of that provision, the debtor must maintain the exempt character of the property.\" <i>Id.</i> at 738. Similarly, a bankruptcy appellate panel in the Ninth Circuit decided that Arizona's requirement that a debtor must reinvest the proceeds from his homestead within eighteen months of selling the homestead or lose the homestead exemption was not controlling because federal bankruptcy law does not allow post-petition uses of exempt property to change the previously established exemption status. <i>In re Herman,</i> 120 B.R. 127, 130 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[12]  Pasquina also asserts that he is a creditor of Cunningham's wife for reasons that are distinct from his claims against Cunningham, and that he should be able to collect the wife's share of the proceeds from the sale of the Johnson Street property because her share is not subject to the homestead exemption. When this claim was raised before the bankruptcy court, the court stated that it did not have jurisdiction over Cunningham's wife because she was not a party to the case. Pasquina does not address this jurisdictional point; hence we have no basis for reviewing his contention that he should be able to collect from Cunningham's wife.</p>\n\n</div>",

Pasquina.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Pasquina hired Cunningham, a former high school classmate, to work in his legal practice in 1982. In 1995, Pasquina was injured in a car accident and was unable to continue to practice law. Therefore, Pasquina wanted to sell his legal practice to Cunningham, but they were unable to come to an agreement. Pasquina then entered unsuccessful negotiations with Pierce &amp; Associates (\"Pierce\") for the sale of his practice. During the course of Pasquina's negotiations with Pierce, Cunningham misled both Pasquina and Pierce into believing that he would join Pierce. Instead, Cunningham secretly removed clients' files from Pasquina's records, covertly opened his own practice, and continued to represent Pasquina's former clients without paying Pasquina his share of the earned legal fees or reimbursing him for the expenses he had advanced the clients. In response to Pasquina's lawsuit, the Massachusetts Superior Court entered its initial judgement of $191,072.30 on June <span class=\"star-pagination\">*321</span> 20, 2001, having found that Cunningham breached his fiduciary duties to Pasquina during the period after the accident.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In November 2001, by filing a Declaration of Homestead with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Registry of Deeds, Cunningham designated his residence at 795 Johnson Street in North Andover, Massachusetts as his homestead.

Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1.<sup>[2]</sup> Soon after Cunningham's declaration of homestead, Pasquina attempted to collect upon his superior court judgment on December 12, 2002 by obtaining a $250,000 writ of attachment against the. Johnson Street property.</p>\n<p>On February 28, 2003, Cunningham filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 701 et. seq., and claimed in, the bankruptcy proceedings a $300,000 homestead exemption on the Johnson Street property pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 522(b).

In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion, the court found that the conversion of the homestead property into proceeds by means of voluntary sale does not remove the protections of § 522(c) from the property. <i>In re Cunningham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1816413\"><a href=\"/opinion/1816413/in-re-cunningham/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 557 (D.Mass.2006). On appeal to us, Pasquina claims that the district court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*323</span> incorrectly applied federal bankruptcy law to protect funds that should have been available to satisfy a nondischargeable debt. He argues that Massachusetts state law governs the disposition of the proceeds from the voluntary sale of a homestead and that these proceeds became subject to pre-petition debts for which the debtor remains liable. As the relevant facts are undisputed and the issue before us turns entirely on the interpretation of law, our review is plenary. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Hyde,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202878\"><a href=\"/opinion/202878/united-states-v-hyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 106 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The bankruptcy estate, created upon the filing of a Chapter 7 petition, is comprised of a debtor's legal and equitable interests in property at the time of the petition. <i>Owen v. Owen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112598\"><a href=\"/opinion/112598/owen-v-owen/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 308, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112598\"><a href=\"/opinion/112598/owen-v-owen/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Typically, assets in the estate are distributed to creditors pursuant to a statutory scheme that assigns priorities to various types of debt. However, particular assets, including a homestead, may be exempted from the bankruptcy estate and retained by the debtor in accordance with the federal Bankruptcy Code. \"An exemption is an interest withdrawn from the estate (and hence from the creditors) for the benefit of the debtor.\" <i>Id.</i> Under § 522(b), a debtor can choose to use either the federal list of exemptions set forth in § 522(d) or the exemptions provided by his state.<sup>[9]</sup><i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. § 522(b), (d); <i>Owen,</i> 500 U.S. at 308, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112598\"><a href=\"/opinion/112598/owen-v-owen/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1833</span></a></span>. Cunningham opted to use Massachusetts's exemption list.</p>\n<p>Pasquina objected to Cunningham's claim of a homestead exemption and his motion to avoid Pasquina's judicial lien, 11 U.S.C. § 522(c).<sup>[10]</sup> The bankruptcy court properly rejected Pasquina's claims, thereby permanently immunizing the homestead from pre-bankruptcy debt by withdrawing the property from the bankruptcy estate. Property that is properly exempted under § 522 is immunized against liability for prebankruptcy debts, subject only to a few exceptions. Those exceptions include: (1) debt from certain taxes and customs duties, (2) debt related to domestic support obligations, (3) liens that cannot be avoided or voided, including tax liens, and (4) debts for a breach of fiduciary duty to a federal depository institution. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. § 522(c)(1)-(3); <i>In re Weinstein,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198278\"><a href=\"/opinion/198278/patriot-portfolio-v-weinstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, 682 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>Pasquina's claim that the post-petition voluntary sale of the exempt property makes the proceeds of the sale available to satisfy a nondischargeable pre-petition debt is at odds with the immunizing effect of § 522(c). Section 522(c) states: \"[P]roperty exempted under this section is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*324</span> not liable <i>during or after</i> the case for any debt of the debtor that arose . . . before' the commencement of the case . .\" 11 U.S.C. § 522(c)(emphasis added). By the plain language of the statute, exemptions under § 522(c) persist beyond the termination of the case, making the property subject to an exemption unavailable for the satisfaction of pre-petition debt (other than for the categories of debt noted in § 522(c) itself). There is only one other proviso to this rule: exempted property is not liable during or after the case \"[u]nless the case is dismissed.\" <i>Id.</i> Cunningham's bankruptcy case was not dismissed; it was adjudicated.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is a basic principle of bankruptcy law that exemptions are determined when a petition is filed. <i>In re Friedman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2023991\"><a href=\"/opinion/2023991/in-re-friedman/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 276 (Bankr. E.D.Pa.1984) (\"It is hornbook bankruptcy law that a debtor's exemptions are determined as of the time of the filing of his petition.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Cunningham,</i> 354 B.R. at 553. To interpret § 522(c) as conferring merely an ephemeral exemption, subject to post-termination events, would undermine that basic principle and its relationship to the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has stated that \"a central purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is to provide a procedure by which certain insolvent debtors can reorder their affairs, make peace with their creditors, and enjoy `a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.'\" <i>Grogan v. Garner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112522\"><a href=\"/opinion/112522/grogan-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 286, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112522\"><a href=\"/opinion/112522/grogan-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></span> (1934)). The Bankruptcy. Code facilitates a fresh start, in part, by allowing property properly exempted under § 522 to be immunized against liability for pre-petition debts. <i>See </i><i>Owen,</i> 500 U.S. at 309, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112598\"><a href=\"/opinion/112598/owen-v-owen/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1833</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The efficacy of the fresh start policy requires finality that allows a debtor to rebuild his life without fear of lingering creditors. In <i>In re Reed,</i> a Texas debtor sold his homestead, which he had taken as an exemption pursuant to the state exemption list, during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1869607\"><a href=\"/opinion/1869607/in-re-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span> (Bankr. W.D.Tex.1995). The trustee for the bankruptcy estate argued that the post-petition sale of the exempt homestead property made the proceeds available to satisfy pre-petition debt. The bankruptcy court disagreed. <i>Id.</i> at 738-39. If \"estates could be reopened to administer such proceeds at virtually any time, [the reopening would be] robbing bankruptcy administration of any sort of meaningful finality, and robbing bankruptcy discharge of its efficacy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 738.</p>\n<p>Pasquina argues that the fresh start and finality interests are inapplicable in this case because Cunningham is a dishonest debtor unworthy of the Bankruptcy Code's protection. It is simply unfair, Pasquina argues, to limit his ability to collect on his judgement against Cunningham. Congress has not been unresponsive to such concerns. When Congress chose to impose limits on the fresh start policy, it did so by providing explicitly that certain debts are nondischargeable. <i>See</i> 11 U.S.C. § 523(a); Grogan, 498 U.S. at 287, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112522\"><a href=\"/opinion/112522/grogan-v-garner/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span> (finding that by allowing certain debts to be nondischargeable, such as \"child support, alimony, and certain unpaid educational loans and taxes, as well as liabilities for fraud[,] Congress evidently concluded that the creditors' interest in recovering full payment of debts in these categories outweighed the debtors' interest in a complete fresh start\"). In fact, Pasquina successfully argued to the bankruptcy court that Cunningham's debt arising from the Massachusetts Superior Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*325</span> judgement in favor of Pasquina was nondischargeable because of Cunningham's fraudulent conduct. However, in deciding which pre-petition debts could be satisfied from otherwise exempt property, Congress did not list such a nondischargeable debt in the itemization set forth in § 522(c)(1)(3). Therefore, in asking us to limit the protections afforded Cunningham because he is a dishonest debtor, Pasquina is effectively asking us to rewrite § 522(c). We cannot do that.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm</i> the district court's judgement that the post-petition sale of Cunningham's home, for which he had obtained a homestead exemption under the law of Massachusetts, did not cause the proceeds of the sale to lose their exempt status under the Bankruptcy Code and become subject to Pasquina's pre-petition nondischargeable debt.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The court adjusted its judgement on April 1, 2003 to account for the revenue that Cunningham had subsequently received from cases that originated with Pasquina. The final judgment was $291,554.55 with the accumulation of interest.</p>\n<p>[2]  In 2004, the homestead protection increased from $300,000 to $500,000. <i>See</i> 2004 Mass. Legis. Serv. ch. 218. Since Cunningham filed for bankruptcy prior to the increase, his homestead exemption is limited to $300,000.</p>\n<p>[3]  As our chronology indicates, Pasquina obtained the superior court judgment against Cunningham prior to Cunningham's filing of the declaration of homestead. The Massachusetts Homestead Act contains an exception for \"a debt contracted prior to the acquisition of said estate of homestead.\" However, we ruled in <i>In re Weinstein</i> that the Massachusetts prior debt exception is pre-empted by the Bankruptcy Code, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198278\"><a href=\"/opinion/198278/patriot-portfolio-v-weinstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, 682 (1st Cir.1999). Understandably, Pasquina does not invoke the Massachusetts prior contracted debt exception in his arguments here.</p>\n<p>[4]  While a debtor can typically avoid the fixing of a judicial lien on his interest in exempt property, he cannot avoid the fixing of a judicial lien for domestic support obligations. 11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>[5]  Cunningham stated in this motion that the Johnson Street property was appraised at $495,000 and was subject to $260,000 in outstanding mortgages. Therefore, absent the lien, his equity interest in the property would be less than $235,000, all of which would be eligible for the homestead exemption:</p>\n<p>[6]  For these reasons, the bankruptcy court deemed Pasquina's objections to be frivolous and sanctioned him for filing them. Pasquina did not appeal this decision.</p>\n<p>[7]  Section 523(a) provides that certain types of debts are not subject to the Bankruptcy Code's discharge provisions. More specifically, a debtor who files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy is not discharged from debt obtained by \"fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny,\" 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(4), or by \"willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity,\" 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(6).</p>\n<p>[8]  Title to the Florida residence was held only in the name of Cunningham's wife. The record indicates that the residence was purchased before Cunningham filed the bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p>[9]  A state is also allowed to \"opt-out\" of the federal exemption list, in which case the debtor is restricted to the exemptions provided by his state. <i>See </i><i>Owen,</i> 500 U.S. at 308, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112598\"><a href=\"/opinion/112598/owen-v-owen/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1833</span></a></span>; 11 U.S.C. § 522(b)(1) (stating that a debtor could select from either list \"unless the State law that is applicable to the debtor . . . specifically does not so authorize\"). Massachusetts has not \"opted-out,\" thereby allowing its residents to elect the federal exemption list.</p>\n<p>[10]  While § 522(c) allows states to define their own exemptions under § 522(b), the Bankruptcy Code is not required to take those exemptions with all of the built-in limitations provided by the state exemption. <i>See </i><i>Owen,</i> 500 U.S. at 313-314, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112598\"><a href=\"/opinion/112598/owen-v-owen/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1833</span></a></span> (\"[W]e conclude that Florida's exclusion of certain liens from the scope of its homestead protection does not achieve a similar exclusion from the Bankruptcy Code's lien avoidance provision.\"). In <i>Weinstein,</i> taking our cue from <i>Owen,</i> we emphasized that \"the state's ability to define its exemptions is not absolute and must yield to conflicting policies in the Bankruptcy Code.\" 164 F.3d at 683. We decided in <i>Weinstein</i> that, \"because the Massachusetts prior contracted debt exception is not one of the types of debt specified in § 522(c), it is invalid in bankruptcy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 682.</p>\n<p>[11]  We do not break new ground with our decision here, which is consistent with the decisions of the few courts that have considered whether proceeds from the post-petition sale of exempt property are exempt from pre-petition nondischargeable debts. In <i>Reed,</i> as noted, the bankrupt debtor opted for the state exemption list and made a post-petition sale of the exempted homestead. 184 B.R. at 735. The Texas bankruptcy court found that \"[n]othing in section 522(c) even vaguely suggests that, as a precondition to enjoying the protections of that provision, the debtor must maintain the exempt character of the property.\" <i>Id.</i> at 738. Similarly, a bankruptcy appellate panel in the Ninth Circuit decided that Arizona's requirement that a debtor must reinvest the proceeds from his homestead within eighteen months of selling the homestead or lose the homestead exemption was not controlling because federal bankruptcy law does not allow post-petition uses of exempt property to change the previously established exemption status. <i>In re Herman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1902567\"><a href=\"/opinion/1902567/in-re-herman/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 130 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p>[12]  Pasquina also asserts that he is a creditor of Cunningham's wife for reasons that are distinct from his claims against Cunningham, and that he should be able to collect the wife's share of the proceeds from the sale of the Johnson Street property because her share is not subject to the homestead exemption. When this claim was raised before the bankruptcy court, the court stated that it did not have jurisdiction over Cunningham's wife because she was not a party to the case. Pasquina does not address this jurisdictional point; hence we have no basis for reviewing his contention that he should be able to collect from Cunningham's wife.</p>\n\n</div>",
