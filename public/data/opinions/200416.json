Appellant Ivette Santiago-Marrero claims on\n\nappeal     that    the   district   court   erroneously   denied       her   the\n\nopportunity to amend her discrimination complaint.                She alleges\n\nthat an employee of the federal government harassed her and caused\n\nher to be terminated from her job \"because she was a Puerto Rican\n\nwho could not speak English.\"           We vacate the dismissal of her\n\ncomplaint against the federal defendants and remand for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n      Briefly summarized, the facts as alleged in the complaint are\n\nas follows.       Appellant was hired in early 2000 by Estée Lauder,\n\nInc., to work as a cosmetics salesperson at the Fort Buchanan Post\n\nExchange, a store run by the Army & Air Force Exchange Service\n\n(AAFES).1     Santiago-Marrero speaks virtually no English, and she\n\nroutinely referred non-Spanish speaking customers to her bilingual\n\nsupervisor.       In June 2001, after appellant had been on the job for\n\nabout eighteen months, a new manager, Kevin Beason, took over at\n\nthe   Post   Exchange.      Appellant   claims   that   Beason,    a    federal\n\nemployee, repeatedly harassed her because of her inability to speak\n\nEnglish and ultimately denied her access to the Post Exchange by\n\nforcing her to return her ID, thus barring her from her work site.\n\nEstée Lauder told appellant that the company did not have a\n\n\n\n      1\n       The AAFES is operated under the Department of Defense, and\nits personnel are federal employees. See Army & Air Force Exch.\nServ. v. Sheehan, 456 U.S. 728, 733, 736 (1982); Honeycutt v. Long,\n861 F.2d 1346, 1349 n.3 (5th Cir. 1988).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fposition for her at any other location, and she therefore was\n\nterminated.\n\n     Appellant filed suit on December 27, 2001 against the United\n\nStates, Beason, and Estée Lauder, Inc.,2 claiming violations of\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to -\n\ne17, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§\n\n621-634,3 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nShe alleged in her complaint that Beason \"maliciously maneuvered\n\nthis entire ordeal\" because of her status as a non-English speaking\n\nPuerto Rican.   Appellant also had filed an administrative claim\n\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act in October 2001.\n\n     The district court dismissed the claims against Beason and the\n\nUnited States with prejudice, and dismissed the claims against\n\nEstée Lauder without prejudice, allowing appellant to pursue claims\n\nagainst her employer under Puerto Rico law in commonwealth courts.\n\nThe court stated that neither the Title VII nor the ADEA claim was\n\nviable against the United States (or Beason) because appellant was\n\nnot employed by the government.   Although appellant had asked in\n\nher opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss for leave to amend\n\n\n\n     2\n       The complaint also was filed on behalf of appellant's\nhusband and their conjugal partnership, and against Beason's wife\nand their conjugal partnership. For simplicity, we refer in both\ninstances only to the primary party.\n     3\n       The ADEA claim rests on the allegation that appellant's\nreplacement at the Post Exchange was younger than she. No other\nfacts are alleged to suggest that age played any role in this case.\n\n                               -3-\n\fher complaint to add an FTCA claim, and further urged that the\n\ncourt take jurisdiction of her claims under Bivens v. Six Unknown\n\nFed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971),4 the district court did\n\nnot receive that memorandum before its decision.5\n\n     The   court,   however,   did    review   the   memorandum   when   it\n\nconsidered appellant's motion for reconsideration and stated that\n\nnothing in the opposition justified vacating its earlier ruling.\n\nIn denying the request to amend, the court stated:\n\n     Almost a year after the filing of the complaint\n     plaintiffs attempt to recast their complaint against the\n     United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act . . . .\n     In the Motion for Reconsideration they mention, in\n     passing, to \"permit the present case to continue as a\n     Biven's case.\" . . . . There is no justification for\n     seeking amendment of the complaint for this purpose at\n     this late stage of the proceedings.    Accordingly, the\n     request to amend complaint . . . . is DENIED[.]\n\n     Appellant does not argue that the court erred in concluding\n\nthat she did not have viable claims against the federal defendants\n\nunder either Title VII or the ADEA.            Nor does she contest the\n\ncourt's decision to dismiss without prejudice the federal claims\n\nagainst Estée Lauder.   Her only contention – and the only issue we\n\n\n\n     4\n       In Bivens, the Supreme Court \"recognized for the first time\nan implied private action for damages against federal officers\nalleged to have violated a citizen's constitutional rights.\" Corr.\nServs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 122 S. Ct. 515, 519 (2001).\n     5\n       There was some confusion over the due date for appellant's\nopposition, which was filed on April 29, 2002 – the day before the\ncourt signed its decision on the motion to dismiss – but the court\neventually considered the memorandum, and so its timing proved to\nbe of no consequence.\n\n                                     -4-\n\faddress – is whether the court wrongly denied her the opportunity\n\nto amend her complaint to include FTCA and Bivens claims.\n\n     Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), a litigant may\n\namend a pleading once as a matter of right before a responsive\n\npleading is filed and subsequently only if the parties consent or\n\n\"by leave of court.\"    Judge v. City of Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 79 (lst\n\nCir. 1998); Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).           Here, appellant filed a first\n\namended    complaint   approximately        one   month   after   her    original\n\ncomplaint to correct a typographical error and a defendant's name,\n\nand she therefore needed the court's permission before amending\n\nagain.\n\n     A district court's denial of leave to amend is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion, Judge, 160 F.3d at 79, but we examine its\n\ndecision \"through the prism of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n15(a), which indicates that leave to amend a complaint 'shall be\n\nfreely given    when   justice   so    requires,'\"        Hatch v.      Dep't   for\n\nChildren, Youth & Their Families, 274 F.3d 12, 19 (lst Cir. 2001).\n\n\"In practice, this means that the denial of such a motion will be\n\nupheld so long as the record evinces an arguably adequate basis for\n\nthe court's decision (e.g., futility, bad faith, undue delay, or a\n\ndilatory motive on the movant's part).\"             Id.\n\n     The    district   court   invoked       timeliness     concerns     when   it\n\nrejected appellant's attempt to add new claims \"at this late stage\n\nof the proceedings,\" but it relied on the mistaken observation that\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthe complaint had been filed almost a year earlier.                  In reality,\n\nthe complaint had been filed just four months before the requested\n\namendment,6 a lapse in time that strikes us as fairly brief.                    In\n\naddition,   the     court   twice   implied   that      it   might   have    ruled\n\ndifferently had appellant timely asserted a Bivens claim.                   In its\n\noriginal    grant    of   defendants'     motion   to    dismiss,     the   court\n\nexpressly noted that \"[t]he complaint is not cast in the terms of\n\na Bivens claim against Mr. Beason.\"           And in ruling on the motion\n\nfor reconsideration, as noted earlier, the court stated that there\n\nwas no justification for allowing transformation of the case to one\n\nbased on Bivens or the FTCA at that \"late\" date.\n\n     In    light    of    the   court's   timing   mistake,7     and    its    own\n\nindication that it might have acted differently had it viewed the\n\nBivens' claim as timely raised, we vacate the dismissal of the\n\nclaims against the federal defendants.             As we cannot say without\n\nsome inquiry that amendment would be futile, and no other basis for\n\ndismissing the complaint is apparent, we are unable to affirm the\n\ncourt's decision on an alternative ground.           See Correa-Martinez v.\n\n\n     6\n       As noted earlier, the complaint was filed on December 27,\n2001.   Appellant's opposition to the motion to dismiss, which\ncontained the request to amend, was filed on April 29, 2002.\n     7\n        We note that the court also understated appellant's\ninvocation of Bivens. Although the court correctly noted that the\ntwo-page motion for reconsideration contained only a brief request\nto allow the case to proceed as a Bivens action, that motion\nexplicitly referred to the earlier opposition to the motion to\ndismiss, in which appellant presented a more developed Bivens\nargument.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fArrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (lst Cir. 1990) (\"[W]e may\n\naffirm a dismissal for failure to state a claim only if it clearly\n\nappears, according to the facts alleged, that the plaintiff cannot\n\nrecover on any viable theory.\").              We emphasize, however, that we\n\nhave not substantively explored appellant's new legal claims, and\n\nthus offer no view on their viability.8\n\n      We do offer two additional observations: first, in asserting\n\na   constitutional     claim,   appellant       has   repeatedly   invoked   the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.      That provision, of course, speaks only to\n\nthe conduct of state officials and is inapplicable to actions by\n\nfederal officials.      See, e.g., Dry v. United States, 235 F.3d 1249,\n\n1255 (10th Cir. 2000) (Fourteenth Amendment is \"applicable only to\n\nactions   by   state    and     local    entities,      not   by   the   federal\n\ngovernment.\").    Any constitutionally based discrimination claim\n\nbrought by appellant must therefore be cognizable under the Fifth\n\nAmendment.     See Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 248-49 (1979)\n\n(plaintiff alleging gender discrimination may bring Bivens action\n\n\n\n      8\n       Defendants argue that a tort claim based on Beason's\ninterference with appellant's employment is barred by a specific\nexclusion in the FTCA for \"[a]ny claim arising out of . . .\ninterference with contract rights,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h).        In\naddition, they point out that she filed her complaint before the\nexpiration of the six-month waiting period for FTCA claims. See 28\nU.S.C. § 2675(a). As for the constitutional claim, appellant's\nmotion opposing dismissal indicates that it is based on the use of\nlanguage as a proxy for national origin discrimination. It is up\nto the district court to determine in the first instance whether,\non the facts alleged, these claims provide a viable basis for\nrecovery.\n\n                                        -7-\n\ffor Fifth Amendment violation). Second, our decision is a vacatur,\n\nnot a reversal; it does not require the district court to allow\n\nappellant the opportunity to amend her complaint if, after further\n\nreview, the court concludes that appellant's proposed amended\n\ncomplaint fails to set forth \"a general scenario which, if proven,\n\nwould entitle the plaintiff to relief against the defendant on some\n\ncognizable theory,\" Hatch, 274 F.3d at 19, or fails for any other\n\nreason.\n\n     The judgment against the federal defendants is vacated and the\n\ncase is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

Here, appellant filed a first\n\namended    complaint   approximately        one   month   after   her    original\n\ncomplaint to correct a typographical error and a defendant's name,\n\nand she therefore needed the court's permission before amending\n\nagain.\n\n     A district court's denial of leave to amend is reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion, Judge, 160 F.3d at 79, but we examine its\n\ndecision \"through the prism of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n15(a), which indicates that leave to amend a complaint 'shall be\n\nfreely given    when   justice   so    requires,'\"        Hatch v.

In reality,\n\nthe complaint had been filed just four months before the requested\n\namendment,6 a lapse in time that strikes us as fairly brief.                    In\n\naddition,   the     court   twice   implied   that      it   might   have    ruled\n\ndifferently had appellant timely asserted a Bivens claim.                   In its\n\noriginal    grant    of   defendants'     motion   to    dismiss,     the   court\n\nexpressly noted that \"[t]he complaint is not cast in the terms of\n\na Bivens claim against Mr. Beason.\"           And in ruling on the motion\n\nfor reconsideration, as noted earlier, the court stated that there\n\nwas no justification for allowing transformation of the case to one\n\nbased on Bivens or the FTCA at that \"late\" date.\n\n     In    light    of    the   court's   timing   mistake,7     and    its    own\n\nindication that it might have acted differently had it viewed the\n\nBivens' claim as timely raised, we vacate the dismissal of the\n\nclaims against the federal defendants.             As we cannot say without\n\nsome inquiry that amendment would be futile, and no other basis for\n\ndismissing the complaint is apparent, we are unable to affirm the\n\ncourt's decision on an alternative ground.           See Correa-Martinez v.\n\n\n     6\n       As noted earlier, the complaint was filed on December 27,\n2001.   Appellant's opposition to the motion to dismiss, which\ncontained the request to amend, was filed on April 29, 2002.\n     7\n        We note that the court also understated appellant's\ninvocation of Bivens. Although the court correctly noted that the\ntwo-page motion for reconsideration contained only a brief request\nto allow the case to proceed as a Bivens action, that motion\nexplicitly referred to the earlier opposition to the motion to\ndismiss, in which appellant presented a more developed Bivens\nargument.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fArrillaga-Belendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (lst Cir. 1990) (\"[W]e may\n\naffirm a dismissal for failure to state a claim only if it clearly\n\nappears, according to the facts alleged, that the plaintiff cannot\n\nrecover on any viable theory.\").              We emphasize, however, that we\n\nhave not substantively explored appellant's new legal claims, and\n\nthus offer no view on their viability.8\n\n      We do offer two additional observations: first, in asserting\n\na   constitutional     claim,   appellant       has   repeatedly   invoked   the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.      That provision, of course, speaks only to\n\nthe conduct of state officials and is inapplicable to actions by\n\nfederal officials.      See, e.g., Dry v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160520\"><a href=\"/opinion/160520/dry-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1255 (10th Cir. 2000) (Fourteenth Amendment is \"applicable only to\n\nactions   by   state    and     local    entities,      not   by   the   federal\n\ngovernment.\").    Any constitutionally based discrimination claim\n\nbrought by appellant must therefore be cognizable under the Fifth\n\nAmendment.     See Davis v. Passman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248-49 (1979)\n\n(plaintiff alleging gender discrimination may bring Bivens action\n\n\n\n      8\n       Defendants argue that a tort claim based on Beason's\ninterference with appellant's employment is barred by a specific\nexclusion in the FTCA for \"[a]ny claim arising out of . . .\ninterference with contract rights,\" 28 U.S.C. § 2680(h).        In\naddition, they point out that she filed her complaint before the\nexpiration of the six-month waiting period for FTCA claims. See 28\nU.S.C. § 2675(a). As for the constitutional claim, appellant's\nmotion opposing dismissal indicates that it is based on the use of\nlanguage as a proxy for national origin discrimination. It is up\nto the district court to determine in the first instance whether,\non the facts alleged, these claims provide a viable basis for\nrecovery.\n\n                                        -7-\n\ffor Fifth Amendment violation). Second, our decision is a vacatur,\n\nnot a reversal; it does not require the district court to allow\n\nappellant the opportunity to amend her complaint if, after further\n\nreview, the court concludes that appellant's proposed amended\n\ncomplaint fails to set forth \"a general scenario which, if proven,\n\nwould entitle the plaintiff to relief against the defendant on some\n\ncognizable theory,\" Hatch, 274 F.3d at 19, or fails for any other\n\nreason.\n\n     The judgment against the federal defendants is vacated and the\n\ncase is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f</pre>",
