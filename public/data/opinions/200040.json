GERVASIO ET AL.,\n\n                      Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n        [Hon. Robert B. Collings, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Bownes and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Dana A. Curhan for appellants.\n     Robert L. Rossi, with whom Odin P. Anderson was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           April 17, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam. The litigation underlying this appeal arises\n\nout of failed business dealings between Business Forms, Inc. (BFI),\n\nSteven J. Gervasio, and several entities organized by Gervasio.\n\nWhen the transaction soured, BFI sued Gervasio and an affiliated\n\nentity, Fast Forms Inc. (FFI), for breach of a non-competition\n\nagreement, conversion, unfair trade practices, and the like.1            By\n\nconsent of the parties, see 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), the case was tried\n\nto a magistrate judge.     The judge conducted a six-day bench trial\n\nanent    BFI's   allegations   and   the   defendants'   rejoinders.    He\n\nreserved decision and thereafter wrote a meticulously reasoned\n\nrescript in which he resolved both the factual and legal issues in\n\nBFI's favor, and entered a substantial judgment against Gervasio\n\nand FFI.    See BFI v. Gervasio, No. 94-10645, slip op. (D. Mass.\n\nMar. 29, 2001).     This appeal followed.\n\n            Having read the record, considered the parties' briefs,\n\nand entertained oral argument, we find no basis to disturb the\n\nmagistrate judge's exegetic decision.        To the precise contrary, we\n\nregard this as a suitable occasion to act on our conviction that an\n\nappellate court's time should not be spent reinventing well-\n\nfashioned wheels.     Where, as here, a trial judge crafts a first-\n\nrate opinion, a reviewing court ought not wax longiloquent for no\n\nmore compelling reason than to hear its own words resonate.            See,\n\n\n\n     1\n      BFI also sued Chesley Business Forms, Ltd., but the issues on\nappeal do not concern that defendant.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fe.g., Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 248 F.3d 40, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d\n\n218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996); Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas de P.R.,\n\nLocal 901, 74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); In re San Juan Dupont\n\nPlaza   Hotel   Fire    Litig.,   989    F.2d   36,   38   (1st   Cir.   1993).\n\nConsequently, we affirm the judgment for substantially the reasons\n\nelucidated in the opinion below. We add only three brief comments.\n\n           First:      The defendants acknowledge that — apart from his\n\nevaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence — the magistrate\n\njudge committed no error in any of his legal rulings.                      They\n\nconcentrate instead on his rendition of the facts.            Although their\n\nbriefs contain much sound and fury, they amount, at bottom, to a\n\nplea that we reweigh the facts de novo.               That plea defies our\n\nstandard of review, which is much more circumscribed.\n\n           Following a bench trial, an appellate court is not\n\njustified in rejecting the trial court's \"findings of fact or\n\nconclusions drawn therefrom unless, on the whole of the record,\n\n[the court of appeals] forms a strong, unyielding belief that a\n\nmistake has been made.\" Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d\n\n148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990).         Put another way, such findings can be\n\noverturned only for clear error.           See id. (collecting cases); see\n\nalso Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).             The instant record, read from a\n\nneutral coign of vantage, does not yield a conviction that a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fmistake has been made, and no hint of any error — clear or\n\notherwise — is apparent.\n\n            Second:     The defendants' challenge to the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence presents a question of law, which engenders de novo\n\nreview.    Sierra Fria Corp. v. Evans, 127 F.3d 175, 181 n.2 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); Smith v. F.W. Morse & Co., 76 F.3d 413, 420 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).    Here, however, the challenge is baseless.\n\n            A sufficiency challenge demands that we peruse the entire\n\nrecord (including the inferences reasonably extractable therefrom)\n\nin the light most hospitable to the plaintiff, without gauging\n\nwitness credibility, resolving testimonial conflicts, or assaying\n\nthe relative quality of the proof. Zimmerman v. Direct Fed. Credit\n\nUnion, 262 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 2001); Correa v. Hosp. San\n\nFrancisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1191 (1st Cir. 1995).                 So long as the\n\ntrial court's interpretation of the evidence is plausible, we may\n\nnot disturb it (whether or not we, if sitting as the triers of\n\nfact,    would   have   reached   the   same   conclusion).       Peckham    v.\n\nContinental Cas. Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 830, 840 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\"Where there      are   two   permissible   views   of   the    evidence,   the\n\nfactfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Id.\n\n(quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574\n\n(1985)).\n\n            The magistrate judge's findings pass through this screen\n\nwith ease:       the record, viewed in the requisite light, contains\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fample evidence of Gervasio's perfidy and of FFI's involvement in\n\nprohibited activities.       No more is exigible.\n\n            Third:   Relatedly, the defendants say that BFI did not\n\nprove that Gervasio acted in bad faith.           But state of mind is\n\ntypically inferred from circumstantial evidence, see Harte-Hanks\n\nCommunications, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 668 (1989); Am.\n\nCommunications Ass'n v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 411 (1950), and the\n\ncircumstances   here   are    adequate   to   ground   an   inference   that\n\nGervasio acted knowingly and with scurrilous intent (and, thus, are\n\nadequate to ground a finding of liability on all the counts lodged\n\nagainst him, including the chapter 93A count).\n\n            We need go no further.       Whether or not this was a close\n\ncase below — that is a matter on which we take no view — it is\n\nplainly not a close case on appeal.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
