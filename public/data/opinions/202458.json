Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                    Torruella, Lynch, and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Emanuel Howard for petitioner.\n     Susanne G. Reardon, Assistant Attorney General, with whom\nThomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief, for respondent.\n\n\n\n                          October 18, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.           John Evans was convicted in\n\nMassachusetts state court of the first-degree murder of Lyle\n\nJackson and was sentenced to life in prison.          His conviction was\n\naffirmed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC).           See\n\nCommonwealth v. Evans, 786 N.E.2d 375, 380 (Mass. 2003).              His\n\nsubsequent petition in federal district court for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus was denied. See Evans v. Verdini, No. Civ.A. 04-10323, 2005\n\nWL 1638119, at *3 (D. Mass. Jul. 13, 2005).\n\n            Evans appeals from that denial.          He argues that the\n\nexclusion   of   certain    defense    witness   testimony   concerning   a\n\nrecanted prior statement violated his Sixth Amendment right to\n\npresent a defense.         He also argues that the state prosecutor\n\nviolated the rule that a prosecutor may not impeach his own witness\n\nas a ploy for the introduction of inadmissible evidence, and that\n\nthis violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights.\n\nThese arguments cause us to explore the topic of impeachment and\n\nrecanted statements.\n\n            We reject Evans's claims and affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of the petition.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            We briefly recount the facts as recited in detail in\n\nCommonwealth v. Evans, 786 N.E.2d at 381.\n\n            In the early morning of January 25, 1995, Jackson and his\n\nfriend, Marcello Holliday, were at Cortee's, a nightclub in the\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fDorchester area of Boston.      Evans also was at Cortee's with his\n\nbrother Jimmy Evans (Jimmy) and two friends, Robert Brown and\n\nRonald Tinsley.     Around 1:45 a.m., Jackson and Holliday left\n\nCortee's for Walaikum's, a nearby restaurant.            They arrived at\n\napproximately 2:20 a.m.      About fifteen minutes later, Evans, his\n\nbrother, Brown, and Tinsley entered Walaikum's, then crowded with\n\ncustomers. Evans, Jimmy, Brown, and Tinsley left after a minute or\n\nso, but quickly reentered the restaurant.           Tinsley began talking\n\nwith a young woman, and Brown said to Evans and Jimmy, \"That's one\n\nof them right there.\"   After verifying that Brown was referring to\n\nJackson, Jimmy drew a gun and approached Jackson, who backed away,\n\nstumbled, crawled into a corner, and began begging for his life.\n\nJimmy then shot at Jackson four or five times.         After seeing Jimmy\n\nshoot at Jackson, Willy Wiggins, who owned Walaikum's, went to the\n\nback of the restaurant and called the police.\n\n           Alton   Clarke,   another    customer,   tried   to   leave   the\n\nrestaurant and was confronted by Evans, who also was armed with a\n\nhandgun.   Evans allowed Clarke to leave once he stated that he had\n\nnothing to do with Jackson. Evans then approached Jackson and shot\n\nat him once.\n\n           Evans, Jimmy, Brown, and Tinsley left Walaikum's, and a\n\ncar chase ensued.    All four were apprehended by police after they\n\nturned into a dead-end street and tried to flee on foot.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f              Jackson died from an infection related to his gunshot\n\nwounds.      He had been shot three times.\n\n              The Evans brothers, Brown, and Tinsley were charged with\n\nmurder by joint venture and tried together before a jury.               At\n\ntrial, the government introduced the testimony of Marvette Neal,\n\nwho   knew    Jackson,   Evans,   and   Jimmy.   Neal   had   told   police\n\napproximately two weeks after the shooting that he had seen both\n\nEvans and his brother shoot at Jackson in Walaikum's.          Later that\n\nmonth, however, when he testified before the grand jury considering\n\nthe charges against Evans, Neal stated only that he had seen Evans\n\nand Jimmy inside Cortee's and Walaikum's.        By the time of Evans's\n\ntrial, in the fall of 1996, Neal had backed further away from his\n\ninitial statement.       During voir dire, Neal stated that he could\n\nrecall no more than that he had seen Jackson at Cortee's and\n\nWalaikum's. He testified that he did not remember making his prior\n\nstatement to police, that he did not see Evans or Jimmy shoot\n\nJackson, and that he did not tell police anything to that effect.\n\n              After voir dire, the prosecution proceeded with Neal as\n\na witness; Neal testified before the jury that he could not recall\n\nhaving seen Evans or Jimmy at Cortee's or Walaikum's on the night\n\nin question.       The trial judge, over objection, permitted the\n\ngovernment to introduce Neal's grand jury testimony to the contrary\n\nas substantive evidence.      The government also was permitted, again\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fover objection, to lay a foundation to impeach Neal with his prior\n\ninconsistent statement to the police.\n\n            The defense then cross-examined Neal.        In particular,\n\nEvans's counsel asked Neal whether he had seen Evans or his brother\n\nwith a gun on the night of the shooting.        Neal testified that he\n\nhad not.\n\n            The next day, the government called Detective Kenneth\n\nDorch, who had taken Neal's initial statement.          Detective Dorch\n\ntestified to Neal's prior inconsistent statement -- that is, that\n\nNeal had told him that he had seen Evans shoot at Jackson.            The\n\ntrial judge instructed the jury six times during Detective Dorch's\n\ntestimony that the prior statement was admitted only for the\n\npurpose of impeachment and was not to be considered substantive\n\nevidence.\n\n            During his defense case, Evans sought to introduce the\n\ntestimony of Eddie Hawkins, who had shared a jail cell with Tinsley\n\nafter the shooting.     Hawkins had made a pre-trial statement to\n\npolice that Tinsley, while in jail, had admitted to shooting\n\nJackson and had acknowledged that he had intended to accept a plea\n\nbargain until he learned that the Commonwealth could place him only\n\nin the getaway car and not in Walaikum's.         However, during voir\n\ndire   Hawkins   repudiated   his   prior   statement   about   Tinsley's\n\nconfession and stated that he had fabricated the story of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fconfession1 to gain more favorable treatment in his own pending\n\ncase.    As a result of Hawkins's voir dire testimony, the trial\n\njudge ruled that Evans's attorney could not question Hawkins about\n\nhis conversation with Tinsley other than to ask whether they had\n\ndiscussed the pending charges against Tinsley.               Evans then opted\n\nnot to call Hawkins.\n\n           On November 8, 1996, Evans was convicted of first-degree\n\nmurder on theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity\n\nand cruelty.2    He also was found guilty of two charges of illegally\n\npossessing   ammunition,     one   charge   of    illegally     discharging    a\n\nfirearm within five hundred feet of a building, two charges of\n\nillegally possessing a firearm, two charges of assault and battery\n\nwith a dangerous weapon, and various motor vehicle charges.                  The\n\ntrial    judge   sentenced   Evans    to    a    mandatory      term   of   life\n\nimprisonment on the murder conviction, and to concurrent terms of\n\nfour to five years for the illegal possession of a firearm and\n\nassault and battery convictions. The other convictions were placed\n\non file with Evans's consent.\n\n           Evans filed a timely notice of appeal and a motion for a\n\nnew trial.       The motion for a new trial was denied, and Evans\n\n\n\n     1\n          Hawkins did not recant his statements about Tinsley's\nhaving changed his mind about accepting a plea bargain.\n     2\n           Jimmy    also   was   convicted.       Brown   and    Tinsley    were\nacquitted.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fappealed.       His direct appeal to the SJC was consolidated with his\n\nappeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial.                          The SJC\n\naffirmed the convictions and the denial of the motion for a new\n\ntrial.        Evans, 786 N.E.2d at 380.           Evans then filed a habeas\n\npetition in federal district court.             The petition was denied.            See\n\nEvans, 2005 WL 1638119, at *3.          A certificate of appealability was\n\ngranted as to two issues.\n\n                                        II.\n\n               Review of the district court's denial of habeas relief is\n\nde novo.       Norton v. Spencer, 351 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003).                    To\n\nstate     a    federal    habeas    claim     concerning      a     state      criminal\n\nconviction, the petitioner must allege errors that violate the\n\nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.                       Estelle v.\n\nMcGuire,       502   U.S.   62,    67-68      (1991);   see       also    28    U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2241(c)(3), 2254(a).           \"[F]ederal habeas corpus relief does not\n\nlie for errors of state law.\"          Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 780\n\n(1990).\n\n               Federal habeas review of the state court's decision is\n\ngoverned by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n\n1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214.                       Under AEDPA,\n\nhabeas relief is unavailable on federal claims \"adjudicated on the\n\nmerits    in    State    court    proceedings\"    unless      the    state     court's\n\ndecision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\n\nof, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fCourt of the United States\" or \"was based on an unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\n\nthe State court proceeding.\"    28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).    Under our\n\ncircuit law, federal claims \"raised before the state court but\n\n. . . left unresolved\" are reviewed de novo.   Lynch v. Ficco, 438\n\nF.3d 35, 44 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75,\n\n80 (1st Cir. 2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord\n\nFortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"AEDPA imposes\n\na requirement of deference to state court decisions, but we can\n\nhardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court\n\ndid not address.\").\n\n                               III.\n\nA.        Challenges Based on the Rule that a Prosecutor Cannot\n          Impeach His Own Witness as a Pretext for Placing\n          Inadmissible Evidence Before the Jury\n\n          We start with Evans's strongest claim.    Evans's habeas\n\npetition makes three arguments related to Neal.    Taking the fact\n\nthat Neal's voir dire testimony showed that he would testify that\n\nhe recalled essentially nothing of importance to the prosecutor,\n\nEvans argues (1) Neal himself should never have been allowed to\n\ntestify, (2) Neal's grand jury testimony that he had seen Evans at\n\nWalaikum's should not have been admitted, and (3) Detective Dorch\n\nshould not have been allowed to testify that Neal had told the\n\npolice that he (Neal) had seen Evans and his brother shoot Jackson\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fat   Walaikum's.       Evans      asserts   that     his   rights    under     the\n\nConfrontation Clause were violated.\n\n           Violation of a rule of evidence does not itself amount to\n\na constitutional violation, which is a necessary predicate for a\n\nhabeas claim.    Kater v. Maloney, 459 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nStill, on the facts of a given case, an evidentiary error may\n\nresult in such fundamental unfairness to the defendant as to\n\nconstitute   a   due   process     violation.      See,    e.g.,    Chambers   v.\n\nMississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1973).\n\n           Another necessary predicate for habeas relief is that the\n\nclaims   presented     in   the   federal   habeas    case   have    first   been\n\npresented to the state court.        See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b), (c); Picard\n\nv. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971).            The first argument -- that\n\nNeal should not have been allowed to testify at all after his voir\n\ndire disclaimer of his prior statements -- was not presented to the\n\nSJC and so is not before us.\n\n           The second argument -- that the grand jury minutes should\n\nnot have been admitted -- was presented to the SJC.            The SJC agreed\n\nwith Evans that those minutes did not meet the requirements of the\n\npast recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.                Evans,\n\n786 N.E.2d at 382-83.          It also held that the evidence was not\n\nsubstantively admissible under a state law rule pertaining to\n\nfalsely testifying about a lack of memory because there was no\n\nfinding by the trial judge that the claimed lack of memory was\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\ffabricated.    Id. at 383.    The SJC held, nonetheless, that the error\n\nin admitting the grand jury testimony was harmless, given that the\n\ndefendants and another witness had testified that Evans was at\n\nWalaikum's on the night in question.              Id.       This ruling was\n\nunassailable, and habeas relief thus is not warranted.               See Brecht\n\nv. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637 (1993) (holding that a petitioner\n\nis entitled to habeas relief on the basis of a trial error only if\n\nthat error \"'had [a] substantial and injurious effect or influence\n\nin determining the jury's verdict'\" (quoting Kotteakos v. United\n\nStates, 328 U.S. 750, 776 (1946))); see also Petrillo v. O'Neill,\n\n428 F.3d 41, 44-45 (1st Cir. 2005) (applying Brecht post-AEDPA).\n\n            The most significant of Evans's claims, at least in\n\ntheory, is the third: that the prosecution engaged in a subterfuge\n\nto get into evidence Neal's prior statement to the police that he\n\nhad seen Evans shoot at Jackson.            The prosecution had no other\n\nwitness who said as much, and the defendant testified that he had\n\nnot shot Jackson.\n\n            Evans's best arguments are grounded in the line of cases\n\nholding    that   \"a   criminal   prosecutor   may    not       employ   a    prior\n\ninconsistent statement to impeach a witness on a 'mere subterfuge'\n\nor for the 'primary purpose' of placing before the jury substantive\n\nevidence    which   is   otherwise   inadmissible.\"         1    Broun   et   al.,\n\nMcCormick on Evidence § 38, at 168 (6th ed. 2006) (emphasis\n\nomitted).     Of course, there is no general prohibition in the\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fConstitution on a party impeaching its own witness.              Cf. Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 607; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 233, § 23.               In criminal cases,\n\nhowever, such impeachment may trigger Due Process and Confrontation\n\nClause concerns.\n\n            This rule imposing constraints on prosecutors is widely\n\naccepted.    See, e.g., United States v. Gilbert, 57 F.3d 709, 711\n\n(9th Cir. 1995) (\"'[T]he government must not knowingly elicit\n\ntestimony from a witness in order to impeach him with otherwise\n\ninadmissible      testimony.'\"         (quoting       United     States     v.\n\nGomez-Gallardo, 915 F.2d 553, 555 (9th Cir. 1990))); United States\n\nv.   Patterson,    23   F.3d   1239,   1245   (7th    Cir.     1994)   (\"[T]he\n\nprosecution may not 'call a witness that it [knows will] not give\n\nit useful evidence, just so it [can] introduce hearsay evidence\n\nagainst the defendant in the hope that the jury [will] miss the\n\nsubtle distinction between impeachment and substantive evidence.\"\n\n(second and third alterations in original) (quoting United States\n\nv. Webster, 734 F.2d 1191, 1192 (7th Cir. 1984))); United States v.\n\nMorlang, 531 F.2d 183, 189 (4th Cir. 1975) (stating that the\n\ngovernment must not, \"in the name of impeachment, . . . present\n\ntestimony to the jury by indirection which would not otherwise be\n\nadmissible\").\n\n            The rule has several components, usually articulated as\n\nrequiring a showing of \"mere subterfuge\" or \"primary purpose\" by\n\nthe prosecutor in eliciting the testimony.           Those requirements, in\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fturn,    lead    to    further   inquiry.       Application      of   the    \"mere\n\nsubterfuge\" or \"primary purpose\" doctrine focuses on the entire\n\ncontent    of   the    witness's      testimony,   not   just   the   challenged\n\nstatement.      If the testimony as a whole is useful on any fact of\n\nconsequence, then the witness may be impeached on any other matter\n\ntestified to by means of a prior inconsistent statement.                  1 Broun\n\net al., supra, § 38, at 168-69; accord United States v. Kane, 944\n\nF.2d    1406,   1412    (7th   Cir.    1991)   (\"When    a   government     witness\n\nprovides evidence both helpful and harmful to the prosecution, the\n\ngovernment should not be forced to choose between the Scylla of\n\nforegoing impeachment and the Charybdis of not calling the witness\n\nat all.\").      The claim here is that Neal's testimony was not useful\n\nto the prosecutor on any matter of consequence, and that Neal was\n\ncalled as a subterfuge to get into evidence his prior hearsay\n\nstatement.\n\n             There is an initial question of whether this claim, which\n\nwas presented to the SJC, was presented as a matter of federal\n\nconstitutional law. The Commonwealth concedes that this exhaustion\n\nquestion is very close and difficult. We bypass this issue because\n\nit is clear Evans would fail on this claim, even if it had been\n\npresented in constitutional terms to the SJC and even if we gave no\n\ndeference to the SJC's decision.           See Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47.\n\n             As the SJC noted, Evans's argument has some initial\n\nappeal, but it ignores one important fact.               See Evans, 786 N.E.2d\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fat 384.     Our turning point (as was the SJC's) is that it was the\n\ndefense's cross examination of Neal, not the Commonwealth's direct\n\nexamination, that created the basis for the admission into evidence\n\nof Neal's prior inconsistent statement.          It was defense counsel\n\nwho, on cross examination, asked Neal if he had ever seen Evans\n\nwith a gun in his hand on January 24 or 25.           When Neal said he had\n\nnot, the door was open for the prosecution to impeach Neal's\n\ntestimony with his statement to Detective Dorch that he had seen\n\nEvans shoot Jackson.       There was no violation of the rules of\n\nevidence, much less a violation of constitutional rights.3\n\nB.          Challenge Based on the Exclusion of Hawkins's Testimony\n\n            Evans's second argument is that he should have been\n\npermitted to question Hawkins about his earlier conversation with\n\nTinsley, which the trial court excluded.         He argues that because\n\nHawkins's    prior   statement    to   the   police    (that      Tinsley    had\n\nconfessed)    supported   the    defense's   theory    of   the    case     (that\n\nTinsley, not Evans, had been the second shooter), defense counsel\n\nshould have been permitted to question Hawkins about the portion of\n\nthe conversation concerning Tinsley's supposed confession and to\n\nimpeach Hawkins with his prior statement to the police.4                    Evans\n\n\n     3\n          Evans argues that his counsel was required, as a zealous\nadvocate, to cross-examine Neal. Because Neal offered no testimony\nof any value to the prosecution, however, this argument is without\nmerit.\n     4\n          Evans also contests the exclusion of those parts of\nHawkins's reported conversation with Tinsley that Hawkins did not\n\n                                    -13-\n\fargues that in limiting Hawkins's testimony by precluding questions\n\nabout the confession,5 the trial judge violated his (Evans's) Sixth\n\nAmendment compulsory process rights.\n\n             The question was presented to and ruled on by the SJC.\n\nThe SJC ruled that the trial judge could have properly concluded,\n\nbased on Hawkins's voir dire, that Hawkins would offer no relevant\n\ntestimony if called.         Id. at 385.        In addition, it held that\n\nHawkins's prior statement was inadmissible hearsay, and that Evans\n\nhad not shown it to be inconsistent with any relevant testimony\n\nthat Hawkins would have given.           Id.   Moreover, the SJC ruled that\n\nthe defense was not permitted to call Hawkins just so it could\n\nimpeach him with an otherwise inadmissible prior statement.               Id.\n\nFinally, the SJC held that given Hawkins's repudiation of his prior\n\nstatement, it was hardly apparent that the statement, although\n\nhearsay,     was   so   reliable   and   trustworthy   that   its   exclusion\n\ninterfered with Evans's constitutional right to present a defense.\n\nId.       Our inquiry is whether the SJC's conclusions involved an\n\n\n\n\nrepudiate (that is, that Tinsley was planning to enter into a plea\nbargain until he realized that the police might be unable to place\nhim at the scene). Any error with respect to the exclusion of such\ntestimony was harmless. See Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637-38.\n      5\n          To be clear, the court permitted Evans to call Hawkins\nbut precluded questions about the conversation with Tinsley other\nthan to say that a conversation had occurred. Evans then decided\nnot to call Hawkins. As the astute federal habeas judge pointed\nout, Hawkins was permitted to testify, but not about a statement he\nhad just sworn was untrue. See Evans, 2005 WL 1638119, at *2.\n\n                                     -14-\n\funreasonable application of clearly established federal law as\n\ninterpreted by the Supreme Court.        28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n\n          \"A defendant's right to present relevant evidence is not\n\nunlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.\"\n\nUnited States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 308 (1998); see also\n\nTaylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 410 (1988) (\"The accused does not\n\nhave an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,\n\nprivileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of\n\nevidence.\"); Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 55 (1987) (\"Of course,\n\nthe right to present relevant testimony is not without limitation.\n\nThe right 'may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other\n\nlegitimate interests in the criminal trial process.'\"           (quoting\n\nChambers, 410 U.S. at 295)).     As long as they are not \"arbitrary or\n\ndisproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve,\"\n\nlimitations on the admissibility of evidence do not violate a\n\ndefendant's right to present a defense.       Rock, 483 U.S. at 56; see\n\nalso Scheffer, 523 U.S. at 308.          Hawkins's prior statement was\n\nhearsay   not   within   any    exception    and   was   therefore   not\n\nindependently admissible.      See Commonwealth v. Semedo, 665 N.E.2d\n\n638, 646 (Mass. 1996).\n\n          Evans argues that even if the prior statement was not\n\nsubstantively admissible, he should have been permitted to use it\n\nfor impeachment purposes.       He argues that it was particularly\n\nunfair to exclude Hawkins's testimony after he had recanted, but to\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fpermit Neal, who also had recanted, to testify.           Moreover, Evans\n\nemphasizes that although it was the prosecution that sought to\n\npresent Neal's prior statement, here it was the defendant who\n\nsought to impeach Hawkins, and that denying him the opportunity to\n\ndo so impaired his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense.6             In\n\ntheory at least, a defendant may have a viable claim that \"applying\n\nthe rule [against impeachment of one's own witness] to prevent him\n\nfrom mounting a critical attack on a key defense witness is\n\nunconstitutional.\"        1 Broun et al., supra, § 39, at 169; see\n\nImwinkelried    &   Garland,   Exculpatory    Evidence:    The     Accused's\n\nConstitutional Right To Introduce Favorable Evidence § 8-2, at 260-\n\n61 (3d ed. 2004).\n\n            There   are    material   differences       between    the     two\n\nsituations,    however,     apart   from   the   fact    that     the    prior\n\ninconsistent statement by Neal came in because the defense opened\n\nthe door.     There was a difference in the reliability of the two\n\nstatements.    Hawkins was not a first-hand witness to the shooting,\n\nbut purported to repeat a statement by Tinsley that confessed that\n\n\n\n     6\n          Massachusetts seems to have adopted a broader rule that\nno party (not just prosecutors) has a statutory right \"to call a\nwitness whom he knows beforehand will offer no testimony relevant\nto an issue at trial solely for the purpose of impeaching that\nwitness with prior inconsistent statements that would otherwise be\ninadmissible.\"   Commonwealth v. McAfee, 722 N.E.2d 1, 8 (Mass.\n1999). Our concern is only whether this state evidentiary rule as\napplied to Hawkins constituted a deprivation of federal\nconstitutional rights so as to render the SJC's opinion an\nunreasonable application of the pertinent law.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fTinsley had shot Jackson.         Hawkins then told the trial judge on\n\nvoir dire that Tinsley had never made a confession.               Hawkins said\n\nhe made up the whole thing in order to curry favor with the\n\npolice.7    By contrast, Neal's recantation by loss of memory could\n\neasily be taken as a fabrication.\n\n                As the SJC held, the state trial judge correctly found\n\nthat the recently recanted prior statement was not \"so reliable and\n\ntrustworthy that, although hearsay, its exclusion might offend\n\n[Evans's] constitutional right to present a defense.\"              Evans, 786\n\nN.E.2d     at    385.    The   SJC's   holding   was   not   an   unreasonable\n\napplication of law for habeas purposes.\n\n                The dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n          \"The hearsay rule, which has long been recognized and\nrespected by virtually every State, is based on experience and\ngrounded in the notion that untrustworthy evidence should not be\npresented to the triers of fact.\" Chambers, 410 U.S. at 298.\n\n                                       -17-\n\f",

He argues that the\n\nexclusion   of   certain    defense    witness   testimony   concerning   a\n\nrecanted prior statement violated his Sixth Amendment right to\n\npresent a defense.         He also argues that the state prosecutor\n\nviolated the rule that a prosecutor may not impeach his own witness\n\nas a ploy for the introduction of inadmissible evidence, and that\n\nthis violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights.\n\nThese arguments cause us to explore the topic of impeachment and\n\nrecanted statements.\n\n            We reject Evans's claims and affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of the petition.\n\n                                      I.\n\n            We briefly recount the facts as recited in detail in\n\nCommonwealth v. Evans, 786 N.E.2d at 381.\n\n            In the early morning of January 25, 1995, Jackson and his\n\nfriend, Marcello Holliday, were at Cortee's, a nightclub in the\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fDorchester area of Boston.      Evans also was at Cortee's with his\n\nbrother Jimmy Evans (Jimmy) and two friends, Robert Brown and\n\nRonald Tinsley.     Around 1:45 a.m., Jackson and Holliday left\n\nCortee's for Walaikum's, a nearby restaurant.            They arrived at\n\napproximately 2:20 a.m.      About fifteen minutes later, Evans, his\n\nbrother, Brown, and Tinsley entered Walaikum's, then crowded with\n\ncustomers. Evans, Jimmy, Brown, and Tinsley left after a minute or\n\nso, but quickly reentered the restaurant.           Tinsley began talking\n\nwith a young woman, and Brown said to Evans and Jimmy, \"That's one\n\nof them right there.\"   After verifying that Brown was referring to\n\nJackson, Jimmy drew a gun and approached Jackson, who backed away,\n\nstumbled, crawled into a corner, and began begging for his life.\n\nJimmy then shot at Jackson four or five times.         After seeing Jimmy\n\nshoot at Jackson, Willy Wiggins, who owned Walaikum's, went to the\n\nback of the restaurant and called the police.\n\n           Alton   Clarke,   another    customer,   tried   to   leave   the\n\nrestaurant and was confronted by Evans, who also was armed with a\n\nhandgun.   Evans allowed Clarke to leave once he stated that he had\n\nnothing to do with Jackson. Evans then approached Jackson and shot\n\nat him once.\n\n           Evans, Jimmy, Brown, and Tinsley left Walaikum's, and a\n\ncar chase ensued.    All four were apprehended by police after they\n\nturned into a dead-end street and tried to flee on foot.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f              Jackson died from an infection related to his gunshot\n\nwounds.      He had been shot three times.\n\n              The Evans brothers, Brown, and Tinsley were charged with\n\nmurder by joint venture and tried together before a jury.               At\n\ntrial, the government introduced the testimony of Marvette Neal,\n\nwho   knew    Jackson,   Evans,   and   Jimmy.   Neal   had   told   police\n\napproximately two weeks after the shooting that he had seen both\n\nEvans and his brother shoot at Jackson in Walaikum's.          Later that\n\nmonth, however, when he testified before the grand jury considering\n\nthe charges against Evans, Neal stated only that he had seen Evans\n\nand Jimmy inside Cortee's and Walaikum's.        By the time of Evans's\n\ntrial, in the fall of 1996, Neal had backed further away from his\n\ninitial statement.       During voir dire, Neal stated that he could\n\nrecall no more than that he had seen Jackson at Cortee's and\n\nWalaikum's. He testified that he did not remember making his prior\n\nstatement to police, that he did not see Evans or Jimmy shoot\n\nJackson, and that he did not tell police anything to that effect.\n\n              After voir dire, the prosecution proceeded with Neal as\n\na witness; Neal testified before the jury that he could not recall\n\nhaving seen Evans or Jimmy at Cortee's or Walaikum's on the night\n\nin question.       The trial judge, over objection, permitted the\n\ngovernment to introduce Neal's grand jury testimony to the contrary\n\nas substantive evidence.      The government also was permitted, again\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fover objection, to lay a foundation to impeach Neal with his prior\n\ninconsistent statement to the police.\n\n            The defense then cross-examined Neal.        In particular,\n\nEvans's counsel asked Neal whether he had seen Evans or his brother\n\nwith a gun on the night of the shooting.        Neal testified that he\n\nhad not.\n\n            The next day, the government called Detective Kenneth\n\nDorch, who had taken Neal's initial statement.          Detective Dorch\n\ntestified to Neal's prior inconsistent statement -- that is, that\n\nNeal had told him that he had seen Evans shoot at Jackson.            The\n\ntrial judge instructed the jury six times during Detective Dorch's\n\ntestimony that the prior statement was admitted only for the\n\npurpose of impeachment and was not to be considered substantive\n\nevidence.\n\n            During his defense case, Evans sought to introduce the\n\ntestimony of Eddie Hawkins, who had shared a jail cell with Tinsley\n\nafter the shooting.     Hawkins had made a pre-trial statement to\n\npolice that Tinsley, while in jail, had admitted to shooting\n\nJackson and had acknowledged that he had intended to accept a plea\n\nbargain until he learned that the Commonwealth could place him only\n\nin the getaway car and not in Walaikum's.         However, during voir\n\ndire   Hawkins   repudiated   his   prior   statement   about   Tinsley's\n\nconfession and stated that he had fabricated the story of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fconfession1 to gain more favorable treatment in his own pending\n\ncase.    As a result of Hawkins's voir dire testimony, the trial\n\njudge ruled that Evans's attorney could not question Hawkins about\n\nhis conversation with Tinsley other than to ask whether they had\n\ndiscussed the pending charges against Tinsley.               Evans then opted\n\nnot to call Hawkins.\n\n           On November 8, 1996, Evans was convicted of first-degree\n\nmurder on theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity\n\nand cruelty.2    He also was found guilty of two charges of illegally\n\npossessing   ammunition,     one   charge   of    illegally     discharging    a\n\nfirearm within five hundred feet of a building, two charges of\n\nillegally possessing a firearm, two charges of assault and battery\n\nwith a dangerous weapon, and various motor vehicle charges.                  The\n\ntrial    judge   sentenced   Evans    to    a    mandatory      term   of   life\n\nimprisonment on the murder conviction, and to concurrent terms of\n\nfour to five years for the illegal possession of a firearm and\n\nassault and battery convictions. The other convictions were placed\n\non file with Evans's consent.\n\n           Evans filed a timely notice of appeal and a motion for a\n\nnew trial.       The motion for a new trial was denied, and Evans\n\n\n\n     1\n          Hawkins did not recant his statements about Tinsley's\nhaving changed his mind about accepting a plea bargain.\n     2\n           Jimmy    also   was   convicted.       Brown   and    Tinsley    were\nacquitted.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fappealed.       His direct appeal to the SJC was consolidated with his\n\nappeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial.                          The SJC\n\naffirmed the convictions and the denial of the motion for a new\n\ntrial.        Evans, 786 N.E.2d at 380.           Evans then filed a habeas\n\npetition in federal district court.             The petition was denied.

Evans's habeas\n\npetition makes three arguments related to Neal.    Taking the fact\n\nthat Neal's voir dire testimony showed that he would testify that\n\nhe recalled essentially nothing of importance to the prosecutor,\n\nEvans argues (1) Neal himself should never have been allowed to\n\ntestify, (2) Neal's grand jury testimony that he had seen Evans at\n\nWalaikum's should not have been admitted, and (3) Detective Dorch\n\nshould not have been allowed to testify that Neal had told the\n\npolice that he (Neal) had seen Evans and his brother shoot Jackson\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fat   Walaikum's.       Evans      asserts   that     his   rights    under     the\n\nConfrontation Clause were violated.\n\n           Violation of a rule of evidence does not itself amount to\n\na constitutional violation, which is a necessary predicate for a\n\nhabeas claim.

The first argument -- that\n\nNeal should not have been allowed to testify at all after his voir\n\ndire disclaimer of his prior statements -- was not presented to the\n\nSJC and so is not before us.\n\n           The second argument -- that the grand jury minutes should\n\nnot have been admitted -- was presented to the SJC.            The SJC agreed\n\nwith Evans that those minutes did not meet the requirements of the\n\npast recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.                Evans,\n\n786 N.E.2d at 382-83.          It also held that the evidence was not\n\nsubstantively admissible under a state law rule pertaining to\n\nfalsely testifying about a lack of memory because there was no\n\nfinding by the trial judge that the claimed lack of memory was\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\ffabricated.

The SJC held, nonetheless, that the error\n\nin admitting the grand jury testimony was harmless, given that the\n\ndefendants and another witness had testified that Evans was at\n\nWalaikum's on the night in question.

The prosecution had no other\n\nwitness who said as much, and the defendant testified that he had\n\nnot shot Jackson.\n\n            Evans's best arguments are grounded in the line of cases\n\nholding    that   \"a   criminal   prosecutor   may    not       employ   a    prior\n\ninconsistent statement to impeach a witness on a 'mere subterfuge'\n\nor for the 'primary purpose' of placing before the jury substantive\n\nevidence    which   is   otherwise   inadmissible.\"         1    Broun   et   al.,\n\nMcCormick on Evidence § 38, at 168 (6th ed. 2006) (emphasis\n\nomitted).

Those requirements, in\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fturn,    lead    to    further   inquiry.       Application      of   the    \"mere\n\nsubterfuge\" or \"primary purpose\" doctrine focuses on the entire\n\ncontent    of   the    witness's      testimony,   not   just   the   challenged\n\nstatement.      If the testimony as a whole is useful on any fact of\n\nconsequence, then the witness may be impeached on any other matter\n\ntestified to by means of a prior inconsistent statement.                  1 Broun\n\net al., supra, § 38, at 168-69; accord United States v. Kane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568524\"><a href=\"/opinion/568524/united-states-v-kenneth-kane/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>    <span class=\"page\">1406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   1412    (7th   Cir.    1991)   (\"When    a   government     witness\n\nprovides evidence both helpful and harmful to the prosecution, the\n\ngovernment should not be forced to choose between the Scylla of\n\nforegoing impeachment and the Charybdis of not calling the witness\n\nat all.\").      The claim here is that Neal's testimony was not useful\n\nto the prosecutor on any matter of consequence, and that Neal was\n\ncalled as a subterfuge to get into evidence his prior hearsay\n\nstatement.\n\n             There is an initial question of whether this claim, which\n\nwas presented to the SJC, was presented as a matter of federal\n\nconstitutional law. The Commonwealth concedes that this exhaustion\n\nquestion is very close and difficult. We bypass this issue because\n\nit is clear Evans would fail on this claim, even if it had been\n\npresented in constitutional terms to the SJC and even if we gave no\n\ndeference to the SJC's decision.           See Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47.\n\n             As the SJC noted, Evans's argument has some initial\n\nappeal, but it ignores one important fact.               See Evans, 786 N.E.2d\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fat 384.     Our turning point (as was the SJC's) is that it was the\n\ndefense's cross examination of Neal, not the Commonwealth's direct\n\nexamination, that created the basis for the admission into evidence\n\nof Neal's prior inconsistent statement.          It was defense counsel\n\nwho, on cross examination, asked Neal if he had ever seen Evans\n\nwith a gun in his hand on January 24 or 25.           When Neal said he had\n\nnot, the door was open for the prosecution to impeach Neal's\n\ntestimony with his statement to Detective Dorch that he had seen\n\nEvans shoot Jackson.       There was no violation of the rules of\n\nevidence, much less a violation of constitutional rights.3\n\nB.          Challenge Based on the Exclusion of Hawkins's Testimony\n\n            Evans's second argument is that he should have been\n\npermitted to question Hawkins about his earlier conversation with\n\nTinsley, which the trial court excluded.         He argues that because\n\nHawkins's    prior   statement    to   the   police    (that      Tinsley    had\n\nconfessed)    supported   the    defense's   theory    of   the    case     (that\n\nTinsley, not Evans, had been the second shooter), defense counsel\n\nshould have been permitted to question Hawkins about the portion of\n\nthe conversation concerning Tinsley's supposed confession and to\n\nimpeach Hawkins with his prior statement to the police.4                    Evans\n\n\n     3\n          Evans argues that his counsel was required, as a zealous\nadvocate, to cross-examine Neal. Because Neal offered no testimony\nof any value to the prosecution, however, this argument is without\nmerit.\n     4\n          Evans also contests the exclusion of those parts of\nHawkins's reported conversation with Tinsley that Hawkins did not\n\n                                    -13-\n\fargues that in limiting Hawkins's testimony by precluding questions\n\nabout the confession,5 the trial judge violated his (Evans's) Sixth\n\nAmendment compulsory process rights.\n\n             The question was presented to and ruled on by the SJC.\n\nThe SJC ruled that the trial judge could have properly concluded,\n\nbased on Hawkins's voir dire, that Hawkins would offer no relevant\n\ntestimony if called.         Id. at 385.        In addition, it held that\n\nHawkins's prior statement was inadmissible hearsay, and that Evans\n\nhad not shown it to be inconsistent with any relevant testimony\n\nthat Hawkins would have given.           Id.   Moreover, the SJC ruled that\n\nthe defense was not permitted to call Hawkins just so it could\n\nimpeach him with an otherwise inadmissible prior statement.               Id.\n\nFinally, the SJC held that given Hawkins's repudiation of his prior\n\nstatement, it was hardly apparent that the statement, although\n\nhearsay,     was   so   reliable   and   trustworthy   that   its   exclusion\n\ninterfered with Evans's constitutional right to present a defense.\n\nId.       Our inquiry is whether the SJC's conclusions involved an\n\n\n\n\nrepudiate (that is, that Tinsley was planning to enter into a plea\nbargain until he realized that the police might be unable to place\nhim at the scene). Any error with respect to the exclusion of such\ntestimony was harmless. See Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637-38.\n      5\n          To be clear, the court permitted Evans to call Hawkins\nbut precluded questions about the conversation with Tinsley other\nthan to say that a conversation had occurred. Evans then decided\nnot to call Hawkins. As the astute federal habeas judge pointed\nout, Hawkins was permitted to testify, but not about a statement he\nhad just sworn was untrue.

As long as they are not \"arbitrary or\n\ndisproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve,\"\n\nlimitations on the admissibility of evidence do not violate a\n\ndefendant's right to present a defense.       Rock, 483 U.S. at 56; see\n\nalso Scheffer, 523 U.S. at 308.          Hawkins's prior statement was\n\nhearsay   not   within   any    exception    and   was   therefore   not\n\nindependently admissible.      See Commonwealth v.

He argues that it was particularly\n\nunfair to exclude Hawkins's testimony after he had recanted, but to\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fpermit Neal, who also had recanted, to testify.           Moreover, Evans\n\nemphasizes that although it was the prosecution that sought to\n\npresent Neal's prior statement, here it was the defendant who\n\nsought to impeach Hawkins, and that denying him the opportunity to\n\ndo so impaired his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense.6             In\n\ntheory at least, a defendant may have a viable claim that \"applying\n\nthe rule [against impeachment of one's own witness] to prevent him\n\nfrom mounting a critical attack on a key defense witness is\n\nunconstitutional.\"        1 Broun et al., supra, § 39, at 169; see\n\nImwinkelried    &   Garland,   Exculpatory    Evidence:    The     Accused's\n\nConstitutional Right To Introduce Favorable Evidence § 8-2, at 260-\n\n61 (3d ed. 2004).\n\n            There   are    material   differences       between    the     two\n\nsituations,    however,     apart   from   the   fact    that     the    prior\n\ninconsistent statement by Neal came in because the defense opened\n\nthe door.     There was a difference in the reliability of the two\n\nstatements.    Hawkins was not a first-hand witness to the shooting,\n\nbut purported to repeat a statement by Tinsley that confessed that\n\n\n\n     6\n          Massachusetts seems to have adopted a broader rule that\nno party (not just prosecutors) has a statutory right \"to call a\nwitness whom he knows beforehand will offer no testimony relevant\nto an issue at trial solely for the purpose of impeaching that\nwitness with prior inconsistent statements that would otherwise be\ninadmissible.\"   Commonwealth v.

Our concern is only whether this state evidentiary rule as\napplied to Hawkins constituted a deprivation of federal\nconstitutional rights so as to render the SJC's opinion an\nunreasonable application of the pertinent law.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fTinsley had shot Jackson.         Hawkins then told the trial judge on\n\nvoir dire that Tinsley had never made a confession.               Hawkins said\n\nhe made up the whole thing in order to curry favor with the\n\npolice.7    By contrast, Neal's recantation by loss of memory could\n\neasily be taken as a fabrication.\n\n                As the SJC held, the state trial judge correctly found\n\nthat the recently recanted prior statement was not \"so reliable and\n\ntrustworthy that, although hearsay, its exclusion might offend\n\n[Evans's] constitutional right to present a defense.\"              Evans, 786\n\nN.E.2d     at    385.
