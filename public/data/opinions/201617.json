We have therefore substituted\nAttorney General Gonzales for John          Ashcroft as the respondent. See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 25(d)(1); Fed. R.           App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f                Per curiam.     Hermase Amicy petitions for review of a\n\nfinal order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying her\n\nmotion     to    reopen   her   immigration   proceedings.     We   deny    the\n\npetition.\n\n                Amicy, a native and citizen of Haiti, entered the United\n\nStates illegally in 1991.          Nine years later, the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS)1 initiated removal proceedings under\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (governing aliens present in the United\n\nStates without admission or parole). Conceding removability, Amicy\n\napplied     for    asylum   and   withholding   of   removal   based   on   the\n\npersecution that she allegedly had suffered in Haiti as a result of\n\nher participation in a pro-democracy “political religious” group.\n\nAmicy claimed that, in 1991, the “Ton Ton Macoutes,” a military\n\ngroup affiliated with the deposed regime of Jean-Claude Duvalier,\n\narrested her because of her political activities.              She testified\n\nthat during her one-month detainment, she was interrogated, beaten\n\nand raped.2        Her asylum application also stated that her brother\n\nwas killed in Haiti in 1999.\n\n                The immigration judge (IJ) denied Amicy's asylum claim as\n\ntime-barred. Citing inconsistencies in Amicy's testimony and her\n\ninability to remember events critical to her claim, the IJ also\n\n\n     1\n      In March 2003 the relevant functions of the INS were\nreorganized and transferred into the new Department of Homeland\nSecurity.\n     2\n         Amicy did not mention the rape in her asylum application.\n\n                                      -2-\n\ffound Amicy lacked credibility and denied her withholding of\n\nremoval application. An order of removal was issued on January 31,\n\n2002. Amicy's appeal to the BIA conceded that her asylum claim was\n\ntime-barred, but argued that she was eligible for withholding of\n\nremoval.    On June 10, 2003, the BIA adopted the IJ's decision and\n\ndismissed Amicy's appeal.\n\n            Three months after the BIA's final order of removal,\n\nAmicy moved the BIA to reopen her immigration proceedings.             She\n\nclaimed that her inability to remember the events surrounding her\n\npersecution was the result of significant psychological trauma. In\n\nsupport of her motion, she submitted a psychiatric evaluation that\n\nstated     that   Amicy   is   impaired   by   “difficulties   in   spatial\n\norganization” and “distractibility,” and that these symptoms are\n\n“consistent with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.”             She\n\nalso submitted a picture allegedly showing her son with gun shot\n\nwounds.     On December 29, 2003, the BIA denied Amicy's motion to\n\nreopen, finding that the new evidence did not adequately rebut the\n\nIJ's adverse credibility determination and that Amicy had not\n\nestablished that the new evidence was previously unavailable.\n\n             The BIA may grant a motion to reopen when the petitioner\n\nestablishes (1) “a prima facie case for the underlying substantive\n\nrelief sought,” and (2) that the motion introduces “previously\n\nunavailable, material evidence.” Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 13,\n\n20 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 (1988));\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fsee also 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).                    Even when the petitioner\n\nsatisfies both of these requirements, however, the BIA retains the\n\ndiscretion to grant or deny the motion.                  See Fesseha, 333 F.3d at\n\n20; 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a).            Thus, we will only reverse the BIA for\n\nan abuse of discretion.            See Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 20.\n\n              Amicy has made no showing that her newly proffered\n\nevidence was unavailable and could not have been presented to the\n\nIJ at the removal hearing.                Cf. Elboukili v. INS, 125 F.3d 861,\n\n1997 WL 616222, at *2 (10th Cir. 1997) (unpublished opinion)\n\n(denying petitioner's request to supplement the record with a\n\npsychological       evaluation       because     “this   means   of   demonstrating\n\npetitioner's        mental        state    has    always    been      available    to\n\npetitioner”).        She therefore has failed to establish the second\n\nrequirement for reopening an immigration proceeding.                    Because the\n\nBIA was within its discretion to deny Amicy's motion to reopen on\n\nthat       basis   alone,    we    need    not   consider     whether    Amicy    has\n\nestablished a prima facie claim for relief.3\n\n\n       3\n      We also decline to consider Amicy's contention that the BIA\nshould have granted her relief because the IJ failed to provide a\ndetailed explanation in support of his adverse credibility\ndetermination. All final orders of the BIA must be challenged in\nthis court within 30 days. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1). The final order\ndenying Amicy's underlying claims for asylum and withholding of\nremoval was issued by the BIA on June 10, 2003. Amicy's motion to\nreopen did not enlarge the filing period for judicial review of her\nunderlying claims, nor did her petition to review the BIA's\nDecember 29, 2003 order (denying her motion to reopen) preserve her\nchallenge to the underlying removal order. See Ven v. Ashcroft,\n386 F.3d 357, 359-60 (1st Cir. 2004). Because Amicy did not timely\npetition for review of the BIA's June 10, 2003 order, we lack\n\n                                           -4-\n\f          Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\njurisdiction to consider the underlying denial.   See Zhang v. INS,\n348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
