Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Zechariah\nChafee, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                       February 26, 2007\n\f               SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.             Following the entry of a\n\nguilty plea, defendant-appellant Gary W. Miller was sentenced to a\n\n180-month incarcerative term under the Armed Career Criminal Act\n\n(ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).             On appeal, Miller argues (i) that\n\nthe district court improperly relied upon a state court transcript\n\nin establishing one of the underlying convictions needed to engage\n\nthe gears of the ACCA; (ii) that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a finding that he had been convicted of such a predicate\n\noffense;    and    (iii)   that   in   all       events,      the   ACCA    enhancement\n\nviolated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.                      Concluding, as we\n\ndo, that these arguments lack force, we affirm the sentence.\n\n               The facts are uncomplicated.              On June 3, 2005, Miller\n\npleaded guilty to a single-count indictment charging him with being\n\na felon in possession of a handgun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(g)(1). At the disposition hearing, the government claimed that\n\nMiller should be sentenced as an armed career criminal.                            Miller\n\ndisputed that claim.\n\n               Under the ACCA, a defendant such as Miller who has three\n\nprior \"violent felony\" convictions is subject to a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence of fifteen years.                 See id. § 924(e)(1).             Both\n\nsides   ultimately      agreed    that      Miller      had    at   least    two    prior\n\nconvictions for violent felonies.                They disagreed, however, as to\n\nwhether    a    third   conviction     —    a    2000   Connecticut        state    court\n\nconviction for third-degree burglary — constituted a countable\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fpredicate under the ACCA.         Refined to bare essence, the parties'\n\ndisagreement (and, hence, the issue of ACCA coverage) centered on\n\nthe nature of this burglary conviction.              We briefly explain the\n\nparameters of the dispute.\n\n              A conviction for burglary may constitute a conviction for\n\na violent felony within the purview of the ACCA.                    See id. §\n\n924(e)(2)(B)(ii).       Burglary is not statutorily defined in the ACCA\n\ncontext, but the Supreme Court has held that, for purposes of\n\nsection 924(e), burglary means generic burglary; that is, \"an\n\nunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or\n\nother structure with intent to commit a crime.\"               Taylor v. United\n\nStates,   495    U.S.   575,    599    (1990).     The   Connecticut    statute\n\nunderpinning      Miller's     conviction     is   not   limited   to   generic\n\nburglary.     Although the statute of conviction defines third-degree\n\nburglary as \"enter[ing] or remain[ing] unlawfully in a building\n\nwith the intent to commit a crime,\" Conn. Gen. Stat. § 53a-103(a),\n\na related statute expands the ordinary definition of \"building\" to\n\ninclude, among other things, vehicles, watercraft, and railroad\n\ncars, see id. § 53a-100.          Therein lies the problem: typically, a\n\nconviction for burglary involving, say, a car, boat, or railroad\n\ncar   would    not   constitute    a   generic     burglary   conviction   and,\n\ntherefore, would not constitute an ACCA predicate.1                See, e.g.,\n\n\n      1\n      Taylor leaves open the possibility that a burglary conviction\ninvolving a non-building that has been converted to a dwelling (for\nexample, a houseboat) might qualify as an ACCA predicate offense.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fUnited States v. Bennett, 469 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir. 2006); United\n\nStates v. Mastera, 435 F.3d 56, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Faced with the need to determine the nature of Miller's\n\nthird-degree burglary conviction, the district court reviewed the\n\ntranscript    of     the    state    court    change-of-plea       colloquy.     The\n\ndistrict     court      focused      particularly     on   the      state    judge's\n\nsummarization      of      the   crime   as   a   \"break-in   at    Trader     Jack's\n\n[involving] a safe.\"             The district court also noted that, during\n\nthe same proceeding, the state judge at one point said that he\n\nwould impose a suspended sentence of five years with three years of\n\nprobation, and then added that Miller should \"[s]tay out of Trader\n\nJack's and all the other stores that he wasn't charged with, even\"\n\n(emphasis supplied).              Based on these statements, the district\n\ncourt, while acknowledging that it was \"a close call,\" found\n\nsufficient evidence to ground a conclusion that Miller's third-\n\ndegree burglary conviction involved the burglary of a building\n\n(i.e., a store) and thus comprised a third ACCA predicate.                        The\n\ndistrict court proceeded to sentence Miller as an armed career\n\ncriminal and imposed a 180-month incarcerative term.                   This timely\n\nappeal followed.\n\n            In this venue, Miller advances three assignments of\n\nerror.     First, he argues that the district court should not have\n\n\n\nSee 495 U.S. at 593, 599.           This case does not require us to explore\nthat possibility.\n\n                                         -4-\n\frelied upon the change-of-plea colloquy in determining the factual\n\ncontours of his Connecticut state court conviction because he did\n\nnot assent to the facts adverted to by the state judge.    Second, he\n\nargues that even if the district court appropriately consulted the\n\ncolloquy, there was insufficient evidence to warrant a finding that\n\nthe burglary involved a building.       Third, he argues that the\n\nfinding that the Connecticut burglary involved a building was made\n\nin derogation of his constitutional rights because that fact was\n\nneither admitted by him nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n            We review Miller's legal claims de novo.    See Mastera,\n\n435 F.3d at 59.    In the process, however, we review the district\n\ncourt's factual findings for clear error. See Bennett, 469 F.3d at\n\n49; United States v. Delgado, 288 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            Our mode of analysis is familiar.   The Supreme Court has\n\narticulated a two-tier categorical approach for determining whether\n\na prior conviction is for a violent felony within the meaning of\n\nthe ACCA.   See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599-603; see also United States\n\nv. Richards, 456 F.3d 260, 262-63 (1st Cir. 2006).        Under this\n\napproach, an inquiring court, confronted with a prior burglary\n\nconviction, must first examine whether the conviction was based\n\nupon a statute that dovetails with the definition of generic\n\nburglary.    See Bennett, 469 F.3d at 49.   If it does, the inquiry\n\nends and the prior conviction may be used as an ACCA predicate.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fId. Where, as here, the underlying statute sweeps more broadly and\n\ndefines burglary in terms that encompass but exceed the parameters\n\nof the generic definition, the court must move to the second step\n\nof the Taylor pavane in order to determine if \"the particular\n\nconviction actually embodied every element of a violent felony.\"\n\nRichards, 456 F.3d at 262.\n\n             The second step is not a free-style exercise.          In taking\n\nthat step, the court must restrict its inquiry to documents within\n\nthe carapace of the record of conviction, such as \"the charging\n\ndocument, the terms of the plea agreement or transcript of the\n\ncolloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for\n\nthe   plea   was   confirmed   by   the   defendant,   or   some   comparable\n\njudicial record of this information.\"          Shepard v. United States,\n\n544 U.S. 13, 26 (2005); cf. Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45, 53\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (discussing contours of \"record of conviction\" in\n\nan analogous context). In describing this second step, the Shepard\n\nCourt indicated that the inquiry is \"generally limited\" to the\n\nmaterials mentioned above \"and any explicit factual finding by the\n\ntrial judge to which the defendant assented.\"           544 U.S. at 16.\n\n             Miller's first argument seizes upon this comment.            He\n\nasserts that a defendant's express assent to the factual basis for\n\na guilty plea is necessary if any portion of the plea colloquy is\n\nto be used at the second step of the Taylor analysis.              Because he\n\nnever assented to the state judge's characterization of the factual\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fbasis for his third-degree burglary conviction, this thesis runs,\n\nthe   district   court's    reliance   upon   that   characterization   was\n\nimpermissible.\n\n           We assume for argument's sake, but do not decide, that a\n\ndefendant's assent to particular portions of a plea colloquy is\n\nneeded before those statements can be used at the second step of a\n\nTaylor analysis.       Even so, Miller's argument fails because his\n\nfactual premise — that he never assented to the state judge's\n\ncharacterization — is faulty.      Our reasoning follows.\n\n           The   law   of   evidence   long   has    recognized   \"adoptive\n\nadmissions.\" See, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(B). This doctrine\n\nprovides that, in certain circumstances, a party's agreement with\n\na fact stated by another may be inferred from (or \"adopted\" by)\n\nsilence.   See id.; see also United States v. Fortes, 619 F.2d 108,\n\n115 (1st Cir. 1980).        Such an inference may arise when (i) a\n\nstatement is made in a party's presence, (ii) the nature of the\n\nstatement is such that it normally would induce the party to\n\nrespond, and (iii) the party nonetheless fails to take exception.\n\nSee United States v. Higgs, 353 F.3d 281, 309-10 (4th Cir. 2003).\n\nIn such an instance, the statement may be considered \"adopted\" by\n\nvirtue of the party's failure to respond. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Negrón-Narváez, 403 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir. 2005); cf. United\n\nStates v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872-73 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"A defendant\n\nthat accepts . . . without contesting the facts set forth in the\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f[presentence] report can scarcely be heard to complain when the\n\nsentencing court uses those facts to make its findings.\").\n\n           This doctrine is applicable here.                The transcript of the\n\nchange-of-plea    hearing     indicates        that   the    state   judge,   after\n\ndescribing the case as one that involved \"a break-in at Trader\n\nJack's with a safe\" and instructing Miller to \"[s]tay out of Trader\n\nJack's and all the other stores,\" asked him if \"[he] had enough\n\ntime to think about this.\"          Miller replied in the affirmative, but\n\ndid not undertake to correct the judge's characterization.                      The\n\ntranscript   reveals    that     the     judge    afforded      Miller   multiple\n\nopportunities    to   speak    on    the    subject.        Miller   consistently\n\nrefrained from any qualification or correction of the factual\n\npredicate upon which the judge's remarks rested.\n\n           Under these circumstances, we believe that Miller had\n\nample opportunity to take exception to particular facts with which\n\nhe disagreed.    He chose not to contest any of the facts that had\n\nbeen recounted by the state judge. Given these exchanges, we think\n\nit fair to conclude that Miller, by his silence, adopted those\n\nfacts (and, therefore, assented to their accuracy).                    Cf. United\n\nStates v. Smith, 390 F.3d 661, 665-66 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that\n\ndefense    counsel    conceded      as     true   the   prosecutor's      factual\n\ncharacterization of an offense where counsel failed to contest the\n\nmatter).   Taking all aspects into account, we find no error in the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fdistrict   court's   conclusion       that    Miller's     burglary   conviction\n\nrelated to a qualifying structure.\n\n           Miller's next argument is case-specific. He claims that,\n\neven if the district court properly considered the transcript, the\n\nevidence was insufficient to ground a finding that Trader Jack's\n\nwas a store (and, thus, a qualifying structure within the generic\n\ndefinition of burglary and the purview of the ACCA).               He offers no\n\nreal support for this argument beyond suggesting that he might have\n\nburglarized something other than a store.                  A Taylor analysis is\n\ncategorical,   but    an    inquiring       court    has   the   right   to   draw\n\nreasonable inferences from the evidence.              See, e.g., Bennett, 469\n\nF.3d at 50.    The court is not required either to wear blinders or\n\nto leave common sense out of the equation.\n\n           Here, given the references to Trader Jack's as a store\n\ncontaining a safe, we believe that the district court drew a\n\nreasonable inference and rendered a logical conclusion: that Trader\n\nJack's was a store and, thus, a building.              That determination was\n\nnot clearly erroneous, and the court was not required to abandon it\n\nmerely because Miller conjured up a speculative possibility.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Beasley, 442 F.3d 386, 393 (6th Cir. 2006)\n\n(explaining that a common sense factual determination cannot be\n\novercome   simply    by    pointing    to    \"some    lingering    metaphysical\n\ndoubt\").\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f            Miller's   final   argument   need   not   detain   us.   He\n\nhypothesizes that his constitutional rights were abridged because\n\nhe did not admit, and the government did not prove to a jury beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, his Connecticut state court conviction (or any\n\nother conviction, for that matter). We recently have rejected this\n\nprecise argument. See United States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 104-05\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); United States v. McKenney, 450 F.3d 39, 45-46 (1st\n\nCir. 2006); see also United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514,\n\n520 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).            That result was a foregone\n\nconclusion under current Supreme Court precedent.        See Almendarez-\n\nTorres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 239 (1998).\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe uphold Miller's sentence.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f",

Richards,</i> 456 F.3d 260, 262-63 (1st Cir.2006). Under this approach, an inquiring court, confronted with a prior burglary conviction, must first examine whether the conviction was based upon a statute that dovetails with the definition of generic burglary. <i>See Bennett,</i> 469 F.3d at 49. If it does, the inquiry ends and the prior conviction may be used as an ACCA predicate. <i>Id.</i> Where, as here, the underlying statute sweeps more broadly and defines burglary in terms that encompass but exceed the parameters of the generic definition, the court must move to the second step of the <i>Taylor</i> pavane in order to determine if \"the particular conviction actually embodied every element of a violent felony.\" <i>Richards,</i> 456 F.3d at 262.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second step is not a free-style exercise.

This doctrine provides that, in certain circumstances, a party's agreement with a fact stated by another may be inferred from (or \"adopted\" by) silence. <i>See id.; see also United States v. Fortes,</i> 619 F.2d 108, 115 (1st Cir.1980). Such an inference may arise when (i) a statement is made in a party's presence, (ii) the nature of the statement is such that it normally would induce the party to respond, and (iii) the party nonetheless fails to take exception. <i>See United States v. Higgs,</i> 353 F.3d 281, 309-10 (4th Cir.2003). In such an instance, the statement may be considered \"adopted\" by virtue of the party's failure to respond. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

The transcript of the change-of-plea hearing indicates that the state judge, after describing the case as one that involved \"a break-in at Trader Jack's with a safe\" and instructing Miller to \"[s]tay out of Trader Jack's and all the other stores,\" asked him if \"[he] had enough time to think about this.\" Miller replied in the affirmative, but did not undertake to correct the judge's characterization. The transcript reveals that the judge afforded Miller multiple opportunities to speak on the subject. Miller consistently refrained from any qualification or correction of the factual predicate upon which the judge's remarks rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we believe that Miller had ample opportunity to take exception to particular facts with which he disagreed. He chose not to contest any of the facts that had been recounted by the state judge. Given these exchanges, we think it fair to conclude that Miller, by his silence, adopted those facts (and, therefore, assented to their accuracy). <i>Cf. United States v. Smith,</i> 390 F.3d 661, 665-66 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that defense counsel conceded as true the prosecutor's factual characterization of an offense where counsel failed to contest the matter). Taking all aspects into account, we find no error in the district court's conclusion that Miller's burglary conviction related to a qualifying structure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller's next argument is case-specific. He claims that, even if the district court properly considered the transcript, the evidence was insufficient to ground a finding that Trader Jack's was a store (and, thus, a qualifying structure within the generic definition of burglary and the purview of the ACCA). He offers no real support for this argument beyond suggesting that he might have burglarized something other than a store. A <i>Taylor</i> analysis is categorical, but an inquiring court has the right to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. <i>See, e.g., Bennett,</i> 469 F.3d at 50. The court is not required either to wear blinders or to leave common sense out of the equation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, given the references to Trader Jack's as a store containing a safe, we believe that the district court drew a reasonable inference and rendered a logical conclusion: that Trader Jack's was a store and, thus, a building. That determination was not clearly erroneous, and the court was not required to abandon it merely because Miller conjured up a speculative possibility. <i>See United States v. Beasley,</i> 442 F.3d 386, 393 (6th Cir.2006) (explaining that a common sense factual determination cannot be overcome simply by pointing to \"some lingering metaphysical doubt\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller's final argument need not detain us. He hypothesizes that his constitutional rights were abridged because he did not admit, and the government did not prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, his Connecticut state court conviction (or any other conviction, for that matter). We recently have rejected this precise argument. <i>See United States v. Coplin,</i> 463 F.3d 96, 104-05 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v.

That result was a foregone conclusion under current Supreme Court precedent. <i>See Almendarez-Torres v.

Miller was sentenced to a 180-month incarcerative term under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1). On appeal, Miller argues (i) that the district court improperly relied upon a state court transcript in establishing one of the underlying convictions needed to engage the gears of the ACCA; (ii) that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he had been convicted of such a predicate offense; and (iii) that in all events, the ACCA enhancement violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. Concluding, as we do, that these arguments lack force, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are uncomplicated. On June 3, 2005, Miller pleaded guilty to a single-count indictment charging him with being a felon in possession of a handgun, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1). At the disposition hearing, the government claimed that Miller should be sentenced as an armed career criminal. Miller disputed that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the ACCA, a defendant such as Miller who has three prior \"violent felony\" convictions is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 924(e)(1). Both sides ultimately agreed that Miller had at least two prior convictions for violent felonies. They disagreed, however, as to whether a third conviction &#8212; a 2000 Connecticut state court conviction for third-degree burglary &#8212; constituted a countable predicate under the ACCA. Refined to bare essence, the parties' disagreement (and, hence, the issue of ACCA coverage) centered on the nature of this burglary conviction. We briefly explain the parameters of the dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A conviction for burglary may constitute a conviction for a violent felony within the purview of the ACCA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Burglary is not statutorily defined in the ACCA context, but the Supreme Court has held that, for purposes of section 924(e), burglary means generic burglary; that is, \"an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure with intent to commit a crime.\" <i>Taylor v.

Although the statute of conviction defines third-degree burglary as \"enter[ing] or remain[ing] unlawfully in a building with the intent to commit a crime,\" Conn. Gen.Stat. &#167; 53a-103(a), a related statute expands the ordinary definition of \"building\" to include, among other things, vehicles, watercraft, and railroad cars, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 53a-100.

The transcript of the change-of-plea hearing indicates that the state judge, after describing the case as one that involved \"a break-in at Trader Jack's with a safe\" and instructing Miller to \"[s]tay out of Trader Jack's and all the other stores,\" asked him if \"[he] had enough time to think about this.\" Miller replied in the affirmative, but did not undertake to correct the judge's characterization. The transcript reveals that the judge afforded Miller multiple opportunities to speak on the subject. Miller consistently refrained from any qualification or correction of the factual predicate upon which the judge's remarks rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we believe that Miller had ample opportunity to take exception to particular facts with which he disagreed. He chose not to contest any of the facts that had been recounted by the state judge. Given these exchanges, we think it fair to conclude that Miller, by his silence, adopted those facts (and, therefore, assented to their accuracy). <i>Cf. United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788490\"><a href=\"/opinion/788490/united-states-v-timothy-dean-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, 665-66 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that defense counsel conceded as true the prosecutor's factual characterization of an offense where counsel failed to contest the matter). Taking all aspects into account, we find no error in the district court's conclusion that Miller's burglary conviction related to a qualifying structure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller's next argument is case-specific. He claims that, even if the district court properly considered the transcript, the evidence was insufficient to ground a finding that Trader Jack's was a store (and, thus, a qualifying structure within the generic definition of burglary and the purview of the ACCA). He offers no real support for this argument beyond suggesting that he might have burglarized something other than a store. A <i>Taylor</i> analysis is categorical, but an inquiring court has the right to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. <i>See, e.g., Bennett,</i> 469 F.3d at 50. The court is not required either to wear blinders or to leave common sense out of the equation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, given the references to Trader Jack's as a store containing a safe, we believe that the district court drew a reasonable inference and rendered a logical conclusion: that Trader Jack's was a store and, thus, a building. That determination was not clearly erroneous, and the court was not required to abandon it merely because Miller conjured up a speculative possibility. <i>See United States v. Beasley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793763\"><a href=\"/opinion/793763/united-states-v-carson-beasley/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 393 (6th Cir.2006) (explaining that a common sense factual determination cannot be overcome simply by pointing to \"some lingering metaphysical doubt\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miller's final argument need not detain us. He hypothesizes that his constitutional rights were abridged because he did not admit, and the government did not prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, his Connecticut state court conviction (or any other conviction, for that matter). We recently have rejected this precise argument. <i>See United States v. Coplin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202424\"><a href=\"/opinion/202424/united-states-v-coplin/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 104-05 (1st Cir.2006); <i>United States v. McKenney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202251\"><a href=\"/opinion/202251/united-states-v-mckenney/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 45-46 (1st Cir. 2006); <i>see also United States v.

That result was a foregone conclusion under current Supreme Court precedent. <i>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 239, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
