The parties — who agree on little\n\nelse — mutually acknowledge that the appeal in this case was\n\nimprovidently taken to this court and that we lack jurisdiction\n\nover it.    The question remains, however, whether we should dismiss\n\nthe appeal (thus leaving the district court's judgment intact) or\n\ntransfer it to the proper venue (the Court of Appeals for the\n\nFederal Circuit).       For the reasons that follow, we hold that\n\ndismissal    would    not   be   in   the   interest   of   justice   (and,\n\naccordingly, grant the government's motion to transfer).\n\n                                      I.\n\n                                 Background\n\n            At this stage of the proceedings, the intricacies of the\n\nunderlying action are of only peripheral interest.            We therefore\n\nsketch the facts and the travel of the case, urging readers who\n\nhunger for more exegetic detail to consult the lower court's\n\nopinions.    See Britell v. United States, 204 F. Supp. 2d 182 (D.\n\nMass. 2002) (Britell II); Britell v. United States, 150 F. Supp. 2d\n\n211 (D. Mass. 2001) (Britell I).\n\n            Early in the term of her pregnancy, plaintiff-appellee\n\nMaureen M. Britell, the wife of an Air National Guard officer,\n\nlearned that the fetus she carried was anencephalic.            Given the\n\ngrim prognosis,1     Britell elected to have her pregnancy terminated.\n\n\n     1\n      Anencephalia is a rare condition, usually fatal before birth\n(or, if not, shortly thereafter). The Merck Manual of Diagnosis\nand Therapy 2222 (Mark H. Beers, M.D. & Robert Berkow, M.D. eds.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fThe procedure was performed at New England Medical Center (NEMC),\n\na renowned Boston teaching hospital.\n\n           Britell maintained her health care coverage through the\n\nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services\n\n(CHAMPUS), a government plan that provides medical benefits for\n\ndependents of military personnel. After a NEMC physician performed\n\nthe abortion that Britell requested, NEMC submitted a claim to\n\nCHAMPUS.   In accordance with federal law, see 10 U.S.C. § 1093(a)\n\n(reprinted in the appendix); 32 C.F.R. § 199.4(e)(2) (same),\n\nCHAMPUS refused to pay for the cost of the abortion.       Britell paid\n\nNEMC and then brought suit against the United States for $4,507.05,\n\nclaiming, inter alia, that the denial of coverage violated her\n\nconstitutional rights.\n\n           The district court granted summary judgment in Britell's\n\nfavor, concluding that \"there [was] no rational, legitimate state\n\ninterest   in   denying   coverage\"   for   abortion   services   in   the\n\ncircumstances of this case.     Britell II, 204 F. Supp. 2d at 185.\n\nThe government filed a timely notice of appeal with this court.\n\nThe parties fully briefed the case, and we scheduled oral argument\n\nfor December 4, 2002.\n\n           Approximately two weeks before the date set for oral\n\nargument, the government awoke to the fact that the United States\n\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had exclusive jurisdiction\n\n\n1999).\n\n                                  -3-\n\fover appeals in cases based in whole or in part on 28 U.S.C. § 1346\n\n(the so-called Little Tucker Act).           See 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(2)\n\n(reprinted in the appendix).       Based upon this belated realization,\n\nthe government moved to transfer the appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1631\n\n(reprinted in the appendix), a statute that authorizes a court\n\nfaced with a want of jurisdiction either to dismiss the proceeding\n\nbefore it or, in the alternative, to transfer that proceeding to a\n\ncourt of proper competence if doing so \"is in the interest of\n\njustice.\"    Britell opposed a transfer and asked instead that we\n\ndismiss the appeal outright.        On December 4, 2002, we heard oral\n\nargument on the question of transfer versus dismissal.\n\n                                    II.\n\n                                  Analysis\n\n            We subdivide our discussion of the pending motion into\n\nthree   segments.     We   begin    with     the    question   of    appellate\n\njurisdiction.    We then parse the transfer statute and, finally,\n\napply it.\n\n                                     A.\n\n                        Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n            Because   federal      courts     are     courts    of     limited\n\njurisdiction, each case must come within some articulable grant of\n\njurisdiction.    Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S.\n\n83, 101 (1998).       Such grants may be either constitutional or\n\nstatutory   in   nature.    Id.      However,      jurisdiction     cannot   be\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fconferred upon a federal court by waiver, consent, or collusion of\n\nthe parties.   Irving v. United States, 162 F.3d 154, 161 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (en banc).\n\n          In this instance, the record reveals beyond hope of\n\ncontradiction that we lack jurisdiction to decide the merits of the\n\ngovernment's appeal.    Britell's complaint premised the district\n\ncourt's jurisdiction, in relevant part, on 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a).\n\nThat statute — reprinted in the appendix — grants district courts\n\njurisdiction (with exceptions not apposite here) over non-tort\n\ncivil actions or claims against the United States, not exceeding\n\n$10,000 in amount, whether founded upon the Constitution, a federal\n\nstatute or regulation, or a contract.    Because Britell's case fits\n\ncomfortably within those contours, the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Massachusetts had original jurisdiction over\n\nit.\n\n          This brings us to the appeal.      Although most district\n\ncourt judgments are appealable to the court of appeals for the\n\ncircuit in which the district court sits, see 28 U.S.C. § 1291,\n\nthat pattern does not always obtain. There are several exceptions,\n\none of which is pertinent here.       By statute, the United States\n\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction\n\nover \"an[y] appeal from a final decision of a district court of the\n\nUnited States . . . if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in\n\nwhole or in part, on [28 U.S.C. § 1346] . . . .\"        28 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f1295(a)(2). While that statute contains some wiggle room, see id.,\n\nno   way   around   its   jurisdictional   mandate   applies   in   the\n\ncircumstances at hand.     Consequently, deciding this appeal is the\n\nexclusive prerogative of the Federal Circuit.\n\n                                   B.\n\n                          The Transfer Statute\n\n           From what we already have written, it is readily evident\n\nthat this court lacks jurisdiction over the merits of the instant\n\nappeal. In such circumstances, Congress has granted federal courts\n\nlimited authority to transfer an action or appeal to a federal\n\ncourt of competent jurisdiction.    The controlling statute reads in\n\npertinent part:\n\n           Whenever a civil action is filed in a court .\n           . . or an appeal, including a petition for\n           review of administrative action, is noticed\n           for or filed with such a court and that court\n           finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,\n           the court shall, if it is in the interest of\n           justice, transfer such action or appeal to any\n           other such [federal] court in which the action\n           or appeal could have been brought at the time\n           it was filed or noticed, and the action or\n           appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed\n           in or noticed for the court to which it is\n           transferred on the date upon which it was\n           actually filed in or noticed for the court\n           from which it was transferred.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1631.\n\n           Although the grant of authority is clear, the guidance\n\nprovided by the text of the statute appears somewhat contradictory.\n\nOn the one hand, Congress's use of the word \"shall\" in section 1631\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fseemingly dictates a preference for transfer in all cases that\n\ncould have been brought in some other federal court.2     See, e.g.,\n\nWebster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 2085 (1993) (stating that\n\n\"shall\" typically is \"used in laws . . . to express what is\n\nmandatory\"). On the other hand, section 1631 contains a qualifying\n\nphrase — \"if it is in the interest of justice\" — and that qualifier\n\nseems to call for a balancing of the equities (and, thus, to make\n\nthe transfer decision discretionary). We reconcile this tension by\n\nexamining the text, structure, and history of section 1631.      See\n\nUnited States v. Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d 685, 688\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).   In the end, we conclude that Congress intended to\n\ncreate a presumption — albeit a rebuttable one — in favor of\n\ntransfer.\n\n            The existence of the presumption is easily discerned.\n\nCongress's use of the phrase \"shall . . . transfer\" in section 1631\n\npersuasively indicates that transfer, rather than dismissal, is the\n\noption of choice.    The legislative history likewise points to a\n\npresumption in favor of transfer.      Congress adopted legislation,\n\nnow codified as section 1631, in the wake of a case in which the\n\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit acknowledged an ambiguity involving\n\nwhich of two courts had appellate jurisdiction, and, although it\n\naffirmed a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, it directed that the\n\n\n\n     2\n      The universe of courts to which section 1631 applies is\ndelimited by 28 U.S.C. § 610 (reprinted in the appendix).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fappellant be permitted to file a petition for reconsideration with\n\nthe proper authority.       Investment Co. Inst. v. Bd. of Govs. of the\n\nFed. Reserve Sys., 551 F.2d 1270, 1282-83 (D.C. Cir. 1977).             The\n\ncourt suggested that, in the future, counsel would do well \"to file\n\npetitions in both courts . . . if there is any doubt.\"              Id. at\n\n1282.   Judge Leventhal, in a powerful concurring opinion, urged\n\n\"enactment    of   a   general    statute   permitting   transfer   between\n\ndistrict courts and courts of appeals in the interest of justice.\"\n\nId. at 1283 (Leventhal, J. concurring).\n\n            In response to the concerns raised by Judge Leventhal,\n\nCongress enacted section 1631.          Congress crafted the statute to\n\nachieve two closely related goals. First, it sought to ensure that\n\n\"a litigant [does not] find himself without a remedy because of a\n\nlawyer's error or a technicality of procedure [that results from]\n\nuncertainty in some statutes regarding which court has review\n\nauthority.\"     S. Rep. No. 97-275, at 11 (1982), reprinted in 1982\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 11, 21.         Second it sought to prevent duplicitous\n\nlitigation that would prove \"wasteful and costly.\"                Id.   The\n\nconclusion that transfer, rather than dismissal, is the option of\n\nchoice is consistent with the formulation of these goals.\n\n            So read, section 1631 protects litigants against both\n\nstatutory imprecision and lawyers' errors.               It also offers a\n\npractical     alternative    to   the   prophylactic,    but   inordinately\n\nwasteful, precaution of double filing.         Last — but far from least\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f— reading section 1631 to create such a presumption furthers the\n\nsalutary policy favoring the resolution of cases on the merits.\n\nSee, e.g., Am. Alliance Ins. Co. v. Eagle Ins. Co., 92 F.3d 57, 61\n\n(2d Cir. 1996); Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers Union\n\nv. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir. 1992).                      Put\n\nanother way, transfer is presumptively preferable because the\n\ndismissal of an action or appeal that might thrive elsewhere is not\n\nonly   resource-wasting    but    also      justice-defeating.        See   Cruz-\n\nAguilera v. INS, 245 F.3d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n           Even though there is a presumption in favor of transfer,\n\nthe text of the statute compels the conclusion that the presumption\n\nis rebuttable.    After all, Congress inserted language specifically\n\ndesigned to    ensure    that    transfer     would   not     be   automatic;    it\n\nconditioned transfer in any particular case on a finding that such\n\na course of action \"is in the interest of justice.\"                  28 U.S.C. §\n\n1631. Only if an inquiring court determines that a transfer is not\n\nin the interest of justice is the presumption rebutted.\n\n           Thus, even though transfer is the option of choice, an\n\ninquiring court must undertake case-specific scrutiny to ferret out\n\ninstances in which the administration of justice would be better\n\nserved by dismissal.      See Horsley v. Johnson, 197 F.3d 134, 136\n\n(5th Cir. 1999); see also Am. Alliance, 92 F.3d at 61 (observing\n\nthat \"abuses     of   process    may   be    prevented   by    enforcing    those\n\ndefaults that arise from egregious or deliberate conduct\").                 Given\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthe language of the statute, we are confident that Congress wanted\n\ncourts to exempt from the transfer mandate those cases in which\n\ntransfer   would   unfairly    benefit         the   proponent,   e.g.,    Janicki\n\nLogging Co. v. Mateer, 42 F.3d 561, 566-67 (9th Cir. 1994), impose\n\nan unwarranted hardship on an objector, e.g., id. at 566, or unduly\n\nburden the judicial system, e.g., Phillips v. Seiter, 173 F.3d 609,\n\n610-11 (7th Cir. 1999).             In conducting its inquiry into the\n\npresence or absence of such factors, a putative transferor court\n\nmust consider the totality of the circumstances.                  See Liriano v.\n\nUnited States, 95 F.3d 119, 122-23 (2d Cir. 1996).\n\n           Among other things, this responsibility obligates the\n\ncourt to engage in whole-record review.                 This obligation flows\n\nnaturally from the language of section 1631, which directs the\n\nputative transferor court to determine if \"the action or appeal\n\ncould have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed\" in any\n\nother federal court.       28 U.S.C. § 1631.            Common sense suggests\n\nthat, in order to comply with this directive, the court must\n\nexamine the complete record.\n\n           This    intuition       is   reinforced     by   the   fact    that   the\n\ninterest of justice analysis necessarily involves considerations of\n\njudicial   administration      (and,      therefore,     requires    at    least   a\n\npreliminary   evaluation      of    the   parties'      positions).       If,    for\n\nexample, an action or appeal has obvious merit and the filing\n\nperiod has expired, dismissal — even dismissal without prejudice —\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fwould frustrate one of the principal objectives of section 1631.\n\nSee Ross v. Colo. Outward Bound Sch., 822 F.2d 1524, 1526-27 (10th\n\nCir. 1987).   The flip side of the coin is that if an action or\n\nappeal is fanciful or frivolous, it is in the interest of justice\n\nto dismiss it rather than to keep it on life support (with the\n\ninevitable result that the transferee court will pull the plug).\n\nSee Seiter, 173 F.3d at 610-11 (reasoning that a case that \"is a\n\nsure loser\" should be dismissed rather than transferred).    Either\n\nway, a look at the merits is indicated.\n\n                                 C.\n\n                          The Case at Bar\n\n          Against this backdrop, we turn to the case at bar.     We\n\nstart with a presumption in favor of transfer — a presumption that\n\nis heightened by our knowledge that the appeal period has run (and,\n\ntherefore, that dismissal will leave the government without any\n\neffective means of obtaining judicial review of the district\n\ncourt's judgment).\n\n          Our examination of the record furnishes no compelling\n\nrebuttal to this presumption.    Despite Britell's insinuations to\n\nthe contrary, we have no reason to believe that the government\n\nacted in bad faith.   It had nothing to gain — and much to lose — by\n\nfiling its notice of appeal in the wrong court.       Moreover, the\n\ngovernment exercised due diligence once it discovered its error.\n\nFinally, Britell will suffer only incidental inconvenience from a\n\n\n                                -11-\n\ftransfer — the need for refiling her brief and the frustration of\n\nwaiting a few more months before the litigation is resolved.\n\nInconvenience of this sort simply does not amount to the kind of\n\nprejudice that would justify the outright dismissal of an action or\n\nappeal.       See Janicki Logging, 42 F.3d at 566.\n\n              In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,\n\nBritell argues that this case involves only a small amount of\n\nmoney; that the government, which should be expected to possess\n\nspecial expertise with regard to the operation of the Little Tucker\n\nAct, created the jurisdictional glitch;3 and that, therefore, the\n\ninterest of justice would be served by ending the matter here and\n\nnow.       We do not agree with this assessment.\n\n               It is nose-on-the-face plain that the decision below has\n\nramifications far beyond its impact on this particular dispute.\n\nThe decision undermines an Act of Congress and, in the bargain,\n\ninvalidates part of a major program administered by the Executive\n\nBranch of the federal government.         What is more, its correctness\n\nseems, at first blush, to be a matter over which reasonable jurists\n\ncould disagree.       It follows that appellate review of the district\n\n\n\n       3\n      This aspect of Britell's argument prompts us to note that the\ngovernment is not the only party who should be expected to know the\njurisdictional rules.     The plaintiff is \"the master of the\ncomplaint.\" Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 398-99\n(1987).   Thus, Britell was chargeable with knowledge that, by\ninvoking 28 U.S.C. § 1346 as the basis of the district court's\njurisdiction, any appeal would have to be heard in the Federal\nCircuit.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fcourt's decision may well prove important from the standpoint of\n\npublic policy.      That is a significant factor in the decisional\n\ncalculus:     a court holding the levers of section 1631 should\n\nconsider    the   consequences   of    both     transfer   and    dismissal   in\n\ndeciding which course of action to follow.

The question remains, however, whether we should dismiss the appeal (thus leaving the district court's judgment intact) or transfer it to the proper venue (the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit). For the reasons that follow, we hold that dismissal would not be in the interest of justice (and, accordingly, grant the government's motion to transfer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this stage of the proceedings, the intricacies of the underlying action are of only peripheral interest. We therefore sketch the facts and the travel of the case, urging readers who hunger for more exegetic detail to consult the lower court's opinions. <i>See Britell v. United States,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d 182 (D.Mass.2002) (<i>Britell II</i>); <i>Britell v. United States,</i> 150 F.Supp.2d 211 (D.Mass.2001) (<i>Britell I</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in the term of her pregnancy, plaintiff-appellee Maureen M. Britell, the wife of an Air National Guard officer, learned that the fetus she carried was anencephalic. Given the grim prognosis,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Britell elected to have her pregnancy terminated. The procedure was performed at New England Medical Center (NEMC), a renowned Boston teaching hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Britell maintained her health care coverage through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), a government plan that provides medical benefits for dependents of military personnel. After a NEMC physician performed the abortion that Britell requested, NEMC submitted a claim to CHAMPUS. In accordance with federal law, <i>see</i> 10 U.S.C. &#167; 1093(a) (reprinted in the appendix); 32 C.F.R. &#167; 199.4(e)(2) (same), CHAMPUS refused to pay for the cost of the abortion. Britell paid NEMC and then brought suit against the United States for $4,507.05, claiming, inter alia, that the denial of coverage violated her constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment in Britell's favor, concluding that \"there [was] no rational, legitimate state interest in denying coverage\" for abortion services in the circumstances of this case. <i>Britell II,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 185. The government filed a timely notice of appeal with this court. The parties fully briefed the case, and we scheduled oral argument for December 4, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately two weeks before the date set for oral argument, the government awoke to the fact that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had exclusive jurisdiction over appeals in cases based in whole or in part on 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346 (the so-called Little Tucker Act). <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1295(a)(2) (reprinted in the appendix). Based upon this belated realization, the government moved to transfer the appeal under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631 (reprinted in the appendix), a statute that authorizes a court faced with a want of jurisdiction either to dismiss the proceeding before it or, in the alternative, to transfer that proceeding to a court of proper competence if doing so \"is in the interest of justice.\" Britell opposed a transfer and asked instead that we dismiss the appeal outright. On December 4, 2002, we heard oral argument on the question of transfer versus dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Analysis</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We subdivide our discussion of the pending motion into three segments. We begin with the question of appellate jurisdiction. We then parse the transfer statute and, finally, apply it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Appellate Jurisdiction</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, each case must come within some articulable grant of jurisdiction. <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 101, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). Such grants may be either constitutional or statutory in nature. <i>Id.</i> However, jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon a federal court by waiver, consent, or collusion of the parties. <i>Irving v. United States,</i> 162 F.3d 154, 161 (1st Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the record reveals beyond hope of contradiction that we lack jurisdiction to decide the merits of the government's appeal. Britell's complaint premised the district court's jurisdiction, in relevant part, on 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(a). That statute &#8212; reprinted in the appendix &#8212; grants district courts jurisdiction (with exceptions not apposite here) over non-tort civil actions or claims against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, whether founded upon the Constitution, a federal statute or regulation, or a contract. Because Britell's case fits comfortably within those contours, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts had original jurisdiction over it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the appeal. Although most district court judgments are appealable to the court of appeals for the circuit in which the district court sits, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, that pattern does not always obtain. There are several exceptions, one of which is pertinent here. By statute, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over \"an[y] appeal from a final decision of a district court of the United States ... if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on [28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346]....\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1295(a)(2). While that statute contains some wiggle room, <i>see id.,</i> no way around its jurisdictional mandate applies in the circumstances at hand. Consequently, deciding this appeal is the exclusive prerogative of the Federal Circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Transfer Statute</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From what we already have written, it is readily evident that this court lacks jurisdiction over the merits of the instant appeal. In such circumstances, Congress has granted federal courts limited authority to transfer an action or appeal to a federal court of competent jurisdiction. The controlling statute reads in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever a civil action is filed in a court... or an appeal, including a petition for review of administrative action, is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any other such [federal] court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed, and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or noticed for the court from which it was transferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the grant of authority is clear, the guidance provided by the text of the statute appears somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, Congress's use of the word \"shall\" in section 1631 seemingly dictates a preference for transfer in all cases that could have been brought in some other federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g.,</i> Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 2085 (1993) (stating that \"shall\" typically is \"used in laws ... to express what is mandatory\"). On the other hand, section 1631 contains a qualifying phrase &#8212; \"if it is in the interest of justice\" &#8212; and that qualifier seems to call for a balancing of the equities (and, thus, to make the transfer decision discretionary). We reconcile this tension by examining the text, structure, and history of section 1631. <i>See United States v. Charles George Trucking Co.,</i> 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir.1987). In the end, we conclude that Congress intended to create a presumption &#8212; albeit a rebuttable one &#8212; in favor of transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existence of the presumption is easily discerned. Congress's use of the phrase \"shall ... transfer\" in section 1631 persuasively indicates that transfer, rather than dismissal, is the option of choice. The legislative history likewise points to a presumption in favor of transfer. Congress adopted legislation, now codified as section 1631, in the wake of a case in which the District of Columbia Circuit acknowledged an ambiguity involving which of two courts had appellate jurisdiction, and, although it affirmed a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, it directed that the appellant be permitted to file a petition for reconsideration with the proper authority. <i>Investment Co. Inst. v. Bd. of Govs. of the Fed. Reserve Sys.,</i> 551 F.2d 1270, 1282-83 (D.C.Cir. 1977). The court suggested that, in the future, counsel would do well \"to file petitions in both courts ... if there is any doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1282. Judge Leventhal, in a powerful concurring opinion, urged \"enactment of a general statute permitting transfer between district courts and courts of appeals in the interest of justice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1283 (Leventhal, J. concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the concerns raised by Judge Leventhal, Congress enacted section 1631. Congress crafted the statute to achieve two closely related goals. First, it sought to ensure that \"a litigant [does not] find himself without a remedy because of a lawyer's error or a technicality of procedure [that results from] uncertainty in some statutes regarding which court has review authority.\" S.Rep. No. 97-275, at 11 (1982), <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 11, 21. Second it sought to prevent duplicitous litigation that would prove \"wasteful and costly.\" <i>Id.</i> The conclusion that transfer, rather than dismissal, is the option of choice is consistent with the formulation of these goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So read, section 1631 protects litigants against both statutory imprecision and lawyers' errors. It also offers a practical alternative to the prophylactic, but inordinately wasteful, precaution of double filing. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; reading section 1631 to create such a presumption furthers the salutary policy favoring the resolution of cases on the merits. <i>See, e.g., Am. Alliance Ins. Co. v. Eagle Ins. Co.,</i> 92 F.3d 57, 61 (2d Cir.1996); <i>Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 19 (1st Cir.1992). Put another way, transfer is presumptively preferable because the dismissal of an action or appeal that might thrive elsewhere is not only resource-wasting but also justice-defeating. <i>See Cruz-Aguilera v. INS,</i> 245 F.3d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though there is a presumption in favor of transfer, the text of the statute compels the conclusion that the presumption is rebuttable. After all, Congress inserted language specifically designed to ensure that transfer would not be automatic; it conditioned transfer in any particular case on a finding that such a course of action \"is in the interest of justice.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631. Only if an inquiring court determines that a transfer is not in the interest of justice is the presumption rebutted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even though transfer is the option of choice, an inquiring court must undertake case-specific scrutiny to ferret out instances in which the administration of justice would be better served by dismissal. <i>See Horsley v. Johnson,</i> 197 F.3d 134, 136 (5th Cir.1999); <i>see also Am. Alliance,</i> 92 F.3d at 61 (observing that \"abuses of process may be prevented by enforcing those defaults that arise from egregious or deliberate conduct\"). Given the language of the statute, we are confident that Congress wanted courts to exempt from the transfer mandate those cases in which transfer would unfairly benefit the proponent, <i>e.g., Janicki Logging Co. v. Mateer,</i> 42 F.3d 561, 566-67 (9th Cir.1994), impose an unwarranted hardship on an objector, <i>e.g., id.</i> at 566, or unduly burden the judicial system, <i>e.g., Phillips v. Seiter,</i> 173 F.3d 609, 610-11 (7th Cir.1999). In conducting its inquiry into the presence or absence of such factors, a putative transferor court must consider the totality of the circumstances. <i>See Liriano v. United States,</i> 95 F.3d 119, 122-23 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among other things, this responsibility obligates the court to engage in whole-record review. This obligation flows naturally from the language of section 1631, which directs the putative transferor court to determine if \"the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed\" in any other federal court. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631. Common sense suggests that, in order to comply with this directive, the court must examine the complete record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This intuition is reinforced by the fact that the interest of justice analysis necessarily involves considerations of judicial administration (and, therefore, requires at least a preliminary evaluation of the parties' positions). If, for example, an action or appeal has obvious merit and the filing period has expired, dismissal &#8212; even dismissal without prejudice &#8212; would frustrate one of the principal objectives of section 1631. <i>See Ross v. Colo. Outward Bound Sch.,</i> 822 F.2d 1524, 1526-27 (10th Cir. 1987). The flip side of the coin is that if an action or appeal is fanciful or frivolous, it is in the interest of justice to dismiss it rather than to keep it on life support (with the inevitable result that the transferee court will pull the plug). <i>See Seiter,</i> 173 F.3d at 610-11 (reasoning that a case that \"is a sure loser\" should be dismissed rather than transferred). Either way, a look at the merits is indicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>C.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Case at Bar</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the case at bar. We start with a presumption in favor of transfer &#8212; a presumption that is heightened by our knowledge that the appeal period has run (and, therefore, that dismissal will leave the government without any effective means of obtaining judicial review of the district court's judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination of the record furnishes no compelling rebuttal to this presumption. Despite Britell's insinuations to the contrary, we have no reason to believe that the government acted in bad faith. It had nothing to gain &#8212; and much to lose &#8212; by filing its notice of appeal in the wrong court. Moreover, the government exercised due diligence once it discovered its error. Finally, Britell will suffer only incidental inconvenience from a transfer &#8212; the need for refiling her brief and the frustration of waiting a few more months before the litigation is resolved. Inconvenience of this sort simply does not amount to the kind of prejudice that would justify the outright dismissal of an action or appeal. <i>See Janicki Logging,</i> 42 F.3d at 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Britell argues that this case involves only a small amount of money; that the government, which should be expected to possess special expertise with regard to the operation of the Little Tucker Act, created the jurisdictional glitch;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that, therefore, the interest of justice would be served by ending the matter here and now. We do not agree with this assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is nose-on-the-face plain that the decision below has ramifications far beyond its impact on this particular dispute. The decision undermines an Act of Congress and, in the bargain, invalidates part of a major program administered by the Executive Branch of the federal government. What is more, its correctness seems, at first blush, to be a matter over which reasonable jurists could disagree. It follows that appellate review of the district court's decision may well prove important from the standpoint of public policy. That is a significant factor in the decisional calculus: a court holding the levers of section 1631 should consider the consequences of both transfer and dismissal in deciding which course of action to follow. <i>Seiter,</i> 173 F.3d at 610-11 (citing <i>Christianson v.

Britell, the wife of an Air National Guard officer, learned that the fetus she carried was anencephalic. Given the grim prognosis,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Britell elected to have her pregnancy terminated. The procedure was performed at New England Medical Center (NEMC), a renowned Boston teaching hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Britell maintained her health care coverage through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), a government plan that provides medical benefits for dependents of military personnel. After a NEMC physician performed the abortion that Britell requested, NEMC submitted a claim to CHAMPUS. In accordance with federal law, <i>see</i> 10 U.S.C. &#167; 1093(a) (reprinted in the appendix); 32 C.F.R. &#167; 199.4(e)(2) (same), CHAMPUS refused to pay for the cost of the abortion. Britell paid NEMC and then brought suit against the United States for $4,507.05, claiming, inter alia, that the denial of coverage violated her constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment in Britell's favor, concluding that \"there [was] no rational, legitimate state interest in denying coverage\" for abortion services in the circumstances of this case. <i>Britell II,</i> 204 F.Supp.2d at 185.

Based upon this belated realization, the government moved to transfer the appeal under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631 (reprinted in the appendix), a statute that authorizes a court faced with a want of jurisdiction either to dismiss the proceeding before it or, in the alternative, to transfer that proceeding to a court of proper competence if doing so \"is in the interest of justice.\" Britell opposed a transfer and asked instead that we dismiss the appeal outright. On December 4, 2002, we heard oral argument on the question of transfer versus dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Analysis</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We subdivide our discussion of the pending motion into three segments.

Such grants may be either constitutional or statutory in nature. <i>Id.</i> However, jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon a federal court by waiver, consent, or collusion of the parties. <i>Irving v.

Britell's complaint premised the district court's jurisdiction, in relevant part, on 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(a). That statute &#8212; reprinted in the appendix &#8212; grants district courts jurisdiction (with exceptions not apposite here) over non-tort civil actions or claims against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, whether founded upon the Constitution, a federal statute or regulation, or a contract. Because Britell's case fits comfortably within those contours, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts had original jurisdiction over it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the appeal. Although most district court judgments are appealable to the court of appeals for the circuit in which the district court sits, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, that pattern does not always obtain. There are several exceptions, one of which is pertinent here. By statute, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over \"an[y] appeal from a final decision of a district court of the United States ... if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on [28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346]....\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1295(a)(2). While that statute contains some wiggle room, <i>see id.,</i> no way around its jurisdictional mandate applies in the circumstances at hand. Consequently, deciding this appeal is the exclusive prerogative of the Federal Circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Transfer Statute</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From what we already have written, it is readily evident that this court lacks jurisdiction over the merits of the instant appeal. In such circumstances, Congress has granted federal courts limited authority to transfer an action or appeal to a federal court of competent jurisdiction. The controlling statute reads in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever a civil action is filed in a court... or an appeal, including a petition for review of administrative action, is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any other such [federal] court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed, and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or noticed for the court from which it was transferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the grant of authority is clear, the guidance provided by the text of the statute appears somewhat contradictory. On the one hand, Congress's use of the word \"shall\" in section 1631 seemingly dictates a preference for transfer in all cases that could have been brought in some other federal court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See, e.g.,</i> Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 2085 (1993) (stating that \"shall\" typically is \"used in laws ... to express what is mandatory\"). On the other hand, section 1631 contains a qualifying phrase &#8212; \"if it is in the interest of justice\" &#8212; and that qualifier seems to call for a balancing of the equities (and, thus, to make the transfer decision discretionary). We reconcile this tension by examining the text, structure, and history of section 1631. <i>See United States v. Charles George Trucking Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491460\"><a href=\"/opinion/491460/united-states-v-charles-george-trucking-co-charles-george-sr-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 688 (1st Cir.1987). In the end, we conclude that Congress intended to create a presumption &#8212; albeit a rebuttable one &#8212; in favor of transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existence of the presumption is easily discerned. Congress's use of the phrase \"shall ... transfer\" in section 1631 persuasively indicates that transfer, rather than dismissal, is the option of choice. The legislative history likewise points to a presumption in favor of transfer. Congress adopted legislation, now codified as section 1631, in the wake of a case in which the District of Columbia Circuit acknowledged an ambiguity involving which of two courts had appellate jurisdiction, and, although it affirmed a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, it directed that the appellant be permitted to file a petition for reconsideration with the proper authority. <i>Investment Co. Inst. v. Bd. of Govs. of the Fed. Reserve Sys.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"344232\"><a href=\"/opinion/344232/investment-company-institute-v-board-of-governors-of-the-federal-reserve/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1270</span></a></span>, 1282-83 (D.C.Cir. 1977). The court suggested that, in the future, counsel would do well \"to file petitions in both courts ... if there is any doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1282. Judge Leventhal, in a powerful concurring opinion, urged \"enactment of a general statute permitting transfer between district courts and courts of appeals in the interest of justice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1283 (Leventhal, J. concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the concerns raised by Judge Leventhal, Congress enacted section 1631. Congress crafted the statute to achieve two closely related goals. First, it sought to ensure that \"a litigant [does not] find himself without a remedy because of a lawyer's error or a technicality of procedure [that results from] uncertainty in some statutes regarding which court has review authority.\" S.Rep. No. 97-275, at 11 (1982), <i>reprinted in</i> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 11, 21. Second it sought to prevent duplicitous litigation that would prove \"wasteful and costly.\" <i>Id.</i> The conclusion that transfer, rather than dismissal, is the option of choice is consistent with the formulation of these goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So read, section 1631 protects litigants against both statutory imprecision and lawyers' errors. It also offers a practical alternative to the prophylactic, but inordinately wasteful, precaution of double filing. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; reading section 1631 to create such a presumption furthers the salutary policy favoring the resolution of cases on the merits. <i>See, e.g., Am. Alliance Ins. Co. v. Eagle Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723921\"><a href=\"/opinion/723921/american-alliance-insurance-co-ltd-v-eagle-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 61 (2d Cir.1996); <i>Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v.

Put another way, transfer is presumptively preferable because the dismissal of an action or appeal that might thrive elsewhere is not only resource-wasting but also justice-defeating. <i>See Cruz-Aguilera v.

After all, Congress inserted language specifically designed to ensure that transfer would not be automatic; it conditioned transfer in any particular case on a finding that such a course of action \"is in the interest of justice.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631. Only if an inquiring court determines that a transfer is not in the interest of justice is the presumption rebutted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, even though transfer is the option of choice, an inquiring court must undertake case-specific scrutiny to ferret out instances in which the administration of justice would be better served by dismissal. <i>See Horsley v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"19307\"><a href=\"/opinion/19307/horsley-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 136 (5th Cir.1999); <i>see also Am. Alliance,</i> 92 F.3d at 61 (observing that \"abuses of process may be prevented by enforcing those defaults that arise from egregious or deliberate conduct\"). Given the language of the statute, we are confident that Congress wanted courts to exempt from the transfer mandate those cases in which transfer would unfairly benefit the proponent, <i>e.g., Janicki Logging Co. v. Mateer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684134\"><a href=\"/opinion/684134/janicki-logging-co-v-bruce-mateer-dale-robertson/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span>, 566-67 (9th Cir.1994), impose an unwarranted hardship on an objector, <i>e.g., id.</i> at 566, or unduly burden the judicial system, <i>e.g., Phillips v. Seiter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763239\"><a href=\"/opinion/763239/andre-l-phillips-v-richard-p-seiter-glenn-watson-v-jeffrey-j-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 610-11 (7th Cir.1999). In conducting its inquiry into the presence or absence of such factors, a putative transferor court must consider the totality of the circumstances. <i>See Liriano v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726053\"><a href=\"/opinion/726053/miguel-dejesus-liriano-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 122-23 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among other things, this responsibility obligates the court to engage in whole-record review. This obligation flows naturally from the language of section 1631, which directs the putative transferor court to determine if \"the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed\" in any other federal court. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631. Common sense suggests that, in order to comply with this directive, the court must examine the complete record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This intuition is reinforced by the fact that the interest of justice analysis necessarily involves considerations of judicial administration (and, therefore, requires at least a preliminary evaluation of the parties' positions). If, for example, an action or appeal has obvious merit and the filing period has expired, dismissal &#8212; even dismissal without prejudice &#8212; would frustrate one of the principal objectives of section 1631. <i>See Ross v. Colo. Outward Bound Sch.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490943\"><a href=\"/opinion/490943/luise-m-ross-as-administratrix-of-the-goods-chattels-and-credits-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span>, 1526-27 (10th Cir. 1987). The flip side of the coin is that if an action or appeal is fanciful or frivolous, it is in the interest of justice to dismiss it rather than to keep it on life support (with the inevitable result that the transferee court will pull the plug). <i>See Seiter,</i> 173 F.3d at 610-11 (reasoning that a case that \"is a sure loser\" should be dismissed rather than transferred). Either way, a look at the merits is indicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>C.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>The Case at Bar</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the case at bar. We start with a presumption in favor of transfer &#8212; a presumption that is heightened by our knowledge that the appeal period has run (and, therefore, that dismissal will leave the government without any effective means of obtaining judicial review of the district court's judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination of the record furnishes no compelling rebuttal to this presumption. Despite Britell's insinuations to the contrary, we have no reason to believe that the government acted in bad faith. It had nothing to gain &#8212; and much to lose &#8212; by filing its notice of appeal in the wrong court. Moreover, the government exercised due diligence once it discovered its error. Finally, Britell will suffer only incidental inconvenience from a transfer &#8212; the need for refiling her brief and the frustration of waiting a few more months before the litigation is resolved. Inconvenience of this sort simply does not amount to the kind of prejudice that would justify the outright dismissal of an action or appeal. <i>See Janicki Logging,</i> 42 F.3d at 566.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, Britell argues that this case involves only a small amount of money; that the government, which should be expected to possess special expertise with regard to the operation of the Little Tucker Act, created the jurisdictional glitch;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and that, therefore, the interest of justice would be served by ending the matter here and now. We do not agree with this assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is nose-on-the-face plain that the decision below has ramifications far beyond its impact on this particular dispute. The decision undermines an Act of Congress and, in the bargain, invalidates part of a major program administered by the Executive Branch of the federal government. What is more, its correctness seems, at first blush, to be a matter over which reasonable jurists could disagree. It follows that appellate review of the district court's decision may well prove important from the standpoint of public policy. That is a significant factor in the decisional calculus: a court holding the levers of section 1631 should consider the consequences of both transfer and dismissal in deciding which course of action to follow. <i>Seiter,</i> 173 F.3d at 610-11 (citing <i>Christianson v.
