Williams III on memorandum for respondent.\n\n\n\n                         February 16, 2005\n\f            Per Curiam. In April of 2004, the Maine Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt ordered Charles G. Williams III disbarred from the practice\n\nof law.    According to the court's order, the evidence \"established\n\na   pattern    of     client     neglect,          excessive   fees,    incompetency,\n\nunauthorized        disclosure    of       financial      information,      failure    to\n\nrespond to orders of the Fee Arbitration Commission, and failure to\n\nrespond to inquiries from Bar Counsel.\" Following that disbarment,\n\nthis court issued an order to show cause why Williams should not be\n\nreciprocally disbarred.               See Fed. R. App. P. 46(b)(2).                   The\n\nrespondent attorney sought and was granted a hearing, Fed. R. App.\n\nP. 46(c), but thereafter failed to appear on the appointed date.\n\nWe now order that he be disbarred from practice before this court.\n\n              A member of this court's bar who \"has been suspended or\n\ndisbarred     from    practice        in    any     other   court\"     is   subject    to\n\nreciprocal discipline.           Fed. R. App. P. 46(b)(1)(A).               An attorney\n\nwho has been so disciplined must promptly inform this court of the\n\ndisciplinary action.           1st Cir. R. Att'y Disciplinary Enforcement\n\n(Discip.    R.)     II.A.      Upon        receiving      official    notice    of   such\n\ndiscipline, the Chief Judge will refer the matter to a disciplinary\n\npanel appointed by him or her.               Discip. R. II.B, V.A.          The clerk of\n\nthe court then serves the respondent attorney, personally or by\n\ncertified or registered mail, with an order to show cause why\n\nsubstantially similar discipline should not be imposed. Discip. R.\n\nII.B.2.       The    order     must    contain        a   statement    informing      the\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\frespondent attorney that any forthcoming request for hearing on the\n\nquestion of reciprocal discipline shall be made within thirty days\n\nafter service of the order.    Id.\n\n           In the absence of a response, the disciplinary panel will\n\nimpose discipline substantially similar to that imposed by the\n\noriginal court.    Discip. R. II.C.           If, however, a response is\n\nfiled, the disciplinary panel will consider whether the respondent\n\nhas demonstrated extenuating circumstances that warrant sanctions\n\ndifferent from those imposed by the original court.              Id.    If a\n\nhearing is requested, that consideration will take place after the\n\nhearing.   Id.\n\n           Where, as here, action against an attorney is based on\n\nthe imposition    of   discipline   by    a   state   court,   the   ultimate\n\ndecision of the state court as to the type and kind of discipline\n\nmeted out is \"not conclusively binding\" on this court.                 In re\n\nRuffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 547 (1968).            Nevertheless, this court is\n\nwithout jurisdiction, in a federal disciplinary proceeding, to\n\ndisturb the state court's imposition of discipline, see D.C. Court\n\nof Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 485-86 (1982); Rooker v.\n\nFidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16 (1923), and the state\n\ncourt's substantive findings ordinarily are entitled to a high\n\ndegree of respect when this court is asked to impose reciprocal\n\ndiscipline, see, e.g., Theard v. United States, 354 U.S. 278, 282\n\n(1957); Gadda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 934, 943 (9th Cir.), cert.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fdenied, 125 S. Ct. 275 (2004); In re Surrick, 338 F.3d 224, 231 (3d\n\nCir. 2003); cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1219 (2004); In re Hoare, 155\n\nF.3d 937, 940 (8th Cir. 1998).\n\n            To accomplish its task, this court will undertake an\n\n\"intrinsic consideration of the state record.\" Selling v. Radford,\n\n243 U.S. 46, 51 (1917).     Given that approach, \"the record of prior\n\ndisciplinary proceedings . . . [is] of substantial relevance in\n\ndetermining whether an attorney should be disbarred from practice.\"\n\nIn re Cordova-Gonzalez, 996 F.2d 1334, 1336-37 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting In re Evans, 834 F.2d 90, 91 (4th Cir. 1987)).            It is the\n\nburden of the respondent attorney to ensure that this whole of the\n\nrecord is furnished to the court in a timely manner and to identify\n\nthe parts of the record upon which he relies.          See Fed. R. App. P.\n\n28(a)(9)(A), Fed R. App. P. 28(e); see generally Discip. R. V.B\n\n(directing the respondent attorney to specify the basis on which\n\nany controverted facts are disputed).\n\n            As a general rule, discipline similar to that imposed in\n\nthe state    court   will   be   imposed   in   a   reciprocal   proceeding.\n\nExceptions may arise if this court finds (i) a deprivation of\n\nprocedural due process (usually defined as a want of notice or\n\nopportunity to be heard), (ii) an infirmity of proof of misconduct\n\nsuch as would \"give rise to a clear conviction on our part that we\n\ncould not consistently with our duty accept as final the [state\n\ncourt's] ultimate conclusion,\" or (iii) the existence of some other\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fserious impediment to acceptance of the state court's conclusion.\n\nSelling, 243 U.S. at 51.       This framework has been memorialized in\n\nDiscip. R. II.C, which provides that, in reciprocal disciplinary\n\nmatters, the panel will impose substantially the same discipline as\n\nwas imposed by the original court unless it is persuaded:\n\n             1. that the procedure used by the other court\n             was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be\n             heard as to constitute a deprivation of due\n             process; or\n\n             2. that there was such an infirmity of proof\n             establishing the misconduct as to give rise to\n             the clear conviction that this Court could\n             not, consistent with its duty, accept as final\n             the conclusion on that subject; or\n\n             3.    that the imposition of substantially\n             similar discipline by this Court would result\n             in grave injustice; or\n\n             4. that the misconduct established is deemed\n             by the Court to warrant different discipline.\n\n             In addition to considering the state court record, this\n\ncourt will ordinarily afford the respondent attorney a hearing, if\n\nrequested.      In    exceptional   circumstances     (and   upon    a   proper\n\nshowing), an evidentiary hearing may be granted in the panel's sole\n\ndiscretion.    In the usual case, the hearing will be on the papers,\n\nsupplemented     by    oral   argument    addressed   to     the    respondent\n\nattorney's specific challenges to the conduct and outcome of the\n\nstate proceedings.      See In re Jaffree, 759 F.2d 604, 605 n.1 (7th\n\nCir. 1985).      The purpose of the hearing is not to afford the\n\nrespondent attorney \"an opportunity to retry the state case,\" id.,\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fbut, rather, to afford him an opportunity to explain his position\n\nmore lucidly to the disciplinary panel.\n\n             When all is said and done, the respondent attorney must\n\ncarry the devoir of persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence,\n\nthat imposition of reciprocal discipline is unwarranted.              Surrick,\n\n338 F.3d at 232; In re Kramer, 282 F.3d 721, 724 (9th Cir. 2002);\n\nIn re Friedman, 51 F.3d 20, 22 (2d Cir. 1995).             Given the limited\n\nnature of our inquiry, the norm will be for this court to impose\n\ndiscipline which is substantially similar to that imposed by the\n\nstate court.     See Hoare, 155 F.3d at 940.\n\n             In the case at hand, the show-cause order satisfied all\n\napplicable requirements, including those enumerated above.                   The\n\nrespondent attorney filed a reply and requested a hearing. He then\n\nwaived that request by his failure to appear.\n\n             We have nonetheless examined his response with care. The\n\nonly cognizable infirmity that he alleges is that the State of\n\nMaine denied him due process.1             In this context, however, due\n\nprocess concerns are limited to \"want of notice or opportunity to\n\nbe heard.\"    Selling, 243 U.S. at 51.       The respondent has proffered\n\nno   credible    evidence     that   the    notice   actually    given       was\n\ninappropriate     or   that    the   state     did   not     afford    him     a\n\n\n\n     1\n      The respondent attorney's other claims are forfeit because he\nhas failed to supply this court, despite several requests, with\nmaterial portions of the record of the state court disciplinary\nproceeding.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fconstitutionally sufficient opportunity to be heard. Thus, his due\n\nprocess claim fails.\n\n          We need go no further.   Cause not having been shown, we\n\nare constrained to impose upon the respondent reciprocal discipline\n\nsubstantially similar to that imposed by the Maine Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt.   Accordingly, Attorney Charles G. Williams III is hereby\n\ndisbarred from the practice of law before this court.\n\n\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Williams III on memorandum for respondent.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA, LYNCH and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 2004, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ordered Charles G. Williams III disbarred from the practice of law. According to the court's order, the evidence \"established a pattern of client neglect, excessive fees, incompetency, unauthorized disclosure of financial information, failure to respond to orders of the Fee Arbitration Commission, and failure to respond to inquiries from Bar Counsel.\" Following that disbarment, this court issued an order to show cause why Williams should not be reciprocally disbarred. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 46(b)(2). The respondent attorney sought and was granted a hearing, Fed. R.App. P. 46(c), but thereafter failed to appear on the appointed date. We now order that he be disbarred from practice before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A member of this court's bar who \"has been suspended or disbarred from practice in any other court\" is subject to reciprocal discipline. Fed. R.App. P. 46(b)(1)(A). An attorney who has been so disciplined must promptly inform this court of the disciplinary action. 1st Cir. R. Att'y Disciplinary Enforcement (Discip. R.) II.A. Upon receiving official notice of such discipline, the Chief Judge will refer the matter to a disciplinary panel appointed by him or her. Discip. R. II.B, V.A. The clerk of the court then serves the respondent attorney, personally or by certified or registered mail, with an order to show cause why substantially similar discipline should not be imposed. Discip. R. II.B.2. The order must contain a statement informing the respondent attorney that any forthcoming request for hearing on the question of reciprocal discipline shall be made within thirty days after service of the order. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of a response, the disciplinary panel will impose discipline substantially similar to that imposed by the original court. Discip. R. II.C. If, however, a response is filed, the disciplinary panel will consider whether the respondent has demonstrated extenuating circumstances that warrant sanctions different from those imposed by the original court. <i>Id.</i> If a hearing is requested, that consideration will take place after the hearing. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, action against an attorney is based on the imposition of discipline by a state court, the ultimate decision of the state court as to the type and kind of discipline meted out is \"not conclusively binding\" on this court. <i>In re Ruffalo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107654\"><a href=\"/opinion/107654/in-re-ruffalo/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 547, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107654\"><a href=\"/opinion/107654/in-re-ruffalo/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nevertheless, this court is without jurisdiction, in a federal disciplinary proceeding, to disturb the state court's imposition of discipline, <i>see D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></span>, 485-86, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></span> (1917). Given that approach, \"the record of prior disciplinary proceedings... [is] of substantial relevance in determining whether an attorney should be disbarred from practice.\" <i>In re Cordova-Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610554\"><a href=\"/opinion/610554/in-re-antonio-l-cordova-gonzalez-in-re-antonio-l-cordova-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1334</span></a></span>, 1336-37 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting <i>In re Evans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498061\"><a href=\"/opinion/498061/in-re-paul-g-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 91 (4th Cir.1987)). It is the burden of the respondent attorney to ensure that this whole of the record is furnished to the court in a timely manner and to identify the parts of the record upon which he relies. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A), Fed R.App. P. 28(e); <i>see generally</i> Discip. R. V.B (directing the respondent attorney to specify the basis on which any controverted facts are disputed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, discipline similar to that imposed in the state court will be imposed in a reciprocal proceeding. Exceptions may arise if this court finds (i) a deprivation of procedural due process (usually defined as a want of notice or opportunity to be heard), (ii) an infirmity of proof of misconduct such as would \"give rise to a clear conviction on our part that we could not consistently with our duty accept as final the [state court's] ultimate conclusion,\" or (iii) the existence of some other serious impediment to acceptance of the state court's conclusion. <i>Selling,</i> 243 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></span>. This framework has been memorialized in Discip. R. II.C, which provides that, in reciprocal disciplinary matters, the panel will impose substantially the same discipline as was imposed by the original court unless it is persuaded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. that the procedure used by the other court was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. that there was such an infirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the clear conviction that this Court could not, consistent with its duty, accept as final the conclusion on that subject; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. that the imposition of substantially similar discipline by this Court would result in grave injustice; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. that the misconduct established is deemed by the Court to warrant different discipline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to considering the state court record, this court will ordinarily afford the respondent attorney a hearing, if requested. In exceptional circumstances (and upon a proper showing), an evidentiary hearing may be granted in the panel's sole discretion. In the usual case, the hearing will be on the papers, supplemented by oral argument addressed to the respondent attorney's specific challenges to the conduct and outcome of the state proceedings. <i>See In re Jafree,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450622\"><a href=\"/opinion/450622/in-the-matter-of-sayyid-mohammed-jawaid-iqbal-jafree-no-d-37/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span>, 605 n. 1 (7th Cir.1985). The purpose of the hearing is not to afford the respondent attorney \"an opportunity to retry the state case,\" <i>id.,</i> but, rather, to afford him an opportunity to explain his position more lucidly to the disciplinary panel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When all is said and done, the respondent attorney must carry the devoir of persuasion, by clear and convincing evidence, that imposition of reciprocal discipline is unwarranted. <i>Surrick,</i> 338 F.3d at 232; <i>In re Kramer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776813\"><a href=\"/opinion/776813/in-re-steven-kramer/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span>, 724 (9th Cir.2002); <i>In re Friedman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692327\"><a href=\"/opinion/692327/in-re-theodore-h-friedman-grievance-committee-for-the-southern-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (2d Cir.1995). Given the limited nature of our inquiry, the norm will be for this court to impose discipline which is substantially similar to that imposed by the state court. <i>See Hoare,</i> 155 F.3d at 940.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the show-cause order satisfied all applicable requirements, including those enumerated above. The respondent attorney filed a reply and requested a hearing. He then waived that request by his failure to appear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have nonetheless examined his response with care. The only cognizable infirmity that he alleges is that the State of Maine denied him due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In this context, however, due process concerns are limited to \"want of notice or opportunity to be heard.\" <i>Selling,</i> 243 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></span>. The respondent has proffered no credible evidence that the notice actually given was inappropriate or that the state did not afford him a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to be heard. Thus, his due process claim fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Cause not having been shown, we are constrained to impose upon the respondent reciprocal discipline substantially similar to that imposed by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Accordingly, Attorney Charles G. Williams III is hereby disbarred from the practice of law before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So Ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The respondent attorney's other claims are forfeit because he has failed to supply this court, despite several requests, with material portions of the record of the state court disciplinary proceeding</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
