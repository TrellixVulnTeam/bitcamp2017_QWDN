William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Wendy Sibbison, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\n     Virginia M. Vander Jagt, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n                          June 27, 3005\n\n\n\n\n__________\n*Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.        In this case, defendant-appellant\n\nChristopher Martins challenges the district court's denial of his\n\nmotion to suppress the critical evidence used to convict him.                His\n\nappeal raises novel questions related to (i) the contours of the\n\n\"emergency aid\" branch of the exigent circumstances doctrine and\n\n(ii) the    authority     of    law   enforcement   officers   to   conduct    a\n\nprotective sweep following a warrantless but lawful entry into a\n\nprivate residence.       After answering these and other questions, we\n\naffirm the defendant's conviction and sentence.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            Given the principal focus of this appeal, we glean the\n\nfacts, as supportably found by the district court, from the record\n\nof   the   suppression    hearing.       We   supplement   those    facts,    as\n\nnecessary, with other facts contained in the record.                 Once the\n\nstage is set, we map the travel of the case.\n\n                                 A.   The Facts.\n\n            On the evening of February 10, 2002, Sergeant Detective\n\nDaniel Linskey responded to a radio call from an anti-gang unit\n\nabout a shooting at the corner of Wendover and Dudley Streets in\n\nBoston's Roxbury section. Upon his arrival, he discovered a victim\n\nnursing a gunshot wound.          The wounded man could not provide any\n\nuseful information about the shooting.\n\n            A bystander informed Linskey that there was a second\n\nvictim up the street.          Linskey proceeded north on Wendover Street\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ffor   about    100   yards.     Another    bystander   directed   him    to   an\n\napartment building.       Linskey entered the structure's first-floor\n\ncommon area and saw a man he knew as \"Fats\" sitting in a kitchen\n\nchair outside Apartment No. 1.            The area was otherwise devoid of\n\nfurniture.      Linskey asked Fats, who was bleeding from a gunshot\n\nwound to the leg, where he had gotten the chair.          Fats replied that\n\nhe had received it from \"his boy\" inside Apartment No. 1.\n\n              At that juncture, Linskey approached the exterior door of\n\nthe apartment.       He immediately noticed a strong odor of marijuana\n\nwafting from within.          He knocked on the door and an adult male\n\nvoice asked him to identify himself.           Linskey replied that he was\n\na police officer and asked to speak with the occupant.                  He next\n\nheard voices and the sound of movement coming from within the\n\napartment.      This was followed by utter silence.\n\n              After ninety seconds or so, Linskey knocked again and\n\nasked to speak with the occupant.           A young boy (perhaps eleven or\n\ntwelve years old) opened the door and stepped back into the foyer\n\nof the apartment. The interior was poorly lit, but Linskey noticed\n\nmarijuana smoke drifting through the air.              He asked the youth\n\nwhether his parents were home or whether anyone else was in the\n\nunit.   The boy responded in the negative.          His voice was markedly\n\ndifferent from the voice that had originally spoken to Linskey from\n\nbehind the closed door.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          Linskey then stepped into the apartment and spied an even\n\nyounger girl watching television in a bedroom.    When he was three\n\nor four feet inside the threshold, he heard yelling from outside.\n\nThis proved to be the defendant, who entered the apartment by way\n\nof the common hallway.   The defendant asked what Linskey was doing\n\nthere and Linskey replied that he was investigating a shooting.\n\nAdverting to the marijuana smoke, Linskey asked whether anyone was\n\nin the apartment with the children.   The defendant said that he was\n\nin charge and that nobody else was present.\n\n           By that time, several other officers had arrived at the\n\nscene and gathered in the common hallway.   Linskey ordered them to\n\nundertake a protective sweep of the premises to ascertain whether\n\nthe adult who originally had answered Linskey's knock was still\n\nthere.   During the suppression hearing, Linskey testified that he\n\nordered the sweep for a variety of reasons, including the location\n\nof one of the shooting victims immediately outside the apartment,\n\nthe marijuana smoke within, and the presence of young, apparently\n\nunsupervised children.    The principal impetus for his decision,\n\nhowever, was that he had heard an older man speak from within the\n\napartment, yet both the youngster who answered the door and the\n\ndefendant insisted that no one else was there.    Linskey indicated\n\nthat he was not sure who this other man was, what involvement he\n\nmay have had with the shootings, or even whether the defendant was\n\naware that someone might have entered the apartment.    Given these\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fmanifold uncertainties, Linskey was concerned for the safety of\n\neveryone involved.\n\n          The sweep quickly bore fruit.        In a bedroom, Linskey\n\ndiscovered José DeVeiga sitting on a bed, wrapped in a cloud of\n\nmarijuana smoke.      DeVeiga seemed to be under the influence of\n\ndrugs.   Linskey patted DeVeiga down, found no weapons, and asked\n\nwhere the marijuana was stashed.       When DeVeiga denied having any\n\nmarijuana, an incredulous Linskey remarked the thick marijuana\n\nsmoke filling the room.\n\n          At that point, the defendant volunteered that he had been\n\nsmoking marijuana and called Linskey's attention to two marijuana\n\nroaches in an ashtray on the floor.       Linskey told the defendant\n\nthat the cold roaches could not have been the source of the\n\nbillowing smoke.     He then announced that he would obtain a search\n\nwarrant in an effort to locate the marijuana and instructed other\n\nofficers to \"freeze\" the apartment.       He thereupon arrested both\n\nDeVeiga and the defendant for possession of marijuana and placed\n\nthe two children in a relative's care.\n\n          The police rapidly obtained and executed a search warrant\n\nfor the premises.       The ensuing search retrieved, inter alia,\n\nhandgun and rifle ammunition, as well as a Pyrex dish containing\n\ncrack cocaine residue.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                             B.   Travel of the Case.\n\n            On June 11, 2003, a federal grand jury in the District of\n\nMassachusetts indicted the defendant on charges of (i) being a\n\nfelon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(g)(1)       and   (ii)    possessing     cocaine   base   with   intent    to\n\ndistribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).               The defendant\n\nmoved to suppress the evidence found in the apartment on Fourth\n\nAmendment grounds.           He contended that the warrantless entry was\n\nneither consensual nor justified by exigent circumstances and that\n\nthe protective sweep was unlawful.\n\n            The government opposed the motion and, on October 27,\n\n2003, the district court convened a suppression hearing.                      Only\n\nLinskey testified.           The court deemed his account credible in all\n\nrelevant respects.            It then made a series of findings.               We\n\nsummarize them.\n\n            C          The child's actions at the threshold\n                       did not indicate either explicit or\n                       implicit consent to enter.\n\n            C          Exigent    circumstances    authorized\n                       Linskey to enter; he had reasonable\n                       cause to fear for the safety of the\n                       boy, given the ongoing drug crime and\n                       the possibility that he was unattended\n                       or that one or more adults who were\n                       participating   in  that   crime  were\n                       present in the apartment.\n\n            C          The totality of the circumstances\n                       afforded Linskey a basis for reasonable\n                       suspicion that someone in the apartment\n                       posed a danger to him or to others and,\n                       thus, justified a protective sweep.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f                   The apartment was in a high-crime area;\n                   there had been a recent shooting nearby\n                   and it was reasonable to infer that the\n                   shooting was gang-related; and Fats\n                   might well have been allied with a\n                   gang, so that his retreat to Apartment\n                   No. 1 might have represented a retreat\n                   to a place where his confederates\n                   resided.\n\nOn the basis of these findings, the court denied the motion to\n\nsuppress.\n\n            The case culminated in a four-day trial.           The jury\n\nconvicted on both counts.    The district court held the disposition\n\nhearing on March 25, 2004.    At that session, the court, relying on\n\nthe presentence investigation report (PSI Report), found that the\n\ndefendant was a career offender.        See USSG §4B1.1.   The defendant\n\nunsuccessfully objected to this designation.       The court calculated\n\nthe guideline sentencing range to be 210-262 months.\n\n            The prosecution sought a sentence at the midpoint of that\n\nrange, whereas the defendant sought a downward departure on the\n\nground    that   his   criminal   history      category    substantially\n\noverrepresented the seriousness of his prior criminality.            The\n\ncourt agreed with the overrepresentation claim, but weighed the\n\noverrepresentation against a number of aggravating factors present\n\nin the crimes of conviction and refused to depart downward.         When\n\nall was said and done, the court imposed a 210-month incarcerative\n\nterm.    This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fII.   DISCUSSION\n\n           The defendant's asseverational array includes Fourth\n\nAmendment challenges to both the initial entry into his apartment\n\nand the subsequent protective sweep; objections to his sentence;\n\nand a complaint anent ineffective assistance of counsel.                 We\n\naddress these three categories of claims sequentially.\n\n                    A.   The Fourth Amendment Claims.\n\n           Both    aspects   of   the    defendant's   Fourth   Amendment\n\nchallenge involve mixed questions of fact and law.         Consequently,\n\nwe assay the district court's factual findings for clear error and\n\nthen review de novo its ultimate conclusion that the discerned\n\nfacts constitute a sufficient legal basis to justify the conduct\n\nabout   which   the   defendant   complains.     See   United   States   v.\n\nSchaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 565 & n.2 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v.\n\nTibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           1.     Warrantless Entry.     It is a bedrock principle that\n\nthe prophylaxis of the Fourth Amendment is at its zenith with\n\nrespect to an individual's home.         See Kyllo v. United States, 533\n\nU.S. 27, 31 (2001).        Thus, a \"warrantless police entry into a\n\nresidence is presumptively unreasonable unless it falls within the\n\ncompass of one of a few well-delineated exceptions.\" United States\n\nv. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 68 (1st Cir. 2004).               Some of these\n\nexceptions are bundled together under the heading of \"exigent\n\ncircumstances\" — a heading that encompasses those situations in\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fwhich some compelling reason for immediate action excuses law\n\nenforcement officers from pausing to obtain a warrant. See Tibolt,\n\n72 F.3d at 969.       Common examples of exigent circumstances include\n\n\"(1) 'hot pursuit' of a fleeing felon; (2) threatened destruction\n\nof evidence inside a residence before a warrant can be obtained;\n\n(3)   a   risk    that   the    suspect   may   escape       from   the     residence\n\nundetected; or (4) a threat, posed by a suspect, to the lives or\n\nsafety of the public, the police officers, or to herself.\" Hegarty\n\nv. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1374 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n              The Hegarty list is not an exclusive compendium, and the\n\ngovernment's principal argument here invokes another species of\n\nexigent circumstances:          the emergency aid doctrine.           See Mincey v.\n\nArizona, 437 U.S. 385, 392 (1978) (noting, in dictum, that \"the\n\nFourth    Amendment      does    not   bar    police    officers      from    making\n\nwarrantless entries and searches when they reasonably believe that\n\na person within [a private residence] is in need of immediate\n\naid\").    The Mincey dictum has prompted several courts to designate\n\na   general      \"emergency     aid\"   category    as    a    genre    of    exigent\n\ncircumstances sufficient to justify a warrantless entry into a\n\nhome.     See, e.g., United States v. Holloway, 290 F.3d 1331, 1337\n\n(11th Cir. 2002); United States v. Richardson, 208 F.3d 626, 630\n\n(7th Cir. 2000); Wayne v. United States, 318 F.2d 205, 212 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1963) (Burger, J.).         We joined this parade in United States v.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fBeaudoin, 362 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 484\n\n(2004).1\n\n            Under     this    doctrine       the      police,       in    an    emergency\n\nsituation,   may     enter    a    residence       without      a    warrant     if   they\n\nreasonably believe that swift action is required to safeguard life\n\nor prevent serious harm.           See id.      To rely upon the doctrine, the\n\ngovernment must show a reasonable basis, approximating probable\n\ncause, both for the officers' belief that an emergency exists and\n\nfor linking the perceived emergency with the area or place into\n\nwhich they propose to intrude.            Id.    The requisite inquiry must be\n\nundertaken    in     light    of    the    totality       of        the   circumstances\n\nconfronting the officers, including, in many cases, a need for an\n\non-the-spot judgment based on incomplete information and sometimes\n\nambiguous    facts      bearing      upon       the     potential         for     serious\n\nconsequences.       See id.\n\n            In applying this yardstick in the case at hand, we survey\n\nthe objective facts known to Linskey in the time frame leading up\n\nto his entry.       See Tibolt, 72 F.3d at 969.              Upon knocking on the\n\ndoor, Linskey heard an adult male voice, followed by conversation,\n\n\n\n     1\n      Our opinion in Beaudoin disposed of the appeals of two\ndefendants.   The Supreme Court denied certiorari in Beaudoin's\ncase, but vacated his codefendant's sentence in light of its\ndecision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005). See\nChampagne v. United States, 125 S. Ct. 1025 (2005). The vacation\nof the judgment vis-à-vis Champagne in no way undercuts our\naffirmance of the conviction and, thus, Beaudoin's Fourth Amendment\nholding remains binding circuit precedent.\n\n                                       -10-\n\fmovement, and then silence.     Upon a second knock, the door opened\n\nto reveal a young boy in an apartment filled with thick marijuana\n\nsmoke.   The child indicated that he was home alone — a dubious\n\nproposition in light of Linskey's knowledge that an adult male had\n\nbeen inside the dwelling moments earlier.2         It seemed implausible\n\nthat the boy was unaware of the man's presence; indeed, the two\n\nmost likely inferences were that the boy was dissembling or that\n\nthe man had fled.    Thus, the officer could have been reasonably\n\ncertain either that a man seeking to conceal himself from the\n\npolice was using the boy as a pawn in a dicey game of hide-and-seek\n\nor that the man had bolted and left the boy unsupervised.\n\n           Either way, the child was present in the midst of an\n\nongoing crime (marijuana use) and was exposed to toxic smoke,\n\nplacing his welfare at risk.        The officer would have been remiss\n\nhad he   eschewed   any   attempt   to     ameliorate   the   boy's   plight.\n\nBecause this parlous state of affairs gave Linskey ample cause to\n\nbelieve that the boy needed emergency assistance, it justified his\n\nentry.   See 3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 6.6(a) (4th ed.\n\n\n\n     2\n      The defendant argues that Linskey entered the apartment\nbefore the boy stated that he was home alone.     To bolster this\nargument, he points to inconclusive and ambiguous snippets culled\nfrom Linskey's testimony. But the district court found otherwise,\nand that finding was not clearly erroneous. See Cumpiano v. Banco\nSantander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that\n\"[w]here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the\nfactfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous\")\n(quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574\n(1985)).\n\n                                    -11-\n\f2004) (stating that warrantless \"entry for the purpose of rendering\n\naid is reasonable . . . [in order] to assist unattended small\n\nchildren\") (collecting cases).\n\n            This holding is within the mainstream of Fourth Amendment\n\njurisprudence.    Other courts have found exigent circumstances in\n\nsimilar situations.      In United States v. Bradley, 321 F.3d 1212\n\n(9th Cir. 2003), the police became aware that a nine-year-old boy\n\nwas potentially home alone after his mother's arrest. Id. at 1213.\n\nAfter receiving no response to repeated knocking, the police\n\nannounced their presence, entered the home through an unlocked back\n\ndoor, and discovered the child.        Id. at 1214.       The Ninth Circuit\n\nemphasized that the officers were aware that a child was home alone\n\nbut were not aware of conditions inside the house.             Id. at 1215.\n\nBased primarily    on    those   facts,   the   court    reasoned   that   the\n\n\"possibility of a nine-year-old child in a house in the middle of\n\nthe night without the supervision of any responsible adult is a\n\nsituation    requiring     immediate      police    assistance.\"           Id.\n\nConsequently, the court found the officers' warrantless entry\n\njustified under the emergency aid doctrine.             Id.\n\n            So too United States v. Hughes, 993 F.2d 1313 (7th Cir.\n\n1993), in which the police learned that an adolescent — a thirteen-\n\nyear-old girl — was inside a house occupied by persons smoking\n\ncrack cocaine.    Id. at 1314.     A police officer entered without a\n\nwarrant, explaining that he had done so because he \"did not know if\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f[the girl] was being held against her will, or if she was there\n\nusing drugs.\" Id. at 1315. Predicated on the officer's reasonable\n\nbelief that the child might be in danger, the Seventh Circuit found\n\nthat exigent circumstances justified the entry.        See id.\n\n          The defendant seeks to debunk the reasonableness of\n\nLinskey's belief that the boy was in need of emergency assistance.\n\nHe points to several cases in which risk to children was found not\n\nto amount to exigent circumstances. See, e.g., Roska ex rel. Roska\n\nv. Peterson, 328 F.3d 1230, 1240-41 (10th Cir. 2003); Calabretta v.\n\nFloyd, 189 F.3d 808, 813 (9th Cir. 1999); Good v. Dauphin County\n\nSocial Servs. for Children & Youth, 891 F.2d 1087, 1095 (3d Cir.\n\n1989).   But without exception, these cases involve much less\n\nominous fact patterns.     Far from helping the defendant, they put\n\nthe situation here into clearer focus. Unlike, say, the officer in\n\nCalabretta, 189 F.3d at 813, Linskey did not enter the home based\n\non some unsubstantiated report of possible danger; rather, he\n\npersonally witnessed a child at the center of illicit drug activity\n\nand had reasonable cause to believe that the child either had been\n\nabandoned or else forced to help conceal an adult's presence.         The\n\nmoment cried out for an immediate entry.\n\n          The defendant makes a last-ditch effort to blunt the\n\nforce of this conclusion:          he suggests that the exigency was\n\nmanufactured   by   the   police   and,   thus,   cannot   justify   their\n\nwarrantless entry.    While we agree that law enforcement officers\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fmay not manipulate events to create an emergency and bootstrap that\n\ninvented emergency into a justification for a warrantless entry of\n\na person's home, see United States v. Curzi, 867 F.2d 36, 43 n.6\n\n(1st Cir. 1989), that principle is unavailing here.\n\n                  We rest this holding on two grounds. In the first place,\n\nthe defendant's \"manufactured evidence\" argument is made for the\n\nfirst time on appeal.           It is, therefore, forfeited.         See B & T\n\nMasonry Constr. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Mutual Ins. Co., 382 F.3d 36, 40\n\n(1st       Cir.    2004)   (explaining   that   \"legal   theories   not   raised\n\nsquarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time\n\non appeal\") (internal quotation marks omitted).                In the second\n\nplace,       given     the   district    court's    supportable     credibility\n\ndetermination, the record cannot sustain a claim that Linskey\n\nmanipulated events to conjure up an emergency.                For aught that\n\nappears, he was simply doing a difficult job under difficult\n\ncircumstances.\n\n                  That ends this aspect of the matter.            We hold that\n\nnotwithstanding the absence of a warrant, the officer's entry into\n\nthe defendant's apartment was justified by exigent circumstances.3\n\n                  2.   The Protective Sweep.       The defendant's remaining\n\nFourth Amendment plaint focuses on the legality vel non of the\n\nprotective sweep that the officers conducted after entering the\n\n\n       3\n      This holding makes it unnecessary to consider the\ngovernment's argument that the district court clearly erred in\nfinding that the child did not consent to Linskey's entry.\n\n                                         -14-\n\fapartment.          The    baseline     rule    is    that     police    officers,    in\n\nconjunction with an arrest on residential premises, may undertake\n\na protective sweep so long as they can point to \"articulable facts\n\nwhich, taken together with the rational inferences from those\n\nfacts,\" would warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing\n\n\"that the area harbor[s] an individual posing a danger.\"                      Maryland\n\nv.   Buie,    494    U.S.    325,     327    (1990)       (internal   quotation    marks\n\nomitted).      This standard is an extension of the doctrine that\n\npermits a police officer to pat down an individual for concealed\n\nweapons upon a reasonable suspicion that the individual might be\n\narmed, provided that the officer's belief is grounded in \"specific\n\nand articulable facts.\"             Id. at 331-32 (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392\n\nU.S. 1, 21 (1968)).          The reasonable suspicion needed to justify a\n\nprotective sweep is \"no more and no less than was required in\n\nTerry.\"      Id. at 334.\n\n             Reasonable       suspicion        is    an    objective    standard;    its\n\nexistence      \"centers       upon     the     objective       significance   of     the\n\nparticular facts under all the circumstances.\"                        United States v.\n\nWoodrum,     202    F.3d     1,   7   (1st    Cir.    2000).      That    standard    is\n\nconsiderably less demanding than the level of proof required to\n\nsupport a finding of probable cause.                  Romain, 393 F.3d at 71.\n\n              The scope of a protective sweep is limited: the doctrine\n\nallows only a \"cursory inspection of those spaces where a person\n\nmay be found.\"            Buie, 494 U.S. at 335.             The sweep may last \"no\n\n\n                                             -15-\n\flonger than is necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of\n\ndanger and in any event no longer than it takes to complete the\n\narrest and depart the premises.\"    Id. at 335-36.\n\n          Although Buie itself speaks of protective sweeps incident\n\nto arrest, this court has employed the doctrine to allow protective\n\nsweeps in conjunction with the execution of search warrants.      See\n\nDrohan v. Vaughn, 176 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v.\n\nDaoust, 916 F.2d 757, 759 (1st Cir. 1990).    Since police officers\n\nlawfully may enter a home either with a warrant or upon probable\n\ncause plus exigent circumstances, see Kirk v. Louisiana, 536 U.S.\n\n635, 638 (2002) (per curiam), it would make no sense to hold that\n\nthe police may conduct a protective sweep when lawfully entering\n\nwith a warrant but must refrain from doing so when lawfully\n\nentering on the basis of exigent circumstances.      In either event,\n\nthe key is the reasonableness of the belief that the officers'\n\nsafety or the safety of others may be at risk.   We hold, therefore,\n\nthat police who have lawfully entered a residence possess the same\n\nright to conduct a protective sweep whether an arrest warrant, a\n\nsearch warrant, or the existence of exigent circumstances prompts\n\ntheir entry.   See United States v. Gould, 364 F.3d 578, 584-87 (5th\n\nCir. 2004) (en banc) (stating that a protective sweep may be\n\njustified so long as police did not enter illegally); United States\n\nv. Taylor, 248 F.3d 506, 513 (6th Cir. 2001) (holding that because\n\nofficers can constitutionally secure an area while awaiting a\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fsearch warrant to ensure that evidence will not be destroyed, \"it\n\nfollows logically that . . . the police may conduct a limited\n\nprotective sweep [of that area] to ensure the safety of those\n\nofficers\"); cf. United States v. Garcia, 997 F.2d 1273, 1282 (9th\n\nCir. 1993) (permitting protective sweep when police were lawfully\n\npresent in a home by consent); United States v. Patrick, 959 F.2d\n\n991,   996    (D.C.   Cir.    1992)    (declaring,    in     the   context     of   a\n\nconsensual entry, that \"[o]nce the police were lawfully on the\n\npremises, they were authorized to conduct a protective sweep\").\n\n              Beyond his general objection to the availability of the\n\nprotective sweep doctrine in the case of entries premised on\n\nexigent      circumstances,    the     defendant    also     asserts    that    the\n\nprotective sweep undertaken in this case transgressed the Fourth\n\nAmendment because the police did not have reasonable suspicion to\n\nbelieve that someone in the apartment posed a danger.                    In this\n\nregard, he contends that the only real basis for suspecting danger\n\nwas the apartment's location in a high-crime plagued by gang\n\nactivity.\n\n              If this were so, the defendant's point would be well-\n\ntaken; mere      presence     in   a   high-crime    area,    without   more,       is\n\ninsufficient to meet the reasonable suspicion benchmark.                        See\n\nIllinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 124 (2000); United States v.\n\nQuinn, 815 F.2d 153, 162 (1st Cir. 1987).                    Here, however, the\n\ndefendant reads the record much too myopically.                There were other\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\ffactors in addition to the location of the apartment in a high-\n\ncrime neighborhood that contributed to the formation of reasonable\n\nsuspicion.     We explain briefly.\n\n             The   shootings,    in   which   two   men   were   wounded,    had\n\noccurred within 100 yards of the apartment complex.              Moreover, the\n\napartment was tied to the shootings because one of the victims, not\n\na resident of the apartment, had retreated there.            The police knew\n\nfrom experience that victims in gang-area shootings often were gang\n\nmembers     themselves   and    tended   to   congregate    with   other    gang\n\nmembers.4     Cf. William Turner, Rescuing of the Romish Fox (1545)\n\n(\"Birds of a feather flock together.\").             Given these facts, the\n\ninference of danger was much more real and immediate than a generic\n\nfear of what might happen in a high-crime area.\n\n             Then, too, the officer knew that there was a distinct\n\npossibility that a man was hiding inside the apartment.                     That\n\npossibility, in itself, elevated the level of suspicion.                     Cf.\n\nWardlow, 528 U.S. at 124 (holding evasive behavior and flight to be\n\npertinent factors in the reasonable suspicion calculus).              To cinch\n\nmatters, immediately before the sweep the defendant claimed that he\n\nwas in charge and that no one else was on the premises.               Linskey\n\n\n\n     4\n      In conducting a reasonable suspicion inquiry, courts should\nrecognize that veteran law enforcement officers, like Sergeant\nLinskey, are entitled to rely on their experience. See Terry, 392\nU.S. at 27; see also Woodrum, 202 F.3d at 6 (explaining that some\n\"[d]eference is due to the experienced perceptions of the\nofficers\").\n\n                                      -18-\n\fhad good cause to disbelieve the second half of that statement and\n\nreasonably could have suspected that the mysterious possessor of\n\nthe adult voice posed a threat.        See United States v. Cavely, 318\n\nF.3d 987, 996 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding protective sweep justified\n\nwhere homeowner arrested outside his home told officers that he had\n\na \"friend\" inside, but friend did not appear after police announced\n\ntheir presence); United States v. Talley, 275 F.3d 560, 564 (6th\n\nCir. 2001) (holding protective sweep justified when police were\n\naware of two additional persons inside a home and were \"misinformed\n\nabout their presence\" by the owner).\n\n            Taking these facts in the ensemble — the high-crime area,\n\nthe shootings, their connection with the apartment, the officer's\n\nexperience and knowledge anent gang behavior, the evasive action of\n\nthe adult known to be present behind the door, and the seeming\n\nattempt   to   misinform   —   we   find    them   sufficient   to   ground   a\n\nreasonable suspicion that the unknown adult posed a threat to the\n\nofficers on the scene.         That suspicion justified the protective\n\nsweep.\n\n                      B.   The Sentencing Claims.\n\n            The   defendant    launches     a   two-pronged   attack   on   his\n\nsentence.      He argues both that his classification as a career\n\noffender was erroneous and that his sentence, viewed in light of\n\nthe Supreme Court's recent decision in United States v. Booker, 125\n\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fS. Ct. 738 (2005), was infected by reversible error.          We consider\n\neach claim separately.\n\n            1.    Career Offender Status.      In order to qualify as a\n\ncareer offender, a defendant must have \"at least two prior felony\n\nconvictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance\n\noffense.\"    USSG §4B1.1(a).       Even when a defendant has two prior\n\nfelony convictions, however, the sentencing court must count them\n\nas   a   single   prior   felony   if   they   are   \"related.\"   Id.   §§\n\n4A1.2(a)(2), 4B1.2(c)(2). Prior convictions are considered related\n\nif they \"were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\"         Id. § 4A1.2,\n\ncmt. n.3(C).\n\n            At the time of his conviction in this case, the defendant\n\nhad prior felony convictions for assault and battery on a police\n\nofficer and assault with a dangerous weapon (both violent crimes).\n\nThe underlying offenses occurred several months apart (one on\n\nNovember 2, 2000 and the other on May 29, 2001).            The defendant\n\nnonetheless strives to convince us that they are related because\n\nthe same state court judge disposed of both charges on the same day\n\nduring the same hearing.      We are not persuaded.\n\n            We need not tarry.      This question is controlled by our\n\ndecision in United States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nThere, we held that when dealing with\n\n            offenses that are temporally and factually\n            distinct (that is, offenses which occurred on\n            different dates and which did not arise out of\n            the same course of conduct), charges based\n\n                                    -20-\n\f           thereon should not be regarded as having been\n           consolidated   (and,  therefore,   'related')\n           unless the original sentencing court entered\n           an actual order of consolidation or there is\n           some other persuasive indicium of formal\n           consolidation apparent on the face of the\n           record which is sufficient to indicate that\n           the offenses have some relationship to one\n           another beyond the sheer fortuity that\n           sentence was imposed by the same judge at the\n           same time.\n\nId. at 317.\n\n           In the district court's view, the defendant's two prior\n\noffenses were temporally and factually distinct and the record\n\ncontained no evidence of formal consolidation.             Consequently, the\n\ncourt followed Correa and ruled that the offenses were not related.\n\nThe defendant assigns error, insisting that the state court record\n\nindicates that a \"functional consolidation\" had occurred.\n\n           This harangue is flatly inconsistent with our holding in\n\nCorrea.       There,    we    held   that,       for   guideline   purposes,\n\n\"consolidation\" requires more than common disposition. Id. at 317.\n\nThe critical datum, we said, is whether the record of the earlier\n\nsentencing(s)   shows   any    indicia      of   formal   consolidation,   the\n\nexistence of which would establish the necessary nexus between the\n\ncharges.   Id. at 317-18.     Because the defendant does not identify\n\neither a formal order of consolidation or any other persuasive\n\nindicium of formal consolidation (such as a docket entry), his\n\nattempt to treat these two distinct offenses as one necessarily\n\nfails.\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f            2.    Booker Error.     We turn next to the defendant's claim\n\nthat Booker error tainted his sentence.             This claim is cast in two\n\nforms.\n\n            The first iteration need not detain us.             The defendant\n\nasseverates that the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted by Booker, was\n\nviolated when a judge and not a jury determined the \"fact\" that his\n\nprior    convictions   were   not    related.        Assuming   arguendo   that\n\nrelatedness might be a fact that a judge could not determine\n\npursuant to a mandatory guidelines system — a dubious proposition\n\nat best — the defendant's asseveration nonetheless must fail.               Our\n\nholding in United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2005), is pellucid that the Sixth Amendment is not violated simply\n\nbecause a judge finds sentencing facts under the guidelines;\n\nrather, the error is only that the judge did so pursuant to a\n\nmandatory guidelines system.         Id. at 75 (interpreting Booker).\n\n            The    second   iteration    of   the    defendant's   sentencing\n\nargument embodies a conventional Booker claim.             That such an error\n\noccurred cannot be gainsaid; the district court, acting before the\n\nSupreme Court decided Booker, understandably treated the guidelines\n\nas mandatory.      In reviewing this error, the threshold question is\n\nwhether it was preserved below.\n\n            The defendant proffers two reasons why we should deem the\n\nerror preserved:       (i) he argued in the lower court that the\n\nguideline provision permitting a downward adjustment for acceptance\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fof responsibility, USSG §3E1.1, constituted an unconstitutional\n\nburden on his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial; and (ii) the\n\ndistrict court mused, sua sponte, that there were no Apprendi\n\nissues involved in the sentencing. See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\n\nU.S. 466 (2000).       We explore these proffers.\n\n            In light of the unexpected nature of Booker's holding\n\nthat the sentencing guidelines must be treated as advisory, we have\n\nbeen fairly liberal in determining what sorts of arguments sufficed\n\nto preserve claims of Booker error in pre-Booker cases. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76.          We have stated that we typically\n\nwill regard Booker error as preserved if the defendant below argued\n\nthat   a   guideline     application    transgressed    either   Apprendi   or\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), \"or that the\n\nGuidelines were unconstitutional.\" Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 76.\n\nThe defendant seizes on the quoted language and asserts that his\n\nargument    that   the   acceptance     of    responsibility   guideline    was\n\nunconstitutional suffices to preserve his present (much different)\n\nclaim of Booker error.       We do not agree.\n\n            Although the language in Antonakopoulos is broad, it\n\ncannot be dislodged from its contextual moorings.                  The cases\n\nleading up to Booker dealt with the notion that the Sixth Amendment\n\nrequired jurors to determine facts that were necessary to the\n\nimposition of a certain sentence.            See Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 748-50\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f(discussing Apprendi and Blakely).            The sentencing guidelines\n\nsuffered from this flaw, but the Booker Court opted to cure it by\n\ninvalidating those provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act that\n\nmade the guidelines mandatory.      See id. at 764-65.\n\n          The Antonakopoulos formulation for the preservation of\n\nclaims of Booker error must be read against this background.         See\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75-76.           It follows that the sort of\n\nconstitutional challenges sufficient to preserve claims of Booker\n\nerror in pre-Booker cases must fall at least arguably within the\n\nencincture of the constitutional concerns raised in Apprendi,\n\nBlakely, and Booker.      The defendant's challenge below, which\n\nposited   that   the   acceptance       of     responsibility   guideline\n\nimpermissibly \"punished\" him for going to trial and, thus, was an\n\nunconstitutional infringement of his Sixth Amendment rights, bears\n\nno relation to the concerns raised by Apprendi, Blakely, and\n\nBooker. It follows inexorably that this challenge did not preserve\n\nthe defendant's nascent Booker claim.\n\n          The defendant's alternate proffer fares no better.          He\n\ncites United States v. Paradis, 351 F.3d 21 (1st Cir. 2003), for\n\nthe proposition that a party's failure to advance an issue in the\n\ndistrict court may be excused (and, thus, the error may be deemed\n\npreserved) if the district court raises the issue on its own.         See\n\nid. at 28-29.    The Paradis opinion will not bear the weight that\n\nthe defendant loads upon it.\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f            In that case, the government failed to argue explicitly\n\nthat a police officer's warrantless search was justified by the\n\nprotective sweep doctrine.                Id. at 28.     The government had,\n\nhowever, cited a case in its brief that discussed the doctrine.\n\nId. at 28 n.6.        We explained that, ordinarily, a bare citation\n\nwould be insufficient to preserve an issue for appellate review but\n\ndeemed the error preserved nonetheless because the district court\n\nhad pounced on the citation and incorporated the cited case's\n\ndiscussion of the protective sweep doctrine into its ruling.                  Id.\n\nat 28-29 & n.6.       Paradis thus stands for the proposition that an\n\nissue    suggested    by    a    party    but    insufficiently   developed    is\n\nnonetheless preserved for appeal when the trial court, on its own\n\ninitiative, seizes the issue and makes an express ruling on its\n\nmerits.\n\n            Paradis    is       plainly    inapposite    here.     During     the\n\nsentencing hearing, the district judge made a prescient observation\n\nabout the applicability of Apprendi to determinate sentencing\n\nschemes, but noted that his concern had no application to the case\n\nat hand.   That rumination formed no part of the court's rulings or\n\nholdings, and it would blink reality were we to allow the defendant\n\nto piggyback upon the court's off-hand comment, promoted by neither\n\nparty, and use it as a means of \"preserving\" his claim of Booker\n\nerror.     We conclude, therefore, that the defendant's claim of\n\nBooker error was not preserved.\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\f            Forfeited Booker errors engender plain-error review. See\n\nUnited States v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d 511, 533 (1st Cir. 2005);\n\nUnited States v. González-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 302 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).     Consequently, the defendant must show \"(1) that an error\n\noccurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"       United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   Here, the defendant has successfully negotiated the first\n\ntwo steps of this pavane.             See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 77\n\n(holding that the court commits a clear and obvious error whenever\n\nit   sentences      a   defendant    pursuant      to    a    mandatory     guidelines\n\nregime).    He stumbles, however, at the third step.\n\n            In     order   to    prove   that     a   Booker        error   affected   a\n\ndefendant's        substantial      rights,     the     defendant       must   show    a\n\nreasonable probability that he would have received a more lenient\n\nsentence under an advisory guidelines regime.                       González-Mercado,\n\n402 F.3d at 303; Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 78-79.                     To clear this\n\nhurdle, the defendant in this case relies upon the fact that the\n\nsentencing court, pursuant to the mandatory guidelines, was either\n\nforbidden     or     discouraged      from      taking       into    account   several\n\ncharacteristics (e.g., his age and family circumstances).\n\n            We find the defendant's reliance misplaced.                     Nearly all\n\nthe factors to which he alludes were limned in the PSI Report, yet\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\fthe district court chose not to speak to them at sentencing.                     The\n\ninference is that the court was unimpressed.             See United States v.\n\nFiguereo, 404 F.3d 537, 542 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             The only new information proffered at the appellate level\n\n— an affidavit recounting the alleged sexual abuse of two of the\n\ndefendant's siblings by another family member — seems to be in\n\ndirect contradiction of his statement to the probation officer that\n\nthere was no history of abuse in the family.              Even in the roiled\n\nwake of Booker, we are reluctant to allow a party to profit by a\n\ncalculated repudiation of a prior version of events solemnly given\n\nto a probation officer and submitted to the district court.\n\n             By way of explanation, the defendant's able appellate\n\ncounsel makes        a   plausible   argument   that    this   chapter      in   the\n\ndefendant's past was shameful to him and, thus, he did not express\n\nit   given    the    apparent   uselessness     of     such    information       for\n\nsentencing purposes. But even were we to assume arguendo that this\n\nnew information is properly before us, other circumstances would\n\nstymie the defendant's efforts to justify resentencing on this\n\nbasis.    The district court found the defendant eligible for a\n\ndownward departure based on the fact that his criminal history\n\nscore    substantially      overstated   the    seriousness      of   his    prior\n\ncriminality.        Yet the court declined to depart, stating:\n\n             [T]he record . . . is that of a young man who\n             is deeply, deeply engaged both in dealing\n             illicit drugs, in a variety of thefts, which\n             it appears have a significant relationship to\n\n                                      -27-\n\f          gaining, possessing, or the threat of using\n          firearms.    And so I think you're very\n          dangerous. And for that reason, though your\n          prior convictions . . . would allow me to\n          depart downward, the most that I think is just\n          is to go [to the bottom of the guideline\n          sentencing range].\n\nThis passage makes clear that, despite its grave concern about the\n\nfairness of the sentencing guidelines in general — a concern that\n\npops up repeatedly throughout the transcript of the disposition\n\nhearing — the court deemed a 210-month sentence just.   Given this\n\nfrank evaluation of the sentence, we do not believe there is a\n\nreasonable probability that the court would have imposed a lesser\n\nsentence had it been operating under an advisory guideline system.\n\nCf. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 81 (stating that \"if the district\n\njudge has said at sentencing that he would have reached the same\n\nresult regardless of the mandatory nature of the Guidelines, that\n\nis a powerful argument against remand\").   Accordingly, we reject\n\nthe defendant's importuning that the Booker error in this case\n\nrequires resentencing.\n\n        C.   The Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim.\n\n          Last — and, as it turns out, least — the defendant posits\n\nthat he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, implying\n\nthat his trial attorney erred in not arguing manufactured exigency\n\nat the suppression hearing and flatly stating that his lawyer\n\n\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fblundered in failing to explore the possibility of a conditional\n\nguilty plea under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2).5\n\n             Establishing ineffective assistance of counsel \"requires\n\na showing that the [defense] attorney turned in a constitutionally\n\ndeficient performance that prejudiced the defendant's substantial\n\nrights.\"     United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)).                     In\n\nall   but    extraordinary         circumstances,        however,   a    claim   of\n\nineffective assistance that is raised for the first time in this\n\ncourt will not be entertained.             See United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d\n\n1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"We have held with a regularity\n\nbordering        on     the   monotonous    that    fact-specific       claims    of\n\nineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of\n\ncriminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to,\n\nand acted upon by, the trial court.\") (collecting cases).\n\n             The defendant cannot elude the grasp of this line of\n\nauthority.       It would serve no useful purpose to rehash the precise\n\ndetails     of    his    theory.    Suffice    it   to    say   that    the   theory\n\npresupposes that an accused with little chance of acquittal and a\n\nweak but colorable argument for suppression is invariably better\n\nserved by a conditional guilty plea. That is a fallacious premise.\n\n\n      5\n      If such a plea could have been negotiated, it would have\npreserved the defendant's right to appeal the denial of his\nsuppression motion while positioning him to secure a credit for\nacceptance of responsibility (which presumably would have resulted\nin a lower sentence).\n\n                                       -29-\n\fEvery case is different, and every lawyer knows (or ought to know)\n\nthe dangers of broad generalization.                 Without a fact-specific\n\ninquiry into defense counsel's thinking (strategic and tactical)\n\nand a knowledge of what exchanges occurred between counsel and\n\nclient, any decision we might make on the performance prong of the\n\nineffective assistance test would be inherently speculative.                     We\n\ntherefore    decline    to    pass    upon    the    defendant's     ineffective\n\nassistance    of   counsel    claim    without      the   benefit    of   a   fully\n\ndeveloped record.      Hence, that claim is premature, and we deny it\n\nwithout prejudice to its subsequent reincarnation, should the\n\ndefendant    so    elect,    in   a   post-conviction      proceeding     brought\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further. To recapitulate, we conclude that\n\nthe police lawfully entered the defendant's abode pursuant to the\n\nemergency aid branch of the exigent circumstances doctrine; that\n\nthey   lawfully     undertook     a   protective     sweep   of     the   premises\n\nfollowing their entry; and that, therefore, the district court did\n\nnot err in refusing to suppress the evidence seized from within the\n\napartment.    We also conclude that the district court appropriately\n\nclassified the defendant as a career offender and committed no\n\nreversible error in the course of sentencing him.                    Finally, we\n\nconclude that the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel\n\n\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fclaim is premature and must be dismissed, without prejudice, on\n\nthat ground.\n\n          The defendant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -31-\n\f",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the principal focus of this appeal, we glean the facts, as supportably found by the district court, from the record of the suppression hearing. We supplement those facts, as necessary, with other facts contained in the record. Once the stage is set, we map the travel of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Facts.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of February 10, 2002, Sergeant Detective Daniel Linskey responded to a radio call from an anti-gang unit about a shooting at the corner of Wendover and Dudley Streets in Boston's Roxbury section. Upon his arrival, he discovered a victim nursing a gunshot wound. The wounded man could not provide any useful information about the shooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bystander informed Linskey that there was a second victim up the street. Linskey proceeded north on Wendover Street for about 100 yards. Another bystander directed him to an apartment building. Linskey entered the structure's first-floor common area and saw a man he knew as \"Fats\" sitting in a kitchen chair outside Apartment No. 1. The area was otherwise devoid of furniture. Linskey asked Fats, who was bleeding from a gunshot wound to the leg, where he had gotten the chair. Fats replied that he had received it from \"his boy\" inside Apartment No. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that juncture, Linskey approached the exterior door of the apartment. He immediately noticed a strong odor of marijuana wafting from within. He knocked on the door and an adult male voice asked him to identify himself. Linskey replied that he was a police officer and asked to speak with the occupant. He next heard voices and the sound of movement coming from within the apartment. This was followed by utter silence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After ninety seconds or so, Linskey knocked again and asked to speak with the occupant. A young boy (perhaps eleven or twelve years old) opened the door and stepped back into the foyer of the apartment. The interior was poorly lit, but Linskey noticed marijuana smoke drifting through the air. He asked the youth whether his parents were home or whether anyone else was in the unit. The boy responded in the negative. His voice was markedly different from the voice that had originally spoken to Linskey from behind the closed door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Linskey then stepped into the apartment and spied an even younger girl watching television in a bedroom. When he was three or four feet inside the threshold, he heard yelling from outside. This proved to be the defendant, who entered the apartment by way of the common hallway. The defendant asked what Linskey was doing there and Linskey replied that he was investigating a shooting. Adverting to the marijuana smoke, Linskey asked whether anyone was in the apartment with the children. The defendant said that he was in charge and that nobody else was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By that time, several other officers had arrived at the scene and gathered in the common hallway. Linskey ordered them to undertake a protective sweep of the premises to ascertain whether the adult who originally had answered Linskey's knock was still there. During the suppression hearing, Linskey testified that he ordered the sweep for a variety of reasons, including the location of one of the shooting victims immediately outside the apartment, the marijuana smoke within, and the presence of young, apparently unsupervised children. The principal impetus for his decision, however, was that he had heard an older man speak from within the apartment, yet both the youngster who answered the door and the defendant insisted that no one else was there. Linskey indicated that he was not sure who this other man was, what involvement he may have had with the shootings, or even whether the defendant was aware that someone might have entered the apartment. Given these manifold uncertainties, Linskey was concerned for the safety of everyone involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sweep quickly bore fruit. In a bedroom, Linskey discovered Jos&#233; DeVeiga sitting on a bed, wrapped in a cloud of marijuana smoke. DeVeiga seemed to be under the influence of drugs. Linskey patted DeVeiga down, found no weapons, and asked where the marijuana was stashed. When DeVeiga denied having any marijuana, an incredulous Linskey remarked the thick marijuana smoke filling the room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, the defendant volunteered that he had been smoking marijuana and called Linskey's attention to two marijuana roaches in an ashtray on the floor. Linskey told the defendant that the cold roaches could not have been the source of the billowing smoke. He then announced that he would obtain a search warrant in an effort to locate the marijuana and instructed other officers to \"freeze\" the apartment. He thereupon arrested both DeVeiga and the defendant for possession of marijuana and placed the two children in a relative's care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police rapidly obtained and executed a search warrant for the premises. The ensuing search retrieved, inter alia, handgun and rifle ammunition, as well as a Pyrex dish containing crack cocaine residue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Travel of the Case.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 2003, a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts indicted the defendant on charges of (i) being a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) and (ii) possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). The defendant moved to suppress the evidence found in the apartment on Fourth Amendment grounds. He contended that the warrantless entry was neither consensual nor justified by exigent circumstances and that the protective sweep was unlawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government opposed the motion and, on October 27, 2003, the district court convened a suppression hearing. Only Linskey testified. The court deemed his account credible in all relevant respects. It then made a series of findings. We summarize them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; The child's actions at the threshold did not indicate either explicit or implicit consent to enter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Exigent circumstances authorized Linskey to enter; he had reasonable cause to fear for the safety of the boy, given the ongoing drug crime and the possibility that he was unattended or that one or more adults who were participating in that crime were present in the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; The totality of the circumstances afforded Linskey a basis for reasonable suspicion that someone in the apartment posed a danger to him or to others and, thus, justified a protective sweep. The apartment was in a high-crime area; there had been a recent shooting nearby and it was reasonable to infer that the shooting was gang-related; and Fats might well have been allied with a gang, so that his retreat to Apartment No. 1 might have represented a retreat to a place where his confederates resided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of these findings, the court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case culminated in a four-day trial. The jury convicted on both counts. The district court held the disposition hearing on March 25, 2004. At that session, the court, relying on the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), found that the defendant was a career offender. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 4B1.1. The defendant unsuccessfully objected to this designation. The court calculated the guideline sentencing range to be 210-262 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution sought a sentence at the midpoint of that range, whereas the defendant sought a downward departure on the ground that his criminal history category substantially overrepresented the seriousness of his prior criminality. The court agreed with the overrepresentation claim, but weighed the overrepresentation against a number of aggravating factors present in the crimes of conviction and refused to depart downward. When all was said and done, the court imposed a 210-month incarcerative term. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's asseverational array includes Fourth Amendment challenges to both the initial entry into his apartment and the subsequent protective sweep; objections to his sentence; and a complaint anent ineffective assistance of counsel. We address these three categories of claims sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Fourth Amendment Claims.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both aspects of the defendant's Fourth Amendment challenge involve mixed questions of fact and law. Consequently, we assay the district court's factual findings for clear error and then review de novo its ultimate conclusion that the discerned facts constitute a sufficient legal basis to justify the conduct about which the defendant complains. <i>See United States v. Schaefer,</i> 87 F.3d 562, 565 &amp; n. 2 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Tibolt,</i> 72 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Warrantless Entry.</i> It is a bedrock principle that the prophylaxis of the Fourth Amendment is at its zenith with respect to an individual's home. <i>See Kyllo v. United States,</i> 533 U.S. 27, 31, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001). Thus, a \"warrantless police entry into a residence is presumptively unreasonable unless it falls within the compass of one of a few well-delineated exceptions.\" <i>United States v. Romain,</i> 393 F.3d 63, 68 (1st Cir.2004). Some of these exceptions are bundled together under the heading of \"exigent circumstances\"&#8212;a heading that encompasses those situations in which some compelling reason for immediate action excuses law enforcement officers from pausing to obtain a warrant. <i>See Tibolt,</i> 72 F.3d at 969. Common examples of exigent circumstances include \"(1) `hot pursuit' of a fleeing felon; (2) threatened destruction of evidence inside a residence before a warrant can be obtained; (3) a risk that the suspect may escape from the residence undetected; or (4) a threat, posed by a suspect, to the lives or safety of the public, the police officers, or to herself.\" <i>Hegarty</i> <i>v. Somerset County,</i> 53 F.3d 1367, 1374 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Hegarty</i> list is not an exclusive compendium, and the government's principal argument here invokes another species of exigent circumstances: the emergency aid doctrine. <i>See Mincey v. Arizona,</i> 437 U.S. 385, 392, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978) (noting, in dictum, that \"the Fourth Amendment does not bar police officers from making warrantless entries and searches when they reasonably believe that a person within [a private residence] is in need of immediate aid\"). The <i>Mincey</i> dictum has prompted several courts to designate a general \"emergency aid\" category as a genre of exigent circumstances sufficient to justify a warrantless entry into a home. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Holloway,</i> 290 F.3d 1331, 1337 (11th Cir. 2002); <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 208 F.3d 626, 630 (7th Cir.2000); <i>Wayne v. United States,</i> 318 F.2d 205, 212 (D.C.Cir. 1963) (Burger, J.). We joined this parade in <i>United States v. Beaudoin,</i> 362 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 484, 160 L.Ed.2d 357 (2004).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this doctrine the police, in an emergency situation, may enter a residence without a warrant if they reasonably believe that swift action is required to safeguard life or prevent serious harm. <i>See id.</i> To rely upon the doctrine, the government must show a reasonable basis, approximating probable cause, both for the officers' belief that an emergency exists and for linking the perceived emergency with the area or place into which they propose to intrude. <i>Id.</i> The requisite inquiry must be undertaken in light of the totality of the circumstances confronting the officers, including, in many cases, a need for an on-the-spot judgment based on incomplete information and sometimes ambiguous facts bearing upon the potential for serious consequences. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In applying this yardstick in the case at hand, we survey the objective facts known to Linskey in the time frame leading up to his entry. <i>See Tibolt,</i> 72 F.3d at 969. Upon knocking on the door, Linskey heard an adult male voice, followed by conversation, movement, and then silence. Upon a second knock, the door opened to reveal a young boy in an apartment filled with thick marijuana smoke. The child indicated that he was home alone&#8212;a dubious proposition in light of Linskey's knowledge that an adult male had been inside the dwelling moments earlier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> It seemed implausible that the boy was unaware of the man's presence; indeed, the two most likely inferences were that the boy was dissembling or that the man had fled. Thus, the officer could have been reasonably certain either that a man seeking to conceal himself from the police was using the boy as a pawn in a dicey game of hide-and-seek or that the man had bolted and left the boy unsupervised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Either way, the child was present in the midst of an ongoing crime (marijuana use) and was exposed to toxic smoke, placing his welfare at risk. The officer would have been remiss had he eschewed any attempt to ameliorate the boy's plight. Because this parlous state of affairs gave Linskey ample cause to believe that the boy needed emergency assistance, it justified his entry. <i>See</i> 3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 6.6(a) (4th ed.2004) (stating that warrantless \"entry for the purpose of rendering aid is reasonable ... [in order] to assist unattended small children\") (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding is within the mainstream of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Other courts have found exigent circumstances in similar situations. In <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> 321 F.3d 1212 (9th Cir.2003), the police became aware that a nine-year-old boy was potentially home alone after his mother's arrest. <i>Id.</i> at 1213. After receiving no response to repeated knocking, the police announced their presence, entered the home through an unlocked back door, and discovered the child. <i>Id.</i> at 1214. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that the officers were aware that a child was home alone but were not aware of conditions inside the house. <i>Id.</i> at 1215. Based primarily on those facts, the court reasoned that the \"possibility of a nine-year-old child in a house in the middle of the night without the supervision of any responsible adult is a situation requiring immediate police assistance.\" <i>Id.</i> Consequently, the court found the officers' warrantless entry justified under the emergency aid doctrine. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So too <i>United States v. Hughes,</i> 993 F.2d 1313 (7th Cir.1993), in which the police learned that an adolescent&#8212;a thirteen-year-old girl&#8212;was inside a house occupied by persons smoking crack cocaine. <i>Id.</i> at 1314. A police officer entered without a warrant, explaining that he had done so because he \"did not know if [the girl] was being held against her will, or if she was there using drugs.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1315. Predicated on the officer's reasonable belief that the child might be in danger, the Seventh Circuit found that exigent circumstances justified the entry. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant seeks to debunk the reasonableness of Linskey's belief that the boy was in need of emergency assistance. He points to several cases in which risk to children was found not to amount to exigent circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Roska ex rel. Roska v. Peterson,</i> 328 F.3d 1230, 1240-41 (10th Cir.2003); <i>Calabretta v. Floyd,</i> 189 F.3d 808, 813 (9th Cir.1999); <i>Good v. Dauphin County Social Servs. for Children &amp; Youth,</i> 891 F.2d 1087, 1095 (3d Cir.1989). But without exception, these cases involve much less ominous fact patterns. Far from helping the defendant, they put the situation here into clearer focus. Unlike, say, the officer in <i>Calabretta,</i> 189 F.3d at 813, Linskey did not enter the home based on some unsubstantiated report of possible danger; rather, he personally witnessed a child at the center of illicit drug activity and had reasonable cause to believe that the child either had been abandoned or else forced to help conceal an adult's presence. The moment cried out for an immediate entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant makes a last-ditch effort to blunt the force of this conclusion: he suggests that the exigency was manufactured by the police and, thus, cannot justify their warrantless entry. While we agree that law enforcement officers may not manipulate events to create an emergency and bootstrap that invented emergency into a justification for a warrantless entry of a person's home, <i>see United</i> <i>States v. Curzi,</i> 867 F.2d 36, 43 n. 6 (1st Cir.1989), that principle is unavailing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rest this holding on two grounds. In the first place, the defendant's \"manufactured evidence\" argument is made for the first time on appeal. It is, therefore, forfeited. <i>See B &amp; T Masonry Constr. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Mutual Ins. Co.,</i> 382 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that \"legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal\") (internal quotation marks omitted). In the second place, given the district court's supportable credibility determination, the record cannot sustain a claim that Linskey manipulated events to conjure up an emergency. For aught that appears, he was simply doing a difficult job under difficult circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. We hold that notwithstanding the absence of a warrant, the officer's entry into the defendant's apartment was justified by exigent circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Protective Sweep.</i> The defendant's remaining Fourth Amendment plaint focuses on the legality vel non of the protective sweep that the officers conducted after entering the apartment. The baseline rule is that police officers, in conjunction with an arrest on residential premises, may undertake a protective sweep so long as they can point to \"articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts,\" would warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing \"that the area harbor[s] an individual posing a danger.\" <i>Maryland v. Buie,</i> 494 U.S. 325, 327, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). This standard is an extension of the doctrine that permits a police officer to pat down an individual for concealed weapons upon a reasonable suspicion that the individual might be armed, provided that the officer's belief is grounded in \"specific and articulable facts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 331-32, 110 S.Ct. 1093 (quoting <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The reasonable suspicion needed to justify a protective sweep is \"no more and no less than was required in <i>Terry.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reasonable suspicion is an objective standard; its existence \"centers upon the objective significance of the particular facts under all the circumstances.\" <i>United States v. Woodrum,</i> 202 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2000). That standard is considerably less demanding than the level of proof required to support a finding of probable cause. <i>Romain,</i> 393 F.3d at 71.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of a protective sweep is limited: the doctrine allows only a \"cursory inspection of those spaces where a person may be found.\" <i>Buie,</i> 494 U.S. at 335, 110 S.Ct. 1093. The sweep may last \"no longer than is necessary to dispel the reasonable suspicion of danger and in any event no longer than it takes to complete the arrest and depart the premises.\" <i>Id.</i> at 335-36, 110 S.Ct. 1093.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Buie</i> itself speaks of protective sweeps incident to arrest, this court has employed the doctrine to allow protective sweeps in conjunction with the execution of search warrants. <i>See Drohan v. Vaughn,</i> 176 F.3d 17, 22 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Daoust,</i> 916 F.2d 757, 759 (1st Cir.1990). Since police officers lawfully may enter a home either with a warrant or upon probable cause plus exigent circumstances, <i>see Kirk v. Louisiana,</i> 536 U.S. 635, 638, 122 S.Ct. 2458, 153 L.Ed.2d 599 (2002) (per curiam), it would make no sense to hold that the police may conduct a protective sweep when lawfully entering with a warrant but must refrain from doing so when lawfully entering on the basis of exigent circumstances. In either event, the key is the reasonableness of the belief that the officers' safety or the safety of others may be at risk. We hold, therefore, that police who have lawfully entered a residence possess the same right to conduct a protective sweep whether an arrest warrant, a search warrant, or the existence of exigent circumstances prompts their entry. <i>See United States v. Gould,</i> 364 F.3d 578, 584-87 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc) (stating that a protective sweep may be justified so long as police did not enter illegally); <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 248 F.3d 506, 513 (6th Cir.2001) (holding that because officers can constitutionally secure an area while awaiting a search warrant to ensure that evidence will not be destroyed, \"it follows logically that ... the police may conduct a limited protective sweep [of that area] to ensure the safety of those officers\"); <i>cf. United States v. Garcia,</i> 997 F.2d 1273, 1282 (9th Cir.1993) (permitting protective sweep when police were lawfully present in a home by consent); <i>United States v. Patrick,</i> 959 F.2d 991, 996 (D.C.Cir.1992) (declaring, in the context of a consensual entry, that \"[o]nce the police were lawfully on the premises, they were authorized to conduct a protective sweep\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beyond his general objection to the availability of the protective sweep doctrine in the case of entries premised on exigent circumstances, the defendant also asserts that the protective sweep undertaken in this case transgressed the Fourth Amendment because the police did not have reasonable suspicion to believe that someone in the apartment posed a danger. In this regard, he contends that the only real basis for suspecting danger was the apartment's location in a high-crime plagued by gang activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this were so, the defendant's point would be well-taken; mere presence in a high-crime area, without more, is insufficient to meet the reasonable suspicion benchmark. <i>See Illinois v. Wardlow,</i> 528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000); <i>United States v. Quinn,</i> 815 F.2d 153, 162 (1st Cir.1987). Here, however, the defendant reads the record much too myopically. There were other factors in addition to the location of the apartment in a high-crime neighborhood that contributed to the formation of reasonable suspicion. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The shootings, in which two men were wounded, had occurred within 100 yards of the apartment complex. Moreover, the apartment was tied to the shootings because one of the victims, not a resident of the apartment, had retreated there. The police knew from experience that victims in gang-area shootings often were gang members themselves and tended to congregate with other gang members.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Cf.</i> William Turner, Rescuing of the Romish Fox (1545) (\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"). Given these facts, the inference of danger was much more real and immediate than a generic fear of what might happen in a high-crime area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, the officer knew that there was a distinct possibility that a man was hiding inside the apartment. That possibility, in itself, elevated the level of suspicion. <i>Cf. Wardlow,</i> 528 U.S. at 124, 120 S.Ct. 673 (holding evasive behavior and flight to be pertinent factors in the reasonable suspicion calculus). To cinch matters, immediately before the sweep the defendant claimed that he was in charge and that no one else was on the premises. Linskey had good cause to disbelieve the second half of that statement and reasonably could have suspected that the mysterious possessor of the adult voice posed a threat. <i>See United States v. Cavely,</i> 318 F.3d 987, 996 (10th Cir.2003) (holding protective sweep justified where homeowner arrested outside his home told officers that he had a \"friend\" inside, but friend did not appear after police announced their presence); <i>United States v. Talley,</i> 275 F.3d 560, 564 (6th Cir.2001) (holding protective sweep justified when police were aware of two additional persons inside a home and were \"misinformed about their presence\" by the owner).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking these facts in the ensemble&#8212;the high-crime area, the shootings, their connection with the apartment, the officer's experience and knowledge anent gang behavior, the evasive action of the adult known to be present behind the door, and the seeming attempt to misinform&#8212;we find them sufficient to ground a reasonable suspicion that the unknown adult posed a threat to the officers on the scene. That suspicion justified the protective sweep.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Sentencing Claims.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant launches a two-pronged attack on his sentence. He argues both that his classification as a career offender was erroneous and that his sentence, viewed in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was infected by reversible error. We consider each claim separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Career Offender Status.</i> In order to qualify as a career offender, a defendant must have \"at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" USSG &#167; 4B1.1(a). Even when a defendant has two prior felony convictions, however, the sentencing court must count them as a single prior felony if they are \"related.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 4A1.2(a)(2), 4B1.2(c)(2). Prior convictions are considered related if they \"were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. n. 3(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of his conviction in this case, the defendant had prior felony convictions for assault and battery on a police officer and assault with a dangerous weapon (both violent crimes). The underlying offenses occurred several months apart (one on November 2, 2000 and the other on May 29, 2001). The defendant nonetheless strives to convince us that they are related because the same state court judge disposed of both charges on the same day during the same hearing. We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry. This question is controlled by our decision in <i>United States v. Correa,</i> 114 F.3d 314 (1st Cir.1997). There, we held that when dealing with</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">offenses that are temporally and factually distinct (that is, offenses which occurred on different dates and which did not arise out of the same course of conduct), charges based thereon should not be regarded as having been consolidated (and, therefore, `related') unless the original sentencing court entered an actual order of consolidation or there is some other persuasive indicium of formal consolidation apparent on the face of the record which is sufficient to indicate that the offenses have some relationship to one another beyond the sheer fortuity that sentence was imposed by the same judge at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court's view, the defendant's two prior offenses were temporally and factually distinct and the record contained no evidence of formal consolidation. Consequently, the court followed <i>Correa</i> and ruled that the offenses were not related. The defendant assigns error, insisting that the state court record indicates that a \"functional consolidation\" had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This harangue is flatly inconsistent with our holding in <i>Correa.</i> There, we held that, for guideline purposes, \"consolidation\" requires more than common disposition. <i>Id.</i> at 317. The critical datum, we said, is whether the record of the earlier sentencing(s) shows any indicia of <i>formal</i> consolidation, the existence of which would establish the necessary nexus between the charges. <i>Id.</i> at 317-18. Because the defendant does not identify either a formal order of consolidation or any other persuasive indicium of formal consolidation (such as a docket entry), his attempt to treat these two distinct offenses as one necessarily fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Booker Error.</i> We turn next to the defendant's claim that <i>Booker</i> error tainted his sentence. This claim is cast in two forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first iteration need not detain us. The defendant asseverates that the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted by <i>Booker,</i> was violated when a judge and not a jury determined the \"fact\" that his prior convictions were not related. Assuming arguendo that relatedness might be a fact that a judge could not determine pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system&#8212;a dubious proposition at best&#8212;the defendant's asseveration nonetheless must fail. Our holding in <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir.2005), is pellucid that the Sixth Amendment is not violated simply because a judge finds sentencing facts under the guidelines; rather, the error is only that the judge did so pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <i>Id.</i> at 75 (interpreting <i>Booker</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second iteration of the defendant's sentencing argument embodies a conventional <i>Booker</i> claim. That such an error occurred cannot be gainsaid; the district court, acting before the Supreme Court decided <i>Booker,</i> understandably treated the guidelines as mandatory. In reviewing this error, the threshold question is whether it was preserved below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant proffers two reasons why we should deem the error preserved: (i) he argued in the lower court that the guideline provision permitting a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, constituted an unconstitutional burden on his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial; and (ii) the district court mused, sua sponte, that there were no <i>Apprendi</i> issues involved in the sentencing. <i>See Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We explore these proffers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the unexpected nature of <i>Booker's</i> holding that the sentencing guidelines must be treated as advisory, we have been fairly liberal in determining what sorts of arguments sufficed to preserve claims of <i>Booker</i> error in pre-<i>Booker</i> cases. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76. We have stated that we typically will regard <i>Booker</i> error as preserved if the defendant below argued that a guideline application transgressed either <i>Apprendi</i> or <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), \"or that the Guidelines were unconstitutional.\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76. The defendant seizes on the quoted language and asserts that his argument that the acceptance of responsibility guideline was unconstitutional suffices to preserve his present (much different) claim of <i>Booker</i> error. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the language in <i>Antonakopoulos</i> is broad, it cannot be dislodged from its contextual moorings. The cases leading up to <i>Booker</i> dealt with the notion that the Sixth Amendment required jurors to determine facts that were necessary to the imposition of a certain sentence. <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 748-50 (discussing <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely</i>). The sentencing guidelines suffered from this flaw, but the <i>Booker</i> Court opted to cure it by invalidating those provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act that made the guidelines mandatory. <i>See id.</i> at 764-65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Antonakopoulos</i> formulation for the preservation of claims of <i>Booker</i> error must be read against this background. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75-76. It follows that the sort of constitutional challenges sufficient to preserve claims of <i>Booker</i> error in pre-<i>Booker</i> cases must fall at least arguably within the encincture of the constitutional concerns raised in <i>Apprendi, Blakely,</i> and <i>Booker.</i> The defendant's challenge below, which posited that the acceptance of responsibility guideline impermissibly \"punished\" him for going to trial and, thus, was an unconstitutional infringement of his Sixth Amendment rights, bears no relation to the concerns raised by <i>Apprendi, Blakely,</i> and <i>Booker.</i> It follows inexorably that this challenge did not preserve the defendant's nascent <i>Booker</i> claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's alternate proffer fares no better. He cites <i>United States v. Paradis,</i> 351 F.3d 21 (1st Cir.2003), for the proposition that a party's failure to advance an issue in the district court may be excused (and, thus, the error may be deemed preserved) if the district court raises the issue on its own. <i>See id.</i> at 28-29. The <i>Paradis</i> opinion will not bear the weight that the defendant loads upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that case, the government failed to argue explicitly that a police officer's warrantless search was justified by the protective sweep doctrine. <i>Id.</i> at 28. The government had, however, cited a case in its brief that discussed the doctrine. <i>Id.</i> at 28 n. 6. We explained that, ordinarily, a bare citation would be insufficient to preserve an issue for appellate review but deemed the error preserved nonetheless because the district court had pounced on the citation and incorporated the cited case's discussion of the protective sweep doctrine into its ruling. <i>Id.</i> at 28-29 &amp; n. 6. <i>Paradis</i> thus stands for the proposition that an issue suggested by a party but insufficiently developed is nonetheless preserved for appeal when the trial court, on its own initiative, seizes the issue and makes an express ruling on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Paradis</i> is plainly inapposite here. During the sentencing hearing, the district judge made a prescient observation about the applicability of <i>Apprendi</i> to determinate sentencing schemes, but noted that his concern had no application to the case at hand. That rumination formed no part of the court's rulings or holdings, and it would blink reality were we to allow the defendant to piggyback upon the court's off-hand comment, promoted by neither party, and use it as a means of \"preserving\" his claim of <i>Booker</i> error. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant's claim of <i>Booker</i> error was not preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forfeited <i>Booker</i> errors engender plain-error review. <i>See United States v. Vega Molina,</i> 407 F.3d 511, 533 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Gonz&#225;lez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d 294, 302 (1st Cir.2005). Consequently, the defendant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Here, the defendant has successfully negotiated the first two steps of this pavane. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77 (holding that the court commits a clear and obvious error whenever it sentences a defendant pursuant to a mandatory guidelines regime). He stumbles, however, at the third step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove that a <i>Booker</i> error affected a defendant's substantial rights, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that he would have received a more lenient sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <i>Gonz&#225;lez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d at 303; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 78-79. To clear this hurdle, the defendant in this case relies upon the fact that the sentencing court, pursuant to the mandatory guidelines, was either forbidden or discouraged from taking into account several characteristics (e.g., his age and family circumstances).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the defendant's reliance misplaced. Nearly all the factors to which he alludes were limned in the PSI Report, yet the district court chose not to speak to them at sentencing. The inference is that the court was unimpressed. <i>See United States v. Figuereo,</i> 404 F.3d 537, 542 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only new information proffered at the appellate level&#8212;an affidavit recounting the alleged sexual abuse of two of the defendant's siblings by another family member&#8212;seems to be in direct contradiction of his statement to the probation officer that there was no history of abuse in the family. Even in the roiled wake of <i>Booker,</i> we are reluctant to allow a party to profit by a calculated repudiation of a prior version of events solemnly given to a probation officer and submitted to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By way of explanation, the defendant's able appellate counsel makes a plausible argument that this chapter in the defendant's past was shameful to him and, thus, he did not express it given the apparent uselessness of such information for sentencing purposes. But even were we to assume arguendo that this new information is properly before us, other circumstances would stymie the defendant's efforts to justify resentencing on this basis. The district court found the defendant eligible for a downward departure based on the fact that his criminal history score substantially overstated the seriousness of his prior criminality. Yet the court declined to depart, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he record ... is that of a young man who is deeply, deeply engaged both in dealing illicit drugs, in a variety of thefts, which it appears have a significant relationship to gaining, possessing, or the threat of using firearms. And so I think you're very dangerous. And for that reason, though your prior convictions... would allow me to depart downward, the most that I think is just is to go [to the bottom of the guideline sentencing range].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This passage makes clear that, despite its grave concern about the fairness of the sentencing guidelines in general&#8212;a concern that pops up repeatedly throughout the transcript of the disposition hearing&#8212; the court deemed a 210-month sentence just. Given this frank evaluation of the sentence, we do not believe there is a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a lesser sentence had it been operating under an advisory guideline system. <i>Cf. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 81 (stating that \"if the district judge has said at sentencing that he would have reached the same result regardless of the mandatory nature of the Guidelines, that is a powerful argument against remand\"). Accordingly, we reject the defendant's importuning that the <i>Booker</i> error in this case requires resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last&#8212;and, as it turns out, least&#8212; the defendant posits that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, implying that his trial attorney erred in not arguing manufactured exigency at the suppression hearing and flatly stating that his lawyer blundered in failing to explore the possibility of a conditional guilty plea under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Establishing ineffective assistance of counsel \"requires a showing that the [defense] attorney turned in a constitutionally deficient performance that prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights.\" <i>United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2004) (citing <i>Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). In all but extraordinary circumstances, however, a claim of ineffective assistance that is raised for the first time in this court will not be entertained. <i>See United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (\"We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\") (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant cannot elude the grasp of this line of authority. It would serve no useful purpose to rehash the precise details of his theory. Suffice it to say that the theory presupposes that an accused with little chance of acquittal and a weak but colorable argument for suppression is invariably better served by a conditional guilty plea. That is a fallacious premise. Every case is different, and every lawyer knows (or ought to know) the dangers of broad generalization. Without a fact-specific inquiry into defense counsel's thinking (strategic and tactical) and a knowledge of what exchanges occurred between counsel and client, any decision we might make on the performance prong of the ineffective assistance test would be inherently speculative. We therefore decline to pass upon the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim without the benefit of a fully developed record. Hence, that claim is premature, and we deny it without prejudice to its subsequent reincarnation, should the defendant so elect, in a post-conviction proceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To recapitulate, we conclude that the police lawfully entered the defendant's abode pursuant to the emergency aid branch of the exigent circumstances doctrine; that they lawfully undertook a protective sweep of the premises following their entry; and that, therefore, the district court did not err in refusing to suppress the evidence seized from within the apartment. We also conclude that the district court appropriately classified the defendant as a career offender and committed no reversible error in the course of sentencing him. Finally, we conclude that the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim is premature and must be dismissed, without prejudice, on that ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The defendant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Our opinion in<i>Beaudoin</i> disposed of the appeals of two defendants.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the principal focus of this appeal, we glean the facts, as supportably found by the district court, from the record of the suppression hearing. We supplement those facts, as necessary, with other facts contained in the record. Once the stage is set, we map the travel of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Facts.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of February 10, 2002, Sergeant Detective Daniel Linskey responded to a radio call from an anti-gang unit about a shooting at the corner of Wendover and Dudley Streets in Boston's Roxbury section. Upon his arrival, he discovered a victim nursing a gunshot wound. The wounded man could not provide any useful information about the shooting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A bystander informed Linskey that there was a second victim up the street. Linskey proceeded north on Wendover Street for about 100 yards. Another bystander directed him to an apartment building. Linskey entered the structure's first-floor common area and saw a man he knew as \"Fats\" sitting in a kitchen chair outside Apartment No. 1. The area was otherwise devoid of furniture. Linskey asked Fats, who was bleeding from a gunshot wound to the leg, where he had gotten the chair. Fats replied that he had received it from \"his boy\" inside Apartment No. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that juncture, Linskey approached the exterior door of the apartment. He immediately noticed a strong odor of marijuana wafting from within. He knocked on the door and an adult male voice asked him to identify himself. Linskey replied that he was a police officer and asked to speak with the occupant. He next heard voices and the sound of movement coming from within the apartment. This was followed by utter silence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After ninety seconds or so, Linskey knocked again and asked to speak with the occupant. A young boy (perhaps eleven or twelve years old) opened the door and stepped back into the foyer of the apartment. The interior was poorly lit, but Linskey noticed marijuana smoke drifting through the air. He asked the youth whether his parents were home or whether anyone else was in the unit. The boy responded in the negative. His voice was markedly different from the voice that had originally spoken to Linskey from behind the closed door.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Linskey then stepped into the apartment and spied an even younger girl watching television in a bedroom. When he was three or four feet inside the threshold, he heard yelling from outside. This proved to be the defendant, who entered the apartment by way of the common hallway. The defendant asked what Linskey was doing there and Linskey replied that he was investigating a shooting. Adverting to the marijuana smoke, Linskey asked whether anyone was in the apartment with the children. The defendant said that he was in charge and that nobody else was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By that time, several other officers had arrived at the scene and gathered in the common hallway. Linskey ordered them to undertake a protective sweep of the premises to ascertain whether the adult who originally had answered Linskey's knock was still there. During the suppression hearing, Linskey testified that he ordered the sweep for a variety of reasons, including the location of one of the shooting victims immediately outside the apartment, the marijuana smoke within, and the presence of young, apparently unsupervised children. The principal impetus for his decision, however, was that he had heard an older man speak from within the apartment, yet both the youngster who answered the door and the defendant insisted that no one else was there. Linskey indicated that he was not sure who this other man was, what involvement he may have had with the shootings, or even whether the defendant was aware that someone might have entered the apartment. Given these manifold uncertainties, Linskey was concerned for the safety of everyone involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sweep quickly bore fruit. In a bedroom, Linskey discovered Jos&#233; DeVeiga sitting on a bed, wrapped in a cloud of marijuana smoke. DeVeiga seemed to be under the influence of drugs. Linskey patted DeVeiga down, found no weapons, and asked where the marijuana was stashed. When DeVeiga denied having any marijuana, an incredulous Linskey remarked the thick marijuana smoke filling the room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, the defendant volunteered that he had been smoking marijuana and called Linskey's attention to two marijuana roaches in an ashtray on the floor. Linskey told the defendant that the cold roaches could not have been the source of the billowing smoke. He then announced that he would obtain a search warrant in an effort to locate the marijuana and instructed other officers to \"freeze\" the apartment. He thereupon arrested both DeVeiga and the defendant for possession of marijuana and placed the two children in a relative's care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police rapidly obtained and executed a search warrant for the premises. The ensuing search retrieved, inter alia, handgun and rifle ammunition, as well as a Pyrex dish containing crack cocaine residue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Travel of the Case.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 2003, a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts indicted the defendant on charges of (i) being a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) and (ii) possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). The defendant moved to suppress the evidence found in the apartment on Fourth Amendment grounds. He contended that the warrantless entry was neither consensual nor justified by exigent circumstances and that the protective sweep was unlawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government opposed the motion and, on October 27, 2003, the district court convened a suppression hearing. Only Linskey testified. The court deemed his account credible in all relevant respects. It then made a series of findings. We summarize them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; The child's actions at the threshold did not indicate either explicit or implicit consent to enter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Exigent circumstances authorized Linskey to enter; he had reasonable cause to fear for the safety of the boy, given the ongoing drug crime and the possibility that he was unattended or that one or more adults who were participating in that crime were present in the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; The totality of the circumstances afforded Linskey a basis for reasonable suspicion that someone in the apartment posed a danger to him or to others and, thus, justified a protective sweep. The apartment was in a high-crime area; there had been a recent shooting nearby and it was reasonable to infer that the shooting was gang-related; and Fats might well have been allied with a gang, so that his retreat to Apartment No. 1 might have represented a retreat to a place where his confederates resided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of these findings, the court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case culminated in a four-day trial. The jury convicted on both counts. The district court held the disposition hearing on March 25, 2004. At that session, the court, relying on the presentence investigation report (PSI Report), found that the defendant was a career offender. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 4B1.1. The defendant unsuccessfully objected to this designation. The court calculated the guideline sentencing range to be 210-262 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution sought a sentence at the midpoint of that range, whereas the defendant sought a downward departure on the ground that his criminal history category substantially overrepresented the seriousness of his prior criminality. The court agreed with the overrepresentation claim, but weighed the overrepresentation against a number of aggravating factors present in the crimes of conviction and refused to depart downward. When all was said and done, the court imposed a 210-month incarcerative term. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's asseverational array includes Fourth Amendment challenges to both the initial entry into his apartment and the subsequent protective sweep; objections to his sentence; and a complaint anent ineffective assistance of counsel. We address these three categories of claims sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Fourth Amendment Claims.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both aspects of the defendant's Fourth Amendment challenge involve mixed questions of fact and law. Consequently, we assay the district court's factual findings for clear error and then review de novo its ultimate conclusion that the discerned facts constitute a sufficient legal basis to justify the conduct about which the defendant complains. <i>See United States v.

Upon knocking on the door, Linskey heard an adult male voice, followed by conversation, movement, and then silence. Upon a second knock, the door opened to reveal a young boy in an apartment filled with thick marijuana smoke. The child indicated that he was home alone&#8212;a dubious proposition in light of Linskey's knowledge that an adult male had been inside the dwelling moments earlier.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> It seemed implausible that the boy was unaware of the man's presence; indeed, the two most likely inferences were that the boy was dissembling or that the man had fled. Thus, the officer could have been reasonably certain either that a man seeking to conceal himself from the police was using the boy as a pawn in a dicey game of hide-and-seek or that the man had bolted and left the boy unsupervised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Either way, the child was present in the midst of an ongoing crime (marijuana use) and was exposed to toxic smoke, placing his welfare at risk. The officer would have been remiss had he eschewed any attempt to ameliorate the boy's plight. Because this parlous state of affairs gave Linskey ample cause to believe that the boy needed emergency assistance, it justified his entry. <i>See</i> 3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 6.6(a) (4th ed.2004) (stating that warrantless \"entry for the purpose of rendering aid is reasonable ... [in order] to assist unattended small children\") (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding is within the mainstream of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Other courts have found exigent circumstances in similar situations. In <i>United States v. Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781136\"><a href=\"/opinion/781136/united-states-v-david-william-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1212</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2003), the police became aware that a nine-year-old boy was potentially home alone after his mother's arrest. <i>Id.</i> at 1213. After receiving no response to repeated knocking, the police announced their presence, entered the home through an unlocked back door, and discovered the child. <i>Id.</i> at 1214. The Ninth Circuit emphasized that the officers were aware that a child was home alone but were not aware of conditions inside the house. <i>Id.</i> at 1215. Based primarily on those facts, the court reasoned that the \"possibility of a nine-year-old child in a house in the middle of the night without the supervision of any responsible adult is a situation requiring immediate police assistance.\" <i>Id.</i> Consequently, the court found the officers' warrantless entry justified under the emergency aid doctrine. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So too <i>United States v.

A police officer entered without a warrant, explaining that he had done so because he \"did not know if [the girl] was being held against her will, or if she was there using drugs.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1315.

He points to several cases in which risk to children was found not to amount to exigent circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Roska ex rel. Roska v. Peterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781963\"><a href=\"/opinion/781963/connie-roska-on-behalf-of-minor-children-rusty-and-jessica-roska-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></a></span>, 1240-41 (10th Cir.2003); <i>Calabretta v.

But without exception, these cases involve much less ominous fact patterns. Far from helping the defendant, they put the situation here into clearer focus. Unlike, say, the officer in <i>Calabretta,</i> 189 F.3d at 813, Linskey did not enter the home based on some unsubstantiated report of possible danger; rather, he personally witnessed a child at the center of illicit drug activity and had reasonable cause to believe that the child either had been abandoned or else forced to help conceal an adult's presence. The moment cried out for an immediate entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant makes a last-ditch effort to blunt the force of this conclusion: he suggests that the exigency was manufactured by the police and, thus, cannot justify their warrantless entry. While we agree that law enforcement officers may not manipulate events to create an emergency and bootstrap that invented emergency into a justification for a warrantless entry of a person's home, <i>see United</i> <i>States v. Curzi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518088\"><a href=\"/opinion/518088/united-states-v-barbara-j-curzi/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 43 n. 6 (1st Cir.1989), that principle is unavailing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rest this holding on two grounds. In the first place, the defendant's \"manufactured evidence\" argument is made for the first time on appeal. It is, therefore, forfeited. <i>See B &amp; T Masonry Constr. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Mutual Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201229\"><a href=\"/opinion/201229/bt-masonry-construc-v-public-service-mutua/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining that \"legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal\") (internal quotation marks omitted). In the second place, given the district court's supportable credibility determination, the record cannot sustain a claim that Linskey manipulated events to conjure up an emergency. For aught that appears, he was simply doing a difficult job under difficult circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter.

The baseline rule is that police officers, in conjunction with an arrest on residential premises, may undertake a protective sweep so long as they can point to \"articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts,\" would warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing \"that the area harbor[s] an individual posing a danger.\" <i>Maryland v.

Since police officers lawfully may enter a home either with a warrant or upon probable cause plus exigent circumstances, <i>see Kirk v.

In either event, the key is the reasonableness of the belief that the officers' safety or the safety of others may be at risk. We hold, therefore, that police who have lawfully entered a residence possess the same right to conduct a protective sweep whether an arrest warrant, a search warrant, or the existence of exigent circumstances prompts their entry. <i>See United States v.

Here, however, the defendant reads the record much too myopically.

Moreover, the apartment was tied to the shootings because one of the victims, not a resident of the apartment, had retreated there. The police knew from experience that victims in gang-area shootings often were gang members themselves and tended to congregate with other gang members.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Cf.</i> William Turner, Rescuing of the Romish Fox (1545) (\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"). Given these facts, the inference of danger was much more real and immediate than a generic fear of what might happen in a high-crime area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, too, the officer knew that there was a distinct possibility that a man was hiding inside the apartment. That possibility, in itself, elevated the level of suspicion. <i>Cf. Wardlow,</i> 528 U.S. at 124, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118326\"><a href=\"/opinion/118326/illinois-v-wardlow/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To cinch matters, immediately before the sweep the defendant claimed that he was in charge and that no one else was on the premises. Linskey had good cause to disbelieve the second half of that statement and reasonably could have suspected that the mysterious possessor of the adult voice posed a threat. <i>See United States v. Cavely,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163041\"><a href=\"/opinion/163041/united-states-v-cavely/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 996 (10th Cir.2003) (holding protective sweep justified where homeowner arrested outside his home told officers that he had a \"friend\" inside, but friend did not appear after police announced their presence); <i>United States v.

That suspicion justified the protective sweep.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Sentencing Claims.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant launches a two-pronged attack on his sentence. He argues both that his classification as a career offender was erroneous and that his sentence, viewed in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), was infected by reversible error. We consider each claim separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Career Offender Status.</i> In order to qualify as a career offender, a defendant must have \"at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" USSG &#167; 4B1.1(a). Even when a defendant has two prior felony convictions, however, the sentencing court must count them as a single prior felony if they are \"related.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167;&#167; 4A1.2(a)(2), 4B1.2(c)(2). Prior convictions are considered related if they \"were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4A1.2, cmt. n. 3(C).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of his conviction in this case, the defendant had prior felony convictions for assault and battery on a police officer and assault with a dangerous weapon (both violent crimes). The underlying offenses occurred several months apart (one on November 2, 2000 and the other on May 29, 2001). The defendant nonetheless strives to convince us that they are related because the same state court judge disposed of both charges on the same day during the same hearing. We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry. This question is controlled by our decision in <i>United States v. Correa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197379\"><a href=\"/opinion/197379/united-states-v-rosalio-correa/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997). There, we held that when dealing with</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">offenses that are temporally and factually distinct (that is, offenses which occurred on different dates and which did not arise out of the same course of conduct), charges based thereon should not be regarded as having been consolidated (and, therefore, `related') unless the original sentencing court entered an actual order of consolidation or there is some other persuasive indicium of formal consolidation apparent on the face of the record which is sufficient to indicate that the offenses have some relationship to one another beyond the sheer fortuity that sentence was imposed by the same judge at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court's view, the defendant's two prior offenses were temporally and factually distinct and the record contained no evidence of formal consolidation. Consequently, the court followed <i>Correa</i> and ruled that the offenses were not related. The defendant assigns error, insisting that the state court record indicates that a \"functional consolidation\" had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This harangue is flatly inconsistent with our holding in <i>Correa.</i> There, we held that, for guideline purposes, \"consolidation\" requires more than common disposition. <i>Id.</i> at 317. The critical datum, we said, is whether the record of the earlier sentencing(s) shows any indicia of <i>formal</i> consolidation, the existence of which would establish the necessary nexus between the charges. <i>Id.</i> at 317-18. Because the defendant does not identify either a formal order of consolidation or any other persuasive indicium of formal consolidation (such as a docket entry), his attempt to treat these two distinct offenses as one necessarily fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Booker Error.</i> We turn next to the defendant's claim that <i>Booker</i> error tainted his sentence. This claim is cast in two forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first iteration need not detain us. The defendant asseverates that the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted by <i>Booker,</i> was violated when a judge and not a jury determined the \"fact\" that his prior convictions were not related. Assuming arguendo that relatedness might be a fact that a judge could not determine pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system&#8212;a dubious proposition at best&#8212;the defendant's asseveration nonetheless must fail. Our holding in <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2005), is pellucid that the Sixth Amendment is not violated simply because a judge finds sentencing facts under the guidelines; rather, the error is only that the judge did so pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <i>Id.</i> at 75 (interpreting <i>Booker</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second iteration of the defendant's sentencing argument embodies a conventional <i>Booker</i> claim. That such an error occurred cannot be gainsaid; the district court, acting before the Supreme Court decided <i>Booker,</i> understandably treated the guidelines as mandatory. In reviewing this error, the threshold question is whether it was preserved below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant proffers two reasons why we should deem the error preserved: (i) he argued in the lower court that the guideline provision permitting a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1, constituted an unconstitutional burden on his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial; and (ii) the district court mused, sua sponte, that there were no <i>Apprendi</i> issues involved in the sentencing. <i>See Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000). We explore these proffers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the unexpected nature of <i>Booker's</i> holding that the sentencing guidelines must be treated as advisory, we have been fairly liberal in determining what sorts of arguments sufficed to preserve claims of <i>Booker</i> error in pre-<i>Booker</i> cases. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Heldeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201512\"><a href=\"/opinion/201512/united-states-v-heldeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76. We have stated that we typically will regard <i>Booker</i> error as preserved if the defendant below argued that a guideline application transgressed either <i>Apprendi</i> or <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2531</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004), \"or that the Guidelines were unconstitutional.\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 76. The defendant seizes on the quoted language and asserts that his argument that the acceptance of responsibility guideline was unconstitutional suffices to preserve his present (much different) claim of <i>Booker</i> error. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the language in <i>Antonakopoulos</i> is broad, it cannot be dislodged from its contextual moorings. The cases leading up to <i>Booker</i> dealt with the notion that the Sixth Amendment required jurors to determine facts that were necessary to the imposition of a certain sentence. <i>See Booker,</i> 125 S.Ct. at 748-50 (discussing <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely</i>). The sentencing guidelines suffered from this flaw, but the <i>Booker</i> Court opted to cure it by invalidating those provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act that made the guidelines mandatory. <i>See id.</i> at 764-65.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Antonakopoulos</i> formulation for the preservation of claims of <i>Booker</i> error must be read against this background. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75-76. It follows that the sort of constitutional challenges sufficient to preserve claims of <i>Booker</i> error in pre-<i>Booker</i> cases must fall at least arguably within the encincture of the constitutional concerns raised in <i>Apprendi, Blakely,</i> and <i>Booker.</i> The defendant's challenge below, which posited that the acceptance of responsibility guideline impermissibly \"punished\" him for going to trial and, thus, was an unconstitutional infringement of his Sixth Amendment rights, bears no relation to the concerns raised by <i>Apprendi, Blakely,</i> and <i>Booker.</i> It follows inexorably that this challenge did not preserve the defendant's nascent <i>Booker</i> claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's alternate proffer fares no better. He cites <i>United States v. Paradis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200733\"><a href=\"/opinion/200733/united-states-v-paradis/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003), for the proposition that a party's failure to advance an issue in the district court may be excused (and, thus, the error may be deemed preserved) if the district court raises the issue on its own. <i>See id.</i> at 28-29. The <i>Paradis</i> opinion will not bear the weight that the defendant loads upon it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In that case, the government failed to argue explicitly that a police officer's warrantless search was justified by the protective sweep doctrine. <i>Id.</i> at 28. The government had, however, cited a case in its brief that discussed the doctrine. <i>Id.</i> at 28 n. 6. We explained that, ordinarily, a bare citation would be insufficient to preserve an issue for appellate review but deemed the error preserved nonetheless because the district court had pounced on the citation and incorporated the cited case's discussion of the protective sweep doctrine into its ruling. <i>Id.</i> at 28-29 &amp; n. 6. <i>Paradis</i> thus stands for the proposition that an issue suggested by a party but insufficiently developed is nonetheless preserved for appeal when the trial court, on its own initiative, seizes the issue and makes an express ruling on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Paradis</i> is plainly inapposite here. During the sentencing hearing, the district judge made a prescient observation about the applicability of <i>Apprendi</i> to determinate sentencing schemes, but noted that his concern had no application to the case at hand. That rumination formed no part of the court's rulings or holdings, and it would blink reality were we to allow the defendant to piggyback upon the court's off-hand comment, promoted by neither party, and use it as a means of \"preserving\" his claim of <i>Booker</i> error. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant's claim of <i>Booker</i> error was not preserved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Forfeited <i>Booker</i> errors engender plain-error review. <i>See United States v. Vega Molina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201589\"><a href=\"/opinion/201589/united-states-v-vega-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 533 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Gonz&#225;lez-Mercado,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201515\"><a href=\"/opinion/201515/united-states-v-gonzalez-mercado/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 302 (1st Cir.2005). Consequently, the defendant must show \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Here, the defendant has successfully negotiated the first two steps of this pavane. <i>See Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 77 (holding that the court commits a clear and obvious error whenever it sentences a defendant pursuant to a mandatory guidelines regime). He stumbles, however, at the third step.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove that a <i>Booker</i> error affected a defendant's substantial rights, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that he would have received a more lenient sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <i>Gonz&#225;lez-Mercado,</i> 402 F.3d at 303; <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 78-79. To clear this hurdle, the defendant in this case relies upon the fact that the sentencing court, pursuant to the mandatory guidelines, was either forbidden or discouraged from taking into account several characteristics (e.g., his age and family circumstances).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the defendant's reliance misplaced. Nearly all the factors to which he alludes were limned in the PSI Report, yet the district court chose not to speak to them at sentencing. The inference is that the court was unimpressed. <i>See United States v. Figuereo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201542\"><a href=\"/opinion/201542/united-states-v-figuereo/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 542 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only new information proffered at the appellate level&#8212;an affidavit recounting the alleged sexual abuse of two of the defendant's siblings by another family member&#8212;seems to be in direct contradiction of his statement to the probation officer that there was no history of abuse in the family. Even in the roiled wake of <i>Booker,</i> we are reluctant to allow a party to profit by a calculated repudiation of a prior version of events solemnly given to a probation officer and submitted to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By way of explanation, the defendant's able appellate counsel makes a plausible argument that this chapter in the defendant's past was shameful to him and, thus, he did not express it given the apparent uselessness of such information for sentencing purposes. But even were we to assume arguendo that this new information is properly before us, other circumstances would stymie the defendant's efforts to justify resentencing on this basis. The district court found the defendant eligible for a downward departure based on the fact that his criminal history score substantially overstated the seriousness of his prior criminality. Yet the court declined to depart, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he record ... is that of a young man who is deeply, deeply engaged both in dealing illicit drugs, in a variety of thefts, which it appears have a significant relationship to gaining, possessing, or the threat of using firearms. And so I think you're very dangerous. And for that reason, though your prior convictions... would allow me to depart downward, the most that I think is just is to go [to the bottom of the guideline sentencing range].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This passage makes clear that, despite its grave concern about the fairness of the sentencing guidelines in general&#8212;a concern that pops up repeatedly throughout the transcript of the disposition hearing&#8212; the court deemed a 210-month sentence just. Given this frank evaluation of the sentence, we do not believe there is a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a lesser sentence had it been operating under an advisory guideline system. <i>Cf. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 81 (stating that \"if the district judge has said at sentencing that he would have reached the same result regardless of the mandatory nature of the Guidelines, that is a powerful argument against remand\"). Accordingly, we reject the defendant's importuning that the <i>Booker</i> error in this case requires resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last&#8212;and, as it turns out, least&#8212; the defendant posits that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, implying that his trial attorney erred in not arguing manufactured exigency at the suppression hearing and flatly stating that his lawyer blundered in failing to explore the possibility of a conditional guilty plea under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Establishing ineffective assistance of counsel \"requires a showing that the [defense] attorney turned in a constitutionally deficient performance that prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights.\" <i>United States v.

In all but extraordinary circumstances, however, a claim of ineffective assistance that is raised for the first time in this court will not be entertained. <i>See United States v.

It would serve no useful purpose to rehash the precise details of his theory. Suffice it to say that the theory presupposes that an accused with little chance of acquittal and a weak but colorable argument for suppression is invariably better served by a conditional guilty plea. That is a fallacious premise. Every case is different, and every lawyer knows (or ought to know) the dangers of broad generalization. Without a fact-specific inquiry into defense counsel's thinking (strategic and tactical) and a knowledge of what exchanges occurred between counsel and client, any decision we might make on the performance prong of the ineffective assistance test would be inherently speculative. We therefore decline to pass upon the defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim without the benefit of a fully developed record. Hence, that claim is premature, and we deny it without prejudice to its subsequent reincarnation, should the defendant so elect, in a post-conviction proceeding brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.

We also conclude that the district court appropriately classified the defendant as a career offender and committed no reversible error in the course of sentencing him.
