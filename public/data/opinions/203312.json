Ramón Rosado-Quiñones, an officer\n\nin the Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\" or \"Department\"),\n\nbrought an action against Department officials under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 seeking over $10 million in damages.              He claimed that his\n\nsuperiors violated his First Amendment rights when they assigned\n\nhim to new job duties, allegedly in retaliation for his having\n\nfiled a lawsuit against them in a local court.                  Rosado also\n\nasserted a due process claim that he was denied notice and a\n\nhearing about his changed job responsibilities, as well as pendent\n\nclaims under Puerto Rico law.          The defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment, which the district court allowed as to all federal\n\nclaims;   the   Puerto   Rico   law    claims     were    dismissed   without\n\nprejudice.   Rosado appeals.    We affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           The undisputed record shows the following.           Rosado was a\n\nveteran of the Puerto Rico Police Department, having been assigned\n\nsince 1985 to the specialized, plainclothes Criminal Investigation\n\nCorps (\"CIC\") in Mayagüez.      The Department transferred Rosado in\n\nFebruary 2005 to an assignment as a uniformed beat officer on the\n\nundesirable 4:00-a.m.-to-noon shift, which produced this lawsuit.\n\nThis transfer followed several events.\n\n           In December 2002, criminal charges of disturbing the\n\npeace were filed against Rosado.           Pursuant to PRPD policy, Rosado\n\nwas forced to surrender temporarily his firearm.              A Commonwealth\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fjudge found probable cause for the criminal charges and, in January\n\n2003, scheduled Rosado for trial.             Rosado was found not guilty in\n\nAugust 2003. The PRPD continued to employ Rosado during the period\n\nof the pending charges, his disarmament, and all times relevant to\n\nthis suit.\n\n           Rosado, despite requests that his firearm be returned,\n\nwas not rearmed by the Department until July 2004.               On September\n\n14, 2004, Rosado told the Superintendent of Police he intended to\n\nsue the Department over his prolonged period of disarmament.\n\nFollowing Rosado's notice, the Department initiated an internal\n\ninquiry.     On November 10, 2004, Rosado's superiors at the CIC\n\nsubmitted a report to the PRPD commander of the Mayagüez region.\n\n           On    November      17,    2004,    Rosado   filed   suit    in   the\n\nCommonwealth courts against the Commonwealth, the Department of\n\nJustice,   and   a    number   of    police    officials.   These      officials\n\nincluded the commander, three lieutenants and two sergeants.                 In\n\nhis Superior Court complaint, Rosado alleged a \"pattern of labor\n\nharassment\" by the PRPD against him.            Rosado alleged that after he\n\nhad been charged with disturbing the peace and his firearm had been\n\nconfiscated, the sergeant who took the gun \"claimed that [Rosado]\n\nhad an emotional condition that was affecting the performance of\n\nhis duties.\"         After Rosado was acquitted of the charges, two\n\nseparate sergeants in the Department reiterated their concerns\n\nabout his emotional condition, and one informed him that only the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fpolice psychiatrist could return Rosado's firearm.           According to\n\nRosado's Superior Court complaint, the latter sergeant \"opposed his\n\nbeing rearmed deliberately in order to do damage to [Rosado],\n\nrequiring for no reason at all that [Rosado] be evaluated by the\n\nPuerto Rico Police psychiatrist, which is an action that in and of\n\nitself is illegal.\"     The complaint goes on to acknowledge that\n\nRosado eventually did undergo a psychiatric evaluation on June 28,\n\n2004, and was rearmed in July.\n\n           Rosado's complaint in the Puerto Rico court also alleged\n\nthat in spite of his past job performance and his acquittal of the\n\ncriminal charges, the Department's Office of Public Integrity\n\nadvised that Rosado be suspended without pay for ninety days,\n\nalthough   that   suspension   did    not   actually   occur.1   Rosado's\n\ncomplaint requested damages of $500,000.\n\n           Defendants put into evidence three reports about Rosado's\n\ninappropriate conduct that were written before Rosado filed suit in\n\nlate 2004.   There had been an incident on January 24, 2003, which\n\nwas memorialized in a January 28, 2003 memo from Lieutenant Nelson\n\nFonseca Rossy, Deputy Director of the Mayagüez CIC, to Captain\n\nHéctor Agosto Rodríguez, Director of that unit.         The memo reported\n\nthat Rosado defied the CIC's official start time. When admonished,\n\nRosado questioned the authority of his superior and said he was\n\n\n     1\n          The CIC informed Rosado on December 8, 2004 that he would\nbe suspended without pay for fifteen days. On December 20, Rosado\nobjected to the suspension, and the suspension never took place.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fbeing persecuted.      Fonseca informed Rosado that he must get his\n\n\"persecution complex out of his head\" since he was not being\n\npersecuted.\n\n            Fonseca    reported      another     instance    of      Rosado's\n\ninappropriate conduct that occurred on December 3, 2003.             Fonseca\n\ndescribed both a specific incident in which Rosado addressed\n\nFonseca   \"disrespectfully,       arrogantly,    and   defiantly,\"    and   a\n\ncontinuing pattern of disrespect by Rosado toward his superior.\n\nThe report noted that \"this officer suffers from a persecution\n\ncomplex and his conduct rebuffs supervision.\"\n\n            Sergeant Pedro Matos Fortuna, Head of Administration for\n\nthe Mayagüez CIC, also reported Rosado's actions on December 3,\n\n2003.     Matos complained that Rosado had addressed him \"in a\n\nhostile, disrespectful and derogatory manner, in contempt of the\n\nposition I hold at the agency and especially towards the criminal\n\ninvestigation corps.\"       The report concluded that based on this and\n\ntwo prior incidents in January 2003, Rosado lacked respect for his\n\nsuperiors     and   would   not   tolerate     discipline.    The      report\n\nrecommended sending Rosado to professional improvement courses.\n\n            Internal disciplinary reports regarding Rosado's conduct\n\ncontinued to be made after Rosado filed his first lawsuit and were\n\nconsistent in theme with the prior reports. A report dated January\n\n26, 2005 and entitled \"Act of Insubordination\" was written by\n\nLieutenant Jorge Velázquez Almodóvar, the Head of the Robbery\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fSection of the Mayagüez CIC.      The report recounted a specific\n\nincident in which Rosado objected to signing a receipt reflecting\n\nthe fact that he possessed a bulletproof jacket.        Rosado also\n\nrefused to answer questions from Velázquez regarding a shooting\n\nincident.     Velázquez reported that Rosado disobeyed legal orders\n\nand questioned authority.     The report concluded that Rosado had\n\ndisqualified himself from working in the CIC.     The report further\n\nnoted that Rosado's attitude spread unease among the department and\n\nprevented other officers \"from doing their job to the best of their\n\nabilities.\"     Velázquez requested an administrative investigation\n\ninto Rosado and further requested that Rosado be transferred out of\n\nthe CIC.2\n\n            The CIC Director, on February 1, 2005, agreed with the\n\nrecommendation that Rosado be transferred to another office.\n\n            On February 9, 2005, the Department transferred Rosado\n\nfrom the CIC to the Field Operations unit. Rosado's new assignment\n\nwas that of uniformed police officer, the lowest rank in the\n\nDepartment.    Rosado's salary was not reduced.   Rosado intended to\n\nretire from the PRPD once he became eligible in January 2007.\n\n            On January 27, 2006, Rosado filed a damages suit in\n\nfederal court in Puerto Rico.    Rosado's federal complaint alleged\n\n\n\n     2\n        The January 26 memo also complained that Rosado solved\ncrimes at a lower rate than others and cited an intra-departmental\nminimum case-resolution rate. Rosado disputes that rate. In our\nview, this dispute is immaterial.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthat the PRPD violated his due process rights when it demoted him\n\nwithout a hearing.          The complaint also alleged that the transfer\n\nviolated the First Amendment because it was ordered in retaliation\n\nfor Rosado's previous filing of a complaint in Puerto Rico court.\n\nThe complaint also included a claim under Puerto Rico law.                 Rosado\n\nsought damages of $10 million for his constitutional claims and\n\n$100,000 for his state law claim.\n\n               Defendants moved for summary judgment on December 7,\n\n2006.    Rosado filed an affidavit in opposition, in which he denied\n\nthe   conclusion      in    the   January    26,   2005   report    that   he   was\n\ninsubordinate and said he \"was only exercising my right to free\n\nspeech.\" As proof that he was not insubordinate, Rosado claimed he\n\nwas not actually investigated.                He did not dispute that his\n\nsupervisors had concluded he was insubordinate and documented their\n\nconcerns to the command staff.              Nor did Rosado dispute the facts\n\nstated    in    the   internal     disciplinary     memoranda      detailing    his\n\nactions, although he disputed the contention that he had been\n\ninsubordinate.\n\n               The district court granted the defendants' motion on\n\nFebruary 5, 2007.          Rosado Quiñones v. Toledo Davila, No. 06-1113,\n\n2007 WL 438770 (D.P.R. Feb. 5, 2007).\n\n                                       II.\n\n               We review the district court's ruling de novo, taking the\n\nfacts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fRosado.    Hoyos v. Telecorp Commc'ns, Inc., 488 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2007).\n\n            As to the federal due process claim, the district court\n\ncorrectly held that because Puerto Rico law does not recognize any\n\nproperty interest in the performance of particular job functions in\n\nthe course of an employee's continued employment, there was no\n\nconstitutionally    protected   interest   requiring   a   due    process\n\nhearing.    Rosado Quiñones, 2007 WL 438770, at *5 (citing Rosado de\n\nVelez v. Zayas, 328 F. Supp. 2d 202, 212 (D.P.R. 2004)).         We affirm\n\nthe district court's conclusion on the due process claim.\n\n            The district court's opinion then treated Rosado's First\n\nAmendment claim as a free speech claim by a public employee and\n\nanalyzed the claim under a three-part test:\n\n            (1) whether the speech involves a matter of\n            public concern; (2) whether, when balanced\n            against each other, the First Amendment\n            interests of the plaintiff and the public\n            outweigh   the   government's    interest in\n            functioning efficiently; and (3) whether the\n            protected   speech  was   a   substantial or\n            motivating factor in the adverse action\n            against the plaintiff.\n\nJordan v. Carter, 428 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Mihos v.\n\nSwift, 358 F.3d 91, 102 (1st Cir. 2004)).    See generally Connick v.\n\nMyers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983); Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of\n\nEduc. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977); Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391\n\nU.S. 563 (1968).    This test has since been refined, in ways not\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fgermane here, in Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410, 421 (2006).\n\nSee Curran v. Cousins, 509 F.3d 36, 44-45 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n             The district court did not reach the second and third\n\nprongs of the test, because it found that Rosado's November 2004\n\ncomplaint in Puerto Rico Superior Court did not address a matter of\n\npublic concern.     The court held that the complaint (which alleged\n\nharassment by fellow employees and delay in rearmament) was \"a\n\nclassic example of speech concerning internal working conditions\n\naffecting only the speaker and co-workers.\"        Rosado Quiñones, 2007\n\nWL 438770, at *5.     We agree.\n\n             \"Whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of\n\npublic concern must be determined by the content, form, and context\n\nof a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\"           Connick,\n\n461 U.S. at 147-48.    The content of Rosado's speech, as embodied by\n\nthe allegations in his original Superior Court complaint, is\n\ndispositive here.     That complaint, replete with implications that\n\nPRPD personnel held personal animosity toward Rosado, does not even\n\napproach matters of inherent public concern in the context of law\n\nenforcement, such as \"official malfeasance, abuse of office, and\n\nneglect of duties.\"        Curran, 509 F.3d at 46.     Rosado's claims of\n\n\"labor harassment\" do not implicate the ability of PRPD personnel\n\nto   carry   out   their   responsibility   to   the   public,   i.e.,   the\n\nprovision of competent law enforcement services.          Cf. Davignon v.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fHodgson, --- F.3d ----, 2008 WL 1822375, at *6-8 (1st Cir. Apr. 24,\n\n2008).\n\n          The   speech   for    which   Rosado   claims   protection   here\n\nrecalls the Supreme Court's admonition that:\n\n          when a public employee speaks not as a citizen\n          upon matters of public concern, but instead as\n          an employee upon matters only of personal\n          interest,    absent     the    most    unusual\n          circumstances, a federal court is not the\n          appropriate forum in which to review the\n          wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a\n          public agency allegedly in reaction to the\n          employee's behavior.\n\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 147.      It is clear on this record that Rosado's\n\nfirst lawsuit did not constitute speech on a matter of public\n\nconcern, and as such, he has no First Amendment free speech\n\nchallenge to his transfer out of the CIC.\n\n          Rosado's brief on appeal argues summarily that the cases\n\non which the district court relied are distinguishable and that\n\nthis case is different because \"the area of free speech involved is\n\nthe filing of a law suit.\"        Rosado merely recites language from\n\nNAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 429 (1963) (\"[T]he First Amendment\n\nalso protects vigorous advocacy, certainly of lawful ends, against\n\ngovernmental intrusion.\"), and United Mine Workers, District 12 v.\n\nIllinois State Bar Ass'n, 389 U.S. 217, 222 (1967) (\"[T]he rights\n\nto assemble peaceably and to petition for a redress of grievances\n\nare among the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the\n\nBill of Rights.\").   However, he presents no further arguments to\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fsuggest how these broad principles could or should alter the\n\nestablished Pickering/Connick/Mt. Healthy framework for assessing\n\npublic   employees'   claims   of   retaliation   for   First   Amendment\n\nactivity.    Rosado has not even attempted to argue that the right to\n\nfile a court complaint is entitled to more protection under the\n\nFirst Amendment than other methods of expressing grievances with\n\npublic employers.\n\n            The cases cited by Rosado do not carry the weight he\n\nassigns them.    United Mine Workers involved the different issue of\n\nwhether members of a union \"had a right, protected by the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments, to join together and assist one another in\n\nthe assertion of their legal rights by collectively hiring an\n\nattorney to handle their claims.\"          389 U.S. at 221.        Button\n\ninvolved a similar issue about the right of NAACP staff attorneys\n\nto provide legal services to litigants whose cases comported with\n\nthe association's institutional goals.      371 U.S. at 419-26.      Both\n\ncases involved attempts by a state to interfere with the rights of\n\norganizations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to employ\n\nattorneys for purposes of vindicating legal rights related to their\n\nassociational purposes. Those interests are simply not involved in\n\nthis case.\n\n            If there is a question of law about whether there is\n\nadded First Amendment protection for public employees' filing of\n\nlawsuits against their employers on matters in which the public has\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fno interest, resolution of that question will await a different\n\ncase.    In the absence of any developed argument on the point, the\n\nquestion is not before us.    United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n\n17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived.\").\n\n            Even if this argument were not waived -- and it was -- it\n\nwould likely fail on the merits.   We have examined our precedent in\n\nPowell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004), and Fabiano v.\n\nHopkins, 352 F.3d 447 (1st Cir. 2003), not cited by plaintiff to\n\neither the district court or this court.      Powell acknowledges, in\n\nthe public employment context, that under the First Amendment,\n\nthere is both a free speech aspect and a right to petition aspect\n\nto claims of retaliation against the filing of lawsuits.       Id. at\n\n16-17.    Rosado never made that distinction clear to the district\n\ncourt.    Notwithstanding the presence of a right to petition claim\n\nin Powell, this court applied the classic Pickering/Connick/Mt.\n\nHealthy analysis.    391 F.3d at 17.    In Fabiano, this court applied\n\nPickering and its progeny to a claim of retaliation for exercising\n\nthe right to petition by a former city employee who sued a city\n\nagency.    352 F.3d at 453.\n\n            In Powell, we upheld an award against a public employer\n\nfound to have retaliated against an employee who filed lawsuits\n\nalleging race discrimination. 391 F.3d at 5-7. The subject matter\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fof the civil rights suit there was plainly a matter of public\n\nconcern.    Further, statutory policy under Title VII prohibits\n\nretaliation   for     the   filing     of    race   discrimination   claims.\n\nSignificantly, the defendants in Powell never argued either that\n\nthe   plaintiff's    complaints      alleging   race   discrimination   were\n\nfrivolous or that they did not address matters of public concern.\n\nSee 391 F.3d at 17, 20.\n\n           By contrast here, the matter of the timing or manner by\n\nwhich the PRPD rearmed Rosado raises no constitutional or public\n\npolicy concerns.      And there is no apparent statutory protection\n\nagainst retaliation for the filing of Rosado's lawsuit.              Rosado's\n\nlawsuit does not involve matters of interest to the public.\n\n           We note there is no absolute First Amendment right to\n\nfile lawsuits.      See Bill Johnson's Rests., Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S.\n\n731, 743 (1983) (\"[S]ham litigation . . . does not come within the\n\nfirst amendment right to petition.\").           The filing of a meritless\n\nlawsuit is subject to sanctions, including the award of attorneys'\n\nfees.   See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 11.\n\n           We have reviewed the summary judgment papers. Even if we\n\nwere to assume there was some form of First Amendment interest in\n\nprotecting the mere filing of Rosado's lawsuit, which did not\n\naddress a matter of public concern, such an interest is outbalanced\n\nby the PRPD's interests. Those interests here include ensuring the\n\nemotional stability of officers to whom the Department gives arms,\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fcurbing insubordination, and being able to respond to a request\n\nfrom an officer's superiors that he be transferred because of a\n\npattern of repeated disrespect for and refusal to take commands\n\nfrom his supervisors.    The decision to transfer, made by the\n\ncommand staff in light of reports it received, outweighs any First\n\nAmendment interest in filing a lawsuit the content of which is not,\n\nunder Connick, protected by the First Amendment.\n\n          The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                    Dissenting Opinion Follows\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f           TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting in part).            Finding\n\nthat Rosado-Quiñones waived his argument that the First Amendment\n\nprotects his filing of a lawsuit, the majority affirms the grant of\n\nsummary judgment to appellees.        I cannot agree.       Rosado-Quiñones\n\nsufficiently developed his argument alleging a violation of his\n\nFirst Amendment right of access to the courts.            I would therefore\n\ndecide the issue that the majority refuses to confront, and would\n\nhold that Rosado-Quiñones raised it with sufficient clarity and\n\ncorrectness to survive the appellee's motion for summary judgment.\n\n           First of all, Rosado-Quiñones did not waive the argument\n\nthat he has a First Amendment right of access to the courts for\n\nredress of his grievances.      He argued in his original complaint\n\nthat he was transferred and demoted \"due to the fact that [he] had\n\nfiled a damage claim.\"     This is clearly an argument that the First\n\nAmendment protects his right of access to the courts. His argument\n\nwas in no way perfunctory.     Rosado-Quiñones did not \"merely . . .\n\nmention a possible argument in the most skeletal way.\"               United\n\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1990).       He passed the threshold\n\nof   fulfilling   his   \"obligation   'to   spell   out    [his]   arguments\n\nsquarely and distinctly.'\"      Rivera-Gómez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d\n\n631, 635 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun.\n\nWholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 990 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\n           In the brief he filed with this court, Rosado-Quiñones\n\nrenews the argument he made in his opposition to summary judgment.\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fIn distinguishing his case from Pickering v. Board of Education,\n\n391 U.S. 563 (1968), and Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983),\n\namong others, Rosado-Quiñones makes clear that \"the area of free\n\nspeech involved is the filing of a law suit.\"      He quotes NAACP v.\n\nButton, 371 U.S. 415, 429 (1963), for the proposition that \"[t]he\n\nright to file a law suit is a form of communication embraced by the\n\nFirst Amendment.\"   He makes the same argument in the brief he filed\n\nbefore this court.     He cites Button and United Mine Workers of\n\nAmerica, Dist. 12 v. Illinois State Bar Ass'n, 389 U.S. 217, 222\n\n(1967), for no other reason than to argue that he has a First\n\nAmendment right to file a lawsuit.     While I agree with the majority\n\nthat Button and United Mine Workers also involved other issues,\n\nthose other issues are not germane to his argument.      The majority\n\nattempts to cast aside these cases by saying that the cases \"do not\n\ncarry the weight [Rosado-Quiñones] assigns them.\"     Slip op. at 12.\n\nI disagree.    That they dealt with other issues does not take away\n\nfrom the fact that they, and we, have held that the First Amendment\n\nencompasses the right of access to courts. See Fabiano v. Hopkins,\n\n352 F.3d 447, 453 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"As an initial matter, every\n\ncitizen has the right 'to petition the Government for a redress of\n\ngrievances.'    U.S. Const. amend. I.     The right of access to the\n\ncourts is an established aspect of this right.\" (citing Bill\n\nJohnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731, 741 (1983))).\n\n\n\n\n                                -17-\n\f           The Pickering/Connick/Mt. Healthy line of cases is the\n\nwrong analytical framework in which to view Rosado-Quiñones's\n\nclaim.   As he made clear in his brief and at oral arguments, those\n\ncases dealt with free speech; his claim deals with the First\n\nAmendment right to file a lawsuit.    This right is distinct from the\n\nright to distribute a questionnaire at work, Connick, 461 U.S. at\n\n140-41; the right to comment on a radio station about the substance\n\nof a memorandum issued by a public school principal, Mt. Healthy\n\nCity Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 274 (1977); or\n\nthe right of a teacher to send a letter to a local newspaper\n\ncriticizing the school board, Pickering, 391 U.S. at 564.      Those\n\nclaims involved a different kind of First Amendment right than the\n\none asserted by Rosado-Quiñones.     In Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d\n\n1 (1st Cir. 2004), we said that the plaintiff's \"filing of his 1991\n\nlawsuit was an exercise of his First Amendment right to petition\n\nthe government for redress, and that in retaliating against him for\n\nthe filing of that lawsuit [the City Solicitor] risked violating\n\nhis right under the Constitution.\"      Id. at 20.   Rosado-Quiñones\n\nclaims that he was retaliated against for the same reason. \"'[O]ur\n\nconstitutional system gives every citizen the right to seek redress\n\nin the courts . . . without fear that recourse to the law will make\n\nthat citizen a target for retaliation.\"         Id. at 16 (citation\n\nomitted) (second alteration in original).\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f             Rosado-Quiñones filed a lawsuit because he claimed that\n\nhe was wronged by a governmental actor.                 \"'[G]oing to a judicial\n\nbody for redress of alleged wrongs . . . stands apart from other\n\nforms   of   action   directed      at    the     alleged    wrongdoer.'\"       Bill\n\nJohnson's Restaurants, 461 U.S. at 741 (citation omitted) (second\n\nalteration in original). Were we to require governmental employees\n\nto demonstrate that their lawsuits were matters of public concern\n\nas a prerequisite to constitutional protection against retaliation\n\nfor exercising this right, we would be placing an unwarranted and\n\nunconstitutional      burden   on   them        that   is   not   placed   on   other\n\ncitizens, merely by virtue of their status as public employees.\n\nCf. id. at 742 (\"If the Board is allowed to enjoin the prosecution\n\nof a well-grounded state lawsuit, it necessarily follows that any\n\nstate plaintiff subject to such an injunction will be totally\n\ndeprived of a remedy for an actual injury.\").\n\n             I agree with the majority that the First Amendment does\n\nnot protect against sham lawsuits.               See slip op. at 14.        Indeed,\n\n\"[t]he first amendment interests involved in private litigation\n\n. . . are not advanced when the litigation is based on intentional\n\nfalsehoods or on knowingly frivolous claims.\"                      Bill Johnson's\n\nRestaurants, 461 U.S. at 743.             But there is a difference between\n\nfrivolous litigation and a lawsuit that has a \"reasonable basis in\n\nfact or law.\"    Id. at 748.     The correct legal framework in which to\n\nview Rosado-Quiñones's lawsuit is to look at whether his suit has\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fsuch a reasonable basis.            At the summary judgment stage, courts\n\nshould merely examine whether or not a plaintiff is \"able to\n\npresent the [court] with evidence that shows his lawsuit raises\n\ngenuine issues of material fact.\" Id. at 745-46. Summary judgment\n\nfor a case such as this one should not be granted unless the\n\n\"plaintiff's position is plainly foreclosed as a matter of law or\n\nis otherwise frivolous.\"            Id. at 747.    The district did not make\n\neither finding below, nor can we reach such a conclusion on the\n\nrecord before us.\n\n            Rosado-Quiñones         filed    his   original    lawsuit   in   the\n\nCommonwealth courts on November 17, 2004, and he was transferred\n\nand demoted on February 5, 2005.            He argues that he was transferred\n\nand demoted because he filed a lawsuit against the Superintendent\n\nof Police of Puerto Rico and other defendants.                His lawsuit is not\n\nfrivolous on its face, nor is it plainly foreclosed as a matter of\n\nlaw.   There is enough temporal proximity between those events that\n\na   reasonable      jury    could    determine     that   Rosado-Quiñones     was\n\nretaliated against because he filed a lawsuit against the Police\n\nDepartment.      See Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec. ex rel.\n\nChertoff,     511    F.3d    216,    224    (1st   Cir.   2007)   (\"'[T]emporal\n\nproximity' between appellant's allegations of discrimination in\n\nJune 2002 and his termination in August 2002 is sufficient to meet\n\nthe relatively light burden of establishing a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation.\" (citing Pomales v. Celulares Telefónica, Inc., 446\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fF.3d 79, 85 (1st Cir. 2006))).        His allegation that he was\n\nretaliated against because he filed a lawsuit against the Police\n\nDepartment presents a genuine issue of material fact that should be\n\ndecided by a jury.    Accordingly, I would reverse the grant of\n\nsummary judgment and give Rosado-Quiñones his day in court.\n\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\f",

He claimed that his superiors violated his First Amendment rights when they assigned him to new job duties, allegedly in retaliation for his having filed a lawsuit against them in a local court. Rosado also asserted a due process claim that he was denied notice and a hearing about his changed job responsibilities, as well as pendent claims under Puerto Rico law. The defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district court allowed as to all federal claims; the Puerto Rico law claims were dismissed without prejudice. Rosado appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The undisputed record shows the following. Rosado was a veteran of the Puerto Rico Police Department, having been assigned since 1985 to the specialized, plainclothes Criminal Investigation Corps (\"CIC\") in Mayagüez. The Department transferred Rosado in February 2005 to an assignment as a uniformed beat officer on the undesirable 4:00-a.m.-to-noon shift, which produced this lawsuit. This transfer followed several events.</p>\n<p>In December 2002, criminal charges of disturbing the peace were filed against Rosado. Pursuant to PRPD policy, Rosado was forced to surrender temporarily his firearm. A Commonwealth judge found probable cause for the criminal charges and, in January 2003, scheduled Rosado for trial. Rosado was found not guilty in August 2003. The PRPD continued to employ Rosado during the period of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> pending charges, his disarmament, and all times relevant to this suit.</p>\n<p>Rosado, despite requests that his firearm be returned, was not rearmed by the Department until July 2004. On September 14, 2004, Rosado told the Superintendent of Police he intended to sue the Department over his prolonged period of disarmament. Following Rosado's notice, the Department initiated an internal inquiry. On November 10, 2004, Rosado's superiors at the CIC submitted a report to the PRPD commander of the Mayagüez region.</p>\n<p>On November 17, 2004, Rosado filed suit in the Commonwealth courts against the Commonwealth, the Department of Justice, and a number of police officials. These officials included the commander, three lieutenants and two sergeants. In his Superior Court complaint, Rosado alleged a \"pattern of labor harassment\" by the PRPD against him. Rosado alleged that after he had been charged with disturbing the peace and his firearm had been confiscated, the sergeant who took the gun \"claimed that [Rosado] had an emotional condition that was affecting the performance of his duties.\" After Rosado was acquitted of the charges, two separate sergeants in the Department reiterated their concerns about his emotional condition, and one informed him that only the police psychiatrist could return Rosado's firearm. According to Rosado's Superior Court complaint, the latter sergeant \"opposed his being rearmed deliberately in order to do damage to [Rosado], requiring for no reason at all that [Rosado] be evaluated by the Puerto Rico Police psychiatrist, which is an action that in and of itself is illegal.\" The complaint goes on to acknowledge that Rosado eventually did undergo a psychiatric evaluation on June 28, 2004, and was rearmed in July.</p>\n<p>Rosado's complaint in the Puerto Rico court also alleged that in spite of his past job performance and his acquittal of the criminal charges, the Department's Office of Public Integrity advised that Rosado be suspended without pay for ninety days, although that suspension did not actually occur.<sup>[1]</sup> Rosado's complaint requested damages of $500,000.</p>\n<p>Defendants put into evidence three reports about Rosado's inappropriate conduct that were written before Rosado filed suit in late 2004. There had been an incident on January 24, 2003, which was memorialized in a January 28, 2003 memo from Lieutenant Nelson Fonseca Rossy, Deputy Director of the Mayagüez CIC, to Captain Héctor Agosto Rodríguez, Director of that unit. The memo reported that Rosado defied the CIC's official start time. When admonished, Rosado questioned the authority of his superior and said he was being persecuted. Fonseca informed Rosado that he must get his \"persecution complex out of his head\" since he was not being persecuted.</p>\n<p>Fonseca reported another instance of Rosado's inappropriate conduct that occurred on December 3, 2003. Fonseca described both a specific incident in which Rosado addressed Fonseca \"disrespectfully, arrogantly, and defiantly,\" and a continuing pattern of disrespect by Rosado toward his superior. The report noted that \"this officer suffers from a persecution complex and his conduct rebuffs supervision.\"</p>\n<p>Sergeant Pedro Matos Fortuna, Head of Administration for the Mayagüez CIC, also reported Rosado's actions on December <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> 3, 2003. Matos complained that Rosado had addressed him \"in a hostile, disrespectful and derogatory manner, in contempt of the position I hold at the agency and especially towards the criminal investigation corps.\" The report concluded that based on this and two prior incidents in January 2003, Rosado lacked respect for his superiors and would not tolerate discipline. The report recommended sending Rosado to professional improvement courses.</p>\n<p>Internal disciplinary reports regarding Rosado's conduct continued to be made after Rosado filed his first lawsuit and were consistent in theme with the prior reports. A report dated January 26, 2005 and entitled \"Act of Insubordination\" was written by Lieutenant Jorge Velázquez Almodóvar, the Head of the Robbery Section of the Mayagüez CIC. The report recounted a specific incident in which Rosado objected to signing a receipt reflecting the fact that he possessed a bulletproof jacket. Rosado also refused to answer questions from Velázquez regarding a shooting incident. Velázquez reported that Rosado disobeyed legal orders and questioned authority. The report concluded that Rosado had disqualified himself from working in the CIC. The report further noted that Rosado's attitude spread unease among the department and prevented other officers \"from doing their job to the best of their abilities.\" Velázquez requested an administrative investigation into Rosado and further requested that Rosado be transferred out of the CIC.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The CIC Director, on February 1, 2005, agreed with the recommendation that Rosado be transferred to another office.</p>\n<p>On February 9, 2005, the Department transferred Rosado from the CIC to the Field Operations unit. Rosado's new assignment was that of uniformed police officer, the lowest rank in the Department. Rosado's salary was not reduced. Rosado intended to retire from the PRPD once he became eligible in January 2007.</p>\n<p>On January 27, 2006, Rosado filed a damages suit in federal court in Puerto Rico. Rosado's federal complaint alleged that the PRPD violated his due process rights when it demoted him without a hearing. The complaint also alleged that the transfer violated the First Amendment because it was ordered in retaliation for Rosado's previous filing of a complaint in Puerto Rico court. The complaint also included a claim under Puerto Rico law. Rosado sought damages of $10 million for his constitutional claims and $100,000 for his state law claim.</p>\n<p>Defendants moved for summary judgment on December 7, 2006. Rosado filed an affidavit in opposition, in which he denied the conclusion in the January 26, 2005 report that he was insubordinate and said he \"was only exercising my right to free speech.\" As proof that he was not insubordinate, Rosado claimed he was not actually investigated. He did not dispute that his supervisors had concluded he was insubordinate and documented their concerns to the command staff. Nor did Rosado dispute the facts stated in the internal disciplinary memoranda detailing his actions, although he disputed the contention that he had been insubordinate.</p>\n<p>The district court granted the defendants' motion on February 5, 2007. <i>Rosado Quiñones v. Toledo Davila,</i> No. 06-1113, 2007 WL 438770 (D.P.R. Feb.5, 2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> II.</h2>\n<p>We review the district court's ruling de novo, taking the facts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Rosado. <i>Hoyos v. Telecorp Commc'ns, Inc.,</i> 488 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>As to the federal due process claim, the district court correctly held that because Puerto Rico law does not recognize any property interest in the performance of particular job functions in the course of an employee's continued employment, there was no constitutionally protected interest requiring a due process hearing. <i>Rosado Quiñones,</i> 2007 WL 438770, at *5 (citing <i>Rosado de Velez v. Zayas,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d 202, 212 (D.P.R.2004)). We affirm the district court's conclusion on the due process claim.</p>\n<p>The district court's opinion then treated Rosado's First Amendment claim as a free speech claim by a public employee and analyzed the claim under a three-part test:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) whether the speech involves a matter of public concern; (2) whether, when balanced against each other, the First Amendment interests of the plaintiff and the public outweigh the government's interest in functioning efficiently; and (3) whether the protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action against the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Jordan v. Carter,</i> 428 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Mihos v. Swift,</i> 358 F.3d 91, 102 (1st Cir.2004)). <i>See generally </i><i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983); <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <i>Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). This test has since been refined, in ways not germane here, in <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). <i>See </i><i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> 509 F.3d 36, 44-45 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The district court did not reach the second and third prongs of the test, because it found that Rosado's November 2004 complaint in Puerto Rico Superior Court did not address a matter of public concern. The court held that the complaint (which alleged harassment by fellow employees and delay in rearmament) was \"a classic example of speech concerning internal working conditions affecting only the speaker and co-workers.\" <i>Rosado Quiñones,</i> 2007 WL 438770, at *5. We agree.</p>\n<p>\"Whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\" <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 147-48, 103 S.Ct. 1684. The content of Rosado's speech, as embodied by the allegations in his original Superior Court complaint, is dispositive here. That complaint, replete with implications that PRPD personnel held personal animosity toward Rosado, does not even approach matters of inherent public concern in the context of law enforcement, such as \"official malfeasance, abuse of office, and neglect of duties.\" <i>Curran,</i> 509 F.3d at 46. Rosado's claims of \"labor harassment\" do not implicate the ability of PRPD personnel to carry out their responsibility to the public, i.e., the provision of competent law enforcement services. <i>Cf. </i><i>Davignon v. Hodgson,</i> 524 F.3d 91, 100-03 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>The speech for which Rosado claims protection here recalls the Supreme Court's admonition that:</p>\n<blockquote>when a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 147, 103 S.Ct. 1684. It is clear on this record that Rosado's first lawsuit did not constitute speech on a matter of public concern, and as such, he has no First Amendment free speech challenge to his transfer out of the CIC.</p>\n<p>Rosado's brief on appeal argues summarily that the cases on which the district court relied are distinguishable and that this case is different because \"the area of free speech involved is the filing of a law suit.\" Rosado merely recites language from <i>NAACP v. Button,</i> 371 U.S. 415, 429, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963) (\"[T]he First Amendment also protects vigorous advocacy, certainly of lawful ends, against governmental intrusion.\"), and <i>United Mine Workers, District 12 v. Illinois State Bar Ass'n,</i> 389 U.S. 217, 222, 88 S.Ct. 353, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967) (\"[T]he rights to assemble peaceably and to petition for a redress of grievances are among the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights.\"). However, he presents no further arguments to suggest how these broad principles could or should alter the established <i>Pickering/Connick/Mt. Healthy</i> framework for assessing public employees' claims of retaliation for First Amendment activity. Rosado has not even attempted to argue that the right to file a court complaint is entitled to more protection under the First Amendment than other methods of expressing grievances with public employers.</p>\n<p>The cases cited by Rosado do not carry the weight he assigns them. <i>United Mine Workers</i> involved the different issue of whether members of a union \"had a right, protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, to join together and assist one another in the assertion of their legal rights by collectively hiring an attorney to handle their claims.\" 389 U.S. at 221, 88 S.Ct. 353. <i>Button</i> involved a similar issue about the right of NAACP staff attorneys to provide legal services to litigants whose cases comported with the association's institutional goals. 371 U.S. at 419-26, 83 S.Ct. 328. Both cases involved attempts by a state to interfere with the rights of organizations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to employ attorneys for purposes of vindicating legal rights related to their associational purposes. Those interests are simply not involved in this case.</p>\n<p>If there is a question of law about whether there is added First Amendment protection for public employees' filing of lawsuits against their employers on matters in which the public has no interest, resolution of that question will await a different case. In the absence of any developed argument on the point, the question is not before us. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n<p>Even if this argument were not waived-and it was-it would likely fail on the merits. We have examined our precedent in <i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> 391 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004), and <i>Fabiano v. Hopkins,</i> 352 F.3d 447 (1st Cir.2003), not cited by plaintiff to either the district court or this court. <i>Powell</i> acknowledges, in the public employment context, that under the First Amendment, there is both a free speech aspect and a right to petition aspect to claims of retaliation against the filing of lawsuits. <i>Id.</i> at 16-17. Rosado never made that distinction clear to the district court. Notwithstanding the presence of a right to petition claim in <i>Powell,</i> this court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> applied the classic <i>Pickering/Connick/Mt. Healthy</i> analysis. 391 F.3d at 17. In <i>Fabiano,</i> this court applied <i>Pickering</i> and its progeny to a claim of retaliation for exercising the right to petition by a former city employee who sued a city agency. 352 F.3d at 453.</p>\n<p>In <i>Powell,</i> we upheld an award against a public employer found to have retaliated against an employee who filed lawsuits alleging race discrimination. 391 F.3d at 5-7. The subject matter of the civil rights suit there was plainly a matter of public concern. Further, statutory policy under Title VII prohibits retaliation for the filing of race discrimination claims. Significantly, the defendants in <i>Powell</i> never argued either that the plaintiff's complaints alleging race discrimination were frivolous or that they did not address matters of public concern. <i>See</i> 391 F.3d at 17, 20.</p>\n<p>By contrast here, the matter of the timing or manner by which the PRPD rearmed Rosado raises no constitutional or public policy concerns. And there is no apparent statutory protection against retaliation for the filing of Rosado's lawsuit. Rosado's lawsuit does not involve matters of interest to the public.</p>\n<p>We note there is no absolute First Amendment right to file lawsuits. <i>See </i><i>Bill Johnson's Rests., Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 461 U.S. 731, 743, 103 S.Ct. 2161, 76 L.Ed.2d 277 (1983) (\"[S]ham litigation ... does not come within the first amendment right to petition.\"). The filing of a meritless lawsuit is subject to sanctions, including the award of attorneys' fees. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n<p>We have reviewed the summary judgment papers. Even if we were to assume there was some form of First Amendment interest in protecting the mere filing of Rosado's lawsuit, which did not address a matter of public concern, such an interest is outbalanced by the PRPD's interests. Those interests here include ensuring the emotional stability of officers to whom the Department gives arms, curbing insubordination, and being able to respond to a request from an officer's superiors that he be transferred because of a pattern of repeated disrespect for and refusal to take commands from his supervisors. The decision to transfer, made by the command staff in light of reports it received, outweighs any First Amendment interest in filing a lawsuit the content of which is not, under <i>Connick,</i> protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Finding that Rosado-Quiñones waived his argument that the First Amendment protects his filing of a lawsuit, the majority affirms the grant of summary judgment to appellees. I cannot agree. Rosado-Quiñones sufficiently developed his argument alleging a violation of his First Amendment right of access to the courts. I would therefore decide the issue that the majority refuses to confront, and would hold that Rosado-Quiñones raised it with sufficient clarity and correctness to survive the appellee's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>First of all, Rosado-Quiñones did not waive the argument that he has a First Amendment right of access to the courts for redress of his grievances. He argued in his original complaint that he was transferred and demoted \"due to the fact that [he] had filed a damage claim.\" This is clearly an argument that the First Amendment protects his right of access to the courts. His argument was in no way perfunctory. Rosado-Quiñones did not \"merely ... mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way.\" <i>United States</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> <i>v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1990). He passed the threshold of fulfilling his \"obligation `to spell out [his] arguments squarely and distinctly.'\" <i>Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro,</i> 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting <i>Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> 840 F.2d 985, 990 (1st Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p>In the brief he filed with this court, Rosado-Quiñones renews the argument he made in his opposition to summary judgment. In distinguishing his case from <i>Pickering v. Board of Education,</i> 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), and <i>Connick v. Myers,</i> 461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983), among others, Rosado-Quiñones makes clear that \"the area of free speech involved is the filing of a law suit.\" He quotes <i>NAACP v. Button,</i> 371 U.S. 415, 429, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963), for the proposition that \"[t]he right to file a law suit is a form of communication embraced by the First Amendment.\" He makes the same argument in the brief he filed before this court. He cites <i>Button</i> and <i>United Mine Workers of America, Dist. 12 v. Illinois State Bar Ass'n,</i> 389 U.S. 217, 222, 88 S.Ct. 353, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967), for no other reason than to argue that he has a First Amendment right to file a lawsuit. While I agree with the majority that <i>Button</i> and <i>United Mine Workers</i> also involved other issues, those other issues are not germane to his argument. The majority attempts to cast aside these cases by saying that the cases \"do not carry the weight [Rosado-Quiñones] assigns them.\" Op. at 6. I disagree. That they dealt with other issues does not take away from the fact that they, and we, have held that the First Amendment encompasses the right of access to courts. <i>See </i><i>Fabiano v. Hopkins,</i> 352 F.3d 447, 453 (1st Cir.2003) (\"As an initial matter, every citizen has the right `to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' U.S. Const. amend. I. The right of access to the courts is an established aspect of this right.\" (citing <i>Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 461 U.S. 731, 741, 103 S.Ct. 2161, 76 L.Ed.2d 277 (1983))).</p>\n<p>The <i>Pickering/Connick/Mt. Healthy</i> line of cases is the wrong analytical framework in which to view Rosado-Quiñones's claim. As he made clear in his brief and at oral arguments, those cases dealt with free speech; his claim deals with the First Amendment right to file a lawsuit. This right is distinct from the right to distribute a questionnaire at work, <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 140-41; the right to comment on a radio station about the substance of a memorandum issued by a public school principal, <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); or the right of a teacher to send a letter to a local newspaper criticizing the school board, <i>Pickering,</i> 391 U.S. at 564. Those claims involved a different kind of First Amendment: right than the one asserted by Rosado-Quiñones. In <i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> 391 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2004), we said that the plaintiff's \"filing of his 1991 lawsuit was an exercise of his First Amendment right to petition the government for redress, and that in retaliating against him for the filing of that lawsuit [the City Solicitor] risked violating his right under the Constitution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20. Rosado-Quiñones claims that he was retaliated against for the same reason. \"[O]ur constitutional system gives every citizen the right to seek redress in the courts ... without fear that recourse to the law will make that citizen a target for retaliation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 16 (citation omitted) (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p>Rosado-Quiñones filed a lawsuit because he claimed that he was wronged by a governmental actor. \"`[G]oing to a judicial body for redress of alleged wrongs ... stands apart from other forms of action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> directed at the alleged wrongdoer.'\" <i>Bill Johnson's Restaurants,</i> 461 U.S. at 741 (citation omitted) (second alteration in original). Were we to require governmental employees to demonstrate that their lawsuits were matters of public concern as a prerequisite to constitutional protection against retaliation for exercising this right, we would be placing an unwarranted and unconstitutional burden on them that is not placed on other citizens, merely by virtue of their status as public employees. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 742 (\"If the Board is allowed to enjoin the prosecution of a well-grounded state lawsuit, it necessarily follows that any state plaintiff subject to such an injunction will be totally deprived of a remedy for an actual injury.\").</p>\n<p>I agree with the majority that the First Amendment does not protect against sham lawsuits. <i>See</i> op. at 7. Indeed, \"[t]he first amendment interests involved in private litigation ... are not advanced when the litigation is based on intentional falsehoods or on knowingly frivolous claims.\" <i>Bill Johnson's Restaurants,</i> 461 U.S. at 743, 103 S.Ct. 2161. But there is a difference between frivolous litigation and a lawsuit that has a \"reasonable basis in fact or law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 748, 103 S.Ct. 2161. The correct legal framework in which to view Rosado-Quiñones's lawsuit is to look at whether his suit has such a reasonable basis. At the summary judgment stage, courts should merely examine whether or not a plaintiff is \"able to present the [court] with evidence that shows his lawsuit raises genuine issues of material fact.\" <i>Id.</i> at 745-46, 103 S.Ct. 2161. Summary judgment for a case such as this one should not be granted unless the \"plaintiff's position is plainly foreclosed as a matter of law or is otherwise frivolous.\" <i>Id.</i> at 747, 103 S.Ct. 2161. The district did not make either finding below, nor can we reach such a conclusion on the record before us.</p>\n<p>Rosado-Quiñones filed his original lawsuit in the Commonwealth courts on November 17, 2004, and he was transferred and demoted on February 5, 2005. He argues that he was transferred and demoted because he filed a lawsuit against the Superintendent of Police of Puerto Rico and other defendants. His lawsuit is not frivolous on its face, nor is it plainly foreclosed as a matter of law. There is enough temporal proximity between those events that a reasonable jury could determine that Rosado-Quiñones was retaliated against because he filed a lawsuit against the Police Department. <i>See </i><i>Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec. ex rel. Chertoff,</i> 511 F.3d 216, 224 (1st Cir.2007) (\"`[T]emporal proximity' between appellant's allegations of discrimination in June 2002 and his termination in August 2002 is sufficient to meet the relatively light burden of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation.\" (citing <i>Pomales v. Celulares Telefónica, Inc.,</i> 447 F.3d 79, 85 (1st Cir. 2006))). His allegation that he was retaliated against because he filed a lawsuit against the Police Department presents a genuine issue of material fact that should be decided by a jury. Accordingly, I would reverse the grant of summary judgment and give Rosado-Quiñones his day in court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The CIC informed Rosado on December 8, 2004 that he would be suspended without pay for fifteen days. On December 20, Rosado objected to the suspension, and the suspension never took place.</p>\n<p>[2]  The January 26 memo also complained that Rosado solved crimes at a lower rate than others and cited an intra-departmental minimum case-resolution rate. Rosado disputes that rate. In our view, this dispute is immaterial.</p>\n\n</div>",

He claimed that his superiors violated his First Amendment rights when they assigned him to new job duties, allegedly in retaliation for his having filed a lawsuit against them in a local court. Rosado also asserted a due process claim that he was denied notice and a hearing about his changed job responsibilities, as well as pendent claims under Puerto Rico law. The defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district court allowed as to all federal claims; the Puerto Rico law claims were dismissed without prejudice. Rosado appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>The undisputed record shows the following. Rosado was a veteran of the Puerto Rico Police Department, having been assigned since 1985 to the specialized, plainclothes Criminal Investigation Corps (\"CIC\") in Mayagüez. The Department transferred Rosado in February 2005 to an assignment as a uniformed beat officer on the undesirable 4:00-a.m.-to-noon shift, which produced this lawsuit. This transfer followed several events.</p>\n<p>In December 2002, criminal charges of disturbing the peace were filed against Rosado. Pursuant to PRPD policy, Rosado was forced to surrender temporarily his firearm. A Commonwealth judge found probable cause for the criminal charges and, in January 2003, scheduled Rosado for trial. Rosado was found not guilty in August 2003. The PRPD continued to employ Rosado during the period of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> pending charges, his disarmament, and all times relevant to this suit.</p>\n<p>Rosado, despite requests that his firearm be returned, was not rearmed by the Department until July 2004. On September 14, 2004, Rosado told the Superintendent of Police he intended to sue the Department over his prolonged period of disarmament. Following Rosado's notice, the Department initiated an internal inquiry. On November 10, 2004, Rosado's superiors at the CIC submitted a report to the PRPD commander of the Mayagüez region.</p>\n<p>On November 17, 2004, Rosado filed suit in the Commonwealth courts against the Commonwealth, the Department of Justice, and a number of police officials. These officials included the commander, three lieutenants and two sergeants. In his Superior Court complaint, Rosado alleged a \"pattern of labor harassment\" by the PRPD against him. Rosado alleged that after he had been charged with disturbing the peace and his firearm had been confiscated, the sergeant who took the gun \"claimed that [Rosado] had an emotional condition that was affecting the performance of his duties.\" After Rosado was acquitted of the charges, two separate sergeants in the Department reiterated their concerns about his emotional condition, and one informed him that only the police psychiatrist could return Rosado's firearm. According to Rosado's Superior Court complaint, the latter sergeant \"opposed his being rearmed deliberately in order to do damage to [Rosado], requiring for no reason at all that [Rosado] be evaluated by the Puerto Rico Police psychiatrist, which is an action that in and of itself is illegal.\" The complaint goes on to acknowledge that Rosado eventually did undergo a psychiatric evaluation on June 28, 2004, and was rearmed in July.</p>\n<p>Rosado's complaint in the Puerto Rico court also alleged that in spite of his past job performance and his acquittal of the criminal charges, the Department's Office of Public Integrity advised that Rosado be suspended without pay for ninety days, although that suspension did not actually occur.<sup>[1]</sup> Rosado's complaint requested damages of $500,000.</p>\n<p>Defendants put into evidence three reports about Rosado's inappropriate conduct that were written before Rosado filed suit in late 2004. There had been an incident on January 24, 2003, which was memorialized in a January 28, 2003 memo from Lieutenant Nelson Fonseca Rossy, Deputy Director of the Mayagüez CIC, to Captain Héctor Agosto Rodríguez, Director of that unit. The memo reported that Rosado defied the CIC's official start time. When admonished, Rosado questioned the authority of his superior and said he was being persecuted. Fonseca informed Rosado that he must get his \"persecution complex out of his head\" since he was not being persecuted.</p>\n<p>Fonseca reported another instance of Rosado's inappropriate conduct that occurred on December 3, 2003. Fonseca described both a specific incident in which Rosado addressed Fonseca \"disrespectfully, arrogantly, and defiantly,\" and a continuing pattern of disrespect by Rosado toward his superior. The report noted that \"this officer suffers from a persecution complex and his conduct rebuffs supervision.\"</p>\n<p>Sergeant Pedro Matos Fortuna, Head of Administration for the Mayagüez CIC, also reported Rosado's actions on December <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> 3, 2003. Matos complained that Rosado had addressed him \"in a hostile, disrespectful and derogatory manner, in contempt of the position I hold at the agency and especially towards the criminal investigation corps.\" The report concluded that based on this and two prior incidents in January 2003, Rosado lacked respect for his superiors and would not tolerate discipline. The report recommended sending Rosado to professional improvement courses.</p>\n<p>Internal disciplinary reports regarding Rosado's conduct continued to be made after Rosado filed his first lawsuit and were consistent in theme with the prior reports. A report dated January 26, 2005 and entitled \"Act of Insubordination\" was written by Lieutenant Jorge Velázquez Almodóvar, the Head of the Robbery Section of the Mayagüez CIC. The report recounted a specific incident in which Rosado objected to signing a receipt reflecting the fact that he possessed a bulletproof jacket. Rosado also refused to answer questions from Velázquez regarding a shooting incident. Velázquez reported that Rosado disobeyed legal orders and questioned authority. The report concluded that Rosado had disqualified himself from working in the CIC. The report further noted that Rosado's attitude spread unease among the department and prevented other officers \"from doing their job to the best of their abilities.\" Velázquez requested an administrative investigation into Rosado and further requested that Rosado be transferred out of the CIC.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The CIC Director, on February 1, 2005, agreed with the recommendation that Rosado be transferred to another office.</p>\n<p>On February 9, 2005, the Department transferred Rosado from the CIC to the Field Operations unit. Rosado's new assignment was that of uniformed police officer, the lowest rank in the Department. Rosado's salary was not reduced. Rosado intended to retire from the PRPD once he became eligible in January 2007.</p>\n<p>On January 27, 2006, Rosado filed a damages suit in federal court in Puerto Rico. Rosado's federal complaint alleged that the PRPD violated his due process rights when it demoted him without a hearing. The complaint also alleged that the transfer violated the First Amendment because it was ordered in retaliation for Rosado's previous filing of a complaint in Puerto Rico court. The complaint also included a claim under Puerto Rico law. Rosado sought damages of $10 million for his constitutional claims and $100,000 for his state law claim.</p>\n<p>Defendants moved for summary judgment on December 7, 2006. Rosado filed an affidavit in opposition, in which he denied the conclusion in the January 26, 2005 report that he was insubordinate and said he \"was only exercising my right to free speech.\" As proof that he was not insubordinate, Rosado claimed he was not actually investigated. He did not dispute that his supervisors had concluded he was insubordinate and documented their concerns to the command staff. Nor did Rosado dispute the facts stated in the internal disciplinary memoranda detailing his actions, although he disputed the contention that he had been insubordinate.</p>\n<p>The district court granted the defendants' motion on February 5, 2007. <i>Rosado Quiñones v.

The court held that the complaint (which alleged harassment by fellow employees and delay in rearmament) was \"a classic example of speech concerning internal working conditions affecting only the speaker and co-workers.\" <i>Rosado Quiñones,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">438770</span></span>, at *5.

That complaint, replete with implications that PRPD personnel held personal animosity toward Rosado, does not even approach matters of inherent public concern in the context of law enforcement, such as \"official malfeasance, abuse of office, and neglect of duties.\" <i>Curran,</i> 509 F.3d at 46. Rosado's claims of \"labor harassment\" do not implicate the ability of PRPD personnel to carry out their responsibility to the public, i.e., the provision of competent law enforcement services. <i>Cf. </i><i>Davignon v. Hodgson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203296\"><a href=\"/opinion/203296/davignon-v-hodgson/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 100-03 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p>The speech for which Rosado claims protection here recalls the Supreme Court's admonition that:</p>\n<blockquote>when a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110917\"><a href=\"/opinion/110917/connick-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is clear on this record that Rosado's first lawsuit did not constitute speech on a matter of public concern, and as such, he has no First Amendment free speech challenge to his transfer out of the CIC.</p>\n<p>Rosado's brief on appeal argues summarily that the cases on which the district court relied are distinguishable and that this case is different because \"the area of free speech involved is the filing of a law suit.\" Rosado merely recites language from <i>NAACP v.

However, he presents no further arguments to suggest how these broad principles could or should alter the established <i>Pickering/Connick/Mt. Healthy</i> framework for assessing public employees' claims of retaliation for First Amendment activity. Rosado has not even attempted to argue that the right to file a court complaint is entitled to more protection under the First Amendment than other methods of expressing grievances with public employers.</p>\n<p>The cases cited by Rosado do not carry the weight he assigns them. <i>United Mine Workers</i> involved the different issue of whether members of a union \"had a right, protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, to join together and assist one another in the assertion of their legal rights by collectively hiring an attorney to handle their claims.\" 389 U.S. at 221, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107551\"><a href=\"/opinion/107551/mine-workers-v-illinois-bar-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span>. Both cases involved attempts by a state to interfere with the rights of organizations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to employ attorneys for purposes of vindicating legal rights related to their associational purposes. Those interests are simply not involved in this case.</p>\n<p>If there is a question of law about whether there is added First Amendment protection for public employees' filing of lawsuits against their employers on matters in which the public has no interest, resolution of that question will await a different case. In the absence of any developed argument on the point, the question is not before us. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n<p>Even if this argument were not waived-and it was-it would likely fail on the merits. We have examined our precedent in <i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201350\"><a href=\"/opinion/201350/powell-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2004), and <i>Fabiano v.

Rosado never made that distinction clear to the district court. Notwithstanding the presence of a right to petition claim in <i>Powell,</i> this court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> applied the classic <i>Pickering/Connick/Mt. Healthy</i> analysis. 391 F.3d at 17. In <i>Fabiano,</i> this court applied <i>Pickering</i> and its progeny to a claim of retaliation for exercising the right to petition by a former city employee who sued a city agency. 352 F.3d at 453.</p>\n<p>In <i>Powell,</i> we upheld an award against a public employer found to have retaliated against an employee who filed lawsuits alleging race discrimination. 391 F.3d at 5-7. The subject matter of the civil rights suit there was plainly a matter of public concern. Further, statutory policy under Title VII prohibits retaliation for the filing of race discrimination claims. Significantly, the defendants in <i>Powell</i> never argued either that the plaintiff's complaints alleging race discrimination were frivolous or that they did not address matters of public concern. <i>See</i> 391 F.3d at 17, 20.</p>\n<p>By contrast here, the matter of the timing or manner by which the PRPD rearmed Rosado raises no constitutional or public policy concerns. And there is no apparent statutory protection against retaliation for the filing of Rosado's lawsuit. Rosado's lawsuit does not involve matters of interest to the public.</p>\n<p>We note there is no absolute First Amendment right to file lawsuits. <i>See </i><i>Bill Johnson's Rests., Inc. v.

The filing of a meritless lawsuit is subject to sanctions, including the award of attorneys' fees. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n<p>We have reviewed the summary judgment papers. Even if we were to assume there was some form of First Amendment interest in protecting the mere filing of Rosado's lawsuit, which did not address a matter of public concern, such an interest is outbalanced by the PRPD's interests. Those interests here include ensuring the emotional stability of officers to whom the Department gives arms, curbing insubordination, and being able to respond to a request from an officer's superiors that he be transferred because of a pattern of repeated disrespect for and refusal to take commands from his supervisors. The decision to transfer, made by the command staff in light of reports it received, outweighs any First Amendment interest in filing a lawsuit the content of which is not, under <i>Connick,</i> protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p>TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Finding that Rosado-Quiñones waived his argument that the First Amendment protects his filing of a lawsuit, the majority affirms the grant of summary judgment to appellees. I cannot agree. Rosado-Quiñones sufficiently developed his argument alleging a violation of his First Amendment right of access to the courts. I would therefore decide the issue that the majority refuses to confront, and would hold that Rosado-Quiñones raised it with sufficient clarity and correctness to survive the appellee's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>First of all, Rosado-Quiñones did not waive the argument that he has a First Amendment right of access to the courts for redress of his grievances. He argued in his original complaint that he was transferred and demoted \"due to the fact that [he] had filed a damage claim.\" This is clearly an argument that the First Amendment protects his right of access to the courts. His argument was in no way perfunctory. Rosado-Quiñones did not \"merely ... mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way.\" <i>United States</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> <i>v.

He cites <i>Button</i> and <i>United Mine Workers of America, Dist. 12 v. Illinois State Bar Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107551\"><a href=\"/opinion/107551/mine-workers-v-illinois-bar-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span>, 222, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107551\"><a href=\"/opinion/107551/mine-workers-v-illinois-bar-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

While I agree with the majority that <i>Button</i> and <i>United Mine Workers</i> also involved other issues, those other issues are not germane to his argument. The majority attempts to cast aside these cases by saying that the cases \"do not carry the weight [Rosado-Quiñones] assigns them.\" Op. at 6. I disagree. That they dealt with other issues does not take away from the fact that they, and we, have held that the First Amendment encompasses the right of access to courts. <i>See </i><i>Fabiano v.

Healthy</i> line of cases is the wrong analytical framework in which to view Rosado-Quiñones's claim. As he made clear in his brief and at oral arguments, those cases dealt with free speech; his claim deals with the First Amendment right to file a lawsuit. This right is distinct from the right to distribute a questionnaire at work, <i>Connick,</i> 461 U.S. at 140-41; the right to comment on a radio station about the substance of a memorandum issued by a public school principal, <i>Mt.

Those claims involved a different kind of First Amendment: right than the one asserted by Rosado-Quiñones. In <i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201350\"><a href=\"/opinion/201350/powell-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2004), we said that the plaintiff's \"filing of his 1991 lawsuit was an exercise of his First Amendment right to petition the government for redress, and that in retaliating against him for the filing of that lawsuit [the City Solicitor] risked violating his right under the Constitution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20. Rosado-Quiñones claims that he was retaliated against for the same reason. \"[O]ur constitutional system gives every citizen the right to seek redress in the courts ... without fear that recourse to the law will make that citizen a target for retaliation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 16 (citation omitted) (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p>Rosado-Quiñones filed a lawsuit because he claimed that he was wronged by a governmental actor. \"`[G]oing to a judicial body for redress of alleged wrongs ... stands apart from other forms of action <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> directed at the alleged wrongdoer.'\" <i>Bill Johnson's Restaurants,</i> 461 U.S. at 741 (citation omitted) (second alteration in original). Were we to require governmental employees to demonstrate that their lawsuits were matters of public concern as a prerequisite to constitutional protection against retaliation for exercising this right, we would be placing an unwarranted and unconstitutional burden on them that is not placed on other citizens, merely by virtue of their status as public employees. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 742 (\"If the Board is allowed to enjoin the prosecution of a well-grounded state lawsuit, it necessarily follows that any state plaintiff subject to such an injunction will be totally deprived of a remedy for an actual injury.\").</p>\n<p>I agree with the majority that the First Amendment does not protect against sham lawsuits. <i>See</i> op. at 7. Indeed, \"[t]he first amendment interests involved in private litigation ... are not advanced when the litigation is based on intentional falsehoods or on knowingly frivolous claims.\" <i>Bill Johnson's Restaurants,</i> 461 U.S. at 743, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110943\"><a href=\"/opinion/110943/bill-johnsons-restaurants-inc-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2161</span></a></span>. The correct legal framework in which to view Rosado-Quiñones's lawsuit is to look at whether his suit has such a reasonable basis. At the summary judgment stage, courts should merely examine whether or not a plaintiff is \"able to present the [court] with evidence that shows his lawsuit raises genuine issues of material fact.\" <i>Id.</i> at 745-46, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110943\"><a href=\"/opinion/110943/bill-johnsons-restaurants-inc-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district did not make either finding below, nor can we reach such a conclusion on the record before us.</p>\n<p>Rosado-Quiñones filed his original lawsuit in the Commonwealth courts on November 17, 2004, and he was transferred and demoted on February 5, 2005. He argues that he was transferred and demoted because he filed a lawsuit against the Superintendent of Police of Puerto Rico and other defendants. His lawsuit is not frivolous on its face, nor is it plainly foreclosed as a matter of law. There is enough temporal proximity between those events that a reasonable jury could determine that Rosado-Quiñones was retaliated against because he filed a lawsuit against the Police Department. <i>See </i><i>Mariani-Colón v. Dep't of Homeland Sec. ex rel.

His allegation that he was retaliated against because he filed a lawsuit against the Police Department presents a genuine issue of material fact that should be decided by a jury. Accordingly, I would reverse the grant of summary judgment and give Rosado-Quiñones his day in court.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The CIC informed Rosado on December 8, 2004 that he would be suspended without pay for fifteen days. On December 20, Rosado objected to the suspension, and the suspension never took place.</p>\n<p>[2]  The January 26 memo also complained that Rosado solved crimes at a lower rate than others and cited an intra-departmental minimum case-resolution rate. Rosado disputes that rate. In our view, this dispute is immaterial.</p>\n\n</div>",
