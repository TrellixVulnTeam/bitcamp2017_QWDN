Espinosa for petitioners.\n     Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\nMark L. Gross and Terri J. Scadron, Attorneys, United States\nDepartment of Justice, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           February 21, 2006\n\f              Per Curiam. Rosa Cerrato and her son, Roberto Cerrato,\n\ncitizens      of   Guatemala,   petition   for    review     of   a   Board    of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") decision denying them withholding of\n\nremoval and asylum.1      We deny the petitions.\n\n              The underlying facts are essentially undisputed.                Rosa\n\nCerrato's uncle, Hugo, was killed in July 1995.              The perpetrators\n\nwere never apprehended and their motive remains unknown.                      Rosa\n\ncontends that another uncle's efforts to investigate the death\n\ncaused approximately five threats to be directed against her\n\nfamily.    In response, Rosa left Guatemala for the United States in\n\n1996, leaving Roberto with her mother.           Roberto ultimately came to\n\nthe United States in 2002, fleeing from gangs that had threatened\n\nhim \"a few times,\" including once at knife point.             He asserts that\n\nthe gangs were after cash sent to him by his mother.                Some of the\n\nCerratos' relatives have moved to other parts of Guatemala over the\n\nyears, but nobody other than Hugo has been harmed.\n\n              The BIA concluded that the Cerratos had failed to show\n\nthat   they    were   persecuted   or   faced     a    likelihood     of   future\n\npersecution if returned to Guatemala.                 The BIA also held that\n\nRoberto had failed to show that the harm that he suffered was\n\nconnected to a protected ground.\n\n\n1\n  In the administrative proceedings, petitioners sought asylum,\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against\nTorture. In their petitions, however, Rosa challenges only the\ndenial of withholding of removal, and Roberto challenges only the\ndenial of asylum.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            An alien can establish eligibility for consideration for\n\nasylum by showing that he has suffered past persecution or that he\n\nhas a \"well-founded\" fear of future persecution if returned to his\n\ncountry of origin.    See Romilus   v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).   In either case, the persecution must be based upon one\n\nof five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, political\n\nopinion, or membership in a particular social group.    Id.    The bar\n\nis higher for withholding of removal, as the alien must show that\n\nit is \"more likely than not\" she will be persecuted on a protected\n\nground if returned to her country of origin.       Id. at 8.    Under\n\neither standard, we will uphold the BIA's determination if it is\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.     Id. at 5.\n\n            Rosa argues that she is entitled to withholding of\n\nremoval because the evidence conclusively demonstrates that she was\n\npersecuted on the basis of her family membership and would face\n\ndeath because of her family membership if returned to Guatemala.\n\nWhile a family can constitute a \"social group\" for purposes of\n\nasylum and withholding of removal, see Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005), Rosa's other contentions fail to\n\npersuade.\n\n            Rosa herself was never physically injured, arrested, or\n\nimprisoned.    Rather, her claim is based upon five threats against\n\nher family, as opposed to her personally.      These threats, while\n\nsurely unsettling, do not amount to \"persecution\" under our case\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\flaw.   See, e.g., Topalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 132-33 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (sporadic arrests and beatings did not constitute\n\n\"persecution\" within meaning of immigration statutes); Bocova v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263-64 (1st Cir. 2005) (similar); Carcamo-\n\nRecinos v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 253, 257-58 (1st Cir. 2004) (threats\n\ndid not amount to persecution). Further, Rosa has supplied the BIA\n\nwith too few specifics about the nature of the threats and why they\n\nwere made.    See Romilus, 385 F.3d at 7 (applicant required to\n\nprovide some evidence of antagonists' motivation).    Finally, Rosa\n\nhas not established that she would suffer harm upon returning to\n\nGuatemala ten years after her original departure.       Along these\n\nlines, we note that her family members have lived there without\n\nbeing harmed in the interim.    See Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d\n\n55, 58-59 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Roberto argues that the BIA erred in concluding that he\n\nfailed to establish a link between the harassment complained of and\n\na protected ground.     Roberto contends that he belongs to the\n\n\"social group\" made up of children that receive money from parents\n\nworking in the United States, and that he was persecuted because of\n\nhis membership in this group. But Roberto never made this argument\n\nto the BIA.   See Ishak v. Gonzales, 422 F.3d 22, 31 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(this court has no jurisdiction to consider a claim that was never\n\npresented to the BIA).     And in any event, the harassment that\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fRoberto experienced does not rise to the level of \"persecution.\"\n\nSee, e.g., Topalli, 417 F.3d at 132-33.\n\n          The petitions are therefore denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
