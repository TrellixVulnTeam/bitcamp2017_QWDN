GIBSON,   Circuit     Judge.   Pedro   Bisbal-Ramos\n\nappeals from the district court's reduction of the compensatory and\n\npunitive damages awarded him by a jury in his suit against the City\n\nof Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, and Roberto Pérez-Colón, the President of\n\nthe   Mayagüez   Municipal      Assembly,     alleging   harassment   and\n\ntermination of employment in violation of his First Amendment\n\nrights.   Bisbal also contends that the district judge who reduced\n\nthe damages should not have done so because he was not the same\n\njudge who presided at trial.     The City1 cross-appeals, arguing that\n\nthere was no evidence to support the jury's finding that any\n\nworkplace harassment was politically motivated or that it resulted\n\nfrom a City policy or custom.       Pérez also cross-appeals, arguing\n\nthat the evidence at trial did not support any award of punitive\n\ndamages and that he was entitled to qualified immunity.         We affirm\n\nthe district court's denial of judgment as a matter of law, but\n\nremand for the district court to determine whether to enter a\n\nremittitur.\n\n          Bisbal is a member of the Popular Democratic Party, or\n\nPDP, and is apparently a fairly prominent and well-connected one.\n\nHis brother was a municipal assemblyman from 1993 up through the\n\n\n\n      1\n      Pérez was also named in his official capacity, and in his\nofficial capacity, he joined the City's cross-appeal. Because a\nclaim against Pérez in his official capacity is essentially a claim\nagainst the City, Gomez v. Rivera Rodríguez, 344 F.3d 103, 120 n.\n12 (1st Cir. 2003), we will name only the City in discussing the\ncross-appeal.\n\n                                   -3-\n\ftime of the trial in this case.          At trial, Pérez, another PDP\n\nmember and the President of the Mayagüez Municipal Assembly, was\n\nable to recount which candidates Bisbal had supported in numerous\n\nelections going back to 1992.\n\n           Bisbal met Pérez at a political event in 1992.          Bisbal\n\nwent to work for the City of Mayagüez in 1993 in the municipal\n\nhousing department.    His position was a \"transitory\" one, but his\n\none-year contract was renewed through 1995. In August 1995, Pérez,\n\nwho was the nominating authority for the Assembly, nominated Bisbal\n\nto work for the Municipal Assembly as \"office administrator.\"         Up\n\nto that time, the job had been performed by another person, María\n\nEugenia Soto Nieto, a permanent employee, but Bisbal joined her.\n\nBisbal's duties included ordering supplies, working on accounting\n\nand   budgeting,   drafting   ordinances   and   resolutions,   recording\n\nassembly proceedings, serving the assembly members coffee, and\n\ndelivering notices of the meetings.        He earned a salary of $1725\n\nper month, which eventually was raised to $1785.         Bisbal's first\n\ntwo employment contracts with the Assembly were for a year each,\n\nand his third contract was for six months.        At the end of 1997, he\n\nreceived a notice that his appointment would terminate at the end\n\nof 1997, but nevertheless, he received a six-month renewal at the\n\nbeginning of 1998.    Beginning in 1999, his renewals came in three-\n\nmonth or one-month increments.      Bisbal stated that the change to\n\nshorter appointments in 1999 was part of a pattern in which\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f\"basically, they just started to withdraw their trust on me and to\n\nsort of move me out of the way and sort of leave me out on the\n\nfringes of the Municipal Assembly.\"\n\n              Bisbal testified that the reason his job changed in 1999\n\nwas that the others in the Assembly office became caught up in a\n\ncampaign for the November 14, 1999 PDP primary.           Bisbal testified\n\nthat the Mayagüez Municipal Assembly virtually became the campaign\n\nheadquarters for Charlie Hernández, a candidate for Representative,\n\nand that all those working for the Assembly quit doing their\n\nofficial duties and devoted themselves to campaign activities.\n\nAll,   that    is,   except   Bisbal,   who   supported   Ferdinand   Lugo,\n\nHernández's rival.       Bisbal was the lone Lugo supporter in the\n\noffice.   Bisbal testified that in this environment, he had nothing\n\nto do at work except some \"small routine things.\"                 He felt\n\n\"completely cast aside.\" Significantly, Pérez supported Hernández.\n\n              Two weeks after the primary, on November 29, 1999, Bisbal\n\nreceived notice that his contract would not be renewed after\n\nDecember 31, 1999.        Pérez made the decision not to renew the\n\ncontract and he signed the notice of termination.          Pérez testified\n\nthat Bisbal was the only employee at the Municipal Assembly whom\n\nPérez knew to be supporting Lugo, and Bisbal was the only employee\n\nwho lost his job at this time.          Bisbal testified that he \"made a\n\nlarge number of efforts to go in and talk to [Pérez],\" but he was\n\nnever allowed in to see him.        The City had budgeted for Bisbal's\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fposition through June 30, 2000.                 Pérez testified, \"From 1995 to\n\n1999 I made a lot of movement to get [Bisbal] another position in\n\nthe Municipal Government of Mayagüez. After the termination of his\n\ncontract in '99 I didn't make anymore.\"\n\n                 Bisbal   sued   the   City,    its    mayor,   and   Pérez    in   his\n\nofficial and individual capacities, alleging violation of his First\n\nAmendment rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                 Specifically, he alleged\n\nthat he had been harassed in the workplace and that his employment\n\nhad been terminated because of his political allegiance to Dr.\n\nMiguel Rodríguez, the opponent of the mayor in the primary.2\n\n                 The defendants moved for summary judgment. The Honorable\n\nJuan       M.    Pérez-Giménez    held   that     there    were   issues      of    fact\n\nprecluding judgment in favor of the City and Pérez, but that Bisbal\n\nhad produced no evidence that the Mayor was involved in any way\n\nwith       the    alleged   harassment     or     termination     of    employment;\n\naccordingly, Judge Pérez-Giménez dismissed the claim against the\n\nMayor.\n\n                 The case against the City and Pérez was tried to a jury\n\nbefore the Honorable Robert J. Ward.                  The jury returned a verdict\n\nagainst the City and Pérez on both the harassment and termination\n\nclaims; it awarded compensatory damages of $60,690 for non-renewal\n\n\n\n       2\n      At trial, Bisbal did not discuss his support of the Mayor's\nopponent, but only the Lugo-Hernández race for Representative.\nThere was no objection, so we consider the complaint amended under\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(b).\n\n                                          -6-\n\fof the employment contract and $250,000 for harassment. It further\n\nawarded   punitive   damages     of   $300,000   against    Pérez    in   his\n\nindividual capacity.3\n\n           The defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law, or\n\nin the alternative, for remittitur or partial new trial, but\n\nattacked only the $250,000 harassment award and the punitive\n\ndamages, not the $60,690 award based on termination of employment.\n\nBefore he could rule on the motion, Judge Ward died.            Judge Pérez-\n\nGiménez ruled the motion in Judge Ward's stead.                 Judge Pérez-\n\nGiménez denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law and the\n\nmotion for new trial, holding that there was sufficient evidence of\n\npolitical persecution and harassment and of deliberate indifference\n\nto   Bisbal's   constitutional    rights.    However,      he   reduced   the\n\nharassment compensatory damages award from $250,000 to $50,000 and\n\nthe punitive damages from $300,000 to $5,000.\n\n           Bisbal did not object in the district court to the\n\nreduction of the damages, but instead immediately took this appeal,\n\ncontending that the district court erred in reducing the damage\n\nawards.    The City cross-appealed, arguing that there was not\n\nsufficient evidence to establish that the motivation for depriving\n\nBisbal of his duties in November 1999 was political retaliation or\n\n\n\n      3\n      Because punitive damages are not available against the\nmunicipality, Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 271\n(1981), the punitive damages were awarded only against Pérez in his\nindividual capacity.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthat the deprivation was the result of a City policy or custom.\n\nPérez also cross-appealed, arguing that there was not sufficient\n\nevidence to support the award of punitive damages against him. The\n\ndefendants do not appeal the verdict against them for termination\n\nof Bisbal's employment.\n\n           We will take up the cross-appeals first, because the\n\ncross-appeals go to the propriety of any award, whereas Bisbal's\n\nappeal concerns the size of award.             If the defendants win their\n\ncross-appeals, there will be no need to consider Bisbal's appeal.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           The City contends that the district court erred in\n\ndenying its motion for judgment as a matter of law since there was\n\nno evidence of political harassment of Bisbal in the workplace in\n\nNovember 1999 and no evidence to establish municipal liability for\n\nharassment.    We review de novo the district court's denial of a\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law.             Borges Colón v. Román-\n\nAbreu,   438   F.3d    1,   14   (1st   Cir.   2006).   In   assessing   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict, we ask\n\nwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict, a rational jury could have found in favor of the party\n\nthat prevailed.       Gillespie v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 386 F.3d 21,\n\n25-26 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                        A.\n\n           In order to show that he suffered cognizable political\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fharassment by a government employer, Bisbal had to prove by clear\n\nand convincing evidence that he was subjected to an unreasonably\n\ninferior work environment.            Ortíz García v. Toledo Fernández, 405\n\nF.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 2005).                  Bisbal must further show by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that his political affiliation was a\n\nsubstantial factor in causing the environment to become inferior.\n\nId.    The City could still avoid liability by proving that it would\n\nhave    acted     the    same   way    regardless      of    Bisbal's     political\n\naffiliation.      Id.\n\n            The    standard      in    this    Circuit      for   the    degree    of\n\nmistreatment that is cognizable in a political discrimination case\n\nwas set by Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209,\n\n1217-20 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc), which held that an employee must\n\nprove by clear and convincing evidence that his or her job had been\n\nrendered \"unreasonably inferior\" to the norm for that position and\n\nthat the change was of a magnitude that would cause \"reasonably\n\nhardy    individuals      to    compromise     their   political        beliefs   and\n\nassociations in favor of the prevailing party.\" Shortly after\n\nAgosto-de-Feliciano was decided, the Supreme Court decided Rutan v.\n\nRepublican Party of Illinois, 497 U.S. 62 (1990), which suggested\n\nin a footnote that even trivial acts of political discrimination by\n\na government employer would give rise to a constitutional claim.\n\nId. at 76 n.8.          Although we have adverted to uncertainty in how\n\nthese two standards fit together, we have continued to apply the\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fAgosto-de-Feliciano standard. Otero v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nIndus. Com'n, 441 F.3d 18, 21-22 & n.4 (1st Cir. 2006); Rosario-\n\nUrdaz v. Velazco, 433 F.3d 174, 178 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006); see\n\nAcosta-Orozco v. Rodríguez-de-Rivera, 132 F.3d 97, 101 n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n          Bisbal's evidence is that, whereas he was busy at work\n\nbefore the primary, once the primary campaign started, he had\n\nnothing to do at work: \"Before that, I always had a lot of work to\n\ndo, and once the primary started, I was completely cast aside.\"\n\nAfter the start of the primary campaign, his work day consisted of\n\nsitting at his desk, punching his time card in, punching out and\n\ndoing \"some small routine things.\"\n\n          The City does not dispute that depriving an employee of\n\nall or almost all his work for an indefinite period can be\n\nsufficient     to    establish    an   \"unreasonably         inferior\"   work\n\nenvironment.        See   Rosario-Urdaz,   433   F.3d   at    179   (\"utterly\n\ndepriving an employee of work indefinitely . . . might make out a\n\nclaim\"); González-Piña v. Rodríguez, 407 F.3d 425, 432 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (holding that such facts were more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence, but reserving the question of whether they established\n\nunreasonably inferior conditions); Rivera-Jiménez v. Pierluisi, 362\n\nF.3d 87, 94-95 (1st Cir. 2004) (denial of benefits and assignments\n\nsufficient to show adverse action). Therefore, we will assume that\n\nthe evidence established an unreasonably inferior work environment.\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f              The City contends that Bisbal did not prove that anyone\n\nintentionally deprived him of duties; instead, the City contends\n\nthat the evidence showed that once the primary campaign began, the\n\nMunicipal Assembly office simply quit doing official work, as all\n\nthe employees but Bisbal were caught up in the political campaign.\n\nWhere   the    plaintiff   is   prominent   in   the   opposition     to   the\n\nprevailing faction in a highly-charged political atmosphere, and is\n\nknown to the defendant to be so, a jury can infer from these facts\n\nplus timing that adverse action is politically motivated. See\n\nPadilla-García v. Guillermo Rodríguez, 212 F.3d 69, 75 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (\"This circumstantial evidence that the appellant was a\n\n'conspicuous target []' could alone create an issue of fact on\n\ndiscriminatory animus.\"); Rodríguez-Rios v. Cordero, 138 F.3d 22,\n\n24 (1st Cir. 1998) (highly-charged atmosphere, conspicuous target,\n\nand reassignment of tasks to members of opponent party); Acevedo-\n\nDíaz v. Aponte, 1 F.3d 62, 69 (1st Cir. 1993).          There was evidence\n\nthat Bisbal was actively supporting Lugo, that he was to some\n\ndegree prominent, and that Bisbal was the only person in his office\n\nthat did support Lugo.     Counsel for the City conceded at trial that\n\nBisbal \"may have been a conspicuous target for discrimination.\"\n\nThe Municipal Assembly office definitely had a highly-charged\n\npolitical     atmosphere   in   November    1999.      The   timing   of   the\n\ndeterioration in Bisbal's working conditions coincided with the\n\nbeginning of the primary campaign. This was sufficient evidence to\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fallow the jury to determine that Bisbal was deprived of duties to\n\nretaliate against his political affiliation.\n\n                                       B.\n\n           The City contends that Bisbal did not show that the City\n\nor Pérez were responsible for the harassment.                    Bisbal did not\n\nattempt to prove that the harassment was the result of an official\n\npolicy.   Bisbal contends that Pérez acted as policymaker for the\n\nCity and that Pérez took away his duties in the month leading up to\n\nthe   primary.    The   City    does    not       dispute   that   Pérez   was    a\n\npolicymaker. However, scrutiny of Bisbal's citations to the record\n\ndoes not reveal any active involvement of Pérez in the harassment.\n\nBisbal's testimony at trial did not identify who was responsible\n\nfor depriving him of his duties.            At first he said, \"[T]hey just\n\nstarted to withdraw their trust on me and to sort of move me out of\n\nthe way and sort of leave me out on the fringes of the Municipal\n\nAssembly.\"   Bisbal never said who \"they\" were.               Bisbal later said,\n\n\"Each and every one of the people who were working there, except\n\nfor me, were backing up Charlie Hernández's candidacy . . . .\"\n\nBisbal did not testify that Pérez witnessed the harassment or that\n\nBisbal informed Pérez of it.       Thus, the jury could not find that\n\nPérez actively instigated the harassment during the work day.\n\n           Even   in   the   absence    of    a    positive    decision    by   the\n\nmunicipality or its policymakers, a municipality may be liable\n\nunder § 1983 where a custom or practice is so \"well-settled and\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fwidespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality can\n\nbe said to have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet\n\ndid nothing to end the practice.\"   Silva v. Worden, 130 F.3d 26, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Bordanaro v. McCleod, 871 F.2d 1151, 1156\n\n(1st Cir. 1989)).   The custom or practice must also be the cause\n\nand moving force behind the deprivation of constitutional rights.\n\nId.   The testimony indicates that Bisbal was virtually without\n\nduties for approximately a month, while the entire assembly office\n\noperated as a de facto campaign headquarters.    Bisbal testified:\n\n      Mr. Roberto Pérez Colón, who was supporting Mr. Charlie\n      Hernández and all assembly members . . . were all\n      favoring Charlie's candidacy, and the atmosphere that you\n      could breathe at the Municipal Assembly was something\n      quite incredible. It was campaigns for Charlie all the\n      time, phone calls for Charlie, activities for Charlie.\n      Basically, that was all that was going on at the\n      Municipal Assembly in Mayagüez.\n\nThe scope, duration, and openness of this transformation of a\n\ngovernment office into a partisan campaign headquarters would allow\n\na jury to have found that Pérez, the President of the Municipal\n\nAssembly and a conceded policymaker, had to have known what was\n\nhappening, yet did nothing to stop it, and that this transformation\n\ncaused Bisbal to be deprived of his duties. We therefore determine\n\nthat Bisbal made a submissible case of municipal liability for the\n\nharassment.\n\n                                II.\n\n           Pérez in his individual capacity contends that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support an award of punitive damages\n\n                                -13-\n\fagainst him.   He specifically does not seek review of the amount of\n\npunitive damages, since he contends that no damages at all should\n\nhave been awarded.        The special verdict form did not specify\n\nwhether the punitive damages were awarded for the termination or\n\nfor the harassment.\n\n            Pérez does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nto support the compensatory award on either the termination or\n\nharassment theory.       The evidence showed that Pérez was directly\n\ninvolved in the termination.          The evidence did not show Pérez'\n\ndirect involvement in the harassment.\n\n     Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 . . . [a]bsent participation in\n     the challenged conduct, a supervisor can be held liable\n     only if (1) the behavior of his subordinates results in\n     a constitutional violation and (2) the supervisor's\n     action or inaction was affirmatively linked to the\n     behavior in the sense that it could be characterized as\n     supervisory encouragement, condonation or acquiescence\n     or gross negligence of the supervisor amounting to\n     deliberate indifference. Deliberate indifference will be\n     found only if it would be manifest to any reasonable\n     official that his conduct was very likely to violate an\n     individual's constitutional rights. The affirmative link\n     requirement contemplates proof that the supervisor's\n     conduct led inexorably to the constitutional violation.\n\nHegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1379-80 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(internal   citations,    quotation    marks   and   punctuation   denoting\n\nalterations omitted).      We have already determined that the scope,\n\nduration, and openness of the transformation of the Municipal\n\nAssembly offices into a campaign headquarters was sufficient to\n\nallow a jury to infer knowledge by Pérez of such conditions and\n\nfailure to correct them, and that this transformation caused the\n\n                                  -14-\n\fviolation of Bisbal's rights.\n\n           We review de novo the district court's ruling as to the\n\nsufficiency   of   the     evidence   to    support    an    award   of   punitive\n\ndamages.   Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 25 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nA jury may be permitted to award punitive damages in a § 1983\n\naction when the defendant's conduct is \"shown to be motivated by\n\nevil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous\n\nindifference to the federally protected rights of others.\"                   Smith\n\nv. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983).              The requirement of \"reckless\n\nindifference\" means that the defendant must act \"'in the face of a\n\nperceived risk that its actions will violate federal law.'\" Borges\n\nColón v. Román-Abreu, 438 F.3d 1, 22 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting\n\nKolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526, 536 (1999)).\n\n           Pérez testified that at the time Bisbal's contract was\n\nnot   renewed      he    knew      that    political        discrimination     was\n\nunconstitutional.        There was evidence from which the jury could\n\nconclude   that    Pérez    made    the    decision    to    terminate    Bisbal's\n\nemployment because of Bisbal's political affiliation and that Pérez\n\ndid so with knowledge that the decision would violate Bisbal's\n\nconstitutional rights. There was also evidence from which the jury\n\ncould have found that Pérez condoned the transformation of the\n\nMunicipal Assembly offices into a campaign headquarters, with\n\nreckless indifference to the foreseeable adverse effect on the\n\nrights of dissenting employees in the office.                The district court\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fdid not err in concluding that the evidence supported an award of\n\npunitive damages.\n\n                                   III.\n\n          Pérez contends that he is entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nPérez does not point out what the district court did wrong, and the\n\nmotion for new trial or judgment as a matter of law does not\n\nmention qualified immunity. Bisbal, however, does not contend that\n\nthe defense was waived.       Even if the defense was not waived, it is\n\nclearly insubstantial in this case.       If indeed the district court\n\ndenied the qualified immunity defense, we review that denial de\n\nnovo, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n\nRodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González, 438 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Wilson v. City of Boston, 421 F.3d 45, 53-54 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n          A public officer is not entitled to qualified immunity if\n\nhe violated a plaintiff's constitutional right and if, at the time\n\nof the violation, the right was so clearly established that it\n\nwould have been clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was\n\nunlawful in the situation he confronted. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.\n\n194, 201-02 (2001).\n\n          The   events   in    question   took   place   in   November   and\n\nDecember 1999. It was clearly established by Branti v. Finkel, 445\n\nU.S. 507, 518-19 (1980), that public officers were not allowed to\n\nfire employees on the basis of political affiliation if such\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\faffiliation was not relevant to the employee's job.                          No one\n\ncontends that Bisbal's job was one for which political affiliation\n\nwas a legitimate qualification.                  It would therefore have been\n\nunreasonable for Pérez to believe it was lawful to terminate\n\nBisbal's employment for political reasons.\n\n            It was also clear after Rutan v. Republican Party of\n\nIllinois, 497 U.S. 62 (1990), and Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-\n\nRoque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1217-20 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc), that\n\nsubjecting an employee to unreasonably inferior working conditions\n\non grounds of political affiliation could also violate the First\n\nAmendment.      Pérez      does     not   dispute    that   deprivation       of   an\n\nemployee's duties for an indefinite time creates an unreasonably\n\ninferior     work    environment.          It     would   therefore    have     been\n\nunreasonable for Pérez to believe that it was lawful to allow the\n\nMunicipal    Assembly      office    to    be    transformed   into    a    campaign\n\nheadquarters,       with   the    attendant       consequences   for       political\n\ndissenters within the office. We therefore can conclude that Pérez\n\nis not entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n            Bisbal contends that it was error for Judge Pérez-Giménez\n\nto rule on the remittitur motion when he was not the judge who\n\npresided over the trial.             Fed. R. Civ. P. 63 provides, \"If a\n\nhearing or trial has been commenced and the judge is unable to\n\nproceed, any other judge may proceed with it upon certifying\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\ffamiliarity with the record and determining that the proceedings in\n\nthe case may be completed without prejudice to the parties.\"\n\nAlthough   the   district     court   file    does    not   reveal   a   separate\n\ncertification    by   Judge    Pérez-Giménez     of    familiarity       with   the\n\nproceedings, he did state in ruling on the new trial and Rule 50\n\nmotion that he had reviewed the record in the case.                  The record\n\nfurther shows that the case was originally before Judge Pérez-\n\nGiménez, who in fact ruled on the summary judgment motion.                 It was\n\ntransferred for trial to Judge Ward, but after Judge Ward's death,\n\nJudge Pérez-Giménez presided over a settlement conference and ruled\n\non the motion for reinstatement.             The record does not reveal any\n\nobjection by Bisbal to Judge Pérez-Giménez ruling on the pending\n\nRule 50 motion, either before or after the ruling.               Therefore, we\n\nwill review the issue only for plain error, see Metropolitan Prop.\n\n& Cas. Ins. Co. v. Shan Trac, Inc., 324 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), and no plain error has been shown.\n\n                                       V.\n\n           Bisbal contends that the district court erred in reducing\n\nthe jury's damages awards.       Before we can even state the standard\n\nof review for Bisbal's appeal, we must face a procedural anomaly.\n\nThe district court did not enter a conventional remittitur, which\n\nrequires giving the plaintiff a choice between accepting a reduced\n\ndamage award and a new trial.               See generally 11 Charles Alan\n\nWright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure, § 2815 at p. 169\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f(2d ed. 1995).     Instead, the district court simply reduced the\n\namount of compensatory and punitive damages. Bisbal cites Kennon v.\n\nGilmer, 131 U.S. 22, 29-30 (1889), arguing that reduction of the\n\ndamages violated his Seventh Amendment rights.\n\n           With regard to compensatory damages, an order entering\n\n\"judgment for a lesser amount than that determined by the jury\n\nwithout allowing petitioner the option of a new trial, cannot be\n\nsquared with the Seventh Amendment.\"          Hetzel v. Prince William\n\nCounty, Virginia, 523 U.S. 208, 211 (1998) (per curiam).                   We\n\ntherefore must reverse the district court's reduction of the\n\ncompensatory damages from $250,000 to $50,000 as legal error.              In\n\nKennon   the   Supreme   Court   remanded   for   the   district   court   to\n\nexercise its discretion in the first instance:\n\n          The erroneous judgment of the supreme court of the\n     territory being reversed, the case will stand as if no\n     such judgment had been entered; and that court will be at\n     liberty, in disposing of the motion for a new trial\n     according to its view of the evidence, either to deny or\n     to grant a new trial generally, or to order judgment for\n     a less sum than the amount of the verdict, conditional\n     upon a remittitur by the plaintiff.\n\n\n131 U.S. at 30.   Accordingly, we will remand for the district court\n\nto decide whether to exercise its discretion to enter a remittitur,\n\ngiving Bisbal the choice of whether to accept the reduced award or\n\nto take a new trial.\n\n           Whether an award of punitive damages is excessive under\n\nthe Due Process Clause is a constitutional question that we review\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fde novo.    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408,\n\n418 (2003); Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532\n\nU.S. 424, 436 (2001).      We have in the past held that we may simply\n\nascertain the amount of punitive award that would be appropriate\n\nand order the district court to enter judgment in such amount.\n\nRowlett v. Anheuser-Busch,Inc., 832 F.2d 194, 207 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\nThis is in accord with the practices of several other circuits that\n\nhave concluded that a court may reduce an excessive award of\n\npunitive damages without giving the plaintiff the option of a new\n\ntrial.     Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. v. Cooper Indus., Inc., 285\n\nF.3d 1146, 1151 (9th Cir. 2002); Ross v. Kansas City Power & Light\n\nCo., 293 F.3d 1041, 1049-50 (8th Cir. 2002); Inter Med. Supplies,\n\nLtd. v. EBI Med. Sys., Inc., 181 F.3d 446, 468 (3d Cir. 1999);\n\nJohansen v. Combustion Engineering, Inc., 170 F.3d 1320, 1330-33\n\n(11th Cir. 1999).\n\n            In order to evaluate the constitutionality of the award,\n\nwe must apply the guideposts prescribed in BMW of N. Am., Inc. v.\n\nGore, 517 U.S. 559, 580-83 (1996), one of which requires us to\n\ncompare    the   amount    of   punitive    damages    to    the   amount     of\n\ncompensatory     damages   awarded.        Campbell,   538    U.S.   at     418;\n\nRodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-González, 438 F.3d 72, 85 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     Because the amount of compensatory damages that will be\n\nawarded is yet unknown, we are not able to conduct the required\n\nreview of the punitive damages award.         Moreover, since Bisbal may\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fopt for a new trial, it would be premature for us to approve a\n\npunitive damages award based on the compensatory award from the\n\nfirst trial.   We therefore must remand the punitive damages award\n\nas well as the compensatory.\n\n           We affirm the district court's denial of the City's\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law and the district court's\n\ndenial of Pérez's motion for judgment as a matter of law as to\n\npunitive   damages   and   qualified   immunity.   We   remand   for   the\n\ndistrict court to decide whether to order a remittitur offering\n\nBisbal the choice between a new trial and a reduced damages award.\n\n     Each party is to bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\f",

Pedro   Bisbal-Ramos\n\nappeals from the district court's reduction of the compensatory and\n\npunitive damages awarded him by a jury in his suit against the City\n\nof Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, and Roberto Pérez-Colón, the President of\n\nthe   Mayagüez   Municipal      Assembly,     alleging   harassment   and\n\ntermination of employment in violation of his First Amendment\n\nrights.   Bisbal also contends that the district judge who reduced\n\nthe damages should not have done so because he was not the same\n\njudge who presided at trial.     The City1 cross-appeals, arguing that\n\nthere was no evidence to support the jury's finding that any\n\nworkplace harassment was politically motivated or that it resulted\n\nfrom a City policy or custom.       Pérez also cross-appeals, arguing\n\nthat the evidence at trial did not support any award of punitive\n\ndamages and that he was entitled to qualified immunity.         We affirm\n\nthe district court's denial of judgment as a matter of law, but\n\nremand for the district court to determine whether to enter a\n\nremittitur.\n\n          Bisbal is a member of the Popular Democratic Party, or\n\nPDP, and is apparently a fairly prominent and well-connected one.\n\nHis brother was a municipal assemblyman from 1993 up through the\n\n\n\n      1\n      Pérez was also named in his official capacity, and in his\nofficial capacity, he joined the City's cross-appeal.

At trial, Pérez, another PDP\n\nmember and the President of the Mayagüez Municipal Assembly, was\n\nable to recount which candidates Bisbal had supported in numerous\n\nelections going back to 1992.\n\n           Bisbal met Pérez at a political event in 1992.          Bisbal\n\nwent to work for the City of Mayagüez in 1993 in the municipal\n\nhousing department.    His position was a \"transitory\" one, but his\n\none-year contract was renewed through 1995. In August 1995, Pérez,\n\nwho was the nominating authority for the Assembly, nominated Bisbal\n\nto work for the Municipal Assembly as \"office administrator.\"         Up\n\nto that time, the job had been performed by another person, María\n\nEugenia Soto Nieto, a permanent employee, but Bisbal joined her.\n\nBisbal's duties included ordering supplies, working on accounting\n\nand   budgeting,   drafting   ordinances   and   resolutions,   recording\n\nassembly proceedings, serving the assembly members coffee, and\n\ndelivering notices of the meetings.        He earned a salary of $1725\n\nper month, which eventually was raised to $1785.         Bisbal's first\n\ntwo employment contracts with the Assembly were for a year each,\n\nand his third contract was for six months.        At the end of 1997, he\n\nreceived a notice that his appointment would terminate at the end\n\nof 1997, but nevertheless, he received a six-month renewal at the\n\nbeginning of 1998.    Beginning in 1999, his renewals came in three-\n\nmonth or one-month increments.      Bisbal stated that the change to\n\nshorter appointments in 1999 was part of a pattern in which\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f\"basically, they just started to withdraw their trust on me and to\n\nsort of move me out of the way and sort of leave me out on the\n\nfringes of the Municipal Assembly.\"\n\n              Bisbal testified that the reason his job changed in 1999\n\nwas that the others in the Assembly office became caught up in a\n\ncampaign for the November 14, 1999 PDP primary.           Bisbal testified\n\nthat the Mayagüez Municipal Assembly virtually became the campaign\n\nheadquarters for Charlie Hernández, a candidate for Representative,\n\nand that all those working for the Assembly quit doing their\n\nofficial duties and devoted themselves to campaign activities.\n\nAll,   that    is,   except   Bisbal,   who   supported   Ferdinand   Lugo,\n\nHernández's rival.       Bisbal was the lone Lugo supporter in the\n\noffice.   Bisbal testified that in this environment, he had nothing\n\nto do at work except some \"small routine things.\"                 He felt\n\n\"completely cast aside.\" Significantly, Pérez supported Hernández.\n\n              Two weeks after the primary, on November 29, 1999, Bisbal\n\nreceived notice that his contract would not be renewed after\n\nDecember 31, 1999.        Pérez made the decision not to renew the\n\ncontract and he signed the notice of termination.          Pérez testified\n\nthat Bisbal was the only employee at the Municipal Assembly whom\n\nPérez knew to be supporting Lugo, and Bisbal was the only employee\n\nwho lost his job at this time.          Bisbal testified that he \"made a\n\nlarge number of efforts to go in and talk to [Pérez],\" but he was\n\nnever allowed in to see him.        The City had budgeted for Bisbal's\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fposition through June 30, 2000.                 Pérez testified, \"From 1995 to\n\n1999 I made a lot of movement to get [Bisbal] another position in\n\nthe Municipal Government of Mayagüez. After the termination of his\n\ncontract in '99 I didn't make anymore.\"\n\n                 Bisbal   sued   the   City,    its    mayor,   and   Pérez    in   his\n\nofficial and individual capacities, alleging violation of his First\n\nAmendment rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.                 Specifically, he alleged\n\nthat he had been harassed in the workplace and that his employment\n\nhad been terminated because of his political allegiance to Dr.\n\nMiguel Rodríguez, the opponent of the mayor in the primary.2\n\n                 The defendants moved for summary judgment. The Honorable\n\nJuan       M.    Pérez-Giménez    held   that     there    were   issues      of    fact\n\nprecluding judgment in favor of the City and Pérez, but that Bisbal\n\nhad produced no evidence that the Mayor was involved in any way\n\nwith       the    alleged   harassment     or     termination     of    employment;\n\naccordingly, Judge Pérez-Giménez dismissed the claim against the\n\nMayor.\n\n                 The case against the City and Pérez was tried to a jury\n\nbefore the Honorable Robert J. Ward.

There was evidence\n\nthat Bisbal was actively supporting Lugo, that he was to some\n\ndegree prominent, and that Bisbal was the only person in his office\n\nthat did support Lugo.     Counsel for the City conceded at trial that\n\nBisbal \"may have been a conspicuous target for discrimination.\"\n\nThe Municipal Assembly office definitely had a highly-charged\n\npolitical     atmosphere   in   November    1999.      The   timing   of   the\n\ndeterioration in Bisbal's working conditions coincided with the\n\nbeginning of the primary campaign.

Bisbal did not\n\nattempt to prove that the harassment was the result of an official\n\npolicy.   Bisbal contends that Pérez acted as policymaker for the\n\nCity and that Pérez took away his duties in the month leading up to\n\nthe   primary.    The   City    does    not       dispute   that   Pérez   was    a\n\npolicymaker. However, scrutiny of Bisbal's citations to the record\n\ndoes not reveal any active involvement of Pérez in the harassment.\n\nBisbal's testimony at trial did not identify who was responsible\n\nfor depriving him of his duties.            At first he said, \"[T]hey just\n\nstarted to withdraw their trust on me and to sort of move me out of\n\nthe way and sort of leave me out on the fringes of the Municipal\n\nAssembly.\"   Bisbal never said who \"they\" were.

The testimony indicates that Bisbal was virtually without\n\nduties for approximately a month, while the entire assembly office\n\noperated as a de facto campaign headquarters.    Bisbal testified:\n\n      Mr. Roberto Pérez Colón, who was supporting Mr. Charlie\n      Hernández and all assembly members . . . were all\n      favoring Charlie's candidacy, and the atmosphere that you\n      could breathe at the Municipal Assembly was something\n      quite incredible. It was campaigns for Charlie all the\n      time, phone calls for Charlie, activities for Charlie.\n      Basically, that was all that was going on at the\n      Municipal Assembly in Mayagüez.\n\nThe scope, duration, and openness of this transformation of a\n\ngovernment office into a partisan campaign headquarters would allow\n\na jury to have found that Pérez, the President of the Municipal\n\nAssembly and a conceded policymaker, had to have known what was\n\nhappening, yet did nothing to stop it, and that this transformation\n\ncaused Bisbal to be deprived of his duties. We therefore determine\n\nthat Bisbal made a submissible case of municipal liability for the\n\nharassment.\n\n                                II.\n\n           Pérez in his individual capacity contends that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence to support an award of punitive damages\n\n                                -13-\n\fagainst him.   He specifically does not seek review of the amount of\n\npunitive damages, since he contends that no damages at all should\n\nhave been awarded.        The special verdict form did not specify\n\nwhether the punitive damages were awarded for the termination or\n\nfor the harassment.\n\n            Pérez does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nto support the compensatory award on either the termination or\n\nharassment theory.       The evidence showed that Pérez was directly\n\ninvolved in the termination.          The evidence did not show Pérez'\n\ndirect involvement in the harassment.\n\n     Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 . . .

Deliberate indifference will be\n     found only if it would be manifest to any reasonable\n     official that his conduct was very likely to violate an\n     individual's constitutional rights.

No one\n\ncontends that Bisbal's job was one for which political affiliation\n\nwas a legitimate qualification.                  It would therefore have been\n\nunreasonable for Pérez to believe it was lawful to terminate\n\nBisbal's employment for political reasons.\n\n            It was also clear after Rutan v.

Pérez      does     not   dispute    that   deprivation       of   an\n\nemployee's duties for an indefinite time creates an unreasonably\n\ninferior     work    environment.          It     would   therefore    have     been\n\nunreasonable for Pérez to believe that it was lawful to allow the\n\nMunicipal    Assembly      office    to    be    transformed   into    a    campaign\n\nheadquarters,       with   the    attendant       consequences   for       political\n\ndissenters within the office. We therefore can conclude that Pérez\n\nis not entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n            Bisbal contends that it was error for Judge Pérez-Giménez\n\nto rule on the remittitur motion when he was not the judge who\n\npresided over the trial.             Fed. R. Civ. P. 63 provides, \"If a\n\nhearing or trial has been commenced and the judge is unable to\n\nproceed, any other judge may proceed with it upon certifying\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\ffamiliarity with the record and determining that the proceedings in\n\nthe case may be completed without prejudice to the parties.\"\n\nAlthough   the   district     court   file    does    not   reveal   a   separate\n\ncertification    by   Judge    Pérez-Giménez     of    familiarity       with   the\n\nproceedings, he did state in ruling on the new trial and Rule 50\n\nmotion that he had reviewed the record in the case.                  The record\n\nfurther shows that the case was originally before Judge Pérez-\n\nGiménez, who in fact ruled on the summary judgment motion.                 It was\n\ntransferred for trial to Judge Ward, but after Judge Ward's death,\n\nJudge Pérez-Giménez presided over a settlement conference and ruled\n\non the motion for reinstatement.             The record does not reveal any\n\nobjection by Bisbal to Judge Pérez-Giménez ruling on the pending\n\nRule 50 motion, either before or after the ruling.               Therefore, we\n\nwill review the issue only for plain error, see Metropolitan Prop.\n\n& Cas. Ins. Co. v.

Before we can even state the standard\n\nof review for Bisbal's appeal, we must face a procedural anomaly.\n\nThe district court did not enter a conventional remittitur, which\n\nrequires giving the plaintiff a choice between accepting a reduced\n\ndamage award and a new trial.               See generally 11 Charles Alan\n\nWright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure, § 2815 at p. 169\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f(2d ed. 1995).     Instead, the district court simply reduced the\n\namount of compensatory and punitive damages.

We\n\ntherefore must reverse the district court's reduction of the\n\ncompensatory damages from $250,000 to $50,000 as legal error.              In\n\nKennon   the   Supreme   Court   remanded   for   the   district   court   to\n\nexercise its discretion in the first instance:\n\n          The erroneous judgment of the supreme court of the\n     territory being reversed, the case will stand as if no\n     such judgment had been entered; and that court will be at\n     liberty, in disposing of the motion for a new trial\n     according to its view of the evidence, either to deny or\n     to grant a new trial generally, or to order judgment for\n     a less sum than the amount of the verdict, conditional\n     upon a remittitur by the plaintiff.\n\n\n131 U.S. at 30.   Accordingly, we will remand for the district court\n\nto decide whether to exercise its discretion to enter a remittitur,\n\ngiving Bisbal the choice of whether to accept the reduced award or\n\nto take a new trial.\n\n           Whether an award of punitive damages is excessive under\n\nthe Due Process Clause is a constitutional question that we review\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fde novo.
