John A. Woodcock, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Matthew S. Erickson with whom Smith Law Offices, P.A., was on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          June 27, 2006\n\f     COFFIN,    Senior   Circuit   Judge.   Appellant,   a   felon,    was\n\nprosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) for possession of firearms\n\nseized in his residence.      Convicted after a jury trial, and the\n\ndistrict court having found that his criminal record included\n\nconvictions for three violent felonies, he was sentenced to a term\n\nof 188 months under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 924(e)(1), which sets a mandatory minimum term of fifteen years.\n\n     Appellant asserts two trial errors: exclusion of the cross-\n\nexamination of government witnesses and refusal to give requested\n\njury instructions on an affirmative defense.     He also challenges a\n\nsentencing ruling that one of his prior convictions – possession of\n\nan unregistered sawed-off shotgun – was a \"violent felony.\"           This\n\nappeal follows a vigorously tried and briefed case and thoughtful\n\nconsideration of the issues by the district court.            Our brief\n\ndisposition does not belittle the gravity of appellant's concerns,\n\nbut signifies that the case needs no further legal analysis before\n\nclosure.\n\n     Appellant's major effort has been directed to the sentencing\n\nissue.     The district court felt bound by our decision in United\n\nStates v. Fortes, 141 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1998), where we flatly\n\nheld that \"possession of a sawed-off shotgun is a 'violent felony'\n\nwithin the meaning of ACCA.\"        The district court took note of\n\nappellant's arguments urging the overruling of Fortes, but properly\n\nalso noted that it was bound to it as the law of the circuit.\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f     Appellant's main brief closed with the request that the\n\njudgment be vacated and the case remanded for a new trial.                    In his\n\nreply brief, he substituted the request that Fortes be reviewed by\n\nthe court en banc and overruled.           We find ourselves, as a panel, in\n\nthe same position as the district court; absent \"supervening\n\nauthority     sufficient       to   warrant       disregard       of   established\n\nprecedent,\" we, too, are bound to follow Fortes.                          Lattab v.\n\nAshcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 2004); see also United States\n\nv. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n     We   add,   to    avoid   being   misinterpreted,        that     we   feel   no\n\ncompulsion to initiate any en banc reconsideration of Fortes.\n\nContrary to appellant's assertion, we see no implicit inconsistency\n\nwith our prior ruling in United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).      In Doe we gave weight to a United State Sentencing\n\nCommission    commentary       amendment     to   the    effect    that     unlawful\n\npossession of an ordinary or generic firearm, without more, did not\n\nmeet the pertinent definition of a violent felony: a crime that\n\n“involves    conduct    that    presents     a    serious   potential       risk   of\n\nphysical injury to another.\"        Id. at 225.         In Fortes we gave weight\n\nto the fact that the Sentencing Commission had not issued a similar\n\namendment covering such specialized weapons as silencers, machine\n\nguns, or sawed-off shotguns, particularly identified in 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 5845(a), unregistered possession of which is barred by 26 U.S.C.\n\n§ 5861(d).\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f       Our position has since been reinforced by the Sentencing\n\nCommission.         In 2004, it again amended its commentary – this time\n\nto address the specialized weapons – and explicitly “expand[ed] the\n\ndefinition of ‘crime of violence’ . . . to include unlawful\n\npossession of any firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a).”                        U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines Manual app. C supp., amend. 674, at 134\n\n(2004).          The rationale for the change tracked our discussion in\n\nFortes, where we deemed the difference between possession of a\n\ngeneric \"firearm\" and a weapon \"singled-out for particularized\n\ntreatment\"         to   be   \"very     substantial.\"       141   F.3d    at    7.   The\n\nCommission noted that “Congress has determined that those firearms\n\ndescribed in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) are inherently dangerous and when\n\npossessed unlawfully, serve only violent purposes.”                       We made the\n\nsame observation in Fortes, citing United States v. Dunn, 946 F.2d\n\n615,       621   (9th   Cir.    1991),    for   the    proposition      that   unlawful\n\npossession         of   §    5845(a)    firearms      involves   a   conjunction     of\n\ndisregard for law and the risk of use and injury.1\n\n       The Commission also noted that a number of courts endorsed\n\nthis view, and we have identified at least six circuits in addition\n\n\n       1\n       Although the definitions of “violent felony” in the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B), and “crime of\nviolence” in the Sentencing Guidelines are not identical, see U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 4B1.2, 4B1.4, comment. (n.1), the\n“serious potential risk of physical injury to another” language is\nthe same in both and “courts have ‘look[ed] generally to cases\npertaining to either provision “to elucidate the nature of the\ncategorical inquiry,”’” United States v. Santos, 363 F.3d 19, 22\nn.5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                            -4-\n\fto ourselves and the Ninth Circuit: United States v. Owens, 447\n\nF.3d 1345, 1346-47 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam); United States v.\n\nSerna, 309 F.3d 859, 863-64 (5th Cir. 2002); United States v.\n\nJohnson, 246 F.3d 330, 334-35 (4th Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nDwyer, 245 F. 3d 1168, 1172 (10th Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nBrazeau, 237 F.3d 842, 844-45 (7th Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nAllegree, 175 F.3d   648, 651 (8th Cir. 1999).\n\n     Finally, appellant argues that the ground rules governing the\n\ndetermination of a prior conviction of a violent felony have\n\ndramatically changed.     In Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575,\n\n602 (1990), the Court, referring to the same felon-in-possession\n\nenhancement   provision   at   issue   here,   stated,   \"[I]t   generally\n\nrequires the trial court to look only to the fact of conviction and\n\nthe statutory definition of the prior offense.\"           Now, appellant\n\ninvokes the renewed emphasis on juries in such post-Taylor cases\n\nas Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005); United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005); and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S.\n\n466 (2000), and claims that a jury must consider the particulars of\n\nthe possession of a sawed-off shotgun – for example, whether such\n\nweapon was found in working order in close proximity or broken in\n\nan inaccessible location – to determine if they constituted \"a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n\n     In addition to other reasons why such cases are inapt, we\n\nagree with the Tenth Circuit's holding in United States v. Moore,\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f401 F.3d 1220, 1225 (10th Cir. 2005), that they have not changed\n\nthe     proposition    that        \"determining    whether      a   given     felony\n\nconstitutes a 'violent felony' is a question of law and not fact .\n\n. .\" and thus a matter for the court and not a jury.                        See also\n\nUnited States v. Santos, 363 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2004) (whether\n\na prior conviction qualifies as a “crime of violence” for purposes\n\nof the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines “is\n\na question of law that we review de novo”); cf. Aguiar v. Gonzales,\n\n438 F.3d 86, 88 (1st Cir. 2006) (whether an offense constitutes a\n\n“crime of violence” under 18 U.S.C. § 16, thus qualifying as an\n\n“aggravated felony” for immigration purposes, is a question of\n\nlaw).\n\n      The two trial errors asserted may be readily resolved.                     The\n\nlimitation of cross-examination of, principally, one government\n\nwitness was clearly a call within the trial court's discretion.\n\nThe hoped for benefit to defendant was that a witness who had\n\nimplicated him in possessing weapons had, on another occasion,\n\nfalsely accused him of rape. This is but minimally argued, without\n\ncitations.      In    any     event,    the    likelihood      of   diversion    and\n\nprejudice,    see     Fed.    R.    Evid.   403,   and   the    unlikelihood      of\n\nappellant's ability to counter any denial by the witness, see Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 608(b), amply supported the exclusion.\n\n      After   concluding      that     appellant   had   not    produced      enough\n\nevidence to support his affirmative defense of necessity, the court\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\frefused to give a requested instruction.   This issue, however, is\n\nforfeited, for appellant failed to renew his request after the\n\ncourt had delivered its instructions, and there was unquestionably\n\nno plain error.   See United States v. Mendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d 1,\n\n4 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

Erickson with whom Smith Law Offices, P.A., was on brief for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BOUDIN, Chief Judge, COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge, and SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, a felon, was prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) for possession of firearms seized in his residence. Convicted after a jury trial, and the district court having found that his criminal record included convictions for three violent felonies, he was sentenced to a term of 188 months under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), which sets a mandatory minimum term of fifteen years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant asserts two trial errors: exclusion of the cross-examination of government witnesses and refusal to give requested jury instructions on an affirmative defense. He also challenges a sentencing ruling that one of his prior convictions&#8212; possession of an unregistered sawed-off shotgun&#8212;was a \"violent felony.\" This appeal follows a vigorously tried and briefed case and thoughtful consideration of the issues by the district court. Our brief disposition does not belittle the gravity of appellant's concerns, but signifies that the case needs no further legal analysis before closure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's major effort has been directed to the sentencing issue. The district court felt bound by our decision in <i>United States v. Fortes,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1998), where we flatly held that \"possession of a sawed-off shotgun is a `violent felony' within the meaning of ACCA.\" The district court took note of appellant's arguments urging the overruling of <i>Fortes,</i> but properly also noted that it was bound to it as the law of the circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's main brief closed with the request that the judgment be vacated and the case remanded for a new trial. In his reply brief, he substituted the request that <i>Fortes</i> be reviewed by the court <i>en banc</i> and overruled. We find ourselves, as a panel, in the same position as the district court; absent \"supervening authority sufficient to warrant disregard of established precedent,\" we, too, are bound to follow <i>Fortes. Lattab v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201243\"><a href=\"/opinion/201243/lattab-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also United States v. Wogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1449 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, to avoid being misinterpreted, that we feel no compulsion to initiate any <i>en banc</i> reconsideration of <i>Fortes.</i> Contrary to appellant's assertion, we see no implicit inconsistency with our prior ruling in <i>United States v. Doe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580696\"><a href=\"/opinion/580696/united-states-v-arthur-l-doe-aka-butchy/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992). In <i>Doe</i> we gave weight to a United State Sentencing Commission commentary amendment to the effect that unlawful possession of an ordinary or generic firearm, without more, did not meet the pertinent definition of a violent felony: a crime that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Id.</i> at 225. In <i>Fortes</i> we gave weight to the fact that the Sentencing Commission had not issued a similar amendment covering such specialized weapons as silencers, machine guns, or sawed-off shotguns, particularly identified in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a), unregistered possession of which is barred by 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our position has since been reinforced by the Sentencing Commission. In 2004, it again amended its commentary&#8212;this time to address the specialized weapons&#8212; and explicitly \"expand[ed] the definition of `crime of violence' . . . to include unlawful possession of any firearm described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a).\" U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C supp., amend. 674, at 134 (2004). The rationale for the change tracked our discussion in <i>Fortes,</i> where we deemed the difference between possession of a generic \"firearm\" and a weapon \"singled-out for particularized treatment\" to be \"very substantial.\" 141 F.3d at 7. The Commission noted that \"Congress has determined that those firearms described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a) are inherently dangerous and when possessed unlawfully, serve only violent purposes.\" We made the same observation in <i>Fortes,</i> citing <i>United States v. Dunn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569364\"><a href=\"/opinion/569364/united-states-v-jody-james-dunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span>, 621 (9th Cir.1991), for the proposition that unlawful possession of &#167; 5845(a) fire-arms involves a conjunction of disregard for law and the risk of use and injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commission also noted that a number of courts endorsed this view, and we have identified at least six circuits in addition to ourselves and the Ninth Circuit: <i>United States v. Owens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77332\"><a href=\"/opinion/77332/united-states-v-charles-david-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1345</span></a></span>, 1346-47 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Serna,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"28984\"><a href=\"/opinion/28984/united-states-v-serna/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span>, 863-64 (5th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772810\"><a href=\"/opinion/772810/united-states-v-elliot-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 334-35 (4th Cir.2001); <i>United States v.

Brazeau,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771761\"><a href=\"/opinion/771761/united-states-v-warren-j-brazeau/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></a></span>, 844-45 (7th Cir. 2001); <i>United States v. Allegree,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763620\"><a href=\"/opinion/763620/united-states-v-robert-christopher-allegree-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span>, 651 (8th Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant argues that the ground rules governing the determination of a prior conviction of a violent felony have dramatically changed. In <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 602, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span> (1990), the Court, referring to the same felon-in-possession enhancement provision at issue here, stated, \"[I]t generally requires the trial court to look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\" Now, appellant invokes the renewed emphasis on juries in such post-<i>Taylor</i> cases as <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span> (2005); <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005); and <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000), and claims that a jury must consider the particulars of the possession of a sawed-off shotgun&#8212;for example, whether such weapon was found in working order in close proximity or broken in an inaccessible location&#8212;to determine if they constituted \"a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to other reasons why such cases are inapt, we agree with the Tenth Circuit's holding in <i>United States v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165648\"><a href=\"/opinion/165648/united-states-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span>, 1225 (10th Cir. 2005), that they have not changed the proposition that \"determining whether a given felony constitutes a `violent felony' is a question of law and not fact . . .\" and thus a matter for the court and not a jury. <i>See also United States v. Santos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200939\"><a href=\"/opinion/200939/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.2004) (whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines \"is a question of law that we review <i>de novo</i>\"); <i>cf. Aguiar v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793346\"><a href=\"/opinion/793346/pedro-aguiar-v-alberto-r-gonzales-united-states-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir. 2006) (whether an offense constitutes a \"crime of violence\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16, thus qualifying as an \"aggravated felony\" for immigration purposes, is a question of law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two trial errors asserted may be readily resolved. The limitation of cross-examination of, principally, one government witness was clearly a call within the trial court's discretion. The hoped for benefit to defendant was that a witness who had implicated him in possessing weapons had, on another occasion, falsely accused him of rape. This is but minimally argued, without citations. In any event, the likelihood of diversion and prejudice, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403, and the unlikelihood of appellant's ability to counter any denial by the witness, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Evid. 608(b), amply supported the exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After concluding that appellant had not produced enough evidence to support his affirmative defense of necessity, the court refused to give a requested instruction. This issue, however, is forfeited, for appellant failed to renew his request after the court had delivered its instructions, and there was unquestionably no plain error. <i>See United States v. Mendoza-Acevedo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572650\"><a href=\"/opinion/572650/united-states-v-edilberto-mendoza-acevedo/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the definitions of \"violent felony\" in the Armed Career Criminal Act,<i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B), and \"crime of violence\" in the Sentencing Guidelines are not identical, <i>see</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual &#167;&#167; 4B1.2, 4B1.4, comment.
