Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                  Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                 and Shadur,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n    Rick Nemcik-Cruz, for appellant.\n\n     Maritza Torres-Rivera, with Adrián Mercado on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 14, 2003\n\n\n\n\n    *\n        Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.\n\f           SHADUR,   Senior    District    Judge.   Raymond   Leon,   Carmen\n\nPantojas-Maldonado,    their    marital     partnership   and   their    son\n\nRaymanuelle      Leon-Pantojas            (\"Raymanuelle\")(collectively\n\n\"Plaintiffs\") appeal from the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendant Municipality of San Juan1\n\n(\"Municipality\" or \"San Juan\") in this diversity of citizenship\n\naction.   Plaintiffs contend (1) that the Municipal Hospital of the\n\nCity of San Juan was negligent and in breach of its statutory\n\nduties when it failed to screen Raymanuelle for phenylketonuria\n\n(\"PKU\") as an infant and (2) that all necessary preconditions for\n\nthis lawsuit have been met.\n\n           After reviewing the parties' submissions on San Juan's\n\nmotion for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. (\"Rule\") 56, the\n\ndistrict court granted that motion because Plaintiffs had failed to\n\nnotify San Juan within 90 days of learning of the damages claimed\n\nas required by Article 15.003 of the Autonomous Municipalities Act\n\nof the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"Municipal Notice Statute\").\n\nWe reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor\n\nof San Juan and remand this case for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       All other defendants that remained in the case, physicians\nwho had treated Raymanuelle in Puerto Rico at some point in time,\ntheir spouses and their marital partnerships, were voluntarily\ndismissed without prejudice to allow this appeal to go forward.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f                        Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n             Although the parties failed to note the less-than-precise\n\nnature of the pleadings as to the establishment of the required\n\ndiversity of citizenship, we of course have the obligation to\n\nconsider such subject matter jurisdictional issues sua sponte.              We\n\nhave done so, and as the brief ensuing discussion reflects, we have\n\nconfirmed that jurisdiction exists.\n\n             Plaintiffs'    Second     Amended    Complaint      (\"Complaint\")\n\nalleges that they are \"residents\" of Florida.              Because 28 U.S.C.\n\n§1332 (\"Section 1332\") vests federal courts with jurisdiction over\n\ncases involving \"citizens\" of different states who meet the amount\n\nin controversy requirement (an element clearly satisfied here),\n\nPlaintiffs'        terminology   is   both     imprecise   and     technically\n\nincorrect. In this Circuit, however, the failure to use the term\n\n\"citizen\"     or    \"domiciliary\"     rather   than   \"resident\"     does   not\n\nnecessarily preclude diversity jurisdiction (see Cantellops v.\n\nAlvaro-Chapel, 234 F.3d 741, 742-43 (1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n             Here the record contains evidence that at the time of\n\nsuit Plaintiffs were not only residents of Florida but were also\n\ndomiciled there, intending to remain indefinitely as required under\n\nSection 1332.       Plaintiffs relocated to Florida in part to secure\n\nbetter medical treatment for Raymanuelle, who will likely need long\n\nterm care.    At the time the Complaint was filed, they had lived for\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthree years   in   Florida,   where    both    parents     are   employed   and\n\nRaymanuelle is enrolled in the elementary school system.\n\n           Despite the deficient terminology in their pleading,\n\nthen, Plaintiffs' residence plainly coincides with their state of\n\ncitizenship, so that Section 1332's diversity jurisdiction was\n\nproperly invoked.     We therefore turn to the merits.\n\n                           Standard of Review\n\n           We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying\n\nthe same standard as did the district court (Carroll v. Xerox\n\nCorp., 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir. 2002)).                 Under Rule 56(c)\n\nsummary    judgment   is   appropriate        only   \"if    the    pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"            Familiar Rule 56 principles\n\nimpose on San Juan as movant the initial burden of establishing the\n\nlack of a genuine issue of material fact (Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n\n477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986)).         On appellate review we, like the\n\ndistrict court, are required to draw all reasonable inferences in\n\nthe light most favorable to nonmovant Plaintiffs (Carroll, 294 F.3d\n\nat 237).\n\n                                 Facts\n\n           Raymanuelle was born on August 25, 1988 in the Municipal\n\nHospital of the City of San Juan (\"Hospital\"), a facility operated\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fby San Juan.   Blood samples taken from Raymanuelle were tested for\n\ncertain diseases, but it is uncontested that he was not screened\n\nfor PKU at that time. Raymanuelle's mother was discharged from the\n\nHospital on August 26, 1988, and the newborn was discharged the\n\nfollowing day.\n\n            Early in Raymanuelle's life his parents noticed problems\n\nwith their son's development, and they sought medical treatment for\n\nhim from numerous doctors and clinics. In 1996 Plaintiffs moved to\n\nTampa,    Florida,    in   large   part   to   obtain   better   medical   and\n\nrehabilitative care for their son.             Tampa Dr. Terry DeClue first\n\ndiagnosed Raymanuelle's condition as classic PKU on July 30, 1998,\n\nand he notified the parents of that diagnosis in an August 5, 1998\n\nletter.\n\n            Until that time Raymanuelle's parents had believed that\n\ntheir son had been properly screened by the hospital at the time of\n\nhis birth.     But in light of the PKU diagnosis, Dr. DeClue then\n\nbegan efforts to obtain Raymanuelle's medical records from Puerto\n\nRico.    Based on his review of those records, the Plaintiff parents\n\nfirst learned that the Hospital had not screened Raymanuelle for\n\nPKU.\n\n            According to the Complaint, PKU is a metabolic disease\n\nthat results in mental retardation and other neurological problems\n\nwhen treatment is not initiated within the first few weeks of an\n\ninfant's life.       On July 2, 1987 Puerto Rico enacted a statute that\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\frequired the creation and adoption of regulations to implement\n\nmandatory genetic screening for all Puerto Rico newborns (24 P.R.\n\nLaws     Ann.    §§3152-3155).       In     October   1988,    shortly     after\n\nRaymanuelle's birth, regulations pursuant to that statute were\n\napproved that required all hospitals in Puerto Rico to screen\n\nnewborn infants for PKU.\n\n               In their original Complaint filed on August 4, 1999,\n\nPlaintiffs sued the Hospital as well as the physicians who treated\n\nRaymanuelle in Puerto Rico for negligently failing to screen for\n\nand diagnose Raymanuelle's PKU.             Plaintiffs allege that because\n\nRaymanuelle's condition went undiagnosed and untreated for years,\n\nhe suffered irreversible neurological damage and severe mental\n\nretardation, as a result of which he will require lifelong care.\n\nNotice    of    the   original   Complaint    was   served    on   San   Juan   on\n\nAugust 13, 1999.\n\n               San Juan later filed a Rule 56 motion, arguing (1) that\n\nAppellants had failed to notify the Municipality within 90 days of\n\nlearning of the damages claimed as required by the Municipal Notice\n\nStatute (21 P.L.R.A. §4703), (2) that the action was time-barred\n\nand (3) that there was no duty to screen Raymanuelle for PKU at the\n\ntime of his birth in August 1988.            On August 6, 2001 the District\n\nCourt granted San Juan's motion on the first ground and dismissed\n\nthe action.       This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f                     Municipal Notice Statute\n\n          This action concerns the application of Puerto Rico's\n\nMunicipal Notice Statute (21 P.R. Laws Ann. §4703):\n\n          Any person who has a claim of any kind against a\n     municipality for personal or property damages due to the\n     fault or negligence of the municipality shall so notify\n     the Mayor, in writing, stating clearly and concisely the\n     date, place, cause and general nature of the damages\n     suffered. Said notification shall also specify the amount\n     of monetary compensation or the kind of relief\n     appropriate for the damages suffered, the names and\n     addresses of his/her witnesses, the claimant's address\n     and, in cases of personal damages, the place where\n     medical treatment was first received.\n\n                       *         *        *\n\n          If the injured party is a minor or a ward, the\n     person exercising patria potestas or the custody of the\n     minor, or the guardian, as the case may be, shall be\n     obliged to notify the Mayor of the claim within ninety\n     (90) days of the date on which he/she learned of the\n     damages claimed. The above shall not be an obstacle to\n     the minor or ward's making said notification on their own\n     initiative within the specified term, if the person\n     exercising patria potestas, or custody or guardianship\n     fails to do so.\n\n                 (b) Jurisdictional requirement.-- No legal\n          action of any kind shall be initiated against a\n          municipality for damages due to negligence unless\n          written notification is made in the form, manner\n          and terms provided in this subtitle.\n\nInterpreting that statute, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has\n\nheld, most recently in Mendez Pabon v. Mendez Martinez, 2000 TSPR\n\n119 (2000), that the notice requirement, while not jurisdictional\n\nin nature, is a \"condition precedent requiring strict compliance\"\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f(J.S.T. at 222; see also Passalacqua v. Municipality of San Juan,\n\n116 P.R.R. 756, 766 (1985), quoting Mangual v. Superior Court, 88\n\nP.R.R. 475, 483 (1963)).\n\n          But   that   condition   has   not   been   applied   inexorably\n\n(Mendez Pabon, J.S.T. at 22).      Instead the Supreme Court of Puerto\n\nRico has \"allowed the flexible application\" of the Municipal Notice\n\nStatute in light of the purposes and objectives of the statute3\n\n(id.).   Lopez v. Puerto Rico Highway Auth., 133 P.R. Dec. 243\n\n(1993) explained that some claimants have been exempted from the\n\nnotification requirement \"because under the circumstances of each\n\none of those cases the legislative scheme was devoid of vitality;\n\nbecause in them the purposes and objectives of the requirement\n\ncould not be achieved; because legally, there was no raison d'etre\n\n\n     2\n       All \"J.S.T.\" references are to pages of the parties' joint\nstipulated translations of some of the decisions of the Supreme\nCourt of Puerto Rico cited in this opinion (see n.4).\n     3\n        Mendez Pabon, J.S.T. at 21-22 repeated those purposes and\nobjectives as explained in Mangual:\n\n          1) to provide the political bodies an opportunity to\n     investigate the facts which give rise to the claim;\n          2) to discourage unfounded claims;\n          3) to facilitate a prompt settlement;\n          4) to permit immediate inspection of the scene of the\n     accident before conditions change;\n          5) to discover the names of witnesses and interview them\n     while their recollections of the events is trustworthy;\n          6) to notify the municipal authorities of a pending legal\n     action so that the necessary financial reserves are provided\n     in the annual budget; and\n          7) to minimize the amount of damages sustained through\n     prompt intervention offering medical treatment and the\n     provision of medical facilities to the injured party.\n\n                                   -8-\n\ffor applying the requirement to such circumstances since said\n\nrequirement was not established for them\" (J.S.T. at 8).                  But\n\nLopez, id. outlined the congeries of circumstances that would\n\nmandate strict compliance with the requirement: (1) an extra-\n\ncontractual claim for damages (2) based on the municipality's\n\nalleged fault or negligence, (3) initiated by claimant (4) directly\n\nagainst the municipality (5) \"in which the municipality has no\n\nmeans to know the essential details of the damage based upon which\n\nthe claim is filed without some adequate notice by the claimant.\"4\n\n           Where the government entity does have its own means to\n\nknow of the damage suffered by a claimant without outside notice,\n\nhowever,   the   Puerto   Rico    Supreme   Court   has   taught   that   the\n\nstatutory notice is unnecessary--essentially that the fifth factor\n\nlater identified in Lopez is not present (Melendez Gutierrez v.\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, 13 P.R. Offic. Trans. 1046 (1983)).\n\nFor that reason Melendez, id. at 1049 reversed the lower court's\n\ndismissal of a claim that alleged medical negligence on the part of\n\na Commonwealth hospital.         That dismissal had been predicated on\n\nPlaintiffs' non-compliance with Article 2A of the Law of Claims and\n\nSuits against the State (\"Commonwealth Notice Statute,\" 32 P.R.\n\n     4\n       Because the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has yet to release\nan official translation of Lopez, the text here quotes the version\nprovided by the parties on appeal as a stipulated translation in\ncompliance with our Circuit Rule 30(d). Plaintiffs argue that the\ndistrict court relied on an erroneous translation of the fifth\nelement in Lopez. As discussed later in the text, however, the\nresult we reach hereafter does not require us to confront that\nissue.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fLaws Ann. §3077a), a provision directly analogous to the Municipal\n\nNotice Statute.     Because it found that the operative events had\n\nbeen thoroughly documented in the records kept by the hospital,\n\nMelendez, id. at 1049 held:\n\n          [I]n cases such as the one at bar -- where the\n          risk of the objective evidence's disappearance\n          is minimal, where there is effective proof of\n          the identity of the witnesses, and where the\n          State may easily investigate and corroborate\n          the facts alleged in the complaint filed --the\n          cited § 3077a is not strictly applicable\n          inasmuch as the objective sought by the\n          application therefor has no raison d'être.\n\n               Although   Plaintiffs      have    understandably   stressed\n\nMelendez both in their district court opposition to San Juan's Rule\n\n56 motion and then again before us, San Juan has simply ignored\n\nthat decision in all of its court submissions.            Instead San Juan\n\nhas approached this litigation as though the Municipal Notice\n\nStatute must be viewed as a no-exception requirement.\n\n          That, however, is a basic misconception.             To be sure,\n\nMelendez dealt with the application of the Commonwealth Notice\n\nStatute rather than the Municipal Notice Statute.           But because of\n\nthe   common    source,   the   nearly    identical     language   and   the\n\nintertwined history of the two statutes, the Supreme Court of\n\nPuerto Rico has consistently interpreted them in tandem (see, e.g.,\n\nPassalacqua, 116 P.R.R. at 763-64).              Indeed, the recent Mendez\n\nPabon decision expressly cited Melendez and specifically looked to\n\njudicial interpretations of the Commonwealth Notice Statute to shed\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\flight on the application of the notification requirement to a suit\n\nagainst the municipality (J.S.T. at 22).\n\n           Thus    San    Juan's   omission   of   cases   interpreting      the\n\nCommonwealth Notice Statute from its analysis reflects precisely\n\nthe \"erroneous impression\" of Puerto Rican law adverted to in the\n\nconcurring opinion in Lopez, J.S.T. at 15 (Rebollo Lopez, J.,\n\nconcurring). Instead cases such as Mendez Pabon make it clear that\n\ncourts are to apply the Melendez-created judicial exception to the\n\nCommonwealth Notice Statute with equal force to the Municipal\n\nNotice Statute.\n\n           Just as was true in Melendez, newborn Raymanuelle's\n\nmedical records--which have been in the Hospital's control since\n\nhis birth and are still present there--thoroughly document the key\n\nfacts at   issue    and    identify   the    percipient    witnesses    to   his\n\ntreatment by the Hospital. And that being so, the question becomes\n\nwhether that knowledge on the Hospital's part--memorialized as it\n\nis in incontestable documents that have been retained over the\n\nintervening years--satisfies the fifth Lopez-identified element\n\nneeded to allow the exception to the notice statute.                   Melendez\n\nteaches an affirmative answer to that question, and we agree.\n\n           As indicated in n.4, Plaintiffs seek to add another\n\nstring to their bow by urging that the district court, relying on\n\nan erroneous translation of the fifth element, wrongly asked\n\nwhether the Hospital (and hence San Juan) had no way to know the\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fessential details of Plaintiffs' claim for damages absent notice,\n\nrather than whether the municipality had no other way to know the\n\nessential details of the harm for which Plaintiffs have demanded\n\ncompensation.     They point to the fact that the Supreme Court of\n\nPuerto Rico has not made available an official translation of\n\nLopez.   But we need not enter the fray on that score, for Melendez\n\ncompels our conclusion here under the stipulated translation of\n\nLopez that has been provided by the parties.\n\n           In sum, the Hospital's records themselves unquestionably\n\ngave San Juan knowledge of the damage to Raymanuelle based on which\n\nPlaintiffs'     claim   is   filed    without   any   need    for   further\n\nnotification from Plaintiffs--those retained records definitively\n\nshow the Hospital's failure to test Raymanuelle for PKU. And under\n\nMelendez such absence of any need for notification took Plaintiffs'\n\nclaim out of the reach of the Municipal Notice Statute.             Because\n\nMelendez controls here, we reverse the result reached by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n                        Equal Protection Challenge\n\n           Because we have found the district court's ruling on\n\napplicability of the Municipal Notice Statute to be erroneous, we\n\nalso need not consider Plaintiffs' alternative contention that the\n\nlegislation violates the Equal Protection Clause.            But that issue\n\nis not properly before us in any event, for Plaintiffs failed to\n\nraise it in the court below.\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f                      Other Rule 56 Issues\n\n          As stated earlier in this opinion, San Juan's Rule 56\n\nmotion also argued that Plaintiffs' claim is time-barred and that\n\nthe Hospital had no duty to test newborn Raymanuelle for PKU.\n\nAlthough the district court reached neither of those contentions\n\nbecause it dispatched the case on the ground discussed at length\n\nhere, the principle that an affirmance on appeal can be based on\n\nany available ground compels us to spend a few moments on those\n\nmatters as well.\n\n          As to the limitations issue, San Juan contends this\n\naction was untimely because it was not brought until August 4,\n\n1999, more than a year after Dr. De Clue diagnosed Raymanuelle's\n\nPKU condition on July 30, 1998.   But the documentary record of Dr.\n\nDeClue's notice of that diagnosis to Raymanuelle's parents is his\n\nAugust 5, 1998 letter to them, dated less than a year before suit\n\nwas filed.5   Unless San Juan were somehow able to establish on\n\nremand that the doctor advised the parents of the diagnosis before\n\nhe wrote them, then, its limitations argument fails.\n\n          As for the duty of care issue, the absence of any\n\nresolution of that facet of Plaintiffs' negligence claim by the\n\n\n\n\n     5\n        Before us San Juan asserts, without any support in the\nrecord, that Plaintiffs themselves learned of Raymanuelle's PKU\ndiagnosis on July 30, 1998 (when the doctor first arrived at that\ndiagnosis) rather than upon their receiving the doctor's August 5\nletter.\n\n                              -13-\n\fdistrict court makes it one of the matters to be resolved on\n\nremand.

Plaintiffs contend (1) that the Municipal Hospital of the City of San Juan was negligent and in breach of its statutory duties when it failed to screen Raymanuelle for phenylketonuria (\"PKU\") as an infant and (2) that all necessary preconditions for this lawsuit have been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the parties' submissions on San Juan's motion for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. (\"Rule\") 56, the district court granted that motion because Plaintiffs had failed to notify San Juan within 90 days of learning of the damages claimed as required by Article 15.003 of the Autonomous Municipalities Act of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"Municipal Notice Statute\"). We reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of San Juan and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties failed to note the less-than-precise nature of the pleadings as to the establishment of the required diversity of citizenship, we of course have the obligation to consider such subject matter jurisdictional issues sua sponte. We have done so, and as the brief ensuing discussion reflects, we have confirmed that jurisdiction exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") alleges that they are \"residents\" of Florida. Because 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332 (\"Section 1332\") vests federal courts with jurisdiction over cases involving \"citizens\" of different states who meet the amount in controversy requirement (an element clearly satisfied here), Plaintiffs' terminology is both imprecise and technically incorrect. In this Circuit, however, the failure to use the term \"citizen\" or \"domiciliary\" rather than \"resident\" does not necessarily preclude diversity jurisdiction (<i>see Cantellops v. Alvaro-Chapel,</i> 234 F.3d 741, 742-43 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the record contains evidence that at the time of suit Plaintiffs were not only residents of Florida but were also domiciled there, intending to remain indefinitely as required under Section 1332. Plaintiffs relocated to Florida in part to secure better medical treatment for Raymanuelle, who will likely need long term care. At the time the Complaint was filed, they had lived for three years in Florida, where both parents are employed and Raymanuelle is enrolled in the elementary school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the deficient terminology in their pleading, then, Plaintiffs' residence plainly coincides with their state of citizenship, so that Section 1332's diversity jurisdiction was properly invoked. We therefore turn to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Standard of Review</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as did the district court (<i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir.2002)). Under Rule 56(c) summary judgment is appropriate only \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Familiar Rule 56 principles impose on San Juan as movant the initial burden of establishing the lack of a genuine issue of material fact (<i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). On appellate review we, like the district court, are required to draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to nonmovant Plaintiffs (<i>Carroll,</i> 294 F.3d at 237).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Facts</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Raymanuelle was born on August 25, 1988 in the Municipal Hospital of the City of San Juan (\"Hospital\"), a facility operated by San Juan. Blood samples taken from Raymanuelle were tested for certain diseases, but it is uncontested that he was not screened for PKU at that time. Raymanuelle's mother was discharged from the Hospital on August 26, 1988, and the newborn was discharged the following day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in Raymanuelle's life his parents noticed problems with their son's development, and they sought medical treatment for him from numerous doctors and clinics. In 1996 Plaintiffs moved to Tampa, Florida, in large part to obtain better medical and rehabilitative care for their son. Tampa Dr. Terry DeClue first diagnosed Raymanuelle's condition as classic PKU on July 30, 1998, and he notified the parents of that diagnosis in an August 5, 1998 letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until that time Raymanuelle's parents had believed that their son had been properly screened by the hospital at the time of his birth. But in light of the PKU diagnosis, Dr. DeClue then began efforts to obtain Raymanuelle's medical records from Puerto Rico. Based on his review of those records, the Plaintiff parents first learned that the Hospital had not screened Raymanuelle for PKU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Complaint, PKU is a metabolic disease that results in mental retardation and other neurological problems when treatment is not initiated within the first few weeks of an infant's life. On July 2, 1987, Puerto Rico enacted a statute that required the creation and adoption of regulations to implement mandatory genetic screening for all Puerto Rico newborns (24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 3152-3155). In October 1988, shortly after Raymanuelle's birth, regulations pursuant to that statute were approved that required all hospitals in Puerto Rico to screen newborn infants for PKU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their original Complaint filed on August 4, 1999, Plaintiffs sued the Hospital as well as the physicians who treated Raymanuelle in Puerto Rico for negligently failing to screen for and diagnose Raymanuelle's PKU. Plaintiffs allege that because Raymanuelle's condition went undiagnosed and untreated for years, he suffered irreversible neurological damage and severe mental retardation, as a result of which he will require lifelong care. Notice of the original Complaint was served on San Juan on August 13, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">San Juan later filed a Rule 56 motion, arguing (1) that Appellants had failed to notify the Municipality within 90 days of learning of the damages claimed as required by the Municipal Notice Statute (21 P.L.R.A. &#167; 4703), (2) that the action was time-barred and (3) that there was no duty to screen Raymanuelle for PKU at the time of his birth in August 1988. On August 6, 2001, the District Court granted San Juan's motion on the first ground and dismissed the action. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Municipal Notice Statute</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action concerns the application of Puerto Rico's Municipal Notice Statute (21 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 4703):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any person who has a claim of any kind against a municipality for personal or property damages due to the fault or negligence of the municipality shall so notify the Mayor, in writing, stating clearly and concisely the date, place, cause and general nature of the damages suffered. Said notification shall also specify the amount of monetary compensation or the kind of relief appropriate for the damages suffered, the names and addresses of his/her witnesses, the claimant's address and, in cases of personal damages, the place where medical treatment was first received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the injured party is a minor or a ward, the person exercising patria potestas or the custody of the minor, or the guardian, as the case may be, shall be obliged to notify the Mayor of the claim within ninety (90) days of the date on which he/she learned of the damages claimed. The above shall not be an obstacle to the minor or ward's making said notification on their own initiative within the specified term, if the person exercising patria potestas, or custody or guardianship fails to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Jurisdictional requirement. &#8212; No legal action of any kind shall be initiated against a municipality for damages due to negligence unless written notification is made in the form, manner and terms provided in this subtitle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interpreting that statute, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held, most recently in <i>Mendez Pabon v. Mendez Martinez,</i> 2000 TSPR 119 (2000), that the notice requirement, while not jurisdictional in nature, is a \"condition precedent requiring strict compliance\" (J.S.T. at 22<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>; <i>see also Passalacqua v. Municipality of San Juan,</i> 116 P.R.R. 756, 766 (1985), quoting <i>Mangual</i> <i>v. Superior Court,</i> 88 P.R.R. 475, 483 (1963)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that condition has not been applied inexorably (<i>Mendez Pabon,</i> J.S.T. at 22). Instead the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has \"allowed the flexible application\" of the Municipal Notice Statute in light of the purposes and objectives of the statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (<i>id.</i>). <i>Lopez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 133 P.R. Dec. 243 (1993) explained that some claimants have been exempted from the notification requirement \"because under the circumstances of each one of those cases the legislative scheme was devoid of vitality; because in them the purposes and objectives of the requirement could not be achieved; because legally, there was no raison d'etre for applying the requirement to such circumstances since said requirement was not established for them\" (J.S.T. at 8). But <i>Lopez, id.</i> outlined the congeries of circumstances that would mandate strict compliance with the requirement: (1) an extra-contractual claim for damages (2) based on the municipality's alleged fault or negligence, (3) initiated by claimant (4) directly against the municipality (5) \"in which the municipality has no means to know the essential details of the damage based upon which the claim is filed without some adequate notice by the claimant.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the government entity does have its own means to know of the damage suffered by a claimant without outside notice, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has taught that the statutory notice is unnecessary &#8212; essentially that the fifth factor later identified in <i>Lopez</i> is not present (<i>Melendez Gutierrez v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,</i> 13 P.R. Offic. Trans. 1046 (1983)). For that reason <i>Melendez, id.</i> at 1049 reversed the lower court's dismissal of a claim that alleged medical negligence on the part of a Commonwealth hospital. That dismissal had been predicated on Plaintiffs' non-compliance with Article 2A of the Law of Claims and Suits against the State (\"Commonwealth Notice Statute,\" 32 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 3077a), a provision directly analogous to the Municipal Notice Statute. Because it found that the operative events had been thoroughly documented in the records kept by the hospital, <i>Melendez, id.</i> at 1049 held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n cases such as the one at bar &#8212; where the risk of the objective evidence's disappearance is minimal, where there is effective proof of the identity of the witnesses, and where the State may easily investigate and corroborate the facts alleged in the complaint filed &#8212; the cited &#167; 3077a is not strictly applicable inasmuch as the objective sought by the application therefor has no raison d'&#234;tre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Plaintiffs have understandably stressed <i>Melendez</i> both in their district court opposition to San Juan's Rule 56 motion and then again before us, San Juan has simply ignored that decision in all of its court submissions. Instead San Juan has approached this litigation as though the Municipal Notice Statute must be viewed as a no-exception requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That, however, is a basic misconception. To be sure, <i>Melendez</i> dealt with the application of the Commonwealth Notice Statute rather than the Municipal Notice Statute. But because of the common source, the nearly identical language and the intertwined history of the two statutes, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has consistently interpreted them in tandem (<i>see, e.g., Passalacqua,</i> 116 P.R.R. at 763-64). Indeed, the recent <i>Mendez Pabon</i> decision expressly cited <i>Melendez</i> and specifically looked to judicial interpretations of the Commonwealth Notice Statute to shed light on the application of the notification requirement to a suit against the municipality (J.S.T. at 22).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus San Juan's omission of cases interpreting the Commonwealth Notice Statute from its analysis reflects precisely the \"erroneous impression\" of Puerto Rican law adverted to in the concurring opinion in <i>Lopez,</i> J.S.T. at 15 (Rebollo Lopez, J., concurring). Instead cases such as <i>Mendez Pabon</i> make it clear that courts are to apply the <i>Melendez</i>-created judicial exception to the Commonwealth Notice Statute with equal force to the Municipal Notice Statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as was true in <i>Melendez,</i> newborn Raymanuelle's medical records &#8212; which have been in the Hospital's control since his birth and are still present there &#8212; thoroughly document the key facts at issue and identify the percipient witnesses to his treatment by the Hospital. And that being so, the question becomes whether that knowledge on the Hospital's part &#8212; memorialized as it is in incontestable documents that have been retained over the intervening years &#8212; satisfies the fifth <i>Lopez</i>-identified element needed to allow the exception to the notice statute. <i>Melendez</i> teaches an affirmative answer to that question, and we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated in n. 4, Plaintiffs seek to add another string to their bow by urging that the district court, relying on an erroneous translation of the fifth element, wrongly asked whether the Hospital (and hence San Juan) had no way to know the essential details of Plaintiffs' <i>claim for damages</i> absent notice, rather than whether the municipality had no other way to know the essential details of the <i>harm</i> for which Plaintiffs have demanded compensation. They point to the fact that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has not made available an official translation of <i>Lopez.</i> But we need not enter the fray on that score, for <i>Melendez</i> compels our conclusion here under the stipulated translation of <i>Lopez</i> that has been provided by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Hospital's records themselves unquestionably gave San Juan knowledge of the damage to Raymanuelle based on which Plaintiffs' claim is filed without any need for further notification from Plaintiffs &#8212; those retained records definitively show the Hospital's failure to test Raymanuelle for PKU. And under <i>Melendez</i> such absence of any need for notification took Plaintiffs' claim out of the reach of the Municipal Notice Statute. Because <i>Melendez</i> controls here, we reverse the result reached by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Equal Protection Challenge</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have found the district court's ruling on applicability of the Municipal Notice Statute to be erroneous, we also need not consider Plaintiffs' alternative contention that the legislation violates the Equal Protection Clause. But that issue is not properly before us in any event, for Plaintiffs failed to raise it in the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Other Rule 56 Issues</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated earlier in this opinion, San Juan's Rule 56 motion also argued that Plaintiffs' claim is time-barred and that the Hospital had no duty to test newborn Raymanuelle for PKU. Although the district court reached neither of those contentions because it dispatched the case on the ground discussed at length here, the principle that an affirmance on appeal can be based on any available ground compels us to spend a few moments on those matters as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the limitations issue, San Juan contends this action was untimely because it was not brought until August 4, 1999, more than a year after Dr. De Clue diagnosed Raymanuelle's PKU condition on July 30, 1998. But the documentary record of Dr. DeClue's notice of that diagnosis to Raymanuelle's parents is his August 5, 1998 letter to them, dated less than a year before suit was filed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Unless San Juan were somehow able to establish on remand that the doctor advised the parents of the diagnosis before he wrote them, then, its limitations argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the duty of care issue, the absence of any resolution of that facet of Plaintiffs' negligence claim by the district court makes it one of the matters to be resolved on remand. We therefore express no view on the subject.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We REVERSE the order of the district court granting San Juan's Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.

Because 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332 (\"Section 1332\") vests federal courts with jurisdiction over cases involving \"citizens\" of different states who meet the amount in controversy requirement (an element clearly satisfied here), Plaintiffs' terminology is both imprecise and technically incorrect. In this Circuit, however, the failure to use the term \"citizen\" or \"domiciliary\" rather than \"resident\" does not necessarily preclude diversity jurisdiction (<i>see Cantellops v. Alvaro-Chapel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771390\"><a href=\"/opinion/771390/josefina-cantellops-v-juan-alvaro-chapel-chr-corporation-flamingo-road/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span>, 742-43 (1st Cir.2000)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the record contains evidence that at the time of suit Plaintiffs were not only residents of Florida but were also domiciled there, intending to remain indefinitely as required under Section 1332. Plaintiffs relocated to Florida in part to secure better medical treatment for Raymanuelle, who will likely need long term care. At the time the Complaint was filed, they had lived for three years in Florida, where both parents are employed and Raymanuelle is enrolled in the elementary school system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the deficient terminology in their pleading, then, Plaintiffs' residence plainly coincides with their state of citizenship, so that Section 1332's diversity jurisdiction was properly invoked.

Under Rule 56(c) summary judgment is appropriate only \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Familiar Rule 56 principles impose on San Juan as movant the initial burden of establishing the lack of a genuine issue of material fact (<i>Celotex Corp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1986)). On appellate review we, like the district court, are required to draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to nonmovant Plaintiffs (<i>Carroll,</i> 294 F.3d at 237).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Facts</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Raymanuelle was born on August 25, 1988 in the Municipal Hospital of the City of San Juan (\"Hospital\"), a facility operated by San Juan. Blood samples taken from Raymanuelle were tested for certain diseases, but it is uncontested that he was not screened for PKU at that time. Raymanuelle's mother was discharged from the Hospital on August 26, 1988, and the newborn was discharged the following day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in Raymanuelle's life his parents noticed problems with their son's development, and they sought medical treatment for him from numerous doctors and clinics. In 1996 Plaintiffs moved to Tampa, Florida, in large part to obtain better medical and rehabilitative care for their son. Tampa Dr. Terry DeClue first diagnosed Raymanuelle's condition as classic PKU on July 30, 1998, and he notified the parents of that diagnosis in an August 5, 1998 letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until that time Raymanuelle's parents had believed that their son had been properly screened by the hospital at the time of his birth. But in light of the PKU diagnosis, Dr. DeClue then began efforts to obtain Raymanuelle's medical records from Puerto Rico. Based on his review of those records, the Plaintiff parents first learned that the Hospital had not screened Raymanuelle for PKU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Complaint, PKU is a metabolic disease that results in mental retardation and other neurological problems when treatment is not initiated within the first few weeks of an infant's life. On July 2, 1987, Puerto Rico enacted a statute that required the creation and adoption of regulations to implement mandatory genetic screening for all Puerto Rico newborns (24 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 3152-3155). In October 1988, shortly after Raymanuelle's birth, regulations pursuant to that statute were approved that required all hospitals in Puerto Rico to screen newborn infants for PKU.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their original Complaint filed on August 4, 1999, Plaintiffs sued the Hospital as well as the physicians who treated Raymanuelle in Puerto Rico for negligently failing to screen for and diagnose Raymanuelle's PKU. Plaintiffs allege that because Raymanuelle's condition went undiagnosed and untreated for years, he suffered irreversible neurological damage and severe mental retardation, as a result of which he will require lifelong care. Notice of the original Complaint was served on San Juan on August 13, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">San Juan later filed a Rule 56 motion, arguing (1) that Appellants had failed to notify the Municipality within 90 days of learning of the damages claimed as required by the Municipal Notice Statute (21 P.L.R.A. &#167; 4703), (2) that the action was time-barred and (3) that there was no duty to screen Raymanuelle for PKU at the time of his birth in August 1988. On August 6, 2001, the District Court granted San Juan's motion on the first ground and dismissed the action. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Municipal Notice Statute</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action concerns the application of Puerto Rico's Municipal Notice Statute (21 P.R.

Said notification shall also specify the amount of monetary compensation or the kind of relief appropriate for the damages suffered, the names and addresses of his/her witnesses, the claimant's address and, in cases of personal damages, the place where medical treatment was first received.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the injured party is a minor or a ward, the person exercising patria potestas or the custody of the minor, or the guardian, as the case may be, shall be obliged to notify the Mayor of the claim within ninety (90) days of the date on which he/she learned of the damages claimed. The above shall not be an obstacle to the minor or ward's making said notification on their own initiative within the specified term, if the person exercising patria potestas, or custody or guardianship fails to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Jurisdictional requirement. &#8212; No legal action of any kind shall be initiated against a municipality for damages due to negligence unless written notification is made in the form, manner and terms provided in this subtitle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Interpreting that statute, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held, most recently in <i>Mendez Pabon v. Mendez Martinez,</i> 2000 TSPR 119 (2000), that the notice requirement, while not jurisdictional in nature, is a \"condition precedent requiring strict compliance\" (J.S.T. at 22<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>; <i>see also Passalacqua v. Municipality of San Juan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></span>, 766 (1985), quoting <i>Mangual</i> <i>v. Superior Court,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></span>, 483 (1963)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that condition has not been applied inexorably (<i>Mendez Pabon,</i> J.S.T. at 22). Instead the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has \"allowed the flexible application\" of the Municipal Notice Statute in light of the purposes and objectives of the statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> (<i>id.</i>). <i>Lopez v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></span> (1993) explained that some claimants have been exempted from the notification requirement \"because under the circumstances of each one of those cases the legislative scheme was devoid of vitality; because in them the purposes and objectives of the requirement could not be achieved; because legally, there was no raison d'etre for applying the requirement to such circumstances since said requirement was not established for them\" (J.S.T. at 8). But <i>Lopez, id.</i> outlined the congeries of circumstances that would mandate strict compliance with the requirement: (1) an extra-contractual claim for damages (2) based on the municipality's alleged fault or negligence, (3) initiated by claimant (4) directly against the municipality (5) \"in which the municipality has no means to know the essential details of the damage based upon which the claim is filed without some adequate notice by the claimant.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the government entity does have its own means to know of the damage suffered by a claimant without outside notice, however, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has taught that the statutory notice is unnecessary &#8212; essentially that the fifth factor later identified in <i>Lopez</i> is not present (<i>Melendez Gutierrez v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">1046</span></span> (1983)). For that reason <i>Melendez, id.</i> at 1049 reversed the lower court's dismissal of a claim that alleged medical negligence on the part of a Commonwealth hospital. That dismissal had been predicated on Plaintiffs' non-compliance with Article 2A of the Law of Claims and Suits against the State (\"Commonwealth Notice Statute,\" 32 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 3077a), a provision directly analogous to the Municipal Notice Statute. Because it found that the operative events had been thoroughly documented in the records kept by the hospital, <i>Melendez, id.</i> at 1049 held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n cases such as the one at bar &#8212; where the risk of the objective evidence's disappearance is minimal, where there is effective proof of the identity of the witnesses, and where the State may easily investigate and corroborate the facts alleged in the complaint filed &#8212; the cited &#167; 3077a is not strictly applicable inasmuch as the objective sought by the application therefor has no raison d'&#234;tre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Plaintiffs have understandably stressed <i>Melendez</i> both in their district court opposition to San Juan's Rule 56 motion and then again before us, San Juan has simply ignored that decision in all of its court submissions. Instead San Juan has approached this litigation as though the Municipal Notice Statute must be viewed as a no-exception requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That, however, is a basic misconception. To be sure, <i>Melendez</i> dealt with the application of the Commonwealth Notice Statute rather than the Municipal Notice Statute. But because of the common source, the nearly identical language and the intertwined history of the two statutes, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has consistently interpreted them in tandem (<i>see, e.g., Passalacqua,</i> 116 P.R.R. at 763-64). Indeed, the recent <i>Mendez Pabon</i> decision expressly cited <i>Melendez</i> and specifically looked to judicial interpretations of the Commonwealth Notice Statute to shed light on the application of the notification requirement to a suit against the municipality (J.S.T. at 22).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus San Juan's omission of cases interpreting the Commonwealth Notice Statute from its analysis reflects precisely the \"erroneous impression\" of Puerto Rican law adverted to in the concurring opinion in <i>Lopez,</i> J.S.T. at 15 (Rebollo Lopez, J., concurring). Instead cases such as <i>Mendez Pabon</i> make it clear that courts are to apply the <i>Melendez</i>-created judicial exception to the Commonwealth Notice Statute with equal force to the Municipal Notice Statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as was true in <i>Melendez,</i> newborn Raymanuelle's medical records &#8212; which have been in the Hospital's control since his birth and are still present there &#8212; thoroughly document the key facts at issue and identify the percipient witnesses to his treatment by the Hospital. And that being so, the question becomes whether that knowledge on the Hospital's part &#8212; memorialized as it is in incontestable documents that have been retained over the intervening years &#8212; satisfies the fifth <i>Lopez</i>-identified element needed to allow the exception to the notice statute. <i>Melendez</i> teaches an affirmative answer to that question, and we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated in n. 4, Plaintiffs seek to add another string to their bow by urging that the district court, relying on an erroneous translation of the fifth element, wrongly asked whether the Hospital (and hence San Juan) had no way to know the essential details of Plaintiffs' <i>claim for damages</i> absent notice, rather than whether the municipality had no other way to know the essential details of the <i>harm</i> for which Plaintiffs have demanded compensation. They point to the fact that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has not made available an official translation of <i>Lopez.</i> But we need not enter the fray on that score, for <i>Melendez</i> compels our conclusion here under the stipulated translation of <i>Lopez</i> that has been provided by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Hospital's records themselves unquestionably gave San Juan knowledge of the damage to Raymanuelle based on which Plaintiffs' claim is filed without any need for further notification from Plaintiffs &#8212; those retained records definitively show the Hospital's failure to test Raymanuelle for PKU. And under <i>Melendez</i> such absence of any need for notification took Plaintiffs' claim out of the reach of the Municipal Notice Statute. Because <i>Melendez</i> controls here, we reverse the result reached by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Equal Protection Challenge</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have found the district court's ruling on applicability of the Municipal Notice Statute to be erroneous, we also need not consider Plaintiffs' alternative contention that the legislation violates the Equal Protection Clause. But that issue is not properly before us in any event, for Plaintiffs failed to raise it in the court below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Other Rule 56 Issues</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated earlier in this opinion, San Juan's Rule 56 motion also argued that Plaintiffs' claim is time-barred and that the Hospital had no duty to test newborn Raymanuelle for PKU. Although the district court reached neither of those contentions because it dispatched the case on the ground discussed at length here, the principle that an affirmance on appeal can be based on any available ground compels us to spend a few moments on those matters as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the limitations issue, San Juan contends this action was untimely because it was not brought until August 4, 1999, more than a year after Dr. De Clue diagnosed Raymanuelle's PKU condition on July 30, 1998. But the documentary record of Dr. DeClue's notice of that diagnosis to Raymanuelle's parents is his August 5, 1998 letter to them, dated less than a year before suit was filed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Unless San Juan were somehow able to establish on remand that the doctor advised the parents of the diagnosis before he wrote them, then, its limitations argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the duty of care issue, the absence of any resolution of that facet of Plaintiffs' negligence claim by the district court makes it one of the matters to be resolved on remand. We therefore express no view on the subject.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We REVERSE the order of the district court granting San Juan's Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.
