After carefully considering the briefs and record\n\nin these consolidated appeals, we affirm the pre-trial detention\n\norders for substantially the reasons stated by the district court.\n\n         Our review is independent, tempered by a degree of deference\n\nto the determination below. United States v. Tortora, 922 F.2d 880\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).        The appellants essentially argue that since the\n\ngovernment's case rested upon hearsay, it failed to prove the need\n\nfor detention by a preponderance of the evidence.                        However, the\n\nrules    of   admissibility      for    criminal      trials   do    not    apply    to\n\ndetention hearings. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f); United States v. Acevedo-\n\nRamos,    755    F.2d   203   (1st   Cir.    1985).     More   importantly,         the\n\nappellants'       indictments        sufficed    to     trigger      a     rebuttable\n\npresumption in favor of detention. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e); United\n\nStates v. Vargas, 804 F.2d 157 (1st Cir. 1986).                     As the district\n\ncourt ruled, the appellants failed to satisfy their burden of\n\nproduction by presenting some evidence that they do not endanger\n\nthe community.      Finally, even if they had discharged their burden,\n\nthe weight of the incriminating evidence is just one factor in the\n\nanalysis.       18 U.S.C. § 3142(g); United States v. Palmer-Contreras,\n\n835 F.2d 15 (1st Cir. 1987).                The appellants are charged with\n\nserious crimes involving large amounts of drugs, and the record\n\nshows that they have the contacts and resources to flee.\n\n     Affirmed.       Loc.
