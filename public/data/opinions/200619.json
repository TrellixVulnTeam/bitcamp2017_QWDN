Petitioner Guillermo A. Para Bravo, who is a\n\nnative and citizen of Colombia, petitions for review of a final\n\norder of removal issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),\n\naffirming the immigration judge’s (IJ’s) denial of his requests for\n\nasylum and for withholding of removal.            For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we AFFIRM the BIA.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n     In 1994, Bravo entered the United States from Colombia on a\n\nvisitor’s    visa.    Approximately     three   years   later,   and   after\n\noverstaying his visa, he married a United States citizen.          Shortly\n\nthereafter his wife filed a visa petition on his behalf, and Bravo\n\nconcurrently filed an application to adjust his status to that of\n\na lawful permanent resident.      The applications were denied after\n\nBravo and his wife failed to appear for an interview.             He later\n\nindicated that the couple missed the interview because they had\n\nseparated.    After removal proceedings commenced against him, his\n\nwife filed another visa petition on his behalf, and Bravo again\n\nrequested an adjustment of status.         That request was withdrawn,\n\nhowever, because he and his wife continued to experience marital\n\ndifficulties.    During this process, Bravo appeared with counsel\n\nbefore an IJ and conceded removability for having remained longer\n\nthan authorized.     Eventually, he filed a formal asylum application\n\nwith the immigration court, which the court later converted into an\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\funder the United Nations Convention Against Torture.1            Following a\n\nhearing, the IJ found Bravo removable as charged and denied his\n\napplications.      Subsequently, the BIA dismissed his appeal.\n\n     At his asylum hearing, Bravo testified that between 1986 and\n\n1993 he owned and operated three discotheques in Colombia. Much of\n\nBravo’s   asylum    and   withholding-of-removal      claims     rest   on   an\n\nincident that allegedly occurred in 1989.            According to Bravo,\n\nwhile working in one of his clubs, he observed a man selling (or\n\nattempting to sell) drugs to one of his patrons.        After breaking up\n\nthe buy, Bravo learned that the patron’s wife had also been offered\n\ndrugs in the ladies’ restroom by another drug pusher.               Having a\n\nzero tolerance drug policy at his discotheques, Bravo called the\n\npolice, who arrested the two individuals suspected of selling (or\n\nattempting to sell) narcotics.\n\n     Although he never spoke to or saw the perpetrators after that\n\nnight, he testified that he believes this incident caused him to\n\nbecome    the   victim    of   a   “systematic   exercise   of   terror      and\n\nintimidation,” one that lasted several years, and that included:\n\nverbal and written threats, vandalism of personal property, the\n\nbombing of one of his clubs, a shooting attack in the same club,\n\nthe burning (or partial burning) of another club, and a drive-by\n\n\n     1\n      In this review petition, Bravo does not seek relief under the\nUnited Nations Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, this claim\nis waived. See Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 28 n.5 (1st Cir.\n2002) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fshooting in front of one of his clubs that resulted in the death of\n\nhis porter.     According to Bravo, “[t]hese persons [i.e., the drug\n\ndealers] were detained by the police, [sic] because I told [on]\n\nthem. . . .         And that’s when everything started for me . . . .”\n\nAfter each incident, authorities were called to the scene and an\n\ninvestigation was conducted.            For instance, after a small bomb was\n\ndetonated in one of his clubs, the police placed undercover agents\n\nat the targeted club for fifteen or twenty days.                  Unfortunately,\n\nthe police were unable to arrest anybody in connection with the\n\nbombing, or any other incident for that matter. Although Bravo has\n\nno knowledge of who was responsible for these events, it is his\n\nsuspicion that his misfortunes were connected to the drugs dealers\n\nhe had arrested.         Because of his troubles, Bravo liquidated his\n\nfirst discotheque in 1991, another in 1992, and his last in 1993.\n\n      In    addition     to    the     problems    he   experienced      with    his\n\ndiscotheque businesses, Bravo allegedly experienced extortion from\n\nguerrilla groups located in the vicinity of a farm that he owned\n\nbut did not live on.          According to his testimony, when he visited\n\nhis   farm,    guerrillas      would    approach    him   and    ask    for   money.\n\nAlthough      the    details    of   these     occurrences      are    unclear   and\n\nincomplete in the record, Bravo apparently would not cave in to\n\nthese requests.       Ultimately, he sold his farm at a loss because his\n\nfarmhand was giving the guerrillas food, cattle, and probably\n\nmoney.     It is not clear when the farm was sold.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f       Bravo arrived in the United States as a visitor in 1994 after\n\nspending over a year working on the liquidation of his last\n\ndiscotheque, and also attempting to collect unpaid loans owed to\n\nhim. Also, his departure from Colombia was not until approximately\n\none year and six months after the last known incident in which any\n\nattempt was made on his life or any harm was inflicted upon him\n\nthrough his property or those associated with him.                       When he left,\n\nBravo    apparently    believed       that    if   he    distanced       himself      from\n\nColombia for a period of time, people were going to “forget” about\n\nhim    and   things   were    going    to    “calm      down”   so   that      he   could\n\neventually return home.          However, since arriving in the United\n\nStates, Bravo allegedly has been told by his two daughters, who\n\nremain in Colombia, that they have received a phone call from an\n\nunidentified person who has indicated that people are aware that\n\nBravo has left the country, and that they would “finish with [him]”\n\nif he returned to Colombia.\n\n        Although the IJ found Bravo’s testimony to be credible, she\n\nnonetheless determined that he was not eligible for asylum for two\n\nreasons.       First, she concluded that Bravo failed to file his\n\napplication for asylum within the one-year filing deadline set\n\nforth in § 208(a)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n\n(INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).              Related to this finding, the IJ\n\nalso    held   that   Bravo   failed     to    establish        either    of    the    two\n\nstatutory exceptions to the one-year filing period.                             See INA\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f§ 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D).            Second, she also held\n\nthat Bravo failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution. Thus, the IJ also denied Bravo’s claims for\n\nboth asylum and withholding of removal on the merits.\n\n       According to the IJ, the threats and economic harm Bravo\n\nendured were not the effects of political persecution, but rather,\n\n“on account of a personal dispute with two individuals who were\n\nattempting to deal in drugs.”       She continued, “[Bravo] has not in\n\nany way indicated that he stated a political opinion to these\n\nindividuals, or that this was anything other than retaliation\n\nagainst his causing their arrest.”        The IJ also found relevant the\n\nfact   that   Bravo   did   not   leave   Colombia   until   after   he   had\n\nliquidated his last discotheque, and attempted to collect debts\n\nowed to him, actions that resulted in a delay of approximately a\n\nyear and six months after the last alleged violent incident.               It\n\nwas the IJ’s view that “this is not the behavior of an individual\n\nwho feels that if he was to remain in Colombia . . . he would\n\ncontinue to have threats made or that he would be at risk for\n\nharm.” She also found that there was no evidence to establish that\n\nBravo “could not have remained in Colombia [and] either started up\n\na different kind of business which would not be the target of drug\n\ndealers, or otherwise worked for somebody else as he had prior to\n\n1986.”    Thus, the IJ concluded by holding that Bravo “has not\n\nestablished that the [type] of crime that was inflicted upon him\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fconstitutes persecution as defined [by the INA], and he has not\n\nestablished that it is more likely than not [that] . . . if he were\n\nto return to Colombia that he would suffer harm of any kind.”\n\n     The BIA dismissed Bravo’s appeal in its entirety, and, in\n\ndoing so, determined that the IJ had properly concluded that Bravo\n\nhad not met his burden of proof.            Specifically, it found that “even\n\nif [Bravo] were to qualify for an exception to the 1 year filing\n\ndeadline,     he   has   not    met    his       burden   of   demonstrating       his\n\neligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.”                      That is, it\n\ndetermined in the alternative, that even if the application was\n\ntimely, it would not be sufficient to render Bravo eligible for\n\nasylum.\n\n                                 II.       ANALYSIS\n\n     We   have     jurisdiction       to   review     final    orders   of   the   BIA\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252.               Here, although the IJ found that\n\nBravo’s asylum application was untimely, the BIA did not affirm on\n\nthat basis.      Accordingly, we leave for another day the question of\n\nwhether INA § 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3), strips this court\n\nof jurisdiction to review administrative decisions made pursuant to\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2).         See Kayembe v. Ashcroft, 334 F.3d 231, 235\n\n(3d Cir. 2003) (explaining that “[o]ur power of review . . .\n\nextends only to the decision of the BIA . . . [and that] only if\n\nthe BIA expressly adopts or defers to a finding of the IJ, will we\n\nreview the decision of the IJ”) (internal citation omitted).\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f       BIA determinations of “statutory eligibility for relief from\n\ndeportation, whether via asylum or withholding of deportation, are\n\nconclusive if ‘supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.’”         Mediouni v. INS,\n\n314 F.3d 24, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias,\n\n502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (citation omitted)). “We will not reverse\n\nsimply because we disagree with the Board's evaluation of the\n\nfacts.”    Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 316 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(citation omitted). Instead, under the deferential \"substantial\n\nevidence\" standard “if [an alien] seeks to obtain judicial reversal\n\nof the BIA’s determination, he must show that the evidence he\n\npresented [not only supports his petition for relief, but] was so\n\ncompelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find” that\n\nhe statutorily qualified for asylum and/or withholding of removal.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 483-84.         It is “the alien [who] bears\n\nthe burden of establishing eligibility for asylum by proving either\n\npast    persecution   or    a   well-founded    fear   of    persecution.”\n\nVelasquez,    316   F.3d   at   34.     Furthermore,   the   standard   for\n\nwithholding removal is more stringent than the “well-founded fear”\n\ntouchstone applicable to an asylum claim.          Id. at 34 n.2.       “[A]\n\npetitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard fails, a fortiori,\n\nto satisfy the former.”     Alvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f     In the instant case, the IJ made detailed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law in connection with her merits review of Bravo’s\n\nclaims of asylum and withholding of removal.                The BIA agreed with\n\nthese on-the-merit determinations.            According to the BIA, “[a]ny\n\nharm that [Bravo] has suffered and any future danger that he may\n\nface stems    from   his    refusal    to    cooperate      with      drug    dealers.\n\nNeither the harm nor the danger is on account of any of the\n\nstatutorily    protected     grounds    for       asylum    or     withholding     of\n\nremoval.”\n\n     The    BIA’s    decision    was        the    product       of    “reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.”     Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481.               Bravo has failed to\n\ndemonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution     on    account    of    his   or     her   race,       religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.    Certainly, he has not demonstrated that the “evidence he\n\npresented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could\n\nfail to find the requisite . . . persecution.”                     Id. at 483-84.\n\nAccordingly, we find no basis to disturb the BIA’s asylum and\n\nwithholding-of-removal       decisions       pursuant      to    the    substantial\n\nevidence standard of review.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

Because of his troubles, Bravo liquidated his\n\nfirst discotheque in 1991, another in 1992, and his last in 1993.\n\n      In    addition     to    the     problems    he   experienced      with    his\n\ndiscotheque businesses, Bravo allegedly experienced extortion from\n\nguerrilla groups located in the vicinity of a farm that he owned\n\nbut did not live on.          According to his testimony, when he visited\n\nhis   farm,    guerrillas      would    approach    him   and    ask    for   money.\n\nAlthough      the    details    of   these     occurrences      are    unclear   and\n\nincomplete in the record, Bravo apparently would not cave in to\n\nthese requests.       Ultimately, he sold his farm at a loss because his\n\nfarmhand was giving the guerrillas food, cattle, and probably\n\nmoney.     It is not clear when the farm was sold.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f       Bravo arrived in the United States as a visitor in 1994 after\n\nspending over a year working on the liquidation of his last\n\ndiscotheque, and also attempting to collect unpaid loans owed to\n\nhim. Also, his departure from Colombia was not until approximately\n\none year and six months after the last known incident in which any\n\nattempt was made on his life or any harm was inflicted upon him\n\nthrough his property or those associated with him.                       When he left,\n\nBravo    apparently    believed       that    if   he    distanced       himself      from\n\nColombia for a period of time, people were going to “forget” about\n\nhim    and   things   were    going    to    “calm      down”   so   that      he   could\n\neventually return home.          However, since arriving in the United\n\nStates, Bravo allegedly has been told by his two daughters, who\n\nremain in Colombia, that they have received a phone call from an\n\nunidentified person who has indicated that people are aware that\n\nBravo has left the country, and that they would “finish with [him]”\n\nif he returned to Colombia.\n\n        Although the IJ found Bravo’s testimony to be credible, she\n\nnonetheless determined that he was not eligible for asylum for two\n\nreasons.       First, she concluded that Bravo failed to file his\n\napplication for asylum within the one-year filing deadline set\n\nforth in § 208(a)(2)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n\n(INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).              Related to this finding, the IJ\n\nalso    held   that   Bravo   failed     to    establish        either    of    the    two\n\nstatutory exceptions to the one-year filing period.                             See INA\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f§ 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D).            Second, she also held\n\nthat Bravo failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution. Thus, the IJ also denied Bravo’s claims for\n\nboth asylum and withholding of removal on the merits.\n\n       According to the IJ, the threats and economic harm Bravo\n\nendured were not the effects of political persecution, but rather,\n\n“on account of a personal dispute with two individuals who were\n\nattempting to deal in drugs.”       She continued, “[Bravo] has not in\n\nany way indicated that he stated a political opinion to these\n\nindividuals, or that this was anything other than retaliation\n\nagainst his causing their arrest.”        The IJ also found relevant the\n\nfact   that   Bravo   did   not   leave   Colombia   until   after   he   had\n\nliquidated his last discotheque, and attempted to collect debts\n\nowed to him, actions that resulted in a delay of approximately a\n\nyear and six months after the last alleged violent incident.               It\n\nwas the IJ’s view that “this is not the behavior of an individual\n\nwho feels that if he was to remain in Colombia . . . he would\n\ncontinue to have threats made or that he would be at risk for\n\nharm.” She also found that there was no evidence to establish that\n\nBravo “could not have remained in Colombia [and] either started up\n\na different kind of business which would not be the target of drug\n\ndealers, or otherwise worked for somebody else as he had prior to\n\n1986.”    Thus, the IJ concluded by holding that Bravo “has not\n\nestablished that the [type] of crime that was inflicted upon him\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fconstitutes persecution as defined [by the INA], and he has not\n\nestablished that it is more likely than not [that] . . . if he were\n\nto return to Colombia that he would suffer harm of any kind.”\n\n     The BIA dismissed Bravo’s appeal in its entirety, and, in\n\ndoing so, determined that the IJ had properly concluded that Bravo\n\nhad not met his burden of proof.            Specifically, it found that “even\n\nif [Bravo] were to qualify for an exception to the 1 year filing\n\ndeadline,     he   has   not    met    his       burden   of   demonstrating       his\n\neligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.”                      That is, it\n\ndetermined in the alternative, that even if the application was\n\ntimely, it would not be sufficient to render Bravo eligible for\n\nasylum.\n\n                                 II.       ANALYSIS\n\n     We   have     jurisdiction       to   review     final    orders   of   the   BIA\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252.               Here, although the IJ found that\n\nBravo’s asylum application was untimely, the BIA did not affirm on\n\nthat basis.      Accordingly, we leave for another day the question of\n\nwhether INA § 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3), strips this court\n\nof jurisdiction to review administrative decisions made pursuant to\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2).

The BIA agreed with\n\nthese on-the-merit determinations.            According to the BIA, “[a]ny\n\nharm that [Bravo] has suffered and any future danger that he may\n\nface stems    from   his    refusal    to    cooperate      with      drug    dealers.\n\nNeither the harm nor the danger is on account of any of the\n\nstatutorily    protected     grounds    for       asylum    or     withholding     of\n\nremoval.”\n\n     The    BIA’s    decision    was        the    product       of    “reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.”     Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481.               Bravo has failed to\n\ndemonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution     on    account    of    his   or     her   race,       religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.    Certainly, he has not demonstrated that the “evidence he\n\npresented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could\n\nfail to find the requisite . . . persecution.”                     Id. at 483-84.\n\nAccordingly, we find no basis to disturb the BIA’s asylum and\n\nwithholding-of-removal       decisions       pursuant      to    the    substantial\n\nevidence standard of review.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f</pre>",
