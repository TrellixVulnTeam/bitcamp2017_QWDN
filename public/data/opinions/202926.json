Petitioner Jose Lorenzo Mejia-\n\nOrellana, a native and citizen of Honduras, petitions for review of\n\na final order of removal of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA),\n\nwhich adopted and affirmed the decision of an Immigration Judge\n\n(IJ).\n\n           The BIA affirmed the IJ's decision that Mejia-Orellana\n\nwas   ineligible   for   a   cancellation    of   removal   under    8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229b(a) because he acquired his lawful permanent resident status\n\nby fraud or misrepresentation and, further, that he was ineligible\n\nfor a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h).                The BIA\n\nalso determined that Mejia-Orellana was not denied due process.\n\n           We affirm the BIA and deny the petition for review.               In\n\na matter of first impression, we uphold the BIA's interpretation of\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) that an alien who has acquired his \"lawful\n\npermanent resident status\" by fraud or misrepresentation has not\n\nbeen lawfully admitted and so is ineligible for a cancellation of\n\nremoval.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           Mejia-Orellana      entered      the   United    States       without\n\ninspection in 1983.      Two years later, he was arrested for criminal\n\npossession of marijuana over 20 grams in violation of Florida\n\nStatute § 893.13.     He married a U.S. citizen in 1987, and in 1991\n\nhe applied for lawful permanent residence, but failed to disclose\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fhis 1985 arrest as he was required to do.       He was granted permanent\n\nresident status on May 19, 1991.\n\n             On April 13, 2002, Mejia-Orellana attempted to reenter\n\nthe United States from the Canadian side of Niagara Falls.           When he\n\nfailed to present his I-551 Alien Registration Card, he was denied\n\nreentry and paroled for deferred inspection in Boston.\n\n             During his inspection in Boston on July 24, 2002, Mejia-\n\nOrellana disclosed his 1985 Florida arrest for marijuana possession\n\nas well as a guilty plea for marijuana possession in New York in\n\n1993.    The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) denied\n\nreentry and instituted removal proceedings charging Mejia-Orellana\n\nwas     an    inadmissible     arriving      alien      under    8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), which classifies as inadmissible aliens who\n\nhave been convicted of a crime relating to a controlled substance.\n\nOriginally, the INS used the New York guilty plea as the basis for\n\ninadmissibility.      In June 2003, however, the INS amended its\n\ncharges and replaced the New York guilty plea with a September 2002\n\nFlorida conviction that stemmed from the 1985 Florida arrest.\n\n             In pleadings submitted on November 24, 2003, Mejia-\n\nOrellana conceded his removability and designated Honduras as his\n\nremoval country.     In a hearing before the IJ on the same day, he\n\nadmitted all of the INS's charges and asked for a cancellation of\n\nremoval.      In   response,   the   INS   argued    that   Mejia-Orellana's\n\npermanent resident status was void ab initio because of his failure\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fto disclose his arrest on his application for adjustment of status\n\nin 1991.\n\n            At three subsequent hearings, the INS raised the argument\n\nthat Mejia-Orellana's lawful permanent resident status was void ab\n\ninitio.    Meanwhile, on December 6, 2004, Mejia-Orellana submitted\n\na memorandum in support of his application for a cancellation of\n\nremoval    under   8    U.S.C.    §   1229b(a)       in   which   he   admitted   the\n\nmisrepresentation on his 1991 application and argued that it did\n\nnot render him inadmissible.\n\n            The IJ's oral decision on April 25, 2005 rejected all of\n\nMejia-Orellana's claims and ordered removal to Honduras pursuant to\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II).                 Following BIA precedent, the IJ\n\nfound that Mejia-Orellana's application for a cancellation of\n\nremoval under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) was pretermitted because his\n\nlawful permanent residence was obtained fraudulently and was thus\n\nvoid ab initio.         In addition, the IJ rejected Mejia-Orellana's\n\napplication     for    a     waiver   of    inadmissibility       under    8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(h).\n\n            In a brief per curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed\n\nthe IJ's decision.          The Board held that fraud or misrepresentation\n\nrenders an acquisition of lawful permanent resident status void ab\n\ninitio, and thus Mejia-Orellana was not eligible for a cancellation\n\nof   removal.         The    Board    noted      that     Mejia-Orellana   did    not\n\n\"meaningfully challenge on appeal\" the IJ's denial of a waiver of\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\finadmissibility.      In addition, the BIA found that Mejia-Orellana\n\nhad   ample     opportunity   to   respond    to   the   INS's     charges   of\n\nmisrepresentation and therefore rejected his due process claim.\n\n                                     II.\n\n              Mejia-Orellana makes several claims.         First, he argues\n\nthat the IJ erred in finding him ineligible for a cancellation of\n\nremoval under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a).         Second, he claims that his due\n\nprocess rights were violated by his not being given an effective\n\nopportunity to respond to the allegations that he lied on his\n\napplication for lawful permanent residence.          Third, he argues that\n\nthe   IJ    erred   in   finding   him     ineligible    for   a   waiver    of\n\ninadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h).\n\n              Because the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling and\n\ndiscussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review both\n\nopinions.     Ouk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 110 (1st Cir. 2006).            We\n\nreview the factual findings for substantial evidence.               Coelho v.\n\nGonzales, 452 F.3d 104, 109-10 (1st Cir. 2006); Rodriguez-Ramirez\n\nv. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005).                To the extent\n\nthere are issues of law, we decide those de novo.          Coelho, 452 F.3d\n\nat 110.\n\nA.            Cancellation of Removal Under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)\n\n              In order to be eligible for a cancellation of removal\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), an alien must, among other requirements,\n\nhave been \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fthan 5 years.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(1).        This case turns on whether\n\nthe phrase \"lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" in 8 U.S.C.\n\n§   1229b(a)     excludes     admissions    acquired        by     fraud   or\n\nmisrepresentation.\n\n           BIA precedent holds that aliens are ineligible for a\n\ncancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) where they have\n\nacquired permanent resident status by fraud or misrepresentation,\n\nbecause   they   have   not   been   lawfully    admitted    for    permanent\n\nresidence.   In re Koloamatangi, 23 I. & N. Dec. 548 (B.I.A. 2003).\n\nKoloamatangi had acquired his status by fraud, and the BIA held\n\nthat the \"correct interpretation of the term 'lawfully admitted for\n\npermanent residence' is that an alien is deemed, ab initio, never\n\nto have obtained lawful permanent resident status once his original\n\nineligibility therefor is determined in proceedings.\"              Id. at 551.\n\n           We accord Chevron deference to the BIA's interpretation.1\n\nSee INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 425 (1999) (recognizing\n\nthat \"the BIA should be accorded Chevron deference as it gives\n\nambiguous statutory terms 'concrete meaning through a process of\n\ncase-by-case adjudication'\") (quoting INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480\n\nU.S. 421, 448 (1987)); Naeem v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          Mejia-Orellana attempts to take advantage of the rule\nthat statutory interpretations by the IJ are not normally accorded\nChevron deference, see, e.g., Lin v. United States Dep't of\nJustice, 416 F.3d 184, 189-91 (2d Cir. 2005). Here, we review the\nBIA's interpretation, so Chevron deference applies.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f2006); see also Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\n467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).\n\n               The BIA's interpretation is reasonable.                    Indeed, any\n\nother reading would encourage fraud and misrepresentation in the\n\nprocess of application for lawful permanent resident status. Other\n\ncourts have upheld this interpretation of the same phrase in\n\ndifferent sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act: \"The\n\nnatural reading of 'lawful' connotes more than just procedural\n\nregularity; it suggests that the substance of an action complied\n\nwith the governing law.\"               De La Rosa v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland\n\nSec.,        489     F.3d     551,     554     (2d       Cir.     2007)   (construing\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(c), repealed in 1996, but still applicable in some\n\ncases, which granted the Attorney General discretion to waive\n\nremoval       for    certain    aliens    \"lawfully       admitted    for   permanent\n\nresidence\"); see also Savoury v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 449 F.3d 1307,\n\n1317       (11th    Cir.    2006)    (adopting     the    BIA's    interpretation   in\n\nKoloamatangi with respect to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(c)); Arellano-Garcia\n\nv. Gonzales, 429 F.3d 1183, 1187 (8th Cir. 2005) (same); Monet v.\n\nINS, 791 F.2d 752, 753-55 (9th Cir. 1986) (same); Matter of\n\nLongstaff, 716 F.2d 1439, 1441-42 (5th Cir. 1983) (interpreting 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1429, which requires lawful admission for permanent\n\nresidence as a prerequisite to naturalization).2\n\n\n       2\n          Our holding is consistent with Onwuamaegbu v. Gonzales,\n470 F.3d 405, 409 (1st Cir. 2006). In Onwuamaegbu, we held that an\nalien's misrepresentation on an application for change in status\n\n                                             -7-\n\f            Because Mejia-Orellana failed to disclose his arrest on\n\nhis application for lawful permanent residence, he was never\n\n\"lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" and so he is ineligible\n\nfor relief under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a).\n\nB.          Due Process\n\n            Mejia-Orellana claims that his due process rights were\n\nviolated because he had no notice and no reasonable opportunity to\n\nrespond to the allegations that he lied on his application for\n\nlawful permanent residence.           Initially, we doubt that Mejia-\n\nOrellana has a cognizable property or liberty interest at stake, a\n\nprerequisite   for   a    colorable   due   process   claim.   Jupiter   v.\n\nAshcroft, 396 F.3d 487, 492 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Mathews v.\n\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334-35 (1976)).         The statute provides for\n\ndiscretionary relief, which does not create a cognizable liberty\n\ninterest.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a); Jupiter, 396 F.3d at 492.\n\n            In any event, the claim of denial of due process is\n\nutterly without merit.      Mejia-Orellana had three hearings in front\n\nof the IJ and submitted a memorandum in support of his application\n\n\n\n\ndid not entitle him to claim that he had not been previously\nadmitted as a lawful resident and thereby escape the statute's\nseven-year residency requirement.       470 F.3d at 409.        We\ndistinguished Koloamatangi and Savoury because the focus in 8\nU.S.C. § 1182(h), unlike in 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a), is on whether a\nperson has been previously admitted, not on whether that admission\nwas lawful. Onwuamaegbu, 470 F.3d at 409.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\ffor a cancellation of removal after the argument that his lawful\n\npermanent resident status was void ab initio first was raised.\n\nC.        Waiver of Inadmissibility Under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h)\n\n          We do not consider Mejia-Orellana's claim that the IJ\n\nerred in denying him a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(h) because he failed to develop that claim sufficiently\n\nbefore the BIA. Rodrígues-Nascimento v. Gonzales, 485 F.3d 60, 62-\n\n63 (1st Cir. 2007); Olujoke v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 16, 22-23 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n          We deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

The Immigration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> and Naturalization Service (INS) denied reentry and instituted removal proceedings charging Mejia-Orellana was an inadmissible arriving alien under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), which classifies as inadmissible aliens who have been convicted of a crime relating to a controlled substance. Originally, the INS used the New York guilty plea as the basis for inadmissibility. In June 2003, however, the INS amended its charges and replaced the New York guilty plea with a September 2002 Florida conviction that stemmed from the 1985 Florida arrest.</p>\n<p>In pleadings submitted on November 24, 2003, Mejia-Orellana conceded his removability and designated Honduras as his removal country. In a hearing before the IJ on the same day, he admitted all of the INS's charges and asked for a cancellation of removal.

The BIA also determined that Mejia-Orellana was not denied due process.</p>\n<p>We affirm the BIA and deny the petition for review. In a matter of first impression, we uphold the BIA's interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) that an alien who has acquired his \"lawful permanent resident status\" by fraud or misrepresentation has not been lawfully admitted and so is ineligible for a cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Mejia-Orellana entered the United States without inspection in 1983. Two years later, he was arrested for criminal possession of marijuana over 20 grams in violation of Florida Statute § 893.13. He married a U.S. citizen in 1987, and in 1991 he applied for lawful permanent residence, but failed to disclose his 1985 arrest as he was required to do. He was granted permanent resident status on May 19, 1991.</p>\n<p>On April 13, 2002, Mejia-Orellana attempted to reenter the United States from the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. When he failed to present his I-551 Alien Registration Card, he was denied reentry and paroled for deferred inspection in Boston.</p>\n<p>During his inspection in Boston on July 24, 2002, Mejia-Orellana disclosed his 1985 Florida arrest for marijuana possession as well as a guilty plea for marijuana possession in New York in 1993. The Immigration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> and Naturalization Service (INS) denied reentry and instituted removal proceedings charging Mejia-Orellana was an inadmissible arriving alien under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), which classifies as inadmissible aliens who have been convicted of a crime relating to a controlled substance. Originally, the INS used the New York guilty plea as the basis for inadmissibility. In June 2003, however, the INS amended its charges and replaced the New York guilty plea with a September 2002 Florida conviction that stemmed from the 1985 Florida arrest.</p>\n<p>In pleadings submitted on November 24, 2003, Mejia-Orellana conceded his removability and designated Honduras as his removal country. In a hearing before the IJ on the same day, he admitted all of the INS's charges and asked for a cancellation of removal. In response, the INS argued that Mejia-Orellana's permanent resident status was void ab initio because of his failure to disclose his arrest on his application for adjustment of status in 1991.</p>\n<p>At three subsequent hearings, the INS raised the argument that Mejia-Orellana's lawful permanent resident status was void ab initio. Meanwhile, on December 6, 2004, Mejia-Orellana submitted a memorandum in support of his application for a cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) in which he admitted the misrepresentation on his 1991 application and argued that it did not render him inadmissible.</p>\n<p>The IJ's oral decision on April 25, 2005 rejected all of Mejia-Orellana's claims and ordered removal to Honduras pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). Following BIA precedent, the IJ found that Mejia-Orellana's application for a cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a) was pretermitted because his lawful permanent residence was obtained fraudulently and was thus void ab initio. In addition, the IJ rejected Mejia-Orellana's application for a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h).</p>\n<p>In a brief per curiam order, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's decision. The Board held that fraud or misrepresentation renders an acquisition of lawful permanent resident status void ab initio, and thus Mejia-Orellana was not eligible for a cancellation of removal. The Board noted that Mejia-Orellana did not \"meaningfully challenge on appeal\" the IJ's denial of a waiver of inadmissibility. In addition, the BIA found that Mejia-Orellana had ample opportunity to respond to the INS's charges of misrepresentation and therefore rejected his due process claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Mejia-Orellana makes several claims. First, he argues that the IJ erred in finding him ineligible for a cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a). Second, he claims that his due process rights were violated by his not being given an effective opportunity to respond to the allegations that he lied on his application for lawful permanent residence. Third, he argues that the IJ erred in finding him ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h).</p>\n<p>Because the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ's ruling and discussed some of the bases for the IJ's opinion, we review both opinions. <i>Ouk v.
