Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Juan F. Matos de Juan on Anders brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                             June 11, 2008\n\f              Per Curiam. Pedro Carrera-González admitted to violation\n\nof a condition of his supervised release term imposed as part of\n\nhis    sentence   for    a    1997   guilty      plea   to   a   drug    trafficking\n\nconspiracy and use of a firearm.               His violation was the commission\n\nof another federal offense: in 2006, Carrera pled guilty to a\n\ncharge of car-jacking in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2119(1), based\n\nupon    conduct   which      occurred     in    March   2005,    while   he   was   on\n\nsupervised release from his imprisonment for the 1997 offense. The\n\ndistrict court revoked his supervised release term and imposed a\n\nsentence of eighteen months, to be served consecutively to a fifty-\n\nmonth sentence for his car-jacking conviction.                   Carrera has filed\n\na notice of appeal.           Appellant's counsel has filed a brief under\n\nAnders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), asserting the lack of\n\nany meritorious ground for appeal, and has moved to withdraw as\n\ncounsel.      Carrera has not filed a separate pro se brief.                        As\n\nrequired by Anders, we have conducted a full examination of the\n\nproceedings.      Because it is clear that there are no meritorious\n\ngrounds for appeal, we affirm the revocation and sentence and grant\n\ncounsel's motion to withdraw.\n\n              \"We review revocation sentences for abuse of discretion.\"\n\nUnited States v. McInnis, 429 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).                        \"The\n\nstatutory maximum, based on the original offense rather than the\n\ngrade    of    release       violation,    ultimately        limits     the   court's\n\nsentencing discretion.\" Id.          Here, Carrera's original 1997 offense\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fof conspiracy to distribute multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine\n\nand crack cocaine was a Class A felony.                            The eighteen-month\n\nrevocation sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum for a\n\nClass A felony (5 years).           See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3).\n\n             Consistent with 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e), the court stated\n\nthat it had considered the factors set forth in § 3553(a)(1) before\n\nit arrived at the revocation sentence. The court took into account\n\nthe advisory guideline range under U.S.S.G. § 7B1.4, and imposed a\n\nsentence within that range (acknowledging that it was not required\n\nto    do   so).    See    McInnis,    429        F.3d    at    4    (\"Pursuant   to     §\n\n3553(a)(4)(B), the court need only consider, not implement, the\n\nadvisory     sentence     range     provided       in    the       guidelines'   policy\n\nstatements\").\n\n             Based upon a Grade A violation of supervised release (the\n\n2006 car-jacking offense) and a criminal history category (CHC) of\n\nI    for   the    1997   offense,    the    court       correctly      identified     the\n\nguideline imprisonment range as 12 - 18 months.                        At sentencing,\n\ndefense counsel argued that the district court should have applied\n\nthe guideline imprisonment range of 4 - 10 months contained in the\n\nMagistrate Judge's July 2005 Report and Recommendation. However,\n\nthe Report and Recommendation pre-dated Carrera's guilty plea to\n\nthe federal car-jacking offense on which this revocation was based.\n\nIt was prepared in connection with the Probation Officer's initial\n\nmotion for revocation based upon Carrera's arrest under Puerto Rico\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fcharges of robbery and firearm possession.    The Magistrate Judge\n\ndetermined that violation to be a \"Grade B violation,\" yielding the\n\nguideline range of 4 - 10 months under U.S.S.G. § 7B1.4.        The\n\nProbation Officer later filed an amended motion for revocation\n\nbased upon the federal car-jacking charge, which was correctly\n\ndetermined to be a \"Grade A violation,\" yielding a 12 - 18 month\n\nrange.1\n\n          The district court clarified in response to defense\n\ncounsel's request for reconsideration, that it had considered the\n\ncriminal history pre-dating the 1997 offense (not the 2006 offense)\n\nin arriving at the revocation sentence.   The record supports the\n\ndistrict court's statement that Carrera's \"criminal history up to\n\n[the commission of the 1997 offense] was violent.\" The presentence\n\ninvestigation report (PSR) for the 1997 offense reported a prior\n\ncriminal conviction of aggravated assault. See PSR, p. 8.    There\n\nwas no abuse of discretion in the sentencing court's consideration\n\nof that criminal history or the violent nature of the car-jacking\n\noffense in determining the length of the revocation sentence.\n\n          In imposing a consecutive sentence, the district court\n\ncorrectly stated that it was following the policy (rather than\n\nmandate) of the Sentencing Commission. See Sent. Tr., p. 13. There\n\n\n     1\n       U.S.S.G. 7B1.1 classifies violations according to the type\nof offense committed by the conduct of the releasee, and defines a\n\"crime of violence\" with reference to U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2, which in\nturn relies upon the statutory elements of the offense and\npotential punishments.\n\n                               -4-\n\fis no suggestion that the court misinterpreted the guidelines to\n\nrequire a consecutive sentence. Cf. United States v. Crudup, 375\n\nF.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding that 2003 amendment to U.S.S.G.\n\n§   5G1.3      worked   a   substantive    change    to     that   guideline    by\n\n\"encourag[ing] district courts to impose consecutive sentences,\n\nwhile at the same time permitting them - in the exercise of their\n\nsound discretion - to make the federal sentence concurrent\").\n\n               Carrera objected at the revocation sentencing hearing\n\nthat the negotiations that led to the amended plea agreement for\n\nthe   2006      car-jacking   offense     included    the     parties'    alleged\n\nagreement to recommend a 10-month, concurrent sentence in the\n\nrevocation case.        There is nothing in the amended plea agreement\n\nitself    to    indicate    that   any    such   promise     was   part   of   the\n\nnegotiation.2      Moreover, even if the parties had so agreed, there\n\nwould not have been a breach since the parties both did recommend\n\na   10-month     concurrent    sentence.         Finally,    the   amended     plea\n\nagreement was entered with respect to the 2006 offense which was\n\nbefore a different district court judge for sentencing than the\n\njudge who presided over the revocation proceedings in this case.\n\n\n      2\n       The amended plea agreement for the 2006 offense makes no\nmention of the pending revocation proceedings with respect to the\n1997 offense, and it contains a provision that the written\nagreement \"constitutes the complete agreement between the United\nStates, the defendant, and defendant's counsel,\" and that the\ngovernment \"has made no promises or representations except as set\nforth in writing in this plea agreement and den[ies] the existence\nof any other term and conditions not stated herein.\" Amended Plea\nAgreement, Dkt No. 121, ¶ 16.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fThere was no plea agreement entered with respect to the violation\n\nof supervised release.    The district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by failing to following the parties' recommendation to\n\nimpose a concurrent sentence.\n\n          The revocation of appellant's supervised release term and\n\nthe imposition of an 18-month consecutive sentence are affirmed.\n\nAppellant's counsel's motion to withdraw is granted.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
