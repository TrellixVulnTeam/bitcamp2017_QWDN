Petitioner Richard W. Johnson\n\nappeals the district court’s decision denying his petition for a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus.     He argues that the district court erred in\n\nconcluding that the state court did not unreasonably apply federal\n\nlaw or unreasonably determine facts because the identification\n\nprocedure used to convict him was unnecessarily suggestive and\n\ninherently unreliable.     For the following reasons, we will affirm\n\nthe district court's judgment denying Johnson’s petition for a writ\n\nof habeas corpus.\n\n                               I.    BACKGROUND\n\n           In    2003,   Johnson     was    convicted   on     one   count   of\n\nintimidation to steal from a depository in violation of Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 265, § 21, and one count of armed robbery in violation of\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 17.        The charges arose from a robbery of\n\na Shrewsbury CVS Pharmacy.          The Worcester Superior Court (“trial\n\ncourt”)   denied   Johnson’s    motion      to   suppress   evidence   of    the\n\nidentification     of    him    by    Joanne      Harrington    because      the\n\nidentification was not influenced by “any suggestion whatsoever by\n\nthe police” or by anything “that the police did or didn’t do.”\n\nJohnson eventually was sentenced to 11 to 13 years imprisonment.\n\nOn appeal, the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed, finding no\n\nerror in the trial court’s denial of Johnson’s motion to suppress.\n\nCommonwealth v. Johnson, 856 N.E.2d 206 (Mass. App. Ct. 2006)\n\n(unpublished table decision).         The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fCourt denied further review.      Commonwealth v. Johnson, 862 N.E.2d\n\n379 (Mass. 2007) (unpublished table decision).\n\n            In 2007, Johnson filed his petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in the federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254.\n\nAfter a hearing, the district court denied the petition and granted\n\na certificate of appealability on the identification issue.\n\n            Johnson   advanced   the   same    arguments       as   to   why   the\n\nidentification    procedure      was   unnecessarily           suggestive      and\n\ninherently unreliable before the state courts, the federal district\n\ncourt, and now this court.       Only Harrington was able to identify\n\nJohnson as one of the robbers.         Harrington was working the 6:00\n\np.m. to midnight shift when two men entered the otherwise empty\n\nstore.     She described the men as wearing matching shirts and\n\nshorts, very neat, with neat haircuts, and wearing hats with the\n\nbrim folded “so you really couldn’t see their eyes.”                After a few\n\nminutes   of   browsing,   the   shorter      of   the   two    men,     Johnson,\n\napproached her while she was sitting behind the prescription\n\ncounter in the back of the store.        She explained that the shorter\n\nman stood “right in front of her face” and looked her “right in the\n\neye.”    She said she got a good look at this face “for five or six\n\nseconds” in “very good” lighting conditions.             The shorter man then\n\nlifted his shirt, showing her a gun that was tucked in the top of\n\nhis pants, and told her to “get up, go to the safe, and get him all\n\nthe oxycontin.”    She gave him seven bottles of oxycontin, and the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\frobbers left.      The whole incident lasted about five minutes.\n\nHarrington was terrified by the incident, “kind of collapsed” and\n\n“started crying” when the robbers left, and had emergency medical\n\ntechnicians monitor her for rapid heart palpitations.\n\n            Harrington described the robbers to two police officers\n\n– Officer Mentzer and Detective Cappucci – shortly after the\n\nrobbery.    She described the shorter man as a white male, 5’3” tall,\n\naverage build, clean shaven, baby-faced, early twenties, short\n\nstrawberry    blond   hair   cut   above   his   ears,   neatly   dressed   in\n\nmatching beige clothes, Boston accent, and carrying a shiny handgun\n\nwith black grips which was tucked into his left waistband.             About\n\none week later, Detective Cappucci showed Harrington four arrays of\n\neight black-and-white pictures, and she did not identify any of\n\nthem as the robber.     Approximately two-and-a-half weeks later, he\n\nshowed her four more photo arrays with eight photographs, and she\n\ndid not identify any as the robber.              Then, five months later,\n\nCappucci told her that a “lead had opened up” in the case, showed\n\nher one more array of eight black-and-white photos, and asked her\n\n“to identify one of the pictures as the suspect.”             She testified\n\nthat she “did not know if there was a suspect in [this array] or\n\nnot,” was looking for a man with short strawberry blond hair, and\n\nidentified Johnson as the robber based on his “face, the eyes, the\n\nlook.”     The final photo array consisted of five pictures of men\n\nwith dark hair, and Johnson alleges that his picture was the only\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fone of a man with light hair, not wearing a shirt, squinting, and\n\nwith a surly looking, intoxicated expression.                 Harrington stated\n\nthat she was absolutely, one hundred percent positive that this was\n\nthe    person   who   robbed     her,   and    Cappucci   told      her   that   she\n\nidentified the “correct person.”              She learned that the suspect’s\n\nname was Richard Johnson and later identified him in court.\n\n                           II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n              We review the district court’s legal conclusions de novo,\n\nand the factual conclusions de novo when, as here, the district\n\ncourt does not undertake independent factfinding.                Teti v. Bender,\n\n507 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2007).                Under the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), we review state\n\ncourt legal and factual determinations under a limited and highly\n\ndeferential standard: an application for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nshall not be granted unless the state court decision upon which it\n\nis    based   (1)   “was   contrary     to,   or   involved    an    unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n\nthe Supreme Court of the United States” or (2) involved “an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\n\npresented in the State court proceeding.”                 State court factual\n\nfindings “shall be presumed to be correct,” and “[t]he applicant\n\nshall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness\n\nby clear and convincing evidence.”             28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)-(e); see\n\nalso Teti, 507 F.3d at 56-57.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f           The claim was properly exhausted, so Johnson must show\n\nthat the state court’s determinations, legal or factual, were\n\n“objectively unreasonable” to prevail.       See Miller-El v. Cockrell,\n\n537 U.S. 322, 340 (2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 409\n\n(2000).   It is not sufficient for the state court’s decision to be\n\nerroneous, incorrect, or clear error.       See Lockyer v. Andrade, 538\n\nU.S. 63, 75-76 (2003); Williams, 529 U.S. at 410-11.                 For the\n\n“unreasonable application” prong, the range of reasonable judgment\n\ndepends on the nature of the rule: “[t]he more general the rule,\n\nthe more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case\n\ndeterminations.”     Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 663-64\n\n(2004).   For the “unreasonable determination of facts” prong, a\n\npetitioner must show that state court factual determinations were\n\nobjectively unreasonable by clear and convincing evidence.               See\n\nMiller-El, 537 U.S. at 341-42.\n\n                            III.    ANALYSIS\n\n           The district court did not err in denying Johnson’s\n\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus.       In response to the argument\n\nthat Detective Cappucci improperly told Harrington that he had a\n\nlead and to identify one of the photographs as the suspect, the\n\ndistrict court stated that “she also said that she did not know at\n\nthe time she was shown that there was the suspect in that array and\n\ndid not remember being told that there was a suspect in that\n\narray.”    It   reasoned   that   even   though   the   case   was   “thin,”\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fHarrington “had a vivid memory of the events . . . [and] was being\n\ncautious as to the identification.” The state trial court was best\n\nsuited     to    make       the      credibility        determination,       and     that\n\ndetermination deserved deference.\n\n            In addition, the state court decision did not result in\n\nan unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.                        Pretrial\n\nidentifications violate due process requirements when they are “so\n\nimpermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial\n\nlikelihood      of   irreparable       misidentification.”            See    Manson    v.\n\nBrathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 105 n.8 (1977) (quoting Simmons v. United\n\nStates, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968)).                    The Supreme Court explained\n\nthat “reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility\n\nof   identification          testimony”         and     when     making     reliability\n\ndeterminations, the court should consider the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, including the following factors: “the opportunity of\n\nthe witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the\n\nwitness’ degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description\n\nof   the   criminal,     the      level   of    certainty       demonstrated    at    the\n\nconfrontation,        and      the     time     between        the   crime    and     the\n\nconfrontation.”        Id. at 114 (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188,\n\n199-200 (1972)).\n\n            Johnson      argues       that    the     Massachusetts    Appeals      Court\n\ndecision unreasonably applied Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, and Stovall\n\nv. Denno, 388        U.S. 293 (1967).          He argues that the identification\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fwas unnecessarily suggestive because (1) Cappucci’s statement that\n\na “lead had opened up” was improper, (2) the direction “to identify\n\none of the pictures as the suspect” was impermissibly suggestive,\n\n(3) anyone would have selected Johnson because he was the only one\n\nthat appeared shirtless and squinting with a distinctive surly\n\nintoxicated expression, (4) subsequent identifications were tainted\n\nwhen Cappucci told her that she selected the “correct person” and\n\n(5) Harrington’s testimony was less credible because she denied\n\nthat Cappucci told her about the lead and that she had selected the\n\ncorrect person.      He then argues that the identification was not\n\nreliable because (1) she was distracted and focused on the gun, not\n\nthe robber’s face; (2) she was too distraught and terrified to\n\naccurately identify Johnson; (3) she admitted that his cap was bent\n\nso that she couldn’t see his eyes but identified Johnson from his\n\neyes; (4) she only looked at him for a few seconds; (5) her prior\n\nidentification was minimal and inconsistent; and (6) although her\n\nlevel of certainty was high, over five months had passed.\n\n           However, this does not explain how the state appeals\n\ncourt determination was an unreasonable application of Supreme\n\nCourt   precedent.     The   state   court   factual   findings   were   not\n\nobjectively unreasonable under Brathwaite or Stovall.\n\n           The Supreme Court upheld the identification procedures in\n\nBrathwaite and Stovall.       In Brathwaite, the identification was\n\npermissible when the witness, an undercover police officer, was\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fonly shown one picture; the procedure was sufficient because of his\n\nability to make an accurate identification (observation in close\n\nrange by a trained officer in natural lighting conditions and\n\nidentification two days later).              Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at 99-101,\n\n114-16.      In Stovall, an in-person identification was permissible\n\nwhen the suspect was the only African-American suspect in the room\n\nbecause of exigent circumstances (suspect had stabbed witness\n\neleven times and was brought to the hospital the day after surgery\n\nfor identification). Stovall, 388 U.S. at 295, 302. Here, Johnson\n\nwas   part    of    a   lineup,    not    alone   in   person     or   by   a    single\n\nphotograph.        Although five of the men allegedly had dark hair, and\n\nHarrington was looking for a man with strawberry blond hair, there\n\nis    no   requirement     to     include   a     certain   number     of   “filler”\n\nphotographs in an array.           Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at 117.             The trial\n\ncourt’s credibility determinations – that Harrington was “clear and\n\ndirect” with a “vivid memory” and her memory, not the actions of\n\nthe police, led to the identification – are accorded a presumption\n\nof correctness.         Norton v. Spencer, 351 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThese      determinations       were     supported     by   the    record       because\n\nHarrington gave detailed descriptions of the robbers and stated\n\nthat she did not know whether the suspect was in the array and did\n\nnot choose Johnson because he was shirtless or because he was\n\nsquinting.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f           Consideration of the Brathwaite factors does not require\n\na contrary conclusion.     Harrington had the opportunity to see the\n\nrobber’s face, even his eyes, when he approached her at the counter\n\nand looked her in the eyes for several seconds under good lighting\n\nconditions.       Brief   encounters      are   sufficient   for    proper\n\nidentifications.     See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at 114 (two to three\n\nminutes was sufficient).     She provided an accurate description of\n\nJohnson’s height, clothing, hair color, and hair style.         Her level\n\nof certainty was high; she was “one hundred percent positive,” and\n\nthere is no question that the photograph was that of Johnson.\n\nThere is no evidence that any of the prior arrays included a\n\npicture of Johnson, and her prior action supports the conclusion\n\nthat she resisted whatever suggestiveness inheres in a photo array.\n\nAlthough   over    five   months   had    lapsed,   courts   have   upheld\n\nidentifications made after longer periods of time.            See, e.g.,\n\nBiggers, 409 U.S. at 201 (involving a lapse of seven months).\n\n                            IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s decision\n\ndenying Johnson’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

She described the men as wearing matching shirts and\n\nshorts, very neat, with neat haircuts, and wearing hats with the\n\nbrim folded “so you really couldn’t see their eyes.”                After a few\n\nminutes   of   browsing,   the   shorter      of   the   two    men,     Johnson,\n\napproached her while she was sitting behind the prescription\n\ncounter in the back of the store.        She explained that the shorter\n\nman stood “right in front of her face” and looked her “right in the\n\neye.”    She said she got a good look at this face “for five or six\n\nseconds” in “very good” lighting conditions.             The shorter man then\n\nlifted his shirt, showing her a gun that was tucked in the top of\n\nhis pants, and told her to “get up, go to the safe, and get him all\n\nthe oxycontin.”    She gave him seven bottles of oxycontin, and the\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\frobbers left.      The whole incident lasted about five minutes.\n\nHarrington was terrified by the incident, “kind of collapsed” and\n\n“started crying” when the robbers left, and had emergency medical\n\ntechnicians monitor her for rapid heart palpitations.\n\n            Harrington described the robbers to two police officers\n\n– Officer Mentzer and Detective Cappucci – shortly after the\n\nrobbery.    She described the shorter man as a white male, 5’3” tall,\n\naverage build, clean shaven, baby-faced, early twenties, short\n\nstrawberry    blond   hair   cut   above   his   ears,   neatly   dressed   in\n\nmatching beige clothes, Boston accent, and carrying a shiny handgun\n\nwith black grips which was tucked into his left waistband.             About\n\none week later, Detective Cappucci showed Harrington four arrays of\n\neight black-and-white pictures, and she did not identify any of\n\nthem as the robber.     Approximately two-and-a-half weeks later, he\n\nshowed her four more photo arrays with eight photographs, and she\n\ndid not identify any as the robber.              Then, five months later,\n\nCappucci told her that a “lead had opened up” in the case, showed\n\nher one more array of eight black-and-white photos, and asked her\n\n“to identify one of the pictures as the suspect.”             She testified\n\nthat she “did not know if there was a suspect in [this array] or\n\nnot,” was looking for a man with short strawberry blond hair, and\n\nidentified Johnson as the robber based on his “face, the eyes, the\n\nlook.”     The final photo array consisted of five pictures of men\n\nwith dark hair, and Johnson alleges that his picture was the only\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fone of a man with light hair, not wearing a shirt, squinting, and\n\nwith a surly looking, intoxicated expression.                 Harrington stated\n\nthat she was absolutely, one hundred percent positive that this was\n\nthe    person   who   robbed     her,   and    Cappucci   told      her   that   she\n\nidentified the “correct person.”              She learned that the suspect’s\n\nname was Richard Johnson and later identified him in court.\n\n                           II.

Under the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), we review state\n\ncourt legal and factual determinations under a limited and highly\n\ndeferential standard: an application for a writ of habeas corpus\n\nshall not be granted unless the state court decision upon which it\n\nis    based   (1)   “was   contrary     to,   or   involved    an    unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n\nthe Supreme Court of the United States” or (2) involved “an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\n\npresented in the State court proceeding.”                 State court factual\n\nfindings “shall be presumed to be correct,” and “[t]he applicant\n\nshall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness\n\nby clear and convincing evidence.”             28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)-(e); see\n\nalso Teti, 507 F.3d at 56-57.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f           The claim was properly exhausted, so Johnson must show\n\nthat the state court’s determinations, legal or factual, were\n\n“objectively unreasonable” to prevail.

Cockrell,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122258\"><a href=\"/opinion/122258/miller-el-v-cockrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340 (2003); Williams v.

It is not sufficient for the state court’s decision to be\n\nerroneous, incorrect, or clear error.       See Lockyer v. Andrade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127898\"><a href=\"/opinion/127898/lockyer-v-andrade/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75-76 (2003); Williams, 529 U.S. at 410-11.                 For the\n\n“unreasonable application” prong, the range of reasonable judgment\n\ndepends on the nature of the rule: “[t]he more general the rule,\n\nthe more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case\n\ndeterminations.”     Yarborough v.

For the “unreasonable determination of facts” prong, a\n\npetitioner must show that state court factual determinations were\n\nobjectively unreasonable by clear and convincing evidence.               See\n\nMiller-El, 537 U.S. at 341-42.\n\n                            III.    ANALYSIS\n\n           The district court did not err in denying Johnson’s\n\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus.       In response to the argument\n\nthat Detective Cappucci improperly told Harrington that he had a\n\nlead and to identify one of the photographs as the suspect, the\n\ndistrict court stated that “she also said that she did not know at\n\nthe time she was shown that there was the suspect in that array and\n\ndid not remember being told that there was a suspect in that\n\narray.”    It   reasoned   that   even   though   the   case   was   “thin,”\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fHarrington “had a vivid memory of the events . . . [and] was being\n\ncautious as to the identification.” The state trial court was best\n\nsuited     to    make       the      credibility        determination,       and     that\n\ndetermination deserved deference.\n\n            In addition, the state court decision did not result in\n\nan unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent.                        Pretrial\n\nidentifications violate due process requirements when they are “so\n\nimpermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial\n\nlikelihood      of   irreparable       misidentification.”            See    Manson    v.\n\nBrathwaite, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109693\"><a href=\"/opinion/109693/manson-v-brathwaite/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 n.8 (1977) (quoting Simmons v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107636\"><a href=\"/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384 (1968)).                    The Supreme Court explained\n\nthat “reliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility\n\nof   identification          testimony”         and     when     making     reliability\n\ndeterminations, the court should consider the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, including the following factors: “the opportunity of\n\nthe witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the\n\nwitness’ degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description\n\nof   the   criminal,     the      level   of    certainty       demonstrated    at    the\n\nconfrontation,        and      the     time     between        the   crime    and     the\n\nconfrontation.”        Id. at 114 (citing Neil v.

Denno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107488\"><a href=\"/opinion/107488/stovall-v-denno/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span>        <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1967).          He argues that the identification\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fwas unnecessarily suggestive because (1) Cappucci’s statement that\n\na “lead had opened up” was improper, (2) the direction “to identify\n\none of the pictures as the suspect” was impermissibly suggestive,\n\n(3) anyone would have selected Johnson because he was the only one\n\nthat appeared shirtless and squinting with a distinctive surly\n\nintoxicated expression, (4) subsequent identifications were tainted\n\nwhen Cappucci told her that she selected the “correct person” and\n\n(5) Harrington’s testimony was less credible because she denied\n\nthat Cappucci told her about the lead and that she had selected the\n\ncorrect person.      He then argues that the identification was not\n\nreliable because (1) she was distracted and focused on the gun, not\n\nthe robber’s face; (2) she was too distraught and terrified to\n\naccurately identify Johnson; (3) she admitted that his cap was bent\n\nso that she couldn’t see his eyes but identified Johnson from his\n\neyes; (4) she only looked at him for a few seconds; (5) her prior\n\nidentification was minimal and inconsistent; and (6) although her\n\nlevel of certainty was high, over five months had passed.\n\n           However, this does not explain how the state appeals\n\ncourt determination was an unreasonable application of Supreme\n\nCourt   precedent.     The   state   court   factual   findings   were   not\n\nobjectively unreasonable under Brathwaite or Stovall.\n\n           The Supreme Court upheld the identification procedures in\n\nBrathwaite and Stovall.       In Brathwaite, the identification was\n\npermissible when the witness, an undercover police officer, was\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fonly shown one picture; the procedure was sufficient because of his\n\nability to make an accurate identification (observation in close\n\nrange by a trained officer in natural lighting conditions and\n\nidentification two days later).              Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at 99-101,\n\n114-16.      In Stovall, an in-person identification was permissible\n\nwhen the suspect was the only African-American suspect in the room\n\nbecause of exigent circumstances (suspect had stabbed witness\n\neleven times and was brought to the hospital the day after surgery\n\nfor identification). Stovall, 388 U.S. at 295, 302. Here, Johnson\n\nwas   part    of    a   lineup,    not    alone   in   person     or   by   a    single\n\nphotograph.        Although five of the men allegedly had dark hair, and\n\nHarrington was looking for a man with strawberry blond hair, there\n\nis    no   requirement     to     include   a     certain   number     of   “filler”\n\nphotographs in an array.           Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at 117.             The trial\n\ncourt’s credibility determinations – that Harrington was “clear and\n\ndirect” with a “vivid memory” and her memory, not the actions of\n\nthe police, led to the identification – are accorded a presumption\n\nof correctness.         Norton v. Spencer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200728\"><a href=\"/opinion/200728/norton-v-spencer/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThese      determinations       were     supported     by   the    record       because\n\nHarrington gave detailed descriptions of the robbers and stated\n\nthat she did not know whether the suspect was in the array and did\n\nnot choose Johnson because he was shirtless or because he was\n\nsquinting.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f           Consideration of the Brathwaite factors does not require\n\na contrary conclusion.     Harrington had the opportunity to see the\n\nrobber’s face, even his eyes, when he approached her at the counter\n\nand looked her in the eyes for several seconds under good lighting\n\nconditions.       Brief   encounters      are   sufficient   for    proper\n\nidentifications.     See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at 114 (two to three\n\nminutes was sufficient).     She provided an accurate description of\n\nJohnson’s height, clothing, hair color, and hair style.         Her level\n\nof certainty was high; she was “one hundred percent positive,” and\n\nthere is no question that the photograph was that of Johnson.\n\nThere is no evidence that any of the prior arrays included a\n\npicture of Johnson, and her prior action supports the conclusion\n\nthat she resisted whatever suggestiveness inheres in a photo array.\n\nAlthough   over    five   months   had    lapsed,   courts   have   upheld\n\nidentifications made after longer periods of time.            See, e.g.,\n\nBiggers, 409 U.S. at 201 (involving a lapse of seven months).\n\n                            IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s decision\n\ndenying Johnson’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f</pre>",
