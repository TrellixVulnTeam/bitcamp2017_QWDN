Plaintiff-appellant Alma Matos\n\nappeals from the district court's denial of preliminary injunctive\n\nrelief.    She has filed two appeals, the second of which is wholly\n\nderivative of the first.1       We treat the matter, as have the\n\nparties, as a single appeal, exercising appellate jurisdiction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).    After careful perscrutation of the\n\nrecord, we find that the appeal is largely moot.         What remains\n\njusticiable does not warrant disturbing the district court's order.\n\n            Because this appeal turns principally on its procedural\n\nposture, we offer only a decurtate account of the facts.\n\n            The plaintiff matriculated at Clinton High School.     By\n\nthe fall of 2002, she had reached her senior year.    She ranked near\n\nthe top of her class and was a member of the National Honor Society\n\n(NHS).    On December 18, 2002, the plaintiff's academic career took\n\na turn for the bizarre.   We paraphrase her account of the relevant\n\nevents.\n\n            During a journalism class, the plaintiff began using a\n\nschool computer to complete an assignment.        She claims to have\n\nlapsed into some private thoughts (which, as matters turned out,\n\ninvolved an alleged sexual dalliance between her teacher and the\n\nprincipal of the high school).      She typed those thoughts into the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      After the district court denied the plaintiff's motion for a\npreliminary injunction, she appealed. She then moved for a stay\nand filed a second notice of appeal upon the denial of that motion.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fcomputer, printed out her handiwork, returned to her seat, and\n\nplaced what she had written among her personal papers.\n\n            The teacher became suspicious and demanded to see the\n\ndocument.     When the plaintiff refused, the teacher resorted to\n\nself-help. Before she could read the paper, however, the plaintiff\n\nsnatched it from her hand.        Finding this behavior intolerable, the\n\nteacher escorted the plaintiff to the principal's office.                 The\n\nprincipal read the document, deemed it offensive, and summoned the\n\nplaintiff's mother to the school for a discussion.                Presumably\n\nbecause he himself was implicated, the principal advised the\n\nplaintiff's mother that he would refer the matter to the vice-\n\nprincipal.      By letter dated December 30, 2002, the vice-principal\n\nsuspended the plaintiff from school for ten days.            The suspension\n\nletter,   addressed    to   the   plaintiff's   parents,     attributed   her\n\nsuspension to \"[p]rofanity, inappropriate use of a computer and\n\ndefamation of character.\"\n\n             Hot on the heels of this suspension, the plaintiff sued\n\nthe   Clinton    School   District   and   a   gallimaufry   of   individual\n\ndefendants (including the principal, the vice-principal, and the\n\nteacher).     Her complaint invoked 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and asserted,\n\ninter alia, claims that the defendants had (i) deprived her of\n\nprocedural due process incident to the suspension, (ii) abridged\n\nher right of free expression, (iii) invaded her right of privacy,\n\nand (iv) conducted an unlawful search and seizure.            The complaint\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fprayed for an amalgam of relief, including a temporary restraining\n\norder (TRO) and a preliminary injunction.\n\n          The district court granted a TRO ex parte.              A few weeks\n\nlater, the court heard the matter on the plaintiff's motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction.          That motion requested five strains of\n\npreliminary injunctive relief: (i) an order allowing the plaintiff\n\nto return to school immediately; (ii) a mandatory injunction\n\nrequiring the defendants to expunge any reference to the incident\n\nfrom the plaintiff's high-school records \"until Defendants have\n\ncomplied with the due process requirements of state law and the\n\nClinton   High     School        Student     Handbook     regarding    student\n\nsuspensions\";     (iii)     an   order     enjoining    the   defendants   from\n\nnotifying colleges about the suspension; (iv) an order prohibiting\n\nthe defendants from altering the contents of the computer on which\n\nthe plaintiff had been working at the time of the incident; and (v)\n\nan order barring the defendants from taking any adverse action with\n\nrespect to the plaintiff's status as an NHS member.\n\n          On     February    11,    2003,    the   district    court   filed   a\n\nthoughtful rescript dissolving the TRO and denying the motion for\n\npreliminary injunction in its entirety.                Matos v. Clinton Sch.\n\nDist., Civ. No. 03-40010, slip op. (D. Mass. Feb. 11, 2003)\n\n(unpublished).     This proceeding ensued.\n\n          We need not tarry.             It is apodictic that a federal\n\nappellate court may only exercise jurisdiction over actual cases or\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fcontroversies.         U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.             The case-or-\n\ncontroversy requirement applies independently to the underlying\n\naction and to any appeal arising therefrom.                  See, e.g., Roe v.\n\nWade,    410    U.S.    113,   125   (1973)    (explaining    that    \"an   actual\n\ncontroversy must exist at stages of appellate . . . review, and not\n\nsimply at the date the action is initiated\"); Thomas R.W. v. Mass.\n\nDep't of Educ., 130 F.3d 477, 479 (1st Cir. 1997) (same).                   As to\n\nthe latter, a cognizable case or controversy must exist not merely\n\nat the time an appeal is taken, but at all subsequent stages of\n\nappellate review.        See County Motors, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp.,\n\n278 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 2002); Oakville Dev. Corp. v. FDIC, 986\n\nF.2d 611, 613 (1st Cir. 1993).                If events occur following the\n\ninstitution of an appeal that make it impossible for the appellate\n\ncourt to provide effective relief, the case or controversy is no\n\nlonger justiciable.            See Newspaper Guild of Salem v. Ottaway\n\nNewspapers, Inc., 79 F.3d 1273, 1277 (1st Cir. 1996); CMM Cable\n\nRep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc., 48 F.3d 618, 621 (1st Cir.\n\n1995).\n\n               This is an interlocutory appeal.          It is brought for the\n\nsole purpose of testing whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion      or   otherwise    erred   in   denying    certain     preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief.         The aim of a preliminary injunction \"is to\n\npreserve the status quo, freezing an existing situation so as to\n\npermit the trial court, upon full adjudication of the case's\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fmerits, more effectively to remedy discerned wrongs.\"             CMM Cable\n\nRep., 48 F.3d at 620.     Allowing an immediate appeal of an order\n\ngranting or denying a preliminary injunction is an exception to the\n\nfinal judgment rule.     The exception arises out of a desire to\n\nprevent irreparable harm to parties \"who, otherwise, might triumph\n\nat trial but be left holding an empty bag.\"         Id.   When this harm-\n\npreventing function cannot be served by the successful prosecution\n\nof an interlocutory appeal from the grant or denial of preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief, then the justiciability of the appeal itself is,\n\nto that extent, called into question.       Id. at 621.\n\n          It is against this backdrop that we turn to the five\n\nstrains of interim injunctive relief originally requested by the\n\nplaintiff. The posture of the case has changed in significant ways\n\nsince the plaintiff initially made her motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction: to name two, she has served her ten-day suspension and\n\nhas graduated from Clinton High School.       Thus, her first prayer —\n\nthat a preliminary injunction issue to compel the defendants to\n\nforgo the suspension and reinstate her immediately — no longer\n\npresents a live controversy.      This court lacks the power to turn\n\nback the clock and, accordingly, this aspect of the appeal is moot.\n\n          Similarly,    the   plaintiff's   third    prayer   —   that   the\n\ndefendants be enjoined pendente lite from notifying colleges about\n\nher suspension — is by the boards.      The plaintiff has completed the\n\ncollege application process and now attends a college of her\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fchoice.   Thus, this aspect of the appeal also has been rendered\n\nmoot by the passage of time.\n\n          So too the plaintiff's fifth prayer for preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief. The NHS is a high-school honor society, and the\n\nplaintiff had sought to have the defendants preliminarily enjoined\n\nfrom taking any steps that might adversely affect her status as a\n\nmember of that organization.   However, the NHS has held a hearing\n\nand determined not to revoke the plaintiff's membership.        The\n\nplaintiff is no longer a high-school student and, therefore, her\n\nNHS membership is in no further jeopardy. Under the circumstances,\n\nthe fifth prayer for preliminary injunctive relief has become moot.\n\n          The plaintiff suggests that her other prayers for relief\n\nsuffice to keep her appeal buoyant.      These prayers collectively\n\nencompass her requests for expungement of her high-school record\n\nand for preservation of the computer.      As now framed,2 neither\n\nmatter is moot in the technical sense.    See, e.g., Coady Corp. v.\n\nToyota Motor Distribs., Inc., 361 F.3d 50, 61-62 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThe plaintiff retains a continuing interest both in the contents of\n\nher high-school record (which may again become relevant as she\n\n\n     2\n      The plaintiff's second prayer asked only that the defendants\nbe ordered to purge the records \"until Defendants have complied\nwith the due process requirements of state law and the Clinton High\nSchool Student Handbook regarding student suspensions.\" Because\nthe suspension has been served and the plaintiff has graduated,\nthat prayer, strictly speaking, also is moot.       The plaintiff,\nhowever, now argues that she really wanted a broader form of\nexpungement pendente lite. Rather than quibble over doctrines such\nas waiver and forfeiture, we meet this argument head-on.\n\n                               -7-\n\flooks ahead to graduate school or real-world employment) and in\n\nensuring that the computer is not corrupted.       But even though\n\nintervening events have not destroyed our ability to grant the\n\nrequested relief on an interim basis, these surviving prayers are\n\ntoo asthenic to support a preliminary injunction.        We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n            The preliminary injunction standard is familiar.   Under\n\nit, a district court typically must consider four elements:      the\n\nprobability of the movant's success on the merits, the prospect of\n\nirreparable harm absent the injunction, the balance of the relevant\n\nequities (focusing upon the hardship to the movant if an injunction\n\ndoes not issue as contrasted with the hardship to the nonmovant if\n\nit does), and the effect of the court's action on the public\n\ninterest. Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d\n\n12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996); Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, 934\n\nF.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1991).      We need not discuss three of these\n\nelements.     In most cases — and this case is no exception —\n\nirreparable harm is a necessary threshold showing for awarding\n\npreliminary injunctive relief.    See, e.g., Phillips v. Marsh, 687\n\nF.2d 620, 622 (2d Cir. 1982).   Inasmuch as the plaintiff has failed\n\nto demonstrate a realistic prospect of irreparable harm, she has\n\nnot crossed that threshold.\n\n            To the extent that the plaintiff focuses on her fourth\n\nprayer for preliminary injunctive relief, she simply cannot show\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fany real danger of harm.       She claims that she remains fearful that\n\nthe defendants, if not enjoined, may \"tamper[] with the hard drive\n\nof the computer.\"        Appellant's Reply Br. at 3.            This fear is\n\nobjectively unreasonable.           The defendants have had possession of\n\nthe computer since the incident occurred.             For most of that time —\n\nwell over fourteen months, as of this writing — they have not been\n\nunder   any    court   order   to    preserve   its   hard   drive.    If   the\n\ndefendants have not tampered with the computer during the lengthy\n\ninterval that elapsed after the lifting of the TRO, there is no\n\nplausible basis for speculating that such tampering will occur\n\nbefore the case is tried.\n\n              A preliminary injunction should not issue except to\n\nprevent a real threat of harm.           Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 19; 11A\n\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary Kay Kane, Federal\n\nPractice & Procedure § 2948.1, at 153-54 (2d ed. 1995).               A threat\n\nthat is either unlikely to materialize or purely theoretical will\n\nnot do.   Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 19; Pub. Serv. Co. v. Town of W.\n\nNewbury, 835 F.2d 380, 382 (1st Cir. 1987).               An imminent threat\n\nthat evidence will be lost is one thing — but a claimed threat,\n\nunaccompanied by any showing of reasonable grounds for believing\n\nthat the evidence in question is imperilled, is insufficient to\n\nwarrant the entry of a prophylactic injunction.              Humble Oil & Ref.\n\nCo. v. Harang, 262 F. Supp. 39, 42-43 (E.D. La. 1966).            Preliminary\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\finjunctions are strong medicine, and they should not issue merely\n\nto calm the imaginings of the movant.3\n\n               The    plaintiff's       reliance   on    her    second    prayer    for\n\npreliminary injunctive relief is no more rewarding.                       That prayer\n\nentails       her    demand    that     her   high-school       records    be    purged\n\ntemporarily of any reference to the incident and/or the suspension.\n\nShe asserts that this information, if allowed to stand in the\n\ninstitution's records, could harm her in the future should she\n\napply    to    graduate       schools    or   require     any    kind     of    security\n\nclearance.\n\n               We agree that this issue, overall, remains a matter of\n\nconcern:       the plaintiff's high-school records are something in\n\nwhich she has a continuing interest.                Nevertheless, that is not\n\ntantamount to saying that she is entitled to protect that interest\n\nby means of a preliminary injunction.                   The claim for expungement\n\nlacks immediacy; the record reflects no reason why that relief, if\n\ndue, cannot await a full-dress trial.              If a case can be adjudicated\n\non the merits before the harm complained of will occur, there is no\n\nsufficient          justification     for     preliminary       injunctive       relief.\n\n\n\n     3\n      If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — tampering\nwith the computer would leave the defendants open to a charge of\nspoliation of evidence.    See, e.g., Blinzler v. Marriot Int'l,\nInc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir. 1996); Nation-Wide Check Corp.\nv. Forest Hills Distribs., Inc., 692 F.2d 214, 217 (1st Cir. 1982).\nGiven that the main case remains to be tried and that the plaintiff\nis seeking substantial damages, the presence of that deterrent\nfurther reduces any risk of tampering.\n\n                                            -10-\n\fHoliday Inns of Am., Inc. v. B & B Corp., 409 F.2d 614, 618 (3d\n\nCir. 1969); 11A Wright, Miller, & Kane, supra § 2948.1, at 149.\n\n            That rule applies here. The plaintiff is more than three\n\nyears away from college graduation.    She has alleged no short-term\n\nintention of applying for either admission to a graduate school or\n\nemployment requiring a security clearance.    Absent something that\n\nindicates a need for immediate relief, a plaintiff's request for a\n\npreliminary injunction ordinarily ought to be rejected. See, e.g.,\n\nPub. Serv. Co., 835 F.2d at 382-83; Phillips, 687 F.2d at 622.    So\n\nit is here.\n\n            We need go no further.   While the plaintiff's complaint\n\nraises a number of claims that remain live, the passage of time and\n\nthe occurrence of a series of easily predictable events have\n\nminimized any need for a preliminary injunction.     Her motion for\n\nsuch relief is, for the most part, moot.   What little of it remains\n\njusticiable presents no adequate basis for a finding of irreparable\n\nharm.4   For these reasons, we summarily reject her appeal.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Should circumstances again change prior to trial so as to\npresent a cognizable danger of irreparable harm, the plaintiff\nremains free to renew her motion for a preliminary injunction. See\nHoliday Inns of Am., 409 F.2d at 618-19.\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

It is brought for the sole purpose of testing whether the district court abused its discretion or otherwise erred in denying certain <i>preliminary</i> injunctive relief. The aim of a preliminary injunction \"is to preserve the status quo, freezing an existing situation so as to permit the trial court, upon full adjudication of the case's merits, more effectively to remedy discerned wrongs.\" <i>CMM Cable Rep.,</i> 48 F.3d at 620. Allowing an immediate appeal of an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction is an exception to the final judgment rule. The exception arises out of a desire to prevent irreparable harm to parties \"who, otherwise, might triumph at trial but be left holding an empty bag.\" <i>Id.</i> When this harm-preventing function cannot be served by the successful prosecution of an interlocutory appeal from the grant or denial of preliminary injunctive relief, then the justiciability of the appeal itself is, to that extent, called into question. <i>Id.</i> at 621.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is against this backdrop that we turn to the five strains of interim injunctive relief originally requested by the plaintiff. The posture of the case has changed in significant ways since the plaintiff initially made her motion for a preliminary injunction: to name two, she has served her ten-day suspension and has graduated from Clinton High School. Thus, her first prayer &#8212; that a preliminary injunction issue to compel the defendants to forgo the suspension and reinstate her immediately &#8212; no longer presents a live controversy. This court lacks the power to turn back the clock and, accordingly, this aspect of the appeal is moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the plaintiff's third prayer &#8212; that the defendants be enjoined <i>pendente lite</i> from notifying colleges about her suspension &#8212; is by the boards. The plaintiff has completed the college application process and now attends a college of her choice. Thus, this aspect of the appeal also has been rendered moot by the passage of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So too the plaintiff's fifth prayer for preliminary injunctive relief. The NHS is a high-school honor society, and the plaintiff had sought to have the defendants preliminarily enjoined from taking any steps that might adversely affect her status as a member of that organization. However, the NHS has held a hearing and determined not to revoke the plaintiff's membership. The plaintiff is no longer a high-school student and, therefore, her NHS membership is in no further jeopardy. Under the circumstances, the fifth prayer for preliminary injunctive relief has become moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff suggests that her other prayers for relief suffice to keep her appeal buoyant. These prayers collectively encompass her requests for expungement of her high-school record and for preservation of the computer. As now framed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> neither matter is moot in the technical sense. <i>See, e.g., Coady Corp. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc.,</i> 361 F.3d 50, 61-62 (1st Cir.2004). The plaintiff retains a continuing interest both in the contents of her high-school record (which may again become relevant as she looks ahead to graduate school or real-world employment) and in ensuring that the computer is not corrupted. But even though intervening events have not destroyed our ability to grant the requested relief on an interim basis, these surviving prayers are too asthenic to support a preliminary injunction. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preliminary injunction standard is familiar. Under it, a district court typically must consider four elements: the probability of the movant's success on the merits, the prospect of irreparable harm absent the injunction, the balance of the relevant equities (focusing upon the hardship to the movant if an injunction does not issue as contrasted with the hardship to the nonmovant if it does), and the effect of the court's action on the public interest. <i>Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1996); <i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert,</i> 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir.1991). We need not discuss three of these elements. In most cases &#8212; and this case is no exception &#8212; irreparable harm is a necessary threshold showing for awarding preliminary injunctive relief. <i>See, e.g., Phillips v. Marsh,</i> 687 F.2d 620, 622 (2d Cir.1982). Inasmuch as the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a realistic prospect of irreparable harm, she has not crossed that threshold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the plaintiff focuses on her fourth prayer for preliminary injunctive relief, she simply cannot show any real danger of harm. She claims that she remains fearful that the defendants, if not enjoined, may \"tamper[] with the hard drive of the computer.\" Appellant's Reply Br. at 3. This fear is objectively unreasonable. The defendants have had possession of the computer since the incident occurred. For most of that time &#8212; well over fourteen months, as of this writing &#8212; they have not been under any court order to preserve its hard drive. If the defendants have not tampered with the computer during the lengthy interval that elapsed after the lifting of the TRO, there is no plausible basis for speculating that such tampering will occur before the case is tried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A preliminary injunction should not issue except to prevent a real threat of harm. <i>Ross-Simons,</i> 102 F.3d at 19; 11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2948.1, at 153-54 (2d ed.1995). A threat that is either unlikely to materialize or purely theoretical will not do. <i>Ross-Simons,</i> 102 F.3d at 19; <i>Pub. Serv. Co. v. Town of W. Newbury,</i> 835 F.2d 380, 382 (1st Cir.1987). An imminent threat that evidence will be lost is one thing &#8212; but a claimed threat, unaccompanied by any showing of reasonable grounds for believing that the evidence in question is imperilled, is insufficient to warrant the entry of a prophylactic injunction. <i>Humble Oil &amp; Ref. Co. v. Harang,</i> 262 F.Supp. 39, 42-43 (E.D.La.1966). Preliminary injunctions are strong medicine, and they should not issue merely to calm the imaginings of the movant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's reliance on her second prayer for preliminary injunctive relief is no more rewarding. That prayer entails her demand that her high-school records be purged temporarily of any reference to the incident and/or the suspension. She asserts that this information, if allowed to stand in the institution's records, could harm her in the future should she apply to graduate schools or require any kind of security clearance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that this issue, overall, remains a matter of concern: the plaintiff's high-school records are something in which she has a continuing interest. Nevertheless, that is not tantamount to saying that she is entitled to protect that interest by means of a preliminary injunction. The claim for expungement lacks immediacy; the record reflects no reason why that relief, if due, cannot await a full-dress trial. If a case can be adjudicated on the merits before the harm complained of will occur, there is no sufficient justification for preliminary injunctive relief. <i>Holiday Inns of Am., Inc. v. B &amp; B Corp.,</i> 409 F.2d 614, 618 (3d Cir.1969); 11A Wright, Miller, &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2948.1, at 149.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That rule applies here. The plaintiff is more than three years away from college graduation. She has alleged no short-term intention of applying for either admission to a graduate school or employment requiring a security clearance. Absent something that indicates a need for <i>immediate</i> relief, a plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction ordinarily ought to be rejected. <i>See, e.g., Pub. Serv. Co.,</i> 835 F.2d at 382-83; <i>Phillips,</i> 687 F.2d at 622. So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. While the plaintiff's complaint raises a number of claims that remain live, the passage of time and the occurrence of a series of easily predictable events have minimized any need for a preliminary injunction. Her motion for such relief is, for the most part, moot. What little of it remains justiciable presents no adequate basis for a finding of irreparable harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For these reasons, we summarily reject her appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of The District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> After the district court denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, she appealed.

The plaintiff, however, now argues that she really wanted a broader form of expungement<i>pendente lite.</i> Rather than quibble over doctrines such as waiver and forfeiture, we meet this argument head-on.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; tampering with the computer would leave the defendants open to a charge of spoliation of evidence<i>See, e.g., Blinzler v.

Given that the main case remains to be tried and that the plaintiff is seeking substantial damages, the presence of that deterrent further reduces any risk of tampering.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Should circumstances again change prior to trial so as to present a cognizable danger of irreparable harm, the plaintiff remains free to renew her motion for a preliminary injunction<i>See Holiday Inns of Am.,</i> 409 F.2d at 618-19.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

By the fall of 2002, she had reached her senior year. She ranked near the top of her class and was a member of the National Honor Society (NHS). On December 18, 2002, the plaintiff's academic career took a turn for the bizarre. We paraphrase her account of the relevant events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a journalism class, the plaintiff began using a school computer to complete an assignment. She claims to have lapsed into some private thoughts (which, as matters turned out, involved an alleged sexual dalliance between her teacher and the principal of the high school). She typed those thoughts into the computer, printed out her handiwork, returned to her seat, and placed what she had written among her personal papers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The teacher became suspicious and demanded to see the document. When the plaintiff refused, the teacher resorted to self-help. Before she could read the paper, however, the plaintiff snatched it from her hand. Finding this behavior intolerable, the teacher escorted the plaintiff to the principal's office. The principal read the document, deemed it offensive, and summoned the plaintiff's mother to the school for a discussion. Presumably because he himself was implicated, the principal advised the plaintiff's mother that he would refer the matter to the vice-principal. By letter dated December 30, 2002, the vice-principal suspended the plaintiff from school for ten days. The suspension letter, addressed to the plaintiff's parents, attributed her suspension to \"[p]rofanity, inappropriate use of a computer and defamation of character.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hot on the heels of this suspension, the plaintiff sued the Clinton School District and a gallimaufry of individual defendants (including the principal, the vice-principal, and the teacher).

This court lacks the power to turn back the clock and, accordingly, this aspect of the appeal is moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the plaintiff's third prayer &#8212; that the defendants be enjoined <i>pendente lite</i> from notifying colleges about her suspension &#8212; is by the boards. The plaintiff has completed the college application process and now attends a college of her choice. Thus, this aspect of the appeal also has been rendered moot by the passage of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So too the plaintiff's fifth prayer for preliminary injunctive relief. The NHS is a high-school honor society, and the plaintiff had sought to have the defendants preliminarily enjoined from taking any steps that might adversely affect her status as a member of that organization. However, the NHS has held a hearing and determined not to revoke the plaintiff's membership. The plaintiff is no longer a high-school student and, therefore, her NHS membership is in no further jeopardy. Under the circumstances, the fifth prayer for preliminary injunctive relief has become moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff suggests that her other prayers for relief suffice to keep her appeal buoyant. These prayers collectively encompass her requests for expungement of her high-school record and for preservation of the computer. As now framed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> neither matter is moot in the technical sense. <i>See, e.g., Coady Corp. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200921\"><a href=\"/opinion/200921/coady-corp-v-toyota-motor-distrib/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 61-62 (1st Cir.2004). The plaintiff retains a continuing interest both in the contents of her high-school record (which may again become relevant as she looks ahead to graduate school or real-world employment) and in ensuring that the computer is not corrupted. But even though intervening events have not destroyed our ability to grant the requested relief on an interim basis, these surviving prayers are too asthenic to support a preliminary injunction. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preliminary injunction standard is familiar. Under it, a district court typically must consider four elements: the probability of the movant's success on the merits, the prospect of irreparable harm absent the injunction, the balance of the relevant equities (focusing upon the hardship to the movant if an injunction does not issue as contrasted with the hardship to the nonmovant if it does), and the effect of the court's action on the public interest. <i>Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1996); <i>Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561828\"><a href=\"/opinion/561828/narragansett-indian-tribe-v-paul-e-guilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1991). We need not discuss three of these elements. In most cases &#8212; and this case is no exception &#8212; irreparable harm is a necessary threshold showing for awarding preliminary injunctive relief. <i>See, e.g., Phillips v. Marsh,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"408037\"><a href=\"/opinion/408037/mary-ann-phillips-v-john-o-marsh-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>, 622 (2d Cir.1982). Inasmuch as the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a realistic prospect of irreparable harm, she has not crossed that threshold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that the plaintiff focuses on her fourth prayer for preliminary injunctive relief, she simply cannot show any real danger of harm. She claims that she remains fearful that the defendants, if not enjoined, may \"tamper[] with the hard drive of the computer.\" Appellant's Reply Br. at 3. This fear is objectively unreasonable. The defendants have had possession of the computer since the incident occurred. For most of that time &#8212; well over fourteen months, as of this writing &#8212; they have not been under any court order to preserve its hard drive. If the defendants have not tampered with the computer during the lengthy interval that elapsed after the lifting of the TRO, there is no plausible basis for speculating that such tampering will occur before the case is tried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A preliminary injunction should not issue except to prevent a real threat of harm. <i>Ross-Simons,</i> 102 F.3d at 19; 11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 2948.1, at 153-54 (2d ed.1995). A threat that is either unlikely to materialize or purely theoretical will not do. <i>Ross-Simons,</i> 102 F.3d at 19; <i>Pub. Serv. Co. v. Town of W. Newbury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498700\"><a href=\"/opinion/498700/public-service-company-of-new-hampshire-v-town-of-west-newbury-thomas-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, 382 (1st Cir.1987). An imminent threat that evidence will be lost is one thing &#8212; but a claimed threat, unaccompanied by any showing of reasonable grounds for believing that the evidence in question is imperilled, is insufficient to warrant the entry of a prophylactic injunction. <i>Humble Oil &amp; Ref. Co. v. Harang,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351267\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351267/humble-oil-refining-company-v-harang/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 42-43 (E.D.La.1966). Preliminary injunctions are strong medicine, and they should not issue merely to calm the imaginings of the movant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's reliance on her second prayer for preliminary injunctive relief is no more rewarding. That prayer entails her demand that her high-school records be purged temporarily of any reference to the incident and/or the suspension. She asserts that this information, if allowed to stand in the institution's records, could harm her in the future should she apply to graduate schools or require any kind of security clearance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that this issue, overall, remains a matter of concern: the plaintiff's high-school records are something in which she has a continuing interest. Nevertheless, that is not tantamount to saying that she is entitled to protect that interest by means of a preliminary injunction. The claim for expungement lacks immediacy; the record reflects no reason why that relief, if due, cannot await a full-dress trial. If a case can be adjudicated on the merits before the harm complained of will occur, there is no sufficient justification for preliminary injunctive relief. <i>Holiday Inns of Am., Inc. v. B &amp; B Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"284359\"><a href=\"/opinion/284359/holiday-inns-of-america-inc-v-b-b-corporation-emile-a-berne-gerald-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span>, 618 (3d Cir.1969); 11A Wright, Miller, &amp; Kane, <i>supra</i> &#167; 2948.1, at 149.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That rule applies here. The plaintiff is more than three years away from college graduation. She has alleged no short-term intention of applying for either admission to a graduate school or employment requiring a security clearance. Absent something that indicates a need for <i>immediate</i> relief, a plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction ordinarily ought to be rejected. <i>See, e.g., Pub. Serv. Co.,</i> 835 F.2d at 382-83; <i>Phillips,</i> 687 F.2d at 622. So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. While the plaintiff's complaint raises a number of claims that remain live, the passage of time and the occurrence of a series of easily predictable events have minimized any need for a preliminary injunction. Her motion for such relief is, for the most part, moot. What little of it remains justiciable presents no adequate basis for a finding of irreparable harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For these reasons, we summarily reject her appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of The District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> After the district court denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, she appealed.

The plaintiff, however, now argues that she really wanted a broader form of expungement<i>pendente lite.</i> Rather than quibble over doctrines such as waiver and forfeiture, we meet this argument head-on.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; tampering with the computer would leave the defendants open to a charge of spoliation of evidence<i>See, e.g., Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196700\"><a href=\"/opinion/196700/blinzler-v-marriott-intl/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1158 (1st Cir.1996); <i>Nation-Wide Check Corp. v.

Given that the main case remains to be tried and that the plaintiff is seeking substantial damages, the presence of that deterrent further reduces any risk of tampering.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Should circumstances again change prior to trial so as to present a cognizable danger of irreparable harm, the plaintiff remains free to renew her motion for a preliminary injunction<i>See Holiday Inns of Am.,</i> 409 F.2d at 618-19.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
