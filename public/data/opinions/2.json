Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                   Torruella, Selya and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Charles W. Rankin, with whom Michelle Menken and Rankin &\nSultan, were on brief, for appellant.\n     Randall E. Kromm, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael K. Loucks, Acting United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 12, 2010\n\f               HOWARD, Circuit Judge. Following a three-day jury trial,\n\nDefendant Darryl Dowdell was convicted of distribution of cocaine\n\nbase     and    sentenced       as   a   career     offender   to    198    months'\n\nimprisonment.           Dowdell appeals the conviction, alleging three\n\ndefects:         that    the    delay    between    his    indictment      by   state\n\nauthorities and his ultimate trial in federal court violated his\n\nSixth Amendment speedy trial rights as well as the Interstate\n\nAgreement on Detainers; that the district court's amendment of the\n\nindictment       from     \"cocaine\"      to     \"cocaine   base\"    violated      the\n\npresentment clause of the Fifth Amendment; and that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion on various evidentiary rulings.                       He also\n\nchallenges the sentence imposed, arguing that the government's\n\nrecommended sentence of 262 months violated a promise not to seek\n\na term of imprisonment longer than 20 years.                For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we affirm both the conviction and the sentence.\n\nI. Background and Travel\n\n               While the facts surrounding the underlying offense are\n\nnot complicated, the pre-trial procedural history of this case\n\npresents a maze of overlapping federal and state activity, a flurry\n\nof continuances, and a revolving door of withdrawn and newly\n\nappointed defense counsel.\n\n                               A. The Subject Offense\n\n               The following facts were elicited at Dowdell's federal\n\ntrial.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f           In the summer of 2001, several Massachusetts authorities\n\nlaunched a coordinated effort with the federal Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA) to investigate drug trafficking in the area of\n\na housing project in Roxbury.           The investigation involved a task\n\nforce of undercover officers who made controlled purchases of\n\ncocaine and crack cocaine from dealers operating in the project.\n\nOne of these officers was Boston Housing Authority investigator\n\nJoao Monteiro.   Posing as a construction worker, Monteiro drove an\n\nunmarked car with a concealed audio transmitter and a video camera\n\nthat focused on the automobile's interior passenger compartment.\n\n           On July 6, 2001, Monteiro observed Dowdell standing on\n\nthe   sidewalk   with    a   man     named   Robert   White,    whom    Monteiro\n\nrecognized from previous encounters.              Dowdell was wearing dark\n\npants and a black shirt.              He and White were counting cash.\n\nMonteiro   signaled     to   White    that   he   wished   to   purchase   crack\n\ncocaine, and White went to talk to Dowdell.            White then approached\n\nMonteiro's car and got into the passenger seat.                     White told\n\nMonteiro that Dowdell, at this point identified only as \"the dark-\n\nskinned brother\" in the dark shirt, was a trustworthy dealer.\n\nAfter purchasing 1.1 grams of crack cocaine for $230, Monteiro\n\nasked White whether \"the dude in black\" was the person to see for\n\nfuture   purchases    if     White    were   unavailable.       White   replied\n\naffirmatively and informed Monteiro that Dowdell went by the name\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f\"Smoke.\" Monteiro departed, after informing White that he would be\n\nreturning in a short while to make another purchase.\n\n            Some 45 minutes later, Monteiro returned to the project\n\nand saw Dowdell on a bicycle.     Monteiro approached Dowdell, who\n\nasked Monteiro if he wanted anything.    Monteiro responded that he\n\nwas looking for White, and Dowdell then biked over to the spot\n\nwhere White was standing.   White came over to Monteiro's car and,\n\nfor the second time that night, sat down beside Monteiro in the\n\npassenger seat.    Monteiro told White that he wished to purchase\n\nmore drugs, as well as baggies for repackaging.   White agreed and,\n\nafter directing Monteiro to a parking area close to the spot of the\n\nfirst transaction, sold him 1.2 grams of crack cocaine and baggies\n\nfor $210.\n\n            Monteiro returned for a third buy on July 16, ten days\n\nafter the first two.   When he arrived, he saw Dowdell standing in\n\na small group, wearing blue jeans and a blue checkered shirt.\n\nMonteiro again asked for White, who was unavailable.       Monteiro\n\nasked for directions and drove away, making it appear that he was\n\ngoing off to search for White.    After waiting long enough to give\n\nthe impression that the search was unsuccessful, he returned to the\n\nproject looking for Dowdell.     He found Dowdell on the sidewalk,\n\nstill wearing a blue checkered shirt.     Monteiro called out \"Yo,\n\nSmoke, can I holler at you.\"     Dowdell approached Monteiro's car,\n\nand the two of them proceeded to have a conversation through the\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fpassenger-side window.     Continuing to address Dowdell as \"Smoke,\"\n\nMonteiro asked for about $200 worth of crack cocaine. Dowdell left\n\nbriefly to meet with another individual and then returned with six\n\nbags of crack cocaine, worth approximately $100.    Seven more bags\n\nwould eventually follow. The total weight of the thirteen bags was\n\napproximately 2.3 grams.    During this whole encounter, Dowdell was\n\nonly partially visible on the video that Monteiro's surveillance\n\ncamera recorded.\n\n          Driving away, Monteiro narrated a description of Dowdell\n\nfor the surveillance recording.    He stated, \"Smoke is the same kid\n\nas the last time.. [sic] he's got on a checkered shirt blue...blue\n\ncheckered shirt umm and he was riding a bicycle.\"\n\n          Later that day, Dowdell was arrested on an outstanding\n\nwarrant unrelated to his transactions with Monteiro.         He was\n\nbrought to a Boston police station where a booking photo was taken.\n\nIn the photo, Dowdell was wearing a blue checkered shirt, as\n\nMonteiro had described earlier in the day.       Later, around four\n\nhours after completing the buy from Dowdell, Monteiro was shown the\n\nphotograph and identified the depicted individual as \"Smoke.\"\n\nMonteiro reported that the individual in the photograph was the\n\nsame person from whom he had purchased drugs that day and whom he\n\nhad seen standing on the corner with White ten days beforehand.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f                   B. Pre-Trial Procedural History\n\n            Because the timing of particular pre-trial events is\n\nimportant to our legal analysis, we must delve into some detail in\n\nretracing the path on which this case traveled before it reached\n\nthe jury.\n\n            On March 25, 2002, eight months after the July 2001\n\nencounters at the housing project, a Suffolk County grand jury\n\nindicted    Dowdell,    based   on   those   events,     for       distributing    a\n\ncontrolled substance in the vicinity of school property.                     At his\n\narraignment, he pled not guilty and was released on bail, which was\n\nsubsequently   revoked    in    October     2003   due   to    a    charge   on   an\n\nunrelated crime.       On April 12, 2004, Dowdell's appointed counsel\n\nwithdrew his representation and was replaced.                  That replacement\n\nwould in turn withdraw in August of that year, and the court\n\nappointed a third attorney.\n\n            On November 17, 2004, the federal government filed a\n\ncriminal complaint against Dowdell based on the July 2001 events,\n\ncharging him with distribution of crack cocaine in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1).      At that time, Dowdell was already serving a\n\n27-month sentence in the Suffolk County House of Correction after\n\na conviction on the unrelated charge that had triggered his bail\n\nrevocation.    One month later, in December 2004, the Commonwealth\n\nentered a nolle prosequi on the March 25, 2002 indictment for\n\ndistributing a controlled substance in the vicinity of school\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fproperty,    effectively    terminating        its     prosecution.     Dowdell\n\nremained in state custody as he continued to serve his ongoing\n\nsentence on the unrelated charge, but from this point onward he\n\nfaced only the federal distribution charge.\n\n            On February 4, 2005, then unrepresented by counsel,\n\nDowdell   wrote   a   letter   to   a    clerk   for    the   magistrate   judge\n\noverseeing the pre-trial proceedings in his federal case.                   The\n\nletter invoked his speedy trial rights under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161.\n\nNearly three weeks later, Dowdell followed this letter with a\n\nformal request under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD),\n\n18 U.S.C. App. 2, ยง 2, that he be transferred from state to federal\n\ncustody as he awaited the resolution of the federal charge.                  On\n\nMarch 14, 2005, the federal government petitioned for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus ad prosequendum, and on March 22, 2005, Dowdell was\n\nbrought into federal district court for his initial appearance, at\n\nwhich point he was assigned new representation.\n\n            During    the      initial        appearance,     the     prosecutor\n\nacknowledged that Dowdell's transfer into federal custody was\n\npursuant to a writ \"based on the defendant's request under the\n\ninterstate agreement on detainers.\"            He proceeded to explain that\n\nDowdell had no intention of waiving his IAD rights, which Dowdell's\n\ncounsel confirmed. By preserving his rights under the IAD, Dowdell\n\nwas to remain in federal custody and receive credit toward the\n\nfulfillment of his term of incarceration for the unrelated charge\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fin   the    state-court   system,   but       receive    no    credit     toward   any\n\neventual federal sentence for the distribution offense until the\n\nstate-court sentence had fully elapsed.\n\n              The next day, March 23, a federal grand jury indicted\n\nDowdell,      charging    him    with    one     count        of     \"knowingly    and\n\nintentionally      possess[ing]     with        intent        to     distribute    and\n\ndistribut[ing] a quantity of cocaine\" in violation of ยง 841(a)(1).\n\nDowdell was arraigned on this charge on March 29, 2005.                     As in the\n\nstate court proceedings, he entered a plea of not guilty.                          The\n\ncourt held an initial status conference on May 11, 2005, during\n\nwhich it set a deadline of June 23 for all dispositive motions.                     At\n\nDowdell's request, that deadline was later extended to July 8.\n\n              Dowdell filed a motion to dismiss the indictment at the\n\nnew July 8 deadline, claiming a violation of the Speedy Trial Act,\n\n18 U.S.C. ยง 3161, as well as violation of the Sixth Amendment.1\n\nSpecifically, Dowdell posited that prejudice had resulted from the\n\npre-indictment delay in federal court.2 In an unsworn declaration,\n\nDowdell      contended    that    the     Commonwealth             had   vindictively\n\nchoreographed the delay and the eventual transfer to federal\n\njurisdiction in retribution for his declining to testify before a\n\n\n      1\n          The Speedy Trial Act claim is not before us on appeal.\n      2\n      The constitutional provision that applies to pre-indictment\ndelay is, in fact, the Fifth, rather than the Sixth, Amendment.\nSee United States v. Marler, 756 F.2d 206, 209โ10 (1st Cir. 1985).\nDowdell's counsel appears to have corrected this point in a\nsupplemental filing.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fstate grand jury in a shooting case in which he had apparently been\n\nthe victim. The declaration claimed that the district attorney was\n\nupset at Dowdell's alleged inability to see the face of the shooter\n\nand had stated \"if you blow my case I am gonna get your drug case\n\nsent back to the feds.\"        This alleged state-federal collusion,\n\nDowdell argued, meant that the starting point for measuring any\n\nspeedy   trial   violations   ought   to   be   the    date   of   his   state\n\nindictment, that is, March 25, 2002, rather than the federal\n\nindictment on March 23, 2005.\n\n           The docket then lay dormant for four months.             Although\n\nthe government was required by rule to file its opposition to the\n\nmotion to dismiss within two weeks, see D. Mass. R. 7.1(b)(2), it\n\nwas not until November 7, 2005 that the government sought leave to\n\nfile a late opposition.       Apparently, the government had actually\n\nprepared the memorandum of law in July and assumed that it had been\n\ntimely submitted. The motion for leave to file explained the delay\n\nas a simple error in performing the electronic submission.                The\n\ndistrict court granted this request, finding no evidence of bad\n\nfaith on the part of the government.       The next day, the government\n\nfiled its opposition.\n\n           On December 17, 2005, before the court had taken any\n\naction on the pending motion to dismiss, Dowdell moved to withdraw\n\nhis appointed counsel -- as he had done twice before in state court\n\n-- claiming a breakdown in communication.             The court held an ex\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fparte hearing on February 14, 2006.           It explained to Dowdell that\n\nappointing new counsel would further delay his case.                  Dowdell\n\nexpressed that he would ideally like to resolve the case as soon as\n\npossible with his current counsel, but \"we seem to not be seeing\n\neye to eye with each other, so I thought I had no choice but to do\n\nthat. . . . I don't want to put it off anymore.                I've told him\n\nthat.        But I just felt that my life is on the line here, and I just\n\nfelt that I need a new attorney.\"             The court granted Dowdell's\n\nrequest and allowed his attorney to withdraw.                Dowdell and the\n\ngovernment agreed that any time that elapsed between the withdrawal\n\nand an eventual ruling on the motion to dismiss would be excluded\n\nfrom the speedy trial calculation.\n\n                On March 2, 2006, the court appointed new counsel,\n\nVictoria Bonilla.          On June 16, 2006, after Bonilla had time to\n\nacquaint herself with the case, Dowdell moved to supplement the\n\nmotion to dismiss. The court held a non-evidentiary hearing on the\n\nmatter and, after setting a trial date of July 31, 2006, granted\n\nthe   motion       to   supplement.   On     June   30,   Dowdell   filed   the\n\nsupplemental memorandum, alleging, inter alia, infringement of\n\nDowdell's due process rights.3        Neither the original motion nor the\n\nsupplemental memorandum mentioned the IAD.\n\n                The government filed its response on July 11, 2006.         The\n\nresponse erroneously asserted that Dowdell had in fact waived his\n\n\n        3\n            The due process claim is not before us on appeal.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fIAD rights at his initial appearance, \"rendering it inapplicable\n\nfor purposes of the motion to dismiss.\" Regardless, the government\n\nclaimed, no IAD violation had occurred.\n\n          The court held a hearing on the motion on July 14, 2006.\n\nBonilla, who had not been involved in the case when Dowdell first\n\nappeared, did not mention the IAD or contest the alleged waiver.\n\nAs indicated in the following colloquy between Bonilla and the\n\ncourt, Dowdell's sole grounds for dismissal concerned the period\n\nprior to the federal indictment, rather than any post-indictment\n\ndevelopments:\n\n          THE COURT: Okay.    All right.    Now, turning\n          more directly to your motion, the supplemental\n          motion for -- to dismiss, do I understand, Ms.\n          Bonilla, that the defendant is not contesting\n          the time between the indictment, the federal\n          indictment, in March of 2005, and today's date\n          but that what you are concentrating on is the\n          time between the November or December notice,\n          December of 2004, and the indictment in March\n          of 2005, as exceeding 30 days in violation of\n          the statute? Is that --\n\n          MS. BONILLA: That's fair to say, your Honor.\n\n          THE COURT: That's fair to say. So we're not\n          concerned with anything that happened between\n          March and the -- March of 2005 and the filing\n          of the original motion to dismiss in July of\n          2005, and the snafu of the government in not\n          responding to that motion until November of\n          2005, is that correct?\n\n          MS. BONILLA: Yes, your Honor.       My   motion\n          focuses on what happens before.\n\nThe court ultimately denied the motion in its entirety, including\n\nDowdell's constitutional speedy trial argument, and prepared to\n\n\n                              -11-\n\fmove onward to the July 31 trial date.          Dowdell, however, once\n\nagain requested a continuance, this time because of the possibility\n\nthat a prior state conviction might be expunged from his record in\n\nthe interim (an occurrence that could affect plea negotiations).\n\nMichael   Bourbeau,   one   of   Bonilla's    partners   who   was   also\n\nrepresenting Dowdell at the hearing, explained that \"we've talked\n\nabout Mr. Dowdell's Speedy Trial rights.       But the ramifications of\n\nthis, I think, this prior [state conviction] -- the determination\n\nthat can be made on that prior is, I think, very significant as to\n\nwhether this case needs to go forward to trial.\"         The government\n\nagreed with this representation.         At that point, the court took\n\npains to ensure that Dowdell understood the ramifications of any\n\npostponement:\n\n          THE COURT: The Court's schedule is such that\n          it couldn't be for probably three months.\n\n          MR. BOURBEAU: We understand the Court's\n          concern.   We've had discussion with Mr.\n          Dowdell.\n\n          THE COURT: Yeah, I mean, this is the oldest\n          case, I think, on my docket, maybe not in the\n          docket number but with respect to the date of\n          the alleged crime. It needs to be resolved.\n          Your request, of course, is made on behalf of\n          the defendant now who needs to have his rights\n          --\n\n          MR. BOURBEAU: Yes.\n\n          THE COURT: -- pursued and resolved.\n\n          ...\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f           THE COURT: All right.    The Court will allow\n           the defendant's motion to continue the trial\n           until September 18th on the extraordinary\n           circumstance that we all find ourselves in\n           this case. It is something that is very much\n           of concern to the Court that this matter be\n           resolved sooner rather than later, but I\n           understand the import of what Mr. Bourbeau is\n           suggesting and that it may well inure to the\n           benefit of not only counsel but of the Court\n           in terms of judicial economy or economy of the\n           Court's expenditure of time. So I'm going to\n           allow that motion for continuance.\n\n\nThus, at Dowdell's own behest, the trial was pushed back an\n\nadditional month and a half.\n\n           The September 18th trial date met the same fate as the\n\npreceding July 31st date -- postponement.        For the second time\n\nsince his federal indictment, and for the fourth time overall,\n\nDowdell's attorney moved to withdraw representation.       In a motion\n\ndated August 8, 2006, Bonilla informed the court that Dowdell\n\nbelieved   there   to   have   been   an   irreparable   breakdown   in\n\ncommunications.    The court held an ex parte hearing on August 16,\n\n2006, after which it denied the motion.          But on September 8,\n\nDowdell sent the court a pro se, handwritten motion to reconsider\n\nits denial.   On September 18, 2006, the court held another ex parte\n\nhearing, after which it determined that the best course was indeed\n\nto allow Bonilla to withdraw.    The trial date was once again pushed\n\nback to December 11, 2006, and a new attorney, Mark Shea, was\n\nappointed on October 31, 2006.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          As with his predecessors, Shea's tenure as Dowdell's\n\ncounsel would terminate prematurely, though this time not at\n\nDowdell's request.   On November 28, 2006, Shea informed the court\n\nthat he had a conflict of interest that compelled withdrawal.    The\n\ncourt allowed another change in representation. The trial date was\n\nrescheduled for February 27, 2007.\n\n          Dowdell's new attorney (now his fourth since the federal\n\nindictment and seventh overall) was granted a requested continuance\n\non December 18, 2006 in order to acquaint himself better with the\n\ncase.   Trial was set for April 9, 2007.       On March 15, 2007,\n\nDowdell's attorney once again requested a continuance, this time\n\nboth in order to ensure effective assistance and because of a\n\npersonal conflict.   The court granted this final continuance.   The\n\ntrial commenced on May 29, 2007 -- nearly six years from the date\n\nof the offense.\n\n                     C. Modifying the Indictment\n\n          We briefly depart from our chronological march through\n\nthe events and take several steps back to August 2006, when the\n\ntrial was still scheduled for the following month.   On August 30,\n\nthe government filed a motion to advise the court of a potential\n\nvariance between the text of the indictment and the proof to be\n\nadduced at trial.    The indictment did not refer to \"cocaine base\"\n\nor \"crack cocaine,\" as had the federal complaint and accompanying\n\naffidavit, the petition for habeas corpus ad prosequendum, the\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\ftestimony before the grand jury, the magistrate judge's colloquy\n\nwith Dowdell at his initial appearance, and various discovery\n\ndocuments that Dowdell had previously been provided.                      Instead, it\n\nsimply read \"cocaine,\" potentially suggesting the powder form of\n\nthe substance.         Arguing that modifying the text from \"cocaine\" to\n\n\"cocaine base\" would not constitute a material change requiring a\n\nsuperseding indictment, the government asked the court to declare\n\nthe   original        indictment    suitable   for   trial.         The    government\n\nprofessed an inability to explain why the indictment did not\n\nspecifically allege distribution of cocaine base, but sought to\n\nclarify the matter prior to trial and avoid unnecessary jury\n\nconfusion over the controlled substance allegedly distributed.\n\n                  Recognizing that a variance, by definition, can only be\n\ndetermined after the presentation of evidence, the court chose to\n\ntreat       the    government's    pre-trial   motion   as    one    to    amend   the\n\nindictment.4          It then analyzed whether the proposed correction\n\nwould rise to the level of a constitutional violation.                     The court\n\ngranted the government's motion, reasoning that Dowdell had been\n\nwell apprised all along of the fact that he was charged with\n\n        4\n      We have explained the difference between a variance and an\namendment as follows: \"A constructive amendment occurs when the\ncharging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or\nin effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last\npassed upon them. A variance occurs when the charging terms remain\nunchanged but when the facts proved at trial are different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.\" United States v. Fisher, 3 F.3d\n456, 462โ63 (1st Cir. 1993) (citations and internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Gaither v. United States, 413 F.2d 1061, 1071\n(D.C. Cir. 1969) (offering similar distinction).\n\n                                        -15-\n\fdistribution of cocaine base and not cocaine powder.                It further\n\nnoted that the particular drug type alleged (whether cocaine base\n\nor cocaine powder) was not actually an element under ยง 841(a)(1)\n\nand did not have any effect on the evidence the government intended\n\nto proffer at trial. Therefore, the court concluded, the amendment\n\nwas akin to a permissible typographical correction.                 See United\n\nStates v. Dowdell, 464 F. Supp. 2d 64, 68 (D. Mass. 2006).\n\n                   D. Evidence Presented at Trial\n\n           At     trial,     Dowdell's          primary         argument      was\n\nmisidentification. He claimed that he was not the \"Smoke\" referred\n\nto in surveillance recordings and that the video footage was\n\ninconclusive as to whether a man with a blue checkered shirt was\n\nactually   involved.        In     order   to     corroborate        Monteiro's\n\nidentification of Dowdell as Smoke, the government introduced,\n\ninter alia, two items that Dowdell had unsuccessfully attempted to\n\nexclude through pre-trial motions in limine: the booking sheet from\n\nthe July 16 arrest and several of White's July 6 statements\n\ncaptured on videotape.\n\n1. The Booking Sheet\n\n           The   booking   sheet   contained     both     the    photograph    of\n\nDowdell in the blue checkered shirt on which Monteiro had based his\n\nidentification, as well as a textual description of Dowdell's\n\nclothing as including a \"blue plaid shirt.\"             Dowdell argued that\n\nthe document was inadmissible because a provision of Federal Rule\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fof Evidence 803(8), the so-called \"law-enforcement exception,\"\n\nforbids    the   introduction   of   police    reports   against   criminal\n\ndefendants.      The government countered that a booking sheet should\n\nnot run afoul of the exception because it contained merely \"rote,\n\nroutine administrative information.\"          The district court concluded\n\nthat the document was admissible pursuant to both\n\n            Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1) (because the document\n            formed    the    basis     of    a    witness's\n            identification)    and    Fed.R.Evid.    803(8)\n            (because   the   document    reflects   routine\n            procedures based upon information from the\n            defendant   himself   and   not   observations,\n            conclusions or opinions of police officers\n            which are normally contained in police\n            reports). In sum, the document possesses the\n            requisite indicia of trustworthiness to be\n            admissible under more than one of the Federal\n            Rules of Evidence.\n\n            At trial, the government proffered an edited version of\n\nthe booking sheet. All information relating to the charges against\n\nDowdell was redacted, while the sections describing clothing and\n\nappearance remained.      In addition, the government introduced the\n\nphotograph separately, unaccompanied by the booking sheet.           It was\n\non the basis of this photograph, rather than the booking sheet,\n\nthat Monteiro would testify he had made his identification of\n\nDowdell as Smoke.\n\n2. Video Evidence\n\n            Dowdell had also objected in limine to the introduction\n\nof White's videotaped statements from the two transactions on July\n\n6, 2001.   There were two tapes at issue, one from each transaction.\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fThe   first    showed   White    telling   Monteiro   who   \"Smoke\"   was   and\n\nconfirming that he was reliable.              The second showed Monteiro\n\napproaching Dowdell and asking him to summon White, which Dowdell\n\nthen did.\n\n              Dowdell challenged the admissibility of the statements\n\non two distinct grounds. First, he argued that the statements\n\nconstituted proof of prior bad acts that would be barred by Rule\n\n404(b).       The government responded that the statements were not\n\noffered as prior bad acts so much as intrinsic evidence of the\n\nspecific crime alleged.         It posited that the jury would not be able\n\nto understand fully the July 16th transaction without knowing what\n\nhad occurred on July 6th. Dowdell's second argument was that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to treat White as a co-conspirator under\n\nRule 802(d)(2)(E), and hence White's statements should be deemed\n\ninadmissible hearsay.      The government not only contested Dowdell's\n\ninsufficiency claim, but also argued that the statements would be\n\nindependently admissible as relating to the basis for Monteiro's\n\nidentification.     Under this alternative theory, White's statements\n\ncould at least be introduced for the impact that they had on\n\nMonteiro and his subsequent identification of Dowdell as \"Smoke,\"\n\nif not for the truth of the matter asserted.\n\n              The district court rejected both of Dowdell's objections\n\nduring the final pre-trial conference.           With respect to the Rule\n\n404(b) claim, it found that \"the transaction with Robert White is\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fdirectly and instrinsically relevant to the charge against Mr.\n\nDowdell in this case.\"        As for the hearsay claim, the district\n\ncourt adopted both of the government's theories of admissibility.\n\n           During the course of the pre-trial conference, Dowdell\n\nargued that even if a transcript of the statements would be\n\nadmissible, the videotape itself would be unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThe government insisted that it was entitled to use the video to\n\nprove its case, as only the video showed what sort of opportunity\n\nMonteiro had to actually see Dowdell from the car.              Again, the\n\ndistrict   court   rejected   Dowdell's   argument,   finding    that   the\n\nvideotape was the best evidence.      Though ordering two minor edits\n\nto the video and the corresponding transcript,5 the court ruled\n\nthat the videotaped statements were otherwise admissible in their\n\noriginal form.\n\n                              E. Sentencing\n\n           On May 31, 2007, after three days of trial, the jury\n\nreturned a guilty verdict.\n\n           Under ยง 841(b)(1)(c), Dowdell would normally have faced\n\na maximum sentence of 20 years.      Mention of this 20-year maximum\n\nhad arisen earlier in the pre-trial proceedings, when Dowdell had\n\nchallenged   the   government's   attempt   to   amend   the   indictment.\n\nDowdell had initially claimed that the change in drug type was\n\n\n    5\n      The two edits were (1) changing the Defendant's name in the\ntranscript from \"Dowdell\" to \"Smoke\" and (2) deleting a statement\nby White that Dowdell was his \"cousin.\"\n\n                                  -19-\n\fmaterial because it might increase the sentence length to which he\n\nwould be exposed.    The government had responded that because drug\n\ntype was not an element in this case, the maximum would remain at\n\n20 years regardless.        In making this point, the government had\n\nstated in writing that it was \"not seeking (and cannot seek) a\n\nsentence in excess of 20 years.\"             The district court cited this\n\nlanguage in allowing the amendment.\n\n            Nevertheless, in April 2007, the government filed an\n\ninformation to establish a prior conviction under 21 U.S.C. ยง 851,\n\nwhich increased the statutory maximum from 20 to 30 years (and the\n\nguideline   range   from    210โ262    months    to   262โ327   months).   At\n\nsentencing, the government recommended a 262-month sentence, at the\n\nbottom end of the guideline range but well over the original 20-\n\nyear statutory maximum.       The court ultimately sentenced Dowdell to\n\n198 months, followed by six years' supervised release. Dowdell did\n\nnot object to the sentence.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n                           A. Speedy Trial Rights\n\n            Dowdell first contends that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to dismiss on constitutional speedy trial\n\ngrounds. The district court noted, but never resolved, whether the\n\nappropriate starting point for the speedy trial clock was the\n\nfederal or the state indictment.               Because it determined that\n\n\"Dowdell ha[d] failed to demonstrate prejudice which rises to the\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\flevel of a constitutional violation,\" the court did not reach the\n\nissue of the precise length of the delay.      We review the speedy\n\ntrial ruling for abuse of discretion.       United States v. Munoz-\n\nFranco, 487 F.3d 25, 58 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          The Sixth Amendment provides that all criminal defendants\n\n\"shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\"    U.S. Const.\n\namend. VI.   If the government violates this constitutional right,\n\nthe criminal charges must be dismissed.     Strunk v. United States,\n\n412 U.S. 434, 439โ40 (1973).    To determine whether a violation has\n\noccurred, we use the four-part balancing test established in Barker\n\nv. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), which requires a weighing of:    (1)\n\nthe length of the delay, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) the\n\ndefendant's assertion of his right, and (4) prejudice to the\n\ndefendant resulting from the delay.     Id. at 530.\n\n          The threshold inquiry concerns the first of these four,\n\nas the sheer brevity of pre-trial delay may obviate the need for\n\nfurther analysis.   See id. (\"Until there is some delay which is\n\npresumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into\n\nthe other factors that go into the balance.\").     Should there be a\n\nlengthier delay, however, we must engage in the \"difficult and\n\nsensitive balancing process\" of placing each of the other factors\n\non the scale.   Id. at 533.   Thus, \"the length of the delay is both\n\nthe trigger for analysis and one of the factors to be considered.\"\n\nUnited States v. Colombo, 852 F.2d 19, 24 (1st Cir. 1988); see also\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fDoggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 651 (1992) (referring to\n\nthe length-of-delay factor as a \"double enquiry\").               Once it is\n\ndetermined that balancing is necessary, none of the four factors\n\nhas any talismanic power.        Rather, \"we must still weigh all of the\n\nfactors collectively before deciding whether a defendant's right to\n\na speedy trial has been violated.\"          Colombo, 852 F.2d at 23.\n\n             It is not clear to us whether the district court may have\n\nglossed over this multi-part analysis by disposing of the issue on\n\nthe question of prejudice alone.          In any event, a violation of the\n\nSpeedy    Trial   Clause   may    occur    even   absent   any   affirmative\n\ndemonstration of prejudice to the accused.          Moore v. Arizona, 414\n\nU.S. 25, 26 (1973) (per curiam) (holding that because Barker\n\n\"expressly rejected the notion that an affirmative demonstration of\n\nprejudice was necessary to prove a denial of the constitutional\n\nright to a speedy trial,\" the state court was \"in fundamental\n\nerror\" for requiring a showing of prejudice to the defense at\n\ntrial).    If indeed a lengthy delay is present, a single factor in\n\nisolation cannot dispose of an issue as \"amorphous, slippery, and\n\nnecessarily relative\" as the right to a speedy trial.            Vermont v.\n\nBrillon, 129 S. Ct. 1283, 1290 (2009) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).6\n\n\n\n     6\n      Disposition of a constitutional speedy trial claim on\nprejudice alone is thus an error of law that itself constitutes an\nabuse of discretion. Nevertheless, even if such an error occurred\nhere, it was harmless.\n\n                                    -22-\n\f           Our analysis will instead begin, as the King admonished\n\nthe White Rabbit, at the beginning: the length of the delay.           There\n\nis no bright-line time limit dividing the lengths that trigger\n\nfurther   Barker   inquiry   from    those   that   do   not.     Whether   a\n\nparticular delay will warrant further speedy trial scrutiny \"is\n\nnecessarily dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of the case.\"\n\nBarker, 407 U.S. at 530โ31.         Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has\n\nobserved that \"[d]epending on the nature of the charges, the lower\n\ncourts have generally found postaccusation delay 'presumptively\n\nprejudicial' at least as it approaches one year.\"               Doggett, 505\n\nU.S. at 652 n.1.    Our cases comport with this observation.            See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Munoz-Amado, 182 F.3d 57, 61 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(nineteen months); United States v. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11,\n\n21 (1st Cir. 1997) (fifteen months).\n\n           The difficulty in this case is determining just when the\n\nspeedy trial clock ought to start running.           The Sixth Amendment\n\nright to a speedy trial attaches upon formal accusation.              United\n\nStates v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 6โ7 (1982).         In the typical case,\n\nthis means either arrest or indictment, whichever comes first.\n\nUnited States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 2005).                 For\n\nDowdell, who did not face any pre-indictment detention on his\n\nfederal charge, the starting point would ordinarily be the date of\n\nhis federal indictment, March 23, 2005. Dowdell, however, does not\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fchallenge    any   length   of   time   that     elapsed    after   this   date.7\n\nInstead, he focuses on the time frame preceding it, arguing that\n\nhis speedy trial rights in fact accrued with his state indictment\n\non   March   25,   2002.    Were   that    the    case,    it    would   yield   a\n\npresumptively prejudicial delay of nearly three years before the\n\nfederal indictment was returned.\n\n             Addressing this argument requires us to consider the\n\nspeedy trial implications of the dual sovereignty doctrine.                Under\n\nthis doctrine, \"the federal government is not bound by the actions\n\nof state authorities and . . . successive state and federal\n\nprosecutions are constitutionally permissible.\"                 United States v.\n\nMejias, 552 F.2d 435, 441โ42 (2d Cir. 1977).               Though perhaps most\n\nrecognizable from the double jeopardy context, see, e.g., Abbate v.\n\nUnited States, 359 U.S. 187 (1959), dual sovereignty considerations\n\nanimate our constitutional speedy trial jurisprudence, as well. In\n\nMacDonald, the Supreme Court briefly noted that \"an arrest or\n\nindictment by one sovereign would not cause the speedy trial\n\nguarantees to become engaged as to possible subsequent indictments\n\nby another sovereign.\" 456 U.S. at 10 n.11.           Following MacDonald's\n\nlead, we observed in United States v. Marler, 756 F.2d 206 (1st\n\nCir. 1985), that \"a ruling that a defendant's right to a speedy\n\n\n      7\n      He would, of course, have been entirely free to do so, as his\nspeedy trial rights remained in effect up until his trial date,\nUnited States v. Jenkins-Watts, 574 F.3d 950, 966 (8th Cir. 2009),\nwhich was not until May 2007. Nevertheless, because Dowdell waived\nthe claim with respect to this period, we do not address it.\n\n                                    -24-\n\ffederal trial attaches upon his state indictment would implicate\n\nthe   very   concerns   that   led   the    Court   to   formulate   the   dual\n\nsovereignty doctrine in the double jeopardy area.\"            Id. at 211.   We\n\nfurther elaborated the policy arguments that bolster the case for\n\na robust dual sovereignty doctrine in the speedy trial context:\n\n             Were we to hold that Marler's state court\n             indictment triggered his speedy trial right,\n             we would in effect be requiring the federal\n             government to keep continually abreast of all\n             state criminal investigations that may present\n             the possibility of federal prosecution and to\n             pursue their own investigations, arrests,\n             indictments, and trials so as to conform with\n             state-dictated timing.     This is obviously\n             counter to the dual sovereignty doctrine as\n             well   as  to   effective,   responsible   law\n             enforcement. . . . Thus, whatever the\n             weaknesses in our dual system of justice,\n             these could only be exacerbated by the\n             proposed expansion of the sixth amendment\n             speedy trial right.\n\nId.\n\n             Dowdell does not contest the truth of any of this as a\n\ngeneral matter, but he nevertheless insists that his case falls\n\nwithin a recognized exception.         He principally relies on United\n\nStates v. Cabral, 475 F.2d 715 (1st Cir. 1973).             In Cabral, state\n\npolice officers investigating the defendant for sale of stolen\n\nproperty arrested him for possessing a sawed-off shotgun.                   The\n\nstate turned the weapon over to federal authorities three days\n\nafter the arrest.       Cabral was indicted in state court for the\n\nstolen property offense and then, fifteen months later, in federal\n\ncourt for the weapons offense.             In considering Cabral's speedy\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\ftrial claim, we held that his constitutional right \"crystallized at\n\nthe time of his initial [state] arrest\" because it was for the same\n\noffense as his ultimate federal indictment, and \"[t]he [federal]\n\ngovernment's prosecution of this charge was initiated only three\n\ndays later when . . . state authorities turned over this weapon to\n\na federal officer.\"    Id. at 718.    Thus, Dowdell argues, Cabral\n\ninstructs us to attribute a state-court indictment to the federal\n\ngovernment where a subsequent federal indictment was essentially a\n\ncontinuation of the state proceedings.   Because his state charges\n\narose out of a federal investigation, were for the same offense as\n\nhis federal charges, and were allegedly dismissed following a\n\ncoordinated effort with the federal government, Dowdell would have\n\nus apply this Cabral exception in our speedy trial analysis here.\n\n          Cabral, however, predates the Supreme Court's development\n\nof the dual sovereignty doctrine in MacDonald.     For this reason,\n\nthe Marler court questioned, although it did not decide, whether\n\nCabral remained good law.   756 F.2d at 212.   Other courts have not\n\nbeen so hesitant.     See, e.g., United States v. Garner, 32 F.3d\n\n1305, 1309 (8th Cir. 1994) (rejecting Cabral's rationale and\n\nfinding it \"in conflict with subsequent statements made by the\n\nSupreme Court\"); United States v. Collamore, 751 F. Supp. 1012,\n\n1025 n.13 (D. Me. 1990) (recognizing that Marler had left the\n\nCabral exception \"an open question\" and then definitively holding\n\nthat \"there is no such exception\").   Dowdell labors to convince us\n\n\n\n                               -26-\n\fof Cabral's continued vitality, pointing to some courts' careful\n\nefforts to distinguish it on the facts rather than reject it\n\noutright.   But if Cabral has managed to survive until this point,\n\nit has only been through the force of its own obsolescence.\n\nDowdell has not identified a single post-MacDonald case from this\n\nor any other jurisdiction to have relied on the exception he urges\n\nus to rely on here.\n\n            A quarter-century of consistent authority impels us to\n\nanswer Marler's question and hold that Supreme Court precedent has\n\nabrogated Cabral.8    The speed of a federal trial is measured from\n\nthe federal accusation on which it is based; one sovereign's\n\nenforcement of its own criminal laws is not attributable to another\n\nsovereign    merely   because   of     the   presence   of   investigatory\n\nassistance, prosecutorial collaboration, or overlap among charges.\n\n            In his reply brief, Dowdell relatedly argues that this\n\ncase falls within an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine,\n\nestablished in Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 123โ24 (1959),\n\nfor situations in which the state prosecution is \"merely a tool of\n\nthe federal authorities.\"       Dowdell has waived this argument by\n\n     8\n      Following the procedure described in cases such as Crowe v.\nBolduc, 365 F.3d 86, 89 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004) and Carpenters Local\nUnion No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 215 F.3d 136, 138 n.1 (1st\nCir. 2000), the proposed panel opinion in this case was circulated\nto all active judges of the court, a majority of whom posed no\nobjection to our handling of Cabral.     The use of this informal\nprocedure does not convert this opinion into an opinion en banc,\nnor does it preclude a suggestion of rehearing en banc on any issue\nin the case, whether or not related to the panel's treatment of\nCabral.\n\n                                     -27-\n\fneglecting to include it in his initial brief.             See United States\n\nv. Hall, 557 F.3d 15, 20 n.3 (1st Cir. 2009).                     Moreover, the\n\nargument lacks merit.       The Bartkus exception is \"narrow[ly]. . . .\n\nlimited    to    situations   in   which    one   sovereign   so     thoroughly\n\ndominates or manipulates the prosecutorial machinery of another\n\nthat   the      latter   retains   little   or    no   volition    in   its   own\n\nproceedings.\"       United States v. Guzman, 85 F.3d 823, 827 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).    To establish a prima facie case, Dowdell would need to show\n\nthat \"one sovereign was a pawn of the other, with the result that\n\nnotion of two supposedly independent prosecutions is merely a\n\nsham.\"    Id.    He has not done so.    That the DEA was heavily involved\n\nin Dowdell's investigation establishes little more than routine\n\nintergovernmental assistance. \"Cooperative law enforcement efforts\n\nbetween independent sovereigns are commendable, and, without more,\n\nsuch efforts will not furnish a legally adequate basis for invoking\n\nthe Bartkus exception to the dual sovereign rule.\"                  Id. at 828.\n\nDowdell's putative smoking gun, that an assistant district attorney\n\nexclaimed \"if you blow my case I am gonna get your drug case sent\n\nback to the feds,\" shows, at worst, a threat.                      It does not\n\nestablish coordinated manipulation, much less that the federal\n\ngovernment was acting as a pawn of Suffolk County officials such\n\nthat it retained little or no volition in its own proceedings.\n\n             We discern no evidence of improper collusion.              Although\n\nthe Bartkus exception may apply to some speedy trial cases, this is\n\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fnot one of them.     Consequently, we conclude that Dowdell's speedy\n\ntrial right attached on the date of his federal indictment.        There\n\nwas no presumptively prejudicial delay, and analysis of the other\n\nBarker factors is therefore unnecessary.\n\n\n\n                  B. Interstate Agreement on Detainers\n\n            Even if the pre-trial delay does not offend the Sixth\n\nAmendment, it may still violate the IAD, 18 U.S.C. App. 2, ยง 2.\n\nThe IAD is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact designed\n\nto   \"encourage     the   expeditious    and   orderly   disposition   of\n\n[outstanding] charges and determination of the proper status of any\n\nand all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, and\n\ncomplaints.\"    Id. art. I.    To meet this goal, the IAD prescribes\n\nprocedures by which a member state may obtain for trial a prisoner\n\nincarcerated in another member jurisdiction, and by which the\n\nprisoner may demand the speedy disposition of certain charges\n\npending against him in another jurisdiction.9       See United States v.\n\nMauro, 436 U.S. 340, 343โ44, 349โ53 (1978) (providing background on\n\nthe IAD).      The IAD's provisions come into play whenever the\n\nprosecuting authority (\"the receiving state\") files a detainer on\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      The federal government is considered a member state for\npurposes of the IAD. United States v. Henson, 945 F.2d 430, 434\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                  -29-\n\fa prisoner serving a sentence in another jurisdiction (\"the sending\n\nstate\").10\n\n             At issue here are the speedy trial provisions that the\n\nIAD imposes on the receiving state.           If the receiving state\n\ninitiates the transfer through a written request for temporary\n\ncustody, it must bring the prisoner to trial within 120 days of his\n\narrival in that jurisdiction.       18 U.S.C. App. 2, ยง 2, art. IV(c).\n\nIf, on the other hand, the prisoner initiates the transfer through\n\na request for final disposition, that window is 180 days from the\n\nsending state's receipt of the request.       Id. art. III(a).   If the\n\nreceiving state fails to observe these strictures, it must dismiss\n\nthe indictment.    Id. art. V(c);    United States v. Bozeman, 533 U.S.\n\n146, 153 (2001).\n\n             Dowdell avers for the first time on appeal that dismissal\n\nis necessary because the IAD clock had expired before he was ever\n\nbrought to trial.11    At no point before filing his appellate brief\n\n     10\n      The IAD only applies to prisoners against whom detainers have\nbeen filed.    Neither party has confirmed or denied whether a\ndetainer was ever actually filed against Dowdell in this case, and\nwe can find no indication in the record one way or the other.\nBecause the issue has not been contested, and because we ultimately\nfind no reversible error, we proceed on the assumption that a\ndetainer was filed. We stress, however, that parties litigating\nIAD claims ought not to take the existence of a detainer for\ngranted. See Mauro, 436 U.S. at 364 n.29 (noting that \"during a\ntypical year federal courts issue approximately 5,000 ad\nprosequendum writs and that about 3,000 of those are in cases in\nwhich a detainer has previously been lodged against the prisoner\").\n     11\n      Both parties leave unresolved whether Dowdell initiated the\ntransfer through his pro se letter, triggering the 120-day clock,\nor whether the government did through its habeas petition,\n\n                                    -30-\n\fdid Dowdell so much as mention the speedy trial provisions of the\n\nIAD, despite ample opportunities.             Had he done so, we have little\n\ndoubt   that    the   trial   judge,    who    consistently    demonstrated   a\n\nconscientious concern for Dowdell's speedy trial rights, would have\n\nmade an effort to comply.\n\n               We do not look favorably on IAD arguments that are not\n\nraised until the trial judge is no longer in a position to avoid a\n\nviolation. Addressing a similar scenario arising on habeas review,\n\nthe Supreme Court endorsed the lower court's observation that \"[i]t\n\nwould not have been difficult for the judge to advance the date of\n\nthe trial or make a finding on the record of good cause, either of\n\nwhich would have satisfied Art. IV(c).            Because the subject never\n\ncame up, however, the trial judge overlooked the problem.\" Reed v.\n\nFarley, 512 U.S. 339, 351 (1994) (quoting Reed v. Clark, 984 F.2d\n\n209, 213 (7th Cir. 1993)).         The Court concluded that \"[w]hen a\n\ndefendant obscures Article IV(c)'s time prescription and avoids\n\nclear objection until the clock has run, cause for collateral\n\nreview scarcely exists.\"       Id. at 349.       The same is true on direct\n\nreview.   A defendant who does not timely raise his IAD rights in\n\ndistrict court forfeits those rights on appeal.               United States v.\n\nNeal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1209 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Oldaker,\n\n\n\n\ntriggering the 180-day clock. The government argues that even the\nstricter 120-day clock did not expire, while Dowdell argues that\neven the more lenient 180-day clock did. Because of our ultimate\ndisposition, we need not resolve the issue.\n\n                                       -31-\n\f823 F.2d 778, 781 (4th Cir. 1987); United States v. Eaddy, 595 F.2d\n\n341, 346 (6th Cir. 1979).\n\n          Dowdell now claims that his general invocation of the IAD\n\nat his initial appearance should have put the court on notice that\n\nthe speedy trial provisions were in force.        Yet an abstract\n\nreference to the compact does not suffice to preserve all potential\n\nchallenges that might arise under it.     One can forfeit a claim\n\nunder one section of the IAD while preserving a different claim\n\nunder another.   See, e.g., Neal, 36 F.3d at 1209-10; Oldaker, 823\n\nF.2d at 781; Eaddy, 595 F.2d at 346.    At his initial appearance,\n\nDowdell referred only to his right to remain in federal custody,\n\nnot the applicability of the statute's speedy trial deadline. This\n\nwould be the last time that Dowdell referred to the IAD before the\n\ndistrict court.12   If he intended to rely on the statutory speedy\n\ntrial provisions, he could have brought them to the trial judge's\n\nattention.   He did not do so.\n\n          Undaunted, Dowdell argues that he did not need to spell\n\nout the letters of the IAD for the district court because his\n\nmotion to dismiss for violation of the Sixth Amendment and the\n\nSpeedy Trial Act effectively accomplished the same thing.       He\n\n     12\n      Dowdell places much of the blame for this silence on the\ngovernment, which erroneously informed the court that Dowdell had\nwaived his IAD rights at his initial appearance. While we do not\ncondone the government's mistake, we note that it did not occur\nuntil July 11, 2006, well after Dowdell filed his motions to\ndismiss -- and well after the date when Dowdell now claims the IAD\nclock should have expired. The error, lamentable as it may be,\ncannot excuse Dowdell's forfeiture retroactively.\n\n                                 -32-\n\frelies    on    Mauro,   in   which    the   Supreme    Court    ruled    that   the\n\ndefendant's failure to invoke the IAD \"in specific terms\" in his\n\nspeedy trial motions did not result in the waiver of an Article\n\nIV(c) claim.        436 U.S. at 364.            In Mauro, the defendant had\n\n\"persistently      requested\"    a     speedy   trial   and     had    \"sought   the\n\ndismissal of his indictment on the ground that the delay in\n\nbringing him to trial while the detainer remained lodged against\n\nhim was causing him to be denied certain privileges at the state\n\nprison.\"       Id. at 364-65.         On those bases, the Court found his\n\nactions \"sufficient to put the Government and the District Court on\n\nnotice of the substance of his claim.\"            Id.; accord Eaddy, 595 F.2d\n\nat 346 (finding a speedy trial motion sufficient to give notice of\n\nan IAD challenge even though it \"was not framed in the precise\n\nlanguage of the Agreement\").\n\n               This case is distinguishable from Mauro in two critical\n\nrespects. First and foremost, Dowdell did not have a colorable IAD\n\nclaim at the time he filed the speedy trial motion.                   Even assuming\n\nthe most defendant-favorable set of circumstances, the earliest\n\ntrial deadline under the IAD would have been July 20, 2005.13                    Yet\n\n     13\n      The parties dispute several matters that would affect our\ncalculation of the actual deadline: (1) whether Dowdell initiated\nthe transfer through his pro se letter, triggering the 120-day\nclock, or whether the government did through its habeas petition,\ntriggering the 180-day clock; (2) whether 78 days of excludable\ntime under the Speedy Trial Act were automatically excludable under\nthe IAD; and (3) whether any portion of the government's four-month\nlapse in responding to Dowdell's original motion to dismiss should\nbe excludable. Giving Dowdell the benefit of the doubt on each,\nthe clock would have run uninterrupted beginning with his initial\n\n                                        -33-\n\fDowdell filed his motion to dismiss nearly two weeks earlier, on\n\nJuly 8.    Thus, Dowdell is in substance arguing that the district\n\ncourt ought to have dismissed the indictment based on a ground that\n\nnot only was absent from the motion to dismiss, but that did not\n\neven exist at the time the motion was filed.             The fallacy in this\n\nposition should be clear enough.            To have the issue preserved,\n\nDowdell would not need us to infer it from his motion to dismiss so\n\nmuch as to generate it ex nihilo at some later point.                  This we\n\ncannot do.\n\n           Second,      neither   Dowdell's     motion   nor   any   subsequent\n\ncommunication said anything about the negative effects that the\n\noutstanding detainer might be having on his rehabilitation.                   We\n\nthink   that   element    critical   to   the    Court's   holding    in    Mauro\n\nbecause, as the Court stressed, it was the attempt to ameliorate\n\nprecisely those effects that prompted the IAD's passage.               See 436\n\nU.S. at 359โ60.        We do not read Mauro to mean that every speedy\n\ntrial claim filed by a detainee necessarily contains an embedded\n\nIAD claim.     The Court was not propounding free association as an\n\ninterpretive canon.       It was, rather, placing weight on the precise\n\nidentity     between    the   defendant's     alleged    prejudice    and    the\n\nprejudice that the IAD targets. Because Dowdell's motion never\n\nrepresented that the requested relief would redound to the success\n\nof his rehabilitation, we do not consider it \"sufficient to put the\n\n\nappearance on March 22, 2005, yielding a latest acceptable trial\ndate of July 20, 2005.\n\n                                     -34-\n\fGovernment and the District Court on notice of the substance of his\n\n[IAD] claim\" under Mauro.\n\n           We therefore conclude that Dowdell at least forfeited any\n\nIAD claim by failing to raise it in the district court.            He may\n\nvery well have waived it altogether by requesting continuance after\n\ncontinuance that pushed the trial date to May 2007.       See New York\n\nv. Hill, 528 U.S. 110 (2000) (holding that defense counsel's\n\nagreement to a trial date outside the IAD period bars the defendant\n\nfrom then seeking dismissal on the ground that the trial did not\n\noccur within that period).     Even if the claim is not waived, our\n\nreview is for plain error only.      Neal, 36 F.3d at 1210.   Under that\n\nstandard, we would reverse only if Dowdell could prove โ(1) that an\n\nerror occurred; (2) that the error was clear or obvious; (3) that\n\nthe error affected his substantial rights; and (4) that the error\n\nalso   seriously   impaired   the    fairness,   integrity,   or   public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.โ        United States v. Gonzalez,\n\n570 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           Here, if there was any error to begin with, it was not\n\nclear or obvious.     The clock could not have run out before the\n\nmotion to dismiss was filed, and we have never before found\n\ncircumstances where the IAD clock would continue to run during the\n\npendency of a defendant's motion.          On the contrary, the clock\n\npresumptively stops for the entirety of the pendency, no matter how\n\nlengthy.   See United States v. Walker, 924 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\f1991); cf. United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 601 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (holding in the Speedy Trial Act context that courts may\n\nexclude the time between the filing of the motion and the hearing\n\non that motion, even if the delay is overlong, inexplicable, or\n\nunreasonable).       Although Dowdell does not address any period of\n\ntime after the court decided his motion in July 2006, we note that\n\nthe ensuing ten months of delay were entirely due to his requests\n\nfor continuances and change of counsel. As a result, Dowdell's IAD\n\nclaim fails.\n\n                      C. Amendment of the Indictment\n\n           Dowdell         next      challenges     the      district     court's\n\nmodification of the indictment to reflect distribution of \"cocaine\n\nbase\" rather than \"cocaine.\"            According to Dowdell, this change\n\nconstituted a material amendment that deprived him of his right to\n\npresentment of charges to a grand jury.                   As we have explained\n\nabove,   the   district      court    treated     the    proposed   change   as   a\n\nministerial correction to a clerical error.                 Our review of this\n\nissue is de novo.     United States v. Hernandez, 490 F.3d 81, 83 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).     Before we undertake that review, however, a bit of\n\nterminological housecleaning is in order.\n\n           The district court appears to have viewed its task as\n\nexplaining     why   the    proposed     change    was    not   a   \"constructive\n\namendment.\" This approach treats the word 'constructive' as a term\n\nof art for 'impermissible.'            That synonymic treatment may not be\n\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fquite right, however.             A constructive amendment, as the name\n\nsuggests, is constructive, that is, having effect in law though not\n\nnecessarily in fact.          Amendments to an indictment can of course be\n\ndirect rather than merely constructive, and they, too, are subject\n\nto the same strict constitutional standards.                  See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Daraio, 445 F.3d 253, 260โ61 & n.8 (3d Cir. 2006)\n\n(contrasting an alleged constructive amendment with a \"formal\n\namendment,\" and noting that there was no claim of \"actual amendment\n\nof the indictment by a literal change of its terms\"); United States\n\nv. Ford, 872 F.2d 1231, 1235โ36 (6th Cir. 1989) (describing first\n\nthe separate categories of amendments and variances, and then\n\nconstructive amendments as a form of amendment); 1 Charles Alan\n\nWright, et al., Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim. ยง 128 (4th ed. 2008)\n\n(\"Allowing      the    case    against     the   accused     to    shift    in    this\n\n[constructive] manner after the indictment is returned raises the\n\nsame concerns about undermining the grand jury's role as a direct\n\namendment.\").         Here, the district court's amendment was anything\n\nbut   constructive,       as   it   literally    altered     the    words    of   the\n\nindictment's text.         There may have been doubt as to whether the\n\nchange was permissible, but there can be no doubt that it was\n\nactual.\n\n           In    any     event,     the   district   court    appears      to    have,\n\nunderstandably, enlisted the nomenclature that we ourselves have\n\nused.   The common meaning of constructive amendment in our cases,\n\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\fwhich can be traced back to United States v. Dunn, 758 F.2d 30 (1st\n\nCir. 1985), is \"'when the charging terms of the indictment are\n\naltered, either literally or in effect, by prosecution or court\n\nafter the grand jury has last passed upon them.'\"                     Id. at 35\n\n(quoting Gaither v. United States, 413 F.2d 1061, 1071โ72 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1969)) (emphasis added).              The use of the word \"literally\"\n\nsuggests that the term encompasses changes that are factually true\n\njust as much as those that are legally imputed.               Yet the Gaither\n\ncase quoted in Dunn was not defining \"constructive amendment\" in\n\nparticular, but rather all amendments.              Returning to the original\n\nsource yields perhaps a more sensible definition: amendments in\n\ngeneral   may   be    literal    or   in   effect    (and,   of    these,   it   is\n\nspecifically    the     latter    that     we   refer   to    as    constructive\n\namendments).    In any case, ever since Dunn, we have adhered to our\n\ndefinition of constructive amendments, most likely because they are\n\nthe amendments that we most often come across.               See 1 Wright, et\n\nal. ยง 128 (noting that \"direct attempts to amend an indictment in\n\nany substantive way are rare\" and that \"[i]nstead, the most common\n\nchallenge in this area is a claim of 'constructive amendment'\").\n\nOn the rare occasion that we do confront a direct amendment to an\n\nindictment, such as here, referring to it as constructive may\n\nobfuscate the issue.       We will therefore eschew any reference to\n\n\"constructive\" amendment here, where there was an express amending\n\nof the indictment.\n\n\n\n                                      -38-\n\f              Returning to our de novo review of the amendment, we\n\nstart with the basis for the rule against amending an indictment\n\nwithout grand jury involvement.              The prohibition is based on the\n\nPresentment Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees in\n\nrelevant part that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a\n\ncapital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or\n\nindictment of a Grand Jury.\"            U.S. Const. amend. V.             The Supreme\n\nCourt   has    interpreted    this     provision      to   mean    that    \"after   an\n\nindictment has been returned[,] its charges may not be broadened\n\nthrough amendment except by the grand jury itself.\"                       Stirone v.\n\nUnited States, 361 U.S. 212, 215โ16 (1960); accord Russell v.\n\nUnited States, 369 U.S. 749, 770 (1962) (holding that an indictment\n\nmay not be \"amended except by resubmission to the grand jury\"); Ex\n\nparte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 9โ10 (1887).\n\n              Nevertheless,     this    prohibition        does    not     extend   to\n\nalterations that are \"merely a matter of form.\"                   Russell, 369 U.S.\n\nat 770; see also United States v. Winter, 663 F.2d 1120, 1139โ40\n\n(1st Cir. 1981); cf. United States v. Eirby, 262 F.3d 31, 38 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (\"[A]n indictment is sufficient if it specifies the\n\nelements of the offense charged, fairly apprises the defendant of\n\nthe charge against which he must defend, and allows him to contest\n\nit without fear of double jeopardy.\").                     Accordingly, we have\n\nallowed ministerial corrections of clerical errors in names, dates,\n\nand   citations,    so   long   as     the   change    would      not    deprive    the\n\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fdefendant of notice of the charges against him.                 See Eirby, 262\n\nF.3d at 38 (citations); United States v. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263,\n\n271 (1st Cir. 2001) (names); Jervis v. Hall, 622 F.2d 19, 22โ23\n\n(1st Cir. 1980) (dates).          Other circuits have similarly allowed\n\ncorrections regarding facts that are ancillary to the charged\n\noffense.    See, e.g., United States v. Powers, 572 F.2d 146, 152\n\n(8th Cir. 1978) (permitting change from \"30-30 caliber revolver\" to\n\n\"30-30 caliber rifle\").          In short, when a change \"le[aves] the\n\nsubstance of the charge unaffected, the switch d[oes] not usurp the\n\nprerogative of the grand jury.\"           Eirby, 262 F.3d at 38.\n\n            We agree with the district court that this is such a\n\ncase.   Because Dowdell was prosecuted under ยง 841(a)(1), which\n\nprohibits distribution of any controlled substance regardless of\n\ntype, drug identity had no bearing on the substance of the charge.\n\nSee United States v. Rutherford, 175 F.3d 899, 906 (11th Cir. 1999)\n\n(explaining that under ยง 841(a), \"[t]he nature of the controlled\n\nsubstance    neither      constitutes    an    element   of   the   offense   nor\n\nbroadens    the   bases    for   conviction,     but   is   relevant   only   for\n\nsentencing purposes\"); United States v. Deisch, 20 F.3d 139, 151\n\n(5th Cir. 1994) (concluding that \"the identity of the involved\n\ncontrolled substance as being 'cocaine base' rather than simply\n\n'cocaine' is not an element of any section 841(a)(1) offense\").\n\nThe statute would thus hold Dowdell as culpable for distribution of\n\ncocaine base as it would for distribution of cocaine powder.\n\n\n\n                                        -40-\n\fIndeed, the government could technically have omitted reference to\n\na particular controlled substance altogether. See United States v.\n\nLewis, 113 F.3d 487, 493 (3d Cir. 1997) (reasoning that because\n\n\"identity of the substance is a sentencing factor rather than an\n\nelement   of   the   offense,\"   an   indictment   under   ยง   841(a)   could\n\ntheoretically avoid specifying the identity of the substance).14\n\n           Had the government not clarified the matter before trial,\n\nand instead proceeded under the original indictment, there would\n\nhave likely been no grounds for objection whatsoever.             Certainly\n\nthere would have been no constructive amendment. See United States\n\nv. Fornilla-Castillo, 408 F.3d 52, 66 (1st Cir. 2005) (explaining\n\nthat no constructive amendment present where the difference between\n\nthe evidence presented and the text of the indictment does not\n\naffect any element of the offense).          At worst, we might have found\n\na variance, although even that is far from certain.              See United\n\nStates v. Wiley, 29 F.3d 345, 352 (8th Cir. 1994) (doubting any\n\nvariance whatsoever would arise from difference between charge\n\ninvolving \"cocaine\" and evidence involving cocaine base because\n\ncocaine base is merely an isomer of cocaine); United States v.\n\nDeisch, 20 F.3d 139, 151 (5th Cir. 1994) (holding that \"[f]or a\n\nsection 841(a)(1) offense involving cocaine base[,] the indictment\n\n\n     14\n      Of course, a defendant might be entitled to notice at some\npoint as to the nature of the substance alleged. We merely observe\nthat under ยง 841(a), such notice needn't come by way of the\nindictment.\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fneed only allege, and the jury need only find, that the substance\n\nwas cocaine\").    And had we gone so far as to find a variance, it\n\nwould have been a harmless one, given all the notice that Dowdell\n\nhad previously received that he was charged with distributing\n\ncocaine base rather than cocaine powder.             Cf. United States v.\n\nTwitty, 72 F.3d 228, 231 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"So long as the statutory\n\nviolation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the facts\n\nfound are somewhat different than those charged -- so long as the\n\ndifference does not cause unfair prejudice.\"). It would be strange\n\nindeed to punish the government for clarifying the indictment\n\nbefore trial when it would have been permitted to proceed without\n\ntaking any action.\n\n            Dowdell   argues   that    the   alteration   was   nevertheless\n\nprohibited based on two premises that are not in fact implicated\n\nhere. First, he claims that the change to cocaine base effectively\n\nexposed him to a harsher sentencing range.           Yet even if sentencing\n\namplification were relevant, none occurred here.           It is true that\n\nunder ยง 841(a), cocaine base normally exposes defendants to steeper\n\nsentencing ranges than does cocaine powder.           But here, Dowdell was\n\nsentenced as a career offender under Section 4B1.1 of the U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines.     That provision would have applied in equal\n\nforce whether he were convicted of distributing cocaine powder or\n\ncocaine base; the guideline range was a product of the 30-year\n\nstatutory   maximum   in   ยง   841(b)(1)(c)    and   Dowdell's    particular\n\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fcriminal history category.            Thus, because we conclude that the\n\nchange did not in fact alter the sentencing range, we need not\n\nresolve     whether    sentencing    ramifications     are    relevant   to    the\n\namendment analysis.15\n\n               Second, Dowdell asserts that the difference in chemical\n\ncomposition between cocaine powder and cocaine base means that the\n\ngovernment would have had to proffer different evidence for each of\n\nthe    substances.       Again,     even   assuming   the    relevance   of    the\n\nconclusion, its predicate is incorrect.               As far as culpability\n\nunder ยง 841(a) is concerned, cocaine base is merely an isomer of\n\ncocaine.       See Wiley, 29 F.3d at 352; United States v. Pierce, 893\n\nF.2d    669,    676   (5th   Cir.   1990).16    The   government   could      have\n\n       15\n        The district court expressly found no constitutional\nviolation because \"mitigation of sentencing ramifications within\nthe statutory maximum is not among the substantial rights protected\nby the right to be indicted by a grand jury.\" Dowdell, 464 F.\nSupp. 2d at 68. The \"substantial rights\" standard, however, is\nonly appropriate in the context of variances. It is true that if\nthe government had proceeded to trial with the original indictment,\nthen variance doctrine would have been the appropriate analytical\nframework. But since we deal here with a direct amendment, rather\nthan a variance, reference to the scope of the defendant's\nsubstantial rights is misplaced. In any case, we leave resolution\nof this issue for a day when the question is put more squarely\nbefore us.\n       16\n      We do not go so far as to hold in this case that a trial\njudge is necessarily permitted simply to swap any controlled\nsubstance under ยง 841(a) for any other controlled substance.\n\"Cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" are inherently related in ways that\nother potential pairings are not. Had the difference been between\ncocaine and Vicodin, or cocaine and marijuana, it is possible the\nlarger gap would weigh into our analysis. But cf. United States v.\nKnuckles, 581 F.2d 305, 311โ12 (2d Cir. 1978) (finding no\nsubstantial variance between charge of heroin distribution under\nยง 841(a) and evidence of cocaine distribution).\n\n                                       -43-\n\fproferred evidence of distribution of cocaine base and still\n\ncarried its burden of proving distribution of \"cocaine.\" Wiley, 29\n\nF.3d at 352; Deisch, 20 F.3d at 150โ51; Pierce, 893 F.2d at 676.\n\n          In sum, we hold that the district court's amendment of\n\nthe indictment from distribution of \"cocaine\" to \"cocaine base\" did\n\nnot affect the substance of the charges and therefore did not\n\noffend the Presentment Clause.\n\n                      D. Evidentiary Rulings\n\n          Dowdell   next   raises    two    evidentiary   challenges,   one\n\nconcerning the admission of the police booking sheet and one\n\nconcerning admission of the coconspirator's videotaped statements.\n\nWe take up each in turn.\n\n1. Admission of police booking sheet\n\n          Dowdell claims that the booking sheet from his July 16,\n\n2001 arrest was inadmissible hearsay.             Normally, an otherwise\n\nhearsay public record is admissible so long as it sets forth\n\n\"matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which\n\nmatters there was a duty to report.\"             Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)(B).\n\nHowever, under what is sometimes called the \"law enforcement\n\nexception,\" Rule 803(8)(B) retains the hearsay prohibition in\n\ncriminal cases for any \"matters observed by police officers and\n\nother law enforcement personnel.\"          Id.   We have interpreted this\n\nrule to mean that, as a general matter, \"police reports are\n\ninadmissible in a criminal case when offered by the prosecution.\"\n\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\fUnited States v. Arias-Santana, 964 F.2d 1262, 1264 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).   The Rule on its face seems equally applicable to the\n\nobservations contained in a booking sheet.            Nevertheless, the\n\ndistrict court held that the law enforcement exception was not\n\nmeant to encompass routine, non-adversarial documents, and on that\n\nbasis found the booking sheet admissible.        Although our review of\n\nrulings admitting or excluding evidence is typically for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, our review of the district court's interpretation of a\n\nrule of evidence is de novo.      United States v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d\n\n36, 58 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            We have yet to consider whether the law enforcement\n\nexception   applies   to   an   ostensibly   objective,   non-adversarial\n\ndocument such as a booking sheet.            On two previous occasions,\n\nhowever, we have at least hinted that it should not.           First, in\n\nUnited States v. Union Nacional de Trabajadores, 576 F.2d 388 (1st\n\nCir. 1978), we held admissible a copy of a U.S. marshal's return\n\ndespite its genesis at the hands of law enforcement personnel.         We\n\nreasoned that\n\n            [t]here is nothing to indicate that Congress\n            meant to cut back upon the common law rule\n            respecting sheriff's returns.   A sheriff or\n            marshal reporting the service of process is\n            not reporting in the capacity of a police\n            observer at the scene of a crime, nor is he\n            ordinarily connected with the case in a law\n            enforcement capacity.      The \"adversarial\"\n            circumstances which might render a law\n            enforcement officer's observations unreliable\n            are unlikely, therefore, to be present.\n\n\n\n                                   -45-\n\fId. at 391.       Then, in United States v. Trenkler, 61 F.3d 45 (1st\n\nCir. 1995), we cited United States v. Brown, 9 F.3d 907, 911-12\n\n(11th Cir. 1993), in dicta for the proposition that \"Rule 803(8)\n\ndoes not necessarily prohibit the use of police records prepared in\n\na    routine     non-adversarial     setting        that    do    not   result        from\n\nsubjective investigation and evaluation.\" Trenkler, 61 F.3d at 59.\n\n               Drawing a line at routine, non-adversarial documents\n\nwould best comport with the purpose for which Congress originally\n\napproved the exception.           The Rule's enactment history indicates\n\nthat \"the reason for this exclusion is that observations by police\n\nofficers at the scene of the crime or the apprehension of the\n\ndefendant are not as reliable as observations by public officials\n\nin    other     cases   because     of    the      adversarial      nature       of    the\n\nconfrontation between the police and the defendant in criminal\n\ncases.\"   S. Rep. No. 1277, 93d Con., 2d Sess., reprinted in (1974)\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 7051, 7064.          Congress was generally \"concerned about\n\nprosecutors attempting to prove their cases in chief simply by\n\nputting       into   evidence     police        officers'        reports    of        their\n\ncontemporaneous observations of crime.\"                United States v. Grady,\n\n544 F.2d 598, 604 (2d Cir. 1976).\n\n               Recognizing   this        intent,     those       circuits    to       have\n\nconsidered the issue have all found that the limitation in Rule\n\n803(8)(B) does not exclude routine observations that are inherently\n\n\n\n\n                                         -46-\n\fnon-adversarial.17        See, e.g., United States v.

Oates, however, was concerned\nnot so much with what constitutes a \"report\" as with who constitute\n\"law enforcement personnel,\" holding that the term encompassed\nchemists working in the U.S. customs service. Here, there is no\ndispute that the police officers who drew up the booking sheet were\nwithin the class of actors envisioned by Rule 803(8)(B).       Less\nclear is whether the documents were within the class of evidence.\nOn this point, even the Second Circuit has acknowledged that the\nRule's language is not absolute.      See Grady, 544 F.2d at 604;\nUnited States v. Feliz, 467 F.3d 227, 236โ37 (2d Cir. 2006)\n(autopsy reports prepared by medical examiner's office admissible\nbecause they were routinely created and did not constitute police\nobservations).\n\n                                        -47-\n\finformation on the property receipt\"); United States v. Quezada,\n\n754 F.2d 1190, 1193โ94 (5th Cir. 1985) (admitting an INS form\n\nindicating      arrest    and      deportation      because       officials'        only\n\nmotivation was to \"mechanically register an unambiguous factual\n\nmatter\"); United States v. Orozco, 590 F.2d 789, 793โ94 (9th Cir.\n\n1979) (finding no error in admission of Customs Service computer\n\ncards of license numbers of cars crossing the border since \"the\n\nsimple    recordation     of    license    numbers    .   .   .    is   not    of    the\n\nadversarial confrontation nature which might cloud [an officer's]\n\nperception\"); Grady, 544 F.2d at 604 (permitting admission of\n\nserial number and receipt of weapons because \"they did not concern\n\nobservations . . . of the appellants' commission of crimes,\" but\n\nrather were \"strictly routine records\").\n\n            Dowdell argues that this construction violates the Rule's\n\nplain language, which seems to bar categorically the prosecution's\n\nintroduction of any and all documents prepared by the police. This\n\nmuch may be true.        Yet, the alternative would violate the rule's\n\nplain purpose, and \"[i]t is a well-established canon of statutory\n\nconstruction that a court should go beyond the literal language of\n\na statute if reliance on that language would defeat the plain\n\npurpose of the statute.\"           Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461\n\nU.S. 574, 586 (1983).          Given the clear intent that undergirded the\n\npassage    of   Rule     803(8),    we    decline    to   give     it   a     literal,\n\nunqualified meaning. See United States v. Smith, 521 F.2d 957, 968\n\n\n\n                                         -48-\n\fn.24 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (refusing to construe 803(8)(B) according to\n\nits literal meaning because it \"should be read[] in accordance with\n\nthe obvious intent of Congress\"); see also United States v. Pagan-\n\nSantini, 451 F.3d 258, 264 (1st Cir. 2006) (referring to Rule\n\n803(8) as \"no model of lucid drafting\").           Instead, we join the\n\nother circuits in concluding that ministerial, non-adversarial\n\ninformation is admissible under Rule 803(8)(B), notwithstanding its\n\ndocumentation at the hands of law enforcement personnel.\n\n           With this interpretation of Rule 803(8)(B) in place, we\n\nnow must consider whether a booking sheet would violate it.             In an\n\nunpublished decision, a panel of the Fifth Circuit answered this\n\nprecise question in the negative, summarily finding that \"booking\n\ninformation [i]s taken in a routine, nonadversarial setting.\"\n\nUnited States v. Haughton, 235 Fed. App'x 254, 2007 WL 2186250, at\n\n*1 (5th Cir. Jul. 30 2007).       We agree.       The rote recitation of\n\nbiographical information in a booking sheet ordinarily does not\n\nimplicate the same potential perception biases that a subjective\n\nnarrative of an investigation or an alleged offense might.                   A\n\nbooking sheet does not recount the work that led to an arrest so\n\nmuch as the mere fact that an arrest occurred.          As a result, unlike\n\nthe   investigative   reports   that   lie   at   the   heart    of   the   law\n\nenforcement exception, booking sheets raise little concern that\n\nsuspicion of guilt will function as proof of guilt.             We think that\n\na police booking sheet is in this respect analogous to the INS\n\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fwarrant that was the subject of the Fifth Circuit's analysis in\n\nQuezada.    The    Quezada   court   upheld      the    admissibility   of   the\n\nwarrant,   which    recounted   the        defendant's     prior   arrest    and\n\ndeportation,\"[d]ue to the lack of any motivation on the part of the\n\nrecording official to do other than mechanically register an\n\nunambiguous factual matter.\" 754 F.2d at 1194. The same reasoning\n\napplies here.\n\n           Dowdell asserts that, even if this much may be true in\n\nthe abstract, the particular booking sheet admitted in his trial\n\nmay have been prepared with an eye toward proving his identity and\n\nas such was excludable as \"indicat[ing] lack of trustworthiness.\"\n\nFed. R. Evid. 803(8)(c).      He offers no factual support for such a\n\nfinding,   instead      indulging     in     a   bare     worst-case-scenario\n\nspeculation that the booking officer might have colluded with\n\nMonteiro before completing the form.             We need not tarry on this.\n\nAn entirely conjectural and uncorroborated conspiracy theory does\n\nnot   transform    an    otherwise     trustworthy        document   into     an\n\nuntrustworthy one.18     There was no abuse of discretion.\n\n      18\n      We note that other circuits have placed the burden of proving\nuntrustworthiness under Rule 803(8) squarely on the shoulders of\nthe party opposing admission.     See, e.g., Boerner v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Co., 394 F.3d 594, 600โ01 (8th Cir. 2005);\nBridgeway Corp. v. Citibank, 201 F.3d 134, 143โ44 (2d Cir. 2000);\nZeus Enterprises, Inc. v. Alphin Aircraft, Inc., 190 F.3d 238, 241\n(4th Cir. 1999); Reynolds v. Green, 184 F.3d 589, 596 (6th Cir.\n1999); United States v. Loyola-Dominguez, 125 F.3d 1315, 1318 (9th\nCir. 1997); Graef v. Chemical Leaman Corp., 106 F.3d 112, 118 (5th\nCir. 1997). We have not yet considered who should bear the burden\nin this context, although our default position seems to be that it\nwould be the party seeking admission, United States v. Bartelho,\n\n                                     -50-\n\f2. Admission of videotapes\n\n                 Dowdell's second evidentiary challenge, that the court\n\nerred       in   admitting   White's   videotaped   comments    to   Monteiro,\n\nimplicates another carve-out from the prohibition on hearsay.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E) provides that any statement\n\nof a coconspirator acting during the course and in furtherance of\n\na conspiracy is non-hearsay and, therefore, admissible for the\n\ntruth of the matter asserted.           In order to determine whether the\n\nfactual predicates for this exception exist, the trial court must\n\nmake    a    so-called   Petrozziello    ruling.    See   United     States   v.\n\nPetrozziello, 547 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).                 A Petrozziello\n\nruling has two stages.         First, following a timely objection, the\n\ncourt makes a provisional finding as to whether the evidence is\n\nadmissible.         If so, that finding is then subject to a second and\n\nfinal review at the close of all the evidence.             United States v.\n\nFamania-Roche, 537 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir. 2008).             At both stages,\n\nthe court applies a preponderance of the evidence standard, namely,\n\nwhether \"it is more likely than not that the declarant and the\n\ndefendant were members of a conspiracy when the hearsay statement\n\n\n\n129 F.3d 663, 670 (1st Cir. 1997), which in this case is the\ngovernment. Regardless, even if the government were to bear the\nburden here, neither the booking sheet itself nor the known facts\nsurrouding its preparation suggest untrustworthiness by a\npreponderance of the evidence. \"The government's burden [of proof]\n. . . does not mean . . . that it must disprove all of the\ndefendant's alternative theories, no matter how speculative or\nimplausible.\" United States v. Ribeiro, 397 F.3d 43, 53 (1st Cir.\n2005).\n\n                                       -51-\n\fwas   made,    and   that   the   statement   was    in    furtherance    of   the\n\nconspiracy.\"     Id.\n\n              Finding such a preponderance here, the district court\n\nadmitted      White's   statements.      Dowdell      now    argues    that    the\n\nprosecution's evidence established nothing more than friendship and\n\nproximity with the declarant, rather than a joint venture to sell\n\ncontrolled     substances.        Assuming    this   argument    was     properly\n\npreserved, we must still accept the district court's findings of\n\nfact unless they were clearly erroneous.19                See United States v.\n\nThompson, 449 F.3d 267, 273 (1st Cir. 2006).              This heavy burden is\n\n\n      19\n      There may be some uncertainty as to the proper standard of\nreview for Petrozziello rulings, due to recent cases that employ\nthe abuse of discretion standard.     See, e.g., United States v.\nVazquez-Botet, 532 F.3d 37, 65 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v.\nColon Diaz, 521 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v.\nRivera-Hernandez, 497 F.3d 71, 82 (1st Cir. 2007). But we long ago\nsaid in United States v. Patterson, 644 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir.\n1981), and have endorsed on countless subsequent occasions, that we\nreview a trial court's Petrozziello determination for clear error.\nEvery other circuit has long been in accord. See United States v.\nEdmond, 52 F.3d 1080, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 1995); United States v.\nGessa, 971 F.2d 1257, 1260โ61 (6th Cir. 1992); United States v.\nCruz, 910 F.2d 1072, 1081 n.11 (3d Cir. 1990); United States v.\nBouck, 877 F.2d 828, 831 (10th Cir. 1989); United States v.\nJackson, 863 F.2d 1168, 1172 (4th Cir. 1989). United States v.\nKaden, 819 F.2d 813, 820 (7th Cir. 1987); United States v. Rahme,\n813 F.2d 31, 36 (2d Cir. 1987); United States v. Silverman, 771\nF.2d 1193, 1199 (9th Cir. 1985); United States v. Harshaw, 705 F.2d\n317, 320 (8th Cir. 1983; United States v. Bulman, 667 F.2d 1374,\n1379 (11th Cir. 1982); United States v. Perry, 624 F.2d 29, 30 (5th\nCir. 1980).      See also Christopher B. Mueller & Laird C.\nKirkpatrick, Federal Evidence ยง 8:62 (3d ed. 2007) (referring to\n\"almost universal agreement\" throughout the federal judiciary on\nuse of clear error review). In the Petrozziello context, it is\nlikely that review for abuse of discretion applies only to the\ndistrict court's ultimate decision whether to admit or exclude the\nstatement, and not to the underlying factual findings.\n\n                                      -52-\n\fcarried only when \"although there is evidence to support [the\n\nfinding], the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with\n\nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\n\nWhere the evidence is susceptible of two plausible interpretations,\n\nthe   trier     of    fact's      choice   between     them    cannot     be   clearly\n\nerroneous.\"        United States v. Newton, 326 F.3d 253, 257 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).      A heavier burden still awaits those attempting unpreserved\n\nchallenges, which are reviewed only for plain error. United States\n\nv. Aviles-Colon, 536 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2008).                          Though the\n\nparties disagree as to whether Dowdell successfully preserved his\n\nchallenge by renewing his objection at the close of all the\n\nevidence, the dispute is ultimately irrelevant.                   Even adopting the\n\nless deferential standard, we would still affirm the district\n\ncourt's ruling.\n\n              It     is   well    established      that    \"the   preponderance    of\n\nevidence required for the introduction of an out-of-court statement\n\nunder Rule 801(d)(2)(E) must necessarily comprise more than the\n\nweight of the statement itself.\"                  United States v. Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d 1161, 1181 (1st Cir. 1993).                     An alleged coconspirator's\n\ndeclarations are thus insufficient in isolation. At the same time,\n\nhowever, the court may consider the hearsay statements themselves\n\nin    the    context      of     other   extrinsic,       corroborating    evidence.\n\nBourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 180โ81 (1987); United\n\nStates v. Mangual-Garcia, 505 F.3d 1, 8 n.5 (1st Cir. 2007).                     Such\n\n\n\n                                           -53-\n\fcorroboration was amply available here.              When Monteiro first saw\n\nWhite on July 6, White was counting cash with Dowdell.                     Moments\n\nlater, when White agreed to make the initial sale to Monteiro, his\n\nfirst action was to walk over to Dowdell and consult with him.\n\nThen, on July 16, Dowdell sold drugs to Monteiro when White was\n\nunavailable.       These      facts,   coupled      with    White's   statements\n\nthemselves, adequately supported a finding of a conspiracy by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, the district court did\n\nnot clearly err in its Petrozziello ruling.\n\n             Dowdell further maintains that even if the statements\n\nthemselves were admissible, introducing them on video nevertheless\n\nviolated     Federal   Rule    of   Evidence     403,      which   provides   that\n\notherwise admissible evidence \"may be excluded if its probative\n\nvalue   is    substantially     outweighed     by    the     danger   of   unfair\n\nprejudice.\"     Specifically, he argues that a printed transcript\n\nwould have been less prejudicial because it would not have allowed\n\nthe jury to see White, who, according to Dowdell, \"looks like an\n\nobvious drug addict and just makes a very bad impression.\"                 But the\n\nmere fact that Dowdell might have fared better without the video is\n\nnot in itself cause for exclusion.             \"By design, all evidence is\n\nmeant to be prejudicial; it is only unfair prejudice which must be\n\navoided.\"     United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (emphasis in original).             The trial court has wide\n\nlatitude in determining when the amount of unfair prejudice has\n\n\n\n                                       -54-\n\ftipped the scale too far.         \"Only rarely -- and in extraordinarily\n\ncompelling circumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold\n\nappellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment\n\nconcerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair\n\neffect.\"   United States v. Shinderman, 515 F.3d 5, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340\n\n(1st Cir. 1988)).\n\n           In this case, in which the reliability of Monteiro's\n\nidentification     of   Dowdell    as    Smoke    was       hotly   contested,    any\n\ncontextual inferences available from a visual record would be\n\nhighly probative.       Whatever minimal unfair prejudice might have\n\nresulted from seeing White's physical appearance, it did not\n\novercome this probative value.           In any event, it was Dowdell, not\n\nthe government, who chose to associate himself with White.                        We\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion.\n\n                                  E. Sentencing\n\n           This    brings   us    to    the    last    of    Dowdell's   litany   of\n\narguments. He asks us to vacate his 198-month sentence because the\n\ngovernment allegedly reneged on a promise not to seek a sentence\n\ngreater than 20 years.       A sentence of 198 months is, of course,\n\nitself less than 20 years.         Dowdell's theory is that the sentence\n\nwas nevertheless voidable because the government's filing of an\n\ninformation   of   prior    conviction,        which    increased      the   minimum\n\nguideline sentence from 210 to 262 months, raised the baseline from\n\n\n\n                                        -55-\n\fwhich the trial court would have varied downward.          Because this\n\nissue was not raised at sentencing, we review for plain error,\n\nUnited States v. Matos, 531 F.3d 121, 122 (1st Cir. 2008), although\n\nwe think this argument ultimately unavailing under any standard of\n\nreview.\n\n          Dowdell does not make clear what jurisprudential basis\n\nwould merit vacating a sentence in this context.         He directs our\n\nattention to Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257 (1971), United\n\nStates v. Gonczy, 357 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2004), United States v.\n\nRexach, 896 F.2d 710, 714 (2d Cir. 1990), and United States v.\n\nGiorgi, 840 F.2d 1022, 1026 (1st Cir. 1988), but none is on point.\n\nThose cases all deal with a prosecutor's breach of an assurance\n\nmade during a plea agreement, not an isolated comment made during\n\na pre-trial hearing in a case in which the defendant received his\n\nfull panoply of constitutional trial rights.       Cf. Gonczy, 357 F.3d\n\nat 53 (explaining that the \"meticulous standards of both promise\n\nand performance\" that govern prosecutors in plea agreements stem\n\nfrom the defendant's waiver of fundamental constitutional rights\n\nthat would otherwise be present in a jury trial).\n\n          Instead, we understand Dowdell to be advancing a theory\n\nof estoppel.     The lack of any briefing on this issue renders the\n\nissue waived.     See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).     Even if not waived, the argument is not supported by\n\nthe   record.      The   government   did   not,   as   Dowdell   argues,\n\n\n\n                                  -56-\n\faffirmatively commit itself to the original 20-year statutory\n\nmaximum. Rather, it offered a descriptive (and accurate) statement\n\nof sentencing law.      The government explained to the court that the\n\nproposed change to the indictment would not violate Apprendi in\n\nthat the statutory maximum would remain the same irrespective of\n\nthe controlled substance alleged in the indictment.         See Apprendi\n\nv. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).       At the time, that statutory\n\nmaximum was 20 years.        Upon the filing of the information, it\n\nbecame 30 years. Although the number changed, the substance of the\n\ngovernment's remark -- that drug identity would have no impact on\n\nthe statutory maximum -- remained just as applicable.           Thus we\n\ndisagree with Dowdell's assertion that the government bound itself\n\nto   any   particular    sentencing   recommendation   to   begin   with.\n\nMoreover, even had such a promise existed, there is no evidence in\n\nthe record to suggest that the court gave any weight whatsoever to\n\nthe government recommendation at sentencing. Dowdell thus fails to\n\nshow a reasonable probability that he would have received a more\n\nlenient sentence but for the alleged error.     See Matos, 531 F.3d at\n\n122โ23.     For all of these reasons, we find no flaw in Dowdell's\n\nsentence.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n            The appellant's conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -57-\n\f",

Nathaniel M.

Following a three-day jury trial,\n\nDefendant Darryl Dowdell was convicted of distribution of cocaine\n\nbase     and    sentenced       as   a   career     offender   to    198    months'\n\nimprisonment.           Dowdell appeals the conviction, alleging three\n\ndefects:         that    the    delay    between    his    indictment      by   state\n\nauthorities and his ultimate trial in federal court violated his\n\nSixth Amendment speedy trial rights as well as the Interstate\n\nAgreement on Detainers; that the district court's amendment of the\n\nindictment       from     \"cocaine\"      to     \"cocaine   base\"    violated      the\n\npresentment clause of the Fifth Amendment; and that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion on various evidentiary rulings.                       He also\n\nchallenges the sentence imposed, arguing that the government's\n\nrecommended sentence of 262 months violated a promise not to seek\n\na term of imprisonment longer than 20 years.                For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we affirm both the conviction and the sentence.\n\nI. Background and Travel\n\n               While the facts surrounding the underlying offense are\n\nnot complicated, the pre-trial procedural history of this case\n\npresents a maze of overlapping federal and state activity, a flurry\n\nof continuances, and a revolving door of withdrawn and newly\n\nappointed defense counsel.\n\n                               A. The Subject Offense\n\n               The following facts were elicited at Dowdell's federal\n\ntrial.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f           In the summer of 2001, several Massachusetts authorities\n\nlaunched a coordinated effort with the federal Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration (DEA) to investigate drug trafficking in the area of\n\na housing project in Roxbury.           The investigation involved a task\n\nforce of undercover officers who made controlled purchases of\n\ncocaine and crack cocaine from dealers operating in the project.\n\nOne of these officers was Boston Housing Authority investigator\n\nJoao Monteiro.   Posing as a construction worker, Monteiro drove an\n\nunmarked car with a concealed audio transmitter and a video camera\n\nthat focused on the automobile's interior passenger compartment.\n\n           On July 6, 2001, Monteiro observed Dowdell standing on\n\nthe   sidewalk   with    a   man     named   Robert   White,    whom    Monteiro\n\nrecognized from previous encounters.              Dowdell was wearing dark\n\npants and a black shirt.              He and White were counting cash.\n\nMonteiro   signaled     to   White    that   he   wished   to   purchase   crack\n\ncocaine, and White went to talk to Dowdell.            White then approached\n\nMonteiro's car and got into the passenger seat.                     White told\n\nMonteiro that Dowdell, at this point identified only as \"the dark-\n\nskinned brother\" in the dark shirt, was a trustworthy dealer.\n\nAfter purchasing 1.1 grams of crack cocaine for $230, Monteiro\n\nasked White whether \"the dude in black\" was the person to see for\n\nfuture   purchases    if     White    were   unavailable.       White   replied\n\naffirmatively and informed Monteiro that Dowdell went by the name\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f\"Smoke.\" Monteiro departed, after informing White that he would be\n\nreturning in a short while to make another purchase.\n\n            Some 45 minutes later, Monteiro returned to the project\n\nand saw Dowdell on a bicycle.     Monteiro approached Dowdell, who\n\nasked Monteiro if he wanted anything.    Monteiro responded that he\n\nwas looking for White, and Dowdell then biked over to the spot\n\nwhere White was standing.   White came over to Monteiro's car and,\n\nfor the second time that night, sat down beside Monteiro in the\n\npassenger seat.    Monteiro told White that he wished to purchase\n\nmore drugs, as well as baggies for repackaging.   White agreed and,\n\nafter directing Monteiro to a parking area close to the spot of the\n\nfirst transaction, sold him 1.2 grams of crack cocaine and baggies\n\nfor $210.\n\n            Monteiro returned for a third buy on July 16, ten days\n\nafter the first two.   When he arrived, he saw Dowdell standing in\n\na small group, wearing blue jeans and a blue checkered shirt.\n\nMonteiro again asked for White, who was unavailable.       Monteiro\n\nasked for directions and drove away, making it appear that he was\n\ngoing off to search for White.    After waiting long enough to give\n\nthe impression that the search was unsuccessful, he returned to the\n\nproject looking for Dowdell.     He found Dowdell on the sidewalk,\n\nstill wearing a blue checkered shirt.     Monteiro called out \"Yo,\n\nSmoke, can I holler at you.\"     Dowdell approached Monteiro's car,\n\nand the two of them proceeded to have a conversation through the\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fpassenger-side window.     Continuing to address Dowdell as \"Smoke,\"\n\nMonteiro asked for about $200 worth of crack cocaine. Dowdell left\n\nbriefly to meet with another individual and then returned with six\n\nbags of crack cocaine, worth approximately $100.    Seven more bags\n\nwould eventually follow. The total weight of the thirteen bags was\n\napproximately 2.3 grams.    During this whole encounter, Dowdell was\n\nonly partially visible on the video that Monteiro's surveillance\n\ncamera recorded.\n\n          Driving away, Monteiro narrated a description of Dowdell\n\nfor the surveillance recording.    He stated, \"Smoke is the same kid\n\nas the last time.. [sic] he's got on a checkered shirt blue...blue\n\ncheckered shirt umm and he was riding a bicycle.\"\n\n          Later that day, Dowdell was arrested on an outstanding\n\nwarrant unrelated to his transactions with Monteiro.         He was\n\nbrought to a Boston police station where a booking photo was taken.\n\nIn the photo, Dowdell was wearing a blue checkered shirt, as\n\nMonteiro had described earlier in the day.       Later, around four\n\nhours after completing the buy from Dowdell, Monteiro was shown the\n\nphotograph and identified the depicted individual as \"Smoke.\"\n\nMonteiro reported that the individual in the photograph was the\n\nsame person from whom he had purchased drugs that day and whom he\n\nhad seen standing on the corner with White ten days beforehand.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f                   B. Pre-Trial Procedural History\n\n            Because the timing of particular pre-trial events is\n\nimportant to our legal analysis, we must delve into some detail in\n\nretracing the path on which this case traveled before it reached\n\nthe jury.\n\n            On March 25, 2002, eight months after the July 2001\n\nencounters at the housing project, a Suffolk County grand jury\n\nindicted    Dowdell,    based   on   those   events,     for       distributing    a\n\ncontrolled substance in the vicinity of school property.                     At his\n\narraignment, he pled not guilty and was released on bail, which was\n\nsubsequently   revoked    in    October     2003   due   to    a    charge   on   an\n\nunrelated crime.       On April 12, 2004, Dowdell's appointed counsel\n\nwithdrew his representation and was replaced.                  That replacement\n\nwould in turn withdraw in August of that year, and the court\n\nappointed a third attorney.\n\n            On November 17, 2004, the federal government filed a\n\ncriminal complaint against Dowdell based on the July 2001 events,\n\ncharging him with distribution of crack cocaine in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1).      At that time, Dowdell was already serving a\n\n27-month sentence in the Suffolk County House of Correction after\n\na conviction on the unrelated charge that had triggered his bail\n\nrevocation.    One month later, in December 2004, the Commonwealth\n\nentered a nolle prosequi on the March 25, 2002 indictment for\n\ndistributing a controlled substance in the vicinity of school\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fproperty,    effectively    terminating        its     prosecution.     Dowdell\n\nremained in state custody as he continued to serve his ongoing\n\nsentence on the unrelated charge, but from this point onward he\n\nfaced only the federal distribution charge.\n\n            On February 4, 2005, then unrepresented by counsel,\n\nDowdell   wrote   a   letter   to   a    clerk   for    the   magistrate   judge\n\noverseeing the pre-trial proceedings in his federal case.                   The\n\nletter invoked his speedy trial rights under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161.\n\nNearly three weeks later, Dowdell followed this letter with a\n\nformal request under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD),\n\n18 U.S.C. App. 2, ยง 2, that he be transferred from state to federal\n\ncustody as he awaited the resolution of the federal charge.                  On\n\nMarch 14, 2005, the federal government petitioned for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus ad prosequendum, and on March 22, 2005, Dowdell was\n\nbrought into federal district court for his initial appearance, at\n\nwhich point he was assigned new representation.\n\n            During    the      initial        appearance,     the     prosecutor\n\nacknowledged that Dowdell's transfer into federal custody was\n\npursuant to a writ \"based on the defendant's request under the\n\ninterstate agreement on detainers.\"            He proceeded to explain that\n\nDowdell had no intention of waiving his IAD rights, which Dowdell's\n\ncounsel confirmed. By preserving his rights under the IAD, Dowdell\n\nwas to remain in federal custody and receive credit toward the\n\nfulfillment of his term of incarceration for the unrelated charge\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fin   the    state-court   system,   but       receive    no    credit     toward   any\n\neventual federal sentence for the distribution offense until the\n\nstate-court sentence had fully elapsed.\n\n              The next day, March 23, a federal grand jury indicted\n\nDowdell,      charging    him    with    one     count        of     \"knowingly    and\n\nintentionally      possess[ing]     with        intent        to     distribute    and\n\ndistribut[ing] a quantity of cocaine\" in violation of ยง 841(a)(1).\n\nDowdell was arraigned on this charge on March 29, 2005.                     As in the\n\nstate court proceedings, he entered a plea of not guilty.                          The\n\ncourt held an initial status conference on May 11, 2005, during\n\nwhich it set a deadline of June 23 for all dispositive motions.                     At\n\nDowdell's request, that deadline was later extended to July 8.\n\n              Dowdell filed a motion to dismiss the indictment at the\n\nnew July 8 deadline, claiming a violation of the Speedy Trial Act,\n\n18 U.S.C. ยง 3161, as well as violation of the Sixth Amendment.1\n\nSpecifically, Dowdell posited that prejudice had resulted from the\n\npre-indictment delay in federal court.2 In an unsworn declaration,\n\nDowdell      contended    that    the     Commonwealth             had   vindictively\n\nchoreographed the delay and the eventual transfer to federal\n\njurisdiction in retribution for his declining to testify before a\n\n\n      1\n          The Speedy Trial Act claim is not before us on appeal.\n      2\n      The constitutional provision that applies to pre-indictment\ndelay is, in fact, the Fifth, rather than the Sixth, Amendment.\nSee United States v. Marler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448999\"><a href=\"/opinion/448999/united-states-v-william-t-marler/\"><span class=\"volume\">756</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209โ10 (1st Cir. 1985).\nDowdell's counsel appears to have corrected this point in a\nsupplemental filing.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fstate grand jury in a shooting case in which he had apparently been\n\nthe victim. The declaration claimed that the district attorney was\n\nupset at Dowdell's alleged inability to see the face of the shooter\n\nand had stated \"if you blow my case I am gonna get your drug case\n\nsent back to the feds.\"        This alleged state-federal collusion,\n\nDowdell argued, meant that the starting point for measuring any\n\nspeedy   trial   violations   ought   to   be   the    date   of   his   state\n\nindictment, that is, March 25, 2002, rather than the federal\n\nindictment on March 23, 2005.\n\n           The docket then lay dormant for four months.             Although\n\nthe government was required by rule to file its opposition to the\n\nmotion to dismiss within two weeks, see D. Mass. R. 7.1(b)(2), it\n\nwas not until November 7, 2005 that the government sought leave to\n\nfile a late opposition.       Apparently, the government had actually\n\nprepared the memorandum of law in July and assumed that it had been\n\ntimely submitted. The motion for leave to file explained the delay\n\nas a simple error in performing the electronic submission.                The\n\ndistrict court granted this request, finding no evidence of bad\n\nfaith on the part of the government.       The next day, the government\n\nfiled its opposition.\n\n           On December 17, 2005, before the court had taken any\n\naction on the pending motion to dismiss, Dowdell moved to withdraw\n\nhis appointed counsel -- as he had done twice before in state court\n\n-- claiming a breakdown in communication.             The court held an ex\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fparte hearing on February 14, 2006.           It explained to Dowdell that\n\nappointing new counsel would further delay his case.                  Dowdell\n\nexpressed that he would ideally like to resolve the case as soon as\n\npossible with his current counsel, but \"we seem to not be seeing\n\neye to eye with each other, so I thought I had no choice but to do\n\nthat. . . . I don't want to put it off anymore.                I've told him\n\nthat.        But I just felt that my life is on the line here, and I just\n\nfelt that I need a new attorney.\"             The court granted Dowdell's\n\nrequest and allowed his attorney to withdraw.                Dowdell and the\n\ngovernment agreed that any time that elapsed between the withdrawal\n\nand an eventual ruling on the motion to dismiss would be excluded\n\nfrom the speedy trial calculation.\n\n                On March 2, 2006, the court appointed new counsel,\n\nVictoria Bonilla.          On June 16, 2006, after Bonilla had time to\n\nacquaint herself with the case, Dowdell moved to supplement the\n\nmotion to dismiss. The court held a non-evidentiary hearing on the\n\nmatter and, after setting a trial date of July 31, 2006, granted\n\nthe   motion       to   supplement.   On     June   30,   Dowdell   filed   the\n\nsupplemental memorandum, alleging, inter alia, infringement of\n\nDowdell's due process rights.3        Neither the original motion nor the\n\nsupplemental memorandum mentioned the IAD.\n\n                The government filed its response on July 11, 2006.         The\n\nresponse erroneously asserted that Dowdell had in fact waived his\n\n\n        3\n            The due process claim is not before us on appeal.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fIAD rights at his initial appearance, \"rendering it inapplicable\n\nfor purposes of the motion to dismiss.\" Regardless, the government\n\nclaimed, no IAD violation had occurred.\n\n          The court held a hearing on the motion on July 14, 2006.\n\nBonilla, who had not been involved in the case when Dowdell first\n\nappeared, did not mention the IAD or contest the alleged waiver.\n\nAs indicated in the following colloquy between Bonilla and the\n\ncourt, Dowdell's sole grounds for dismissal concerned the period\n\nprior to the federal indictment, rather than any post-indictment\n\ndevelopments:\n\n          THE COURT: Okay.    All right.    Now, turning\n          more directly to your motion, the supplemental\n          motion for -- to dismiss, do I understand, Ms.\n          Bonilla, that the defendant is not contesting\n          the time between the indictment, the federal\n          indictment, in March of 2005, and today's date\n          but that what you are concentrating on is the\n          time between the November or December notice,\n          December of 2004, and the indictment in March\n          of 2005, as exceeding 30 days in violation of\n          the statute? Is that --\n\n          MS. BONILLA: That's fair to say, your Honor.\n\n          THE COURT: That's fair to say. So we're not\n          concerned with anything that happened between\n          March and the -- March of 2005 and the filing\n          of the original motion to dismiss in July of\n          2005, and the snafu of the government in not\n          responding to that motion until November of\n          2005, is that correct?\n\n          MS. BONILLA: Yes, your Honor.       My   motion\n          focuses on what happens before.\n\nThe court ultimately denied the motion in its entirety, including\n\nDowdell's constitutional speedy trial argument, and prepared to\n\n\n                              -11-\n\fmove onward to the July 31 trial date.          Dowdell, however, once\n\nagain requested a continuance, this time because of the possibility\n\nthat a prior state conviction might be expunged from his record in\n\nthe interim (an occurrence that could affect plea negotiations).\n\nMichael   Bourbeau,   one   of   Bonilla's    partners   who   was   also\n\nrepresenting Dowdell at the hearing, explained that \"we've talked\n\nabout Mr. Dowdell's Speedy Trial rights.       But the ramifications of\n\nthis, I think, this prior [state conviction] -- the determination\n\nthat can be made on that prior is, I think, very significant as to\n\nwhether this case needs to go forward to trial.\"         The government\n\nagreed with this representation.         At that point, the court took\n\npains to ensure that Dowdell understood the ramifications of any\n\npostponement:\n\n          THE COURT: The Court's schedule is such that\n          it couldn't be for probably three months.\n\n          MR. BOURBEAU: We understand the Court's\n          concern.   We've had discussion with Mr.\n          Dowdell.\n\n          THE COURT: Yeah, I mean, this is the oldest\n          case, I think, on my docket, maybe not in the\n          docket number but with respect to the date of\n          the alleged crime. It needs to be resolved.\n          Your request, of course, is made on behalf of\n          the defendant now who needs to have his rights\n          --\n\n          MR. BOURBEAU: Yes.\n\n          THE COURT: -- pursued and resolved.\n\n          ...\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f           THE COURT: All right.    The Court will allow\n           the defendant's motion to continue the trial\n           until September 18th on the extraordinary\n           circumstance that we all find ourselves in\n           this case. It is something that is very much\n           of concern to the Court that this matter be\n           resolved sooner rather than later, but I\n           understand the import of what Mr. Bourbeau is\n           suggesting and that it may well inure to the\n           benefit of not only counsel but of the Court\n           in terms of judicial economy or economy of the\n           Court's expenditure of time. So I'm going to\n           allow that motion for continuance.\n\n\nThus, at Dowdell's own behest, the trial was pushed back an\n\nadditional month and a half.\n\n           The September 18th trial date met the same fate as the\n\npreceding July 31st date -- postponement.        For the second time\n\nsince his federal indictment, and for the fourth time overall,\n\nDowdell's attorney moved to withdraw representation.       In a motion\n\ndated August 8, 2006, Bonilla informed the court that Dowdell\n\nbelieved   there   to   have   been   an   irreparable   breakdown   in\n\ncommunications.    The court held an ex parte hearing on August 16,\n\n2006, after which it denied the motion.          But on September 8,\n\nDowdell sent the court a pro se, handwritten motion to reconsider\n\nits denial.   On September 18, 2006, the court held another ex parte\n\nhearing, after which it determined that the best course was indeed\n\nto allow Bonilla to withdraw.    The trial date was once again pushed\n\nback to December 11, 2006, and a new attorney, Mark Shea, was\n\nappointed on October 31, 2006.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f          As with his predecessors, Shea's tenure as Dowdell's\n\ncounsel would terminate prematurely, though this time not at\n\nDowdell's request.   On November 28, 2006, Shea informed the court\n\nthat he had a conflict of interest that compelled withdrawal.    The\n\ncourt allowed another change in representation. The trial date was\n\nrescheduled for February 27, 2007.\n\n          Dowdell's new attorney (now his fourth since the federal\n\nindictment and seventh overall) was granted a requested continuance\n\non December 18, 2006 in order to acquaint himself better with the\n\ncase.   Trial was set for April 9, 2007.       On March 15, 2007,\n\nDowdell's attorney once again requested a continuance, this time\n\nboth in order to ensure effective assistance and because of a\n\npersonal conflict.   The court granted this final continuance.   The\n\ntrial commenced on May 29, 2007 -- nearly six years from the date\n\nof the offense.\n\n                     C. Modifying the Indictment\n\n          We briefly depart from our chronological march through\n\nthe events and take several steps back to August 2006, when the\n\ntrial was still scheduled for the following month.   On August 30,\n\nthe government filed a motion to advise the court of a potential\n\nvariance between the text of the indictment and the proof to be\n\nadduced at trial.    The indictment did not refer to \"cocaine base\"\n\nor \"crack cocaine,\" as had the federal complaint and accompanying\n\naffidavit, the petition for habeas corpus ad prosequendum, the\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\ftestimony before the grand jury, the magistrate judge's colloquy\n\nwith Dowdell at his initial appearance, and various discovery\n\ndocuments that Dowdell had previously been provided.                      Instead, it\n\nsimply read \"cocaine,\" potentially suggesting the powder form of\n\nthe substance.         Arguing that modifying the text from \"cocaine\" to\n\n\"cocaine base\" would not constitute a material change requiring a\n\nsuperseding indictment, the government asked the court to declare\n\nthe   original        indictment    suitable   for   trial.         The    government\n\nprofessed an inability to explain why the indictment did not\n\nspecifically allege distribution of cocaine base, but sought to\n\nclarify the matter prior to trial and avoid unnecessary jury\n\nconfusion over the controlled substance allegedly distributed.\n\n                  Recognizing that a variance, by definition, can only be\n\ndetermined after the presentation of evidence, the court chose to\n\ntreat       the    government's    pre-trial   motion   as    one    to    amend   the\n\nindictment.4          It then analyzed whether the proposed correction\n\nwould rise to the level of a constitutional violation.                     The court\n\ngranted the government's motion, reasoning that Dowdell had been\n\nwell apprised all along of the fact that he was charged with\n\n        4\n      We have explained the difference between a variance and an\namendment as follows: \"A constructive amendment occurs when the\ncharging terms of the indictment are altered, either literally or\nin effect, by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last\npassed upon them. A variance occurs when the charging terms remain\nunchanged but when the facts proved at trial are different from\nthose alleged in the indictment.\" United States v.

Evidence Presented at Trial\n\n           At     trial,     Dowdell's          primary         argument      was\n\nmisidentification. He claimed that he was not the \"Smoke\" referred\n\nto in surveillance recordings and that the video footage was\n\ninconclusive as to whether a man with a blue checkered shirt was\n\nactually   involved.        In     order   to     corroborate        Monteiro's\n\nidentification of Dowdell as Smoke, the government introduced,\n\ninter alia, two items that Dowdell had unsuccessfully attempted to\n\nexclude through pre-trial motions in limine: the booking sheet from\n\nthe July 16 arrest and several of White's July 6 statements\n\ncaptured on videotape.\n\n1. The Booking Sheet\n\n           The   booking   sheet   contained     both     the    photograph    of\n\nDowdell in the blue checkered shirt on which Monteiro had based his\n\nidentification, as well as a textual description of Dowdell's\n\nclothing as including a \"blue plaid shirt.\"             Dowdell argued that\n\nthe document was inadmissible because a provision of Federal Rule\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fof Evidence 803(8), the so-called \"law-enforcement exception,\"\n\nforbids    the   introduction   of   police    reports   against   criminal\n\ndefendants.      The government countered that a booking sheet should\n\nnot run afoul of the exception because it contained merely \"rote,\n\nroutine administrative information.\"          The district court concluded\n\nthat the document was admissible pursuant to both\n\n            Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1) (because the document\n            formed    the    basis     of    a    witness's\n            identification)    and    Fed.R.Evid.    803(8)\n            (because   the   document    reflects   routine\n            procedures based upon information from the\n            defendant   himself   and   not   observations,\n            conclusions or opinions of police officers\n            which are normally contained in police\n            reports). In sum, the document possesses the\n            requisite indicia of trustworthiness to be\n            admissible under more than one of the Federal\n            Rules of Evidence.\n\n            At trial, the government proffered an edited version of\n\nthe booking sheet. All information relating to the charges against\n\nDowdell was redacted, while the sections describing clothing and\n\nappearance remained.      In addition, the government introduced the\n\nphotograph separately, unaccompanied by the booking sheet.           It was\n\non the basis of this photograph, rather than the booking sheet,\n\nthat Monteiro would testify he had made his identification of\n\nDowdell as Smoke.\n\n2. Video Evidence\n\n            Dowdell had also objected in limine to the introduction\n\nof White's videotaped statements from the two transactions on July\n\n6, 2001.   There were two tapes at issue, one from each transaction.\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fThe   first    showed   White    telling   Monteiro   who   \"Smoke\"   was   and\n\nconfirming that he was reliable.              The second showed Monteiro\n\napproaching Dowdell and asking him to summon White, which Dowdell\n\nthen did.\n\n              Dowdell challenged the admissibility of the statements\n\non two distinct grounds. First, he argued that the statements\n\nconstituted proof of prior bad acts that would be barred by Rule\n\n404(b).       The government responded that the statements were not\n\noffered as prior bad acts so much as intrinsic evidence of the\n\nspecific crime alleged.         It posited that the jury would not be able\n\nto understand fully the July 16th transaction without knowing what\n\nhad occurred on July 6th. Dowdell's second argument was that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to treat White as a co-conspirator under\n\nRule 802(d)(2)(E), and hence White's statements should be deemed\n\ninadmissible hearsay.      The government not only contested Dowdell's\n\ninsufficiency claim, but also argued that the statements would be\n\nindependently admissible as relating to the basis for Monteiro's\n\nidentification.     Under this alternative theory, White's statements\n\ncould at least be introduced for the impact that they had on\n\nMonteiro and his subsequent identification of Dowdell as \"Smoke,\"\n\nif not for the truth of the matter asserted.\n\n              The district court rejected both of Dowdell's objections\n\nduring the final pre-trial conference.           With respect to the Rule\n\n404(b) claim, it found that \"the transaction with Robert White is\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fdirectly and instrinsically relevant to the charge against Mr.\n\nDowdell in this case.\"        As for the hearsay claim, the district\n\ncourt adopted both of the government's theories of admissibility.\n\n           During the course of the pre-trial conference, Dowdell\n\nargued that even if a transcript of the statements would be\n\nadmissible, the videotape itself would be unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThe government insisted that it was entitled to use the video to\n\nprove its case, as only the video showed what sort of opportunity\n\nMonteiro had to actually see Dowdell from the car.              Again, the\n\ndistrict   court   rejected   Dowdell's   argument,   finding    that   the\n\nvideotape was the best evidence.      Though ordering two minor edits\n\nto the video and the corresponding transcript,5 the court ruled\n\nthat the videotaped statements were otherwise admissible in their\n\noriginal form.\n\n                              E. Sentencing\n\n           On May 31, 2007, after three days of trial, the jury\n\nreturned a guilty verdict.\n\n           Under ยง 841(b)(1)(c), Dowdell would normally have faced\n\na maximum sentence of 20 years.      Mention of this 20-year maximum\n\nhad arisen earlier in the pre-trial proceedings, when Dowdell had\n\nchallenged   the   government's   attempt   to   amend   the   indictment.\n\nDowdell had initially claimed that the change in drug type was\n\n\n    5\n      The two edits were (1) changing the Defendant's name in the\ntranscript from \"Dowdell\" to \"Smoke\" and (2) deleting a statement\nby White that Dowdell was his \"cousin.\"\n\n                                  -19-\n\fmaterial because it might increase the sentence length to which he\n\nwould be exposed.    The government had responded that because drug\n\ntype was not an element in this case, the maximum would remain at\n\n20 years regardless.        In making this point, the government had\n\nstated in writing that it was \"not seeking (and cannot seek) a\n\nsentence in excess of 20 years.\"             The district court cited this\n\nlanguage in allowing the amendment.\n\n            Nevertheless, in April 2007, the government filed an\n\ninformation to establish a prior conviction under 21 U.S.C. ยง 851,\n\nwhich increased the statutory maximum from 20 to 30 years (and the\n\nguideline   range   from    210โ262    months    to   262โ327   months).   At\n\nsentencing, the government recommended a 262-month sentence, at the\n\nbottom end of the guideline range but well over the original 20-\n\nyear statutory maximum.       The court ultimately sentenced Dowdell to\n\n198 months, followed by six years' supervised release. Dowdell did\n\nnot object to the sentence.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n                           A. Speedy Trial Rights\n\n            Dowdell first contends that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to dismiss on constitutional speedy trial\n\ngrounds. The district court noted, but never resolved, whether the\n\nappropriate starting point for the speedy trial clock was the\n\nfederal or the state indictment.               Because it determined that\n\n\"Dowdell ha[d] failed to demonstrate prejudice which rises to the\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\flevel of a constitutional violation,\" the court did not reach the\n\nissue of the precise length of the delay.

For\n\nDowdell, who did not face any pre-indictment detention on his\n\nfederal charge, the starting point would ordinarily be the date of\n\nhis federal indictment, March 23, 2005. Dowdell, however, does not\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fchallenge    any   length   of   time   that     elapsed    after   this   date.7\n\nInstead, he focuses on the time frame preceding it, arguing that\n\nhis speedy trial rights in fact accrued with his state indictment\n\non   March   25,   2002.    Were   that    the    case,    it    would   yield   a\n\npresumptively prejudicial delay of nearly three years before the\n\nfederal indictment was returned.\n\n             Addressing this argument requires us to consider the\n\nspeedy trial implications of the dual sovereignty doctrine.

We\n\nfurther elaborated the policy arguments that bolster the case for\n\na robust dual sovereignty doctrine in the speedy trial context:\n\n             Were we to hold that Marler's state court\n             indictment triggered his speedy trial right,\n             we would in effect be requiring the federal\n             government to keep continually abreast of all\n             state criminal investigations that may present\n             the possibility of federal prosecution and to\n             pursue their own investigations, arrests,\n             indictments, and trials so as to conform with\n             state-dictated timing.     This is obviously\n             counter to the dual sovereignty doctrine as\n             well   as  to   effective,   responsible   law\n             enforcement. . . . Thus, whatever the\n             weaknesses in our dual system of justice,\n             these could only be exacerbated by the\n             proposed expansion of the sixth amendment\n             speedy trial right.\n\nId.\n\n             Dowdell does not contest the truth of any of this as a\n\ngeneral matter, but he nevertheless insists that his case falls\n\nwithin a recognized exception.         He principally relies on United\n\nStates v. Cabral, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"309576\"><a href=\"/opinion/309576/united-states-v-george-f-cabral/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1973).             In Cabral, state\n\npolice officers investigating the defendant for sale of stolen\n\nproperty arrested him for possessing a sawed-off shotgun.                   The\n\nstate turned the weapon over to federal authorities three days\n\nafter the arrest.       Cabral was indicted in state court for the\n\nstolen property offense and then, fifteen months later, in federal\n\ncourt for the weapons offense.             In considering Cabral's speedy\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\ftrial claim, we held that his constitutional right \"crystallized at\n\nthe time of his initial [state] arrest\" because it was for the same\n\noffense as his ultimate federal indictment, and \"[t]he [federal]\n\ngovernment's prosecution of this charge was initiated only three\n\ndays later when . . . state authorities turned over this weapon to\n\na federal officer.\"    Id. at 718.    Thus, Dowdell argues, Cabral\n\ninstructs us to attribute a state-court indictment to the federal\n\ngovernment where a subsequent federal indictment was essentially a\n\ncontinuation of the state proceedings.   Because his state charges\n\narose out of a federal investigation, were for the same offense as\n\nhis federal charges, and were allegedly dismissed following a\n\ncoordinated effort with the federal government, Dowdell would have\n\nus apply this Cabral exception in our speedy trial analysis here.\n\n          Cabral, however, predates the Supreme Court's development\n\nof the dual sovereignty doctrine in MacDonald.     For this reason,\n\nthe Marler court questioned, although it did not decide, whether\n\nCabral remained good law.   756 F.2d at 212.   Other courts have not\n\nbeen so hesitant.

Neither party has confirmed or denied whether a\ndetainer was ever actually filed against Dowdell in this case, and\nwe can find no indication in the record one way or the other.\nBecause the issue has not been contested, and because we ultimately\nfind no reversible error, we proceed on the assumption that a\ndetainer was filed. We stress, however, that parties litigating\nIAD claims ought not to take the existence of a detainer for\ngranted. See Mauro, 436 U.S. at 364 n.29 (noting that \"during a\ntypical year federal courts issue approximately 5,000 ad\nprosequendum writs and that about 3,000 of those are in cases in\nwhich a detainer has previously been lodged against the prisoner\").\n     11\n      Both parties leave unresolved whether Dowdell initiated the\ntransfer through his pro se letter, triggering the 120-day clock,\nor whether the government did through its habeas petition,\n\n                                    -30-\n\fdid Dowdell so much as mention the speedy trial provisions of the\n\nIAD, despite ample opportunities.

Addressing a similar scenario arising on habeas review,\n\nthe Supreme Court endorsed the lower court's observation that \"[i]t\n\nwould not have been difficult for the judge to advance the date of\n\nthe trial or make a finding on the record of good cause, either of\n\nwhich would have satisfied Art.

Yet an abstract\n\nreference to the compact does not suffice to preserve all potential\n\nchallenges that might arise under it.     One can forfeit a claim\n\nunder one section of the IAD while preserving a different claim\n\nunder another.   See, e.g., Neal, 36 F.3d at 1209-10; Oldaker, 823\n\nF.2d at 781; Eaddy, 595 F.2d at 346.    At his initial appearance,\n\nDowdell referred only to his right to remain in federal custody,\n\nnot the applicability of the statute's speedy trial deadline. This\n\nwould be the last time that Dowdell referred to the IAD before the\n\ndistrict court.12   If he intended to rely on the statutory speedy\n\ntrial provisions, he could have brought them to the trial judge's\n\nattention.   He did not do so.\n\n          Undaunted, Dowdell argues that he did not need to spell\n\nout the letters of the IAD for the district court because his\n\nmotion to dismiss for violation of the Sixth Amendment and the\n\nSpeedy Trial Act effectively accomplished the same thing.       He\n\n     12\n      Dowdell places much of the blame for this silence on the\ngovernment, which erroneously informed the court that Dowdell had\nwaived his IAD rights at his initial appearance. While we do not\ncondone the government's mistake, we note that it did not occur\nuntil July 11, 2006, well after Dowdell filed his motions to\ndismiss -- and well after the date when Dowdell now claims the IAD\nclock should have expired. The error, lamentable as it may be,\ncannot excuse Dowdell's forfeiture retroactively.\n\n                                 -32-\n\frelies    on    Mauro,   in   which    the   Supreme    Court    ruled    that   the\n\ndefendant's failure to invoke the IAD \"in specific terms\" in his\n\nspeedy trial motions did not result in the waiver of an Article\n\nIV(c) claim.        436 U.S. at 364.            In Mauro, the defendant had\n\n\"persistently      requested\"    a     speedy   trial   and     had    \"sought   the\n\ndismissal of his indictment on the ground that the delay in\n\nbringing him to trial while the detainer remained lodged against\n\nhim was causing him to be denied certain privileges at the state\n\nprison.\"       Id. at 364-65.         On those bases, the Court found his\n\nactions \"sufficient to put the Government and the District Court on\n\nnotice of the substance of his claim.\"            Id.; accord Eaddy, 595 F.2d\n\nat 346 (finding a speedy trial motion sufficient to give notice of\n\nan IAD challenge even though it \"was not framed in the precise\n\nlanguage of the Agreement\").\n\n               This case is distinguishable from Mauro in two critical\n\nrespects. First and foremost, Dowdell did not have a colorable IAD\n\nclaim at the time he filed the speedy trial motion.                   Even assuming\n\nthe most defendant-favorable set of circumstances, the earliest\n\ntrial deadline under the IAD would have been July 20, 2005.13                    Yet\n\n     13\n      The parties dispute several matters that would affect our\ncalculation of the actual deadline: (1) whether Dowdell initiated\nthe transfer through his pro se letter, triggering the 120-day\nclock, or whether the government did through its habeas petition,\ntriggering the 180-day clock; (2) whether 78 days of excludable\ntime under the Speedy Trial Act were automatically excludable under\nthe IAD; and (3) whether any portion of the government's four-month\nlapse in responding to Dowdell's original motion to dismiss should\nbe excludable. Giving Dowdell the benefit of the doubt on each,\nthe clock would have run uninterrupted beginning with his initial\n\n                                        -33-\n\fDowdell filed his motion to dismiss nearly two weeks earlier, on\n\nJuly 8.    Thus, Dowdell is in substance arguing that the district\n\ncourt ought to have dismissed the indictment based on a ground that\n\nnot only was absent from the motion to dismiss, but that did not\n\neven exist at the time the motion was filed.             The fallacy in this\n\nposition should be clear enough.            To have the issue preserved,\n\nDowdell would not need us to infer it from his motion to dismiss so\n\nmuch as to generate it ex nihilo at some later point.                  This we\n\ncannot do.\n\n           Second,      neither   Dowdell's     motion   nor   any   subsequent\n\ncommunication said anything about the negative effects that the\n\noutstanding detainer might be having on his rehabilitation.                   We\n\nthink   that   element    critical   to   the    Court's   holding    in    Mauro\n\nbecause, as the Court stressed, it was the attempt to ameliorate\n\nprecisely those effects that prompted the IAD's passage.               See 436\n\nU.S. at 359โ60.        We do not read Mauro to mean that every speedy\n\ntrial claim filed by a detainee necessarily contains an embedded\n\nIAD claim.     The Court was not propounding free association as an\n\ninterpretive canon.       It was, rather, placing weight on the precise\n\nidentity     between    the   defendant's     alleged    prejudice    and    the\n\nprejudice that the IAD targets. Because Dowdell's motion never\n\nrepresented that the requested relief would redound to the success\n\nof his rehabilitation, we do not consider it \"sufficient to put the\n\n\nappearance on March 22, 2005, yielding a latest acceptable trial\ndate of July 20, 2005.\n\n                                     -34-\n\fGovernment and the District Court on notice of the substance of his\n\n[IAD] claim\" under Mauro.\n\n           We therefore conclude that Dowdell at least forfeited any\n\nIAD claim by failing to raise it in the district court.            He may\n\nvery well have waived it altogether by requesting continuance after\n\ncontinuance that pushed the trial date to May 2007.       See New York\n\nv.

Under that\n\nstandard, we would reverse only if Dowdell could prove โ(1) that an\n\nerror occurred; (2) that the error was clear or obvious; (3) that\n\nthe error affected his substantial rights; and (4) that the error\n\nalso   seriously   impaired   the    fairness,   integrity,   or   public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.โ        United States v.

Although Dowdell does not address any period of\n\ntime after the court decided his motion in July 2006, we note that\n\nthe ensuing ten months of delay were entirely due to his requests\n\nfor continuances and change of counsel.

As we have explained\n\nabove,   the   district      court    treated     the    proposed   change   as   a\n\nministerial correction to a clerical error.

Before we undertake that review, however, a bit of\n\nterminological housecleaning is in order.\n\n           The district court appears to have viewed its task as\n\nexplaining     why   the    proposed     change    was    not   a   \"constructive\n\namendment.\" This approach treats the word 'constructive' as a term\n\nof art for 'impermissible.'            That synonymic treatment may not be\n\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fquite right, however.

Yet the Gaither\n\ncase quoted in Dunn was not defining \"constructive amendment\" in\n\nparticular, but rather all amendments.

In any case, ever since Dunn, we have adhered to our\n\ndefinition of constructive amendments, most likely because they are\n\nthe amendments that we most often come across.               See 1 Wright, et\n\nal. ยง 128 (noting that \"direct attempts to amend an indictment in\n\nany substantive way are rare\" and that \"[i]nstead, the most common\n\nchallenge in this area is a claim of 'constructive amendment'\").\n\nOn the rare occasion that we do confront a direct amendment to an\n\nindictment, such as here, referring to it as constructive may\n\nobfuscate the issue.

And had we gone so far as to find a variance, it\n\nwould have been a harmless one, given all the notice that Dowdell\n\nhad previously received that he was charged with distributing\n\ncocaine base rather than cocaine powder.             Cf. United States v.\n\nTwitty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196496\"><a href=\"/opinion/196496/united-states-v-twitty/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"So long as the statutory\n\nviolation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the facts\n\nfound are somewhat different than those charged -- so long as the\n\ndifference does not cause unfair prejudice.\"). It would be strange\n\nindeed to punish the government for clarifying the indictment\n\nbefore trial when it would have been permitted to proceed without\n\ntaking any action.\n\n            Dowdell   argues   that    the   alteration   was   nevertheless\n\nprohibited based on two premises that are not in fact implicated\n\nhere. First, he claims that the change to cocaine base effectively\n\nexposed him to a harsher sentencing range.           Yet even if sentencing\n\namplification were relevant, none occurred here.           It is true that\n\nunder ยง 841(a), cocaine base normally exposes defendants to steeper\n\nsentencing ranges than does cocaine powder.           But here, Dowdell was\n\nsentenced as a career offender under Section 4B1.1 of the U.S.\n\nSentencing Guidelines.     That provision would have applied in equal\n\nforce whether he were convicted of distributing cocaine powder or\n\ncocaine base; the guideline range was a product of the 30-year\n\nstatutory   maximum   in   ยง   841(b)(1)(c)    and   Dowdell's    particular\n\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fcriminal history category.            Thus, because we conclude that the\n\nchange did not in fact alter the sentencing range, we need not\n\nresolve     whether    sentencing    ramifications     are    relevant   to    the\n\namendment analysis.15\n\n               Second, Dowdell asserts that the difference in chemical\n\ncomposition between cocaine powder and cocaine base means that the\n\ngovernment would have had to proffer different evidence for each of\n\nthe    substances.       Again,     even   assuming   the    relevance   of    the\n\nconclusion, its predicate is incorrect.               As far as culpability\n\nunder ยง 841(a) is concerned, cocaine base is merely an isomer of\n\ncocaine.       See Wiley, 29 F.3d at 352; United States v. Pierce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534814\"><a href=\"/opinion/534814/united-states-v-roy-lee-pierce-james-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>    <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    676   (5th   Cir.   1990).16    The   government   could      have\n\n       15\n        The district court expressly found no constitutional\nviolation because \"mitigation of sentencing ramifications within\nthe statutory maximum is not among the substantial rights protected\nby the right to be indicted by a grand jury.\" Dowdell, 464 F.\nSupp. 2d at 68. The \"substantial rights\" standard, however, is\nonly appropriate in the context of variances. It is true that if\nthe government had proceeded to trial with the original indictment,\nthen variance doctrine would have been the appropriate analytical\nframework. But since we deal here with a direct amendment, rather\nthan a variance, reference to the scope of the defendant's\nsubstantial rights is misplaced. In any case, we leave resolution\nof this issue for a day when the question is put more squarely\nbefore us.\n       16\n      We do not go so far as to hold in this case that a trial\njudge is necessarily permitted simply to swap any controlled\nsubstance under ยง 841(a) for any other controlled substance.\n\"Cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" are inherently related in ways that\nother potential pairings are not.

Admission of police booking sheet\n\n          Dowdell claims that the booking sheet from his July 16,\n\n2001 arrest was inadmissible hearsay.             Normally, an otherwise\n\nhearsay public record is admissible so long as it sets forth\n\n\"matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which\n\nmatters there was a duty to report.\"             Fed. R. Evid. 803(8)(B).\n\nHowever, under what is sometimes called the \"law enforcement\n\nexception,\" Rule 803(8)(B) retains the hearsay prohibition in\n\ncriminal cases for any \"matters observed by police officers and\n\nother law enforcement personnel.\"          Id.   We have interpreted this\n\nrule to mean that, as a general matter, \"police reports are\n\ninadmissible in a criminal case when offered by the prosecution.\"\n\n\n\n                                    -44-\n\fUnited States v.

The Rule on its face seems equally applicable to the\n\nobservations contained in a booking sheet.            Nevertheless, the\n\ndistrict court held that the law enforcement exception was not\n\nmeant to encompass routine, non-adversarial documents, and on that\n\nbasis found the booking sheet admissible.        Although our review of\n\nrulings admitting or excluding evidence is typically for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, our review of the district court's interpretation of a\n\nrule of evidence is de novo.

Instead, we join the\n\nother circuits in concluding that ministerial, non-adversarial\n\ninformation is admissible under Rule 803(8)(B), notwithstanding its\n\ndocumentation at the hands of law enforcement personnel.\n\n           With this interpretation of Rule 803(8)(B) in place, we\n\nnow must consider whether a booking sheet would violate it.             In an\n\nunpublished decision, a panel of the Fifth Circuit answered this\n\nprecise question in the negative, summarily finding that \"booking\n\ninformation [i]s taken in a routine, nonadversarial setting.\"\n\nUnited States v. Haughton, 235 Fed. App'x 254, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2186250</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n\n*1 (5th Cir. Jul. 30 2007).       We agree.       The rote recitation of\n\nbiographical information in a booking sheet ordinarily does not\n\nimplicate the same potential perception biases that a subjective\n\nnarrative of an investigation or an alleged offense might.                   A\n\nbooking sheet does not recount the work that led to an arrest so\n\nmuch as the mere fact that an arrest occurred.          As a result, unlike\n\nthe   investigative   reports   that   lie   at   the   heart    of   the   law\n\nenforcement exception, booking sheets raise little concern that\n\nsuspicion of guilt will function as proof of guilt.             We think that\n\na police booking sheet is in this respect analogous to the INS\n\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fwarrant that was the subject of the Fifth Circuit's analysis in\n\nQuezada.    The    Quezada   court   upheld      the    admissibility   of   the\n\nwarrant,   which    recounted   the        defendant's     prior   arrest    and\n\ndeportation,\"[d]ue to the lack of any motivation on the part of the\n\nrecording official to do other than mechanically register an\n\nunambiguous factual matter.\" 754 F.2d at 1194. The same reasoning\n\napplies here.\n\n           Dowdell asserts that, even if this much may be true in\n\nthe abstract, the particular booking sheet admitted in his trial\n\nmay have been prepared with an eye toward proving his identity and\n\nas such was excludable as \"indicat[ing] lack of trustworthiness.\"\n\nFed. R. Evid. 803(8)(c).      He offers no factual support for such a\n\nfinding,   instead      indulging     in     a   bare     worst-case-scenario\n\nspeculation that the booking officer might have colluded with\n\nMonteiro before completing the form.             We need not tarry on this.\n\nAn entirely conjectural and uncorroborated conspiracy theory does\n\nnot   transform    an    otherwise     trustworthy        document   into     an\n\nuntrustworthy one.18     There was no abuse of discretion.\n\n      18\n      We note that other circuits have placed the burden of proving\nuntrustworthiness under Rule 803(8) squarely on the shoulders of\nthe party opposing admission.

In order to determine whether the\n\nfactual predicates for this exception exist, the trial court must\n\nmake    a    so-called   Petrozziello    ruling.

A Petrozziello\n\nruling has two stages.         First, following a timely objection, the\n\ncourt makes a provisional finding as to whether the evidence is\n\nadmissible.

Even adopting the\n\nless deferential standard, we would still affirm the district\n\ncourt's ruling.\n\n              It     is   well    established      that    \"the   preponderance    of\n\nevidence required for the introduction of an out-of-court statement\n\nunder Rule 801(d)(2)(E) must necessarily comprise more than the\n\nweight of the statement itself.\"                  United States v.

When Monteiro first saw\n\nWhite on July 6, White was counting cash with Dowdell.                     Moments\n\nlater, when White agreed to make the initial sale to Monteiro, his\n\nfirst action was to walk over to Dowdell and consult with him.\n\nThen, on July 16, Dowdell sold drugs to Monteiro when White was\n\nunavailable.       These      facts,   coupled      with    White's   statements\n\nthemselves, adequately supported a finding of a conspiracy by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, the district court did\n\nnot clearly err in its Petrozziello ruling.\n\n             Dowdell further maintains that even if the statements\n\nthemselves were admissible, introducing them on video nevertheless\n\nviolated     Federal   Rule    of   Evidence     403,      which   provides   that\n\notherwise admissible evidence \"may be excluded if its probative\n\nvalue   is    substantially     outweighed     by    the     danger   of   unfair\n\nprejudice.\"     Specifically, he argues that a printed transcript\n\nwould have been less prejudicial because it would not have allowed\n\nthe jury to see White, who, according to Dowdell, \"looks like an\n\nobvious drug addict and just makes a very bad impression.\"                 But the\n\nmere fact that Dowdell might have fared better without the video is\n\nnot in itself cause for exclusion.             \"By design, all evidence is\n\nmeant to be prejudicial; it is only unfair prejudice which must be\n\navoided.\"     United States v.

Whatever minimal unfair prejudice might have\n\nresulted from seeing White's physical appearance, it did not\n\novercome this probative value.           In any event, it was Dowdell, not\n\nthe government, who chose to associate himself with White.                        We\n\ndiscern no abuse of discretion.\n\n                                  E.

He asks us to vacate his 198-month sentence because the\n\ngovernment allegedly reneged on a promise not to seek a sentence\n\ngreater than 20 years.       A sentence of 198 months is, of course,\n\nitself less than 20 years.         Dowdell's theory is that the sentence\n\nwas nevertheless voidable because the government's filing of an\n\ninformation   of   prior    conviction,        which    increased      the   minimum\n\nguideline sentence from 210 to 262 months, raised the baseline from\n\n\n\n                                        -55-\n\fwhich the trial court would have varied downward.

Cf. Gonczy, 357 F.3d\n\nat 53 (explaining that the \"meticulous standards of both promise\n\nand performance\" that govern prosecutors in plea agreements stem\n\nfrom the defendant's waiver of fundamental constitutional rights\n\nthat would otherwise be present in a jury trial).\n\n          Instead, we understand Dowdell to be advancing a theory\n\nof estoppel.     The lack of any briefing on this issue renders the\n\nissue waived.     See United States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).     Even if not waived, the argument is not supported by\n\nthe   record.      The   government   did   not,   as   Dowdell   argues,\n\n\n\n                                  -56-\n\faffirmatively commit itself to the original 20-year statutory\n\nmaximum. Rather, it offered a descriptive (and accurate) statement\n\nof sentencing law.      The government explained to the court that the\n\nproposed change to the indictment would not violate Apprendi in\n\nthat the statutory maximum would remain the same irrespective of\n\nthe controlled substance alleged in the indictment.         See Apprendi\n\nv. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000).       At the time, that statutory\n\nmaximum was 20 years.        Upon the filing of the information, it\n\nbecame 30 years. Although the number changed, the substance of the\n\ngovernment's remark -- that drug identity would have no impact on\n\nthe statutory maximum -- remained just as applicable.           Thus we\n\ndisagree with Dowdell's assertion that the government bound itself\n\nto   any   particular    sentencing   recommendation   to   begin   with.\n\nMoreover, even had such a promise existed, there is no evidence in\n\nthe record to suggest that the court gave any weight whatsoever to\n\nthe government recommendation at sentencing. Dowdell thus fails to\n\nshow a reasonable probability that he would have received a more\n\nlenient sentence but for the alleged error.     See Matos, 531 F.3d at\n\n122โ23.     For all of these reasons, we find no flaw in Dowdell's\n\nsentence.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n            The appellant's conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -57-\n\f</pre>",
