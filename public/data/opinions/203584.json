Plaintiff-Appellant Richard\n\nDennis appeals the district court's decision to grant Defendant-\n\nAppellee Osram Sylvania, Inc.'s (\"Sylvania\") motion for summary\n\njudgment on a claim involving New Hampshire's anti-discrimination\n\nstatute, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 354-A.           Dennis also appeals the\n\ndistrict court's decision to deny \"as moot\" two discovery motions:\n\n(1) a motion to compel discovery of privileged documents and (2) a\n\nmotion for an extension of time pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\nFor the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                              I.   Background\n\n            Dennis was employed with Sylvania from August 1995 to\n\nMarch 24, 2004, at which date he was terminated.          At the time of\n\nhis firing, Dennis was the Associate Development Program Manager in\n\nSylvania's   human   resources     department.     His   responsibilities\n\nincluded representing the company at recruitment fairs on campuses\n\nand overseeing Sylvania's internship program.\n\n            Dennis   claims   that   Sylvania    retaliated   against   him\n\nbecause he gave deposition testimony critical of the company in an\n\ninternal matter brought by Nancy Green, a former employee of\n\nSylvania.    Green had alleged that Sylvania retaliated against her\n\nbecause she had filed a sexual harassment complaint against a co-\n\nworker.   As the lead investigator of Green's complaint, Dennis was\n\ndeposed on February 5, 2004.       Dennis cites to several instances in\n\nhis deposition where he was critical of Sylvania's response to\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fGreen's claims, such as the company's \"soft punishment\" of the\n\nalleged harassers and the slow pace with which it conducted the\n\ninvestigation of her claims.1\n\n          In   addition,   Dennis    points    to   certain   actions   and\n\nstatements     by   Sylvania's       lawyers        demonstrating   their\n\ndissatisfaction with his testimony.        For example, Dennis claims\n\nthat Paul Beckwith, Sylvania's legal counsel, was \"hostile\" to him\n\nduring the deposition.     Dennis also alleges that Beckwith raised\n\nhis voice in response to Dennis' inquiries about the strength of\n\nthe Green case, exclaiming that he \"doesn't have time for this\n\nshit.\"   Dennis further claims that during a break, when he sought\n\nguidance from Beckwith regarding whether he had to reveal his\n\nknowledge of a company manager's romantic involvement with a\n\nsubordinate, Beckwith, \"in a forceful manner, ordered him to answer\n\n'yes,''no,' or 'I don't recall.'\"2        Dennis states that Beckwith\n\n\n1\n  Dennis further noted in his deposition that Sylvania's employees\nperceived that the alleged harassers \"could do what they wanted\nbecause they were friends with [the manager]\"; that there was a\njustified perception that it would be futile to file complaints\nagainst the manager's friends; that it was inappropriate for\nSylvania to have a public team meeting on the Green matter; that\nGreen was \"justified in being upset\" by Sylvania's handling of her\ncomplaint; and that Sylvania's issuance of a warning letter to\nGreen in response to her reaction at the team meeting was \"the\nstupidest thing [Dennis] heard.\"\n2\n    Dennis also notes a dispute regarding whether he met with\nBeckwith for a deposition preparation session at Sylvania on\nJanuary 22, 2004.    Dennis states that he does not recall any\nmeeting with Beckwith prior to his February 5, 2004 deposition and\ncontends that he was out of the country on January 22, 2004. This\ndispute is not material to the outcome of this case.\n\n                                    -3-\n\ftold him that the second part of his testimony was not as helpful\n\nas the first part. In addition, Dennis alleges that Sylvania's in-\n\nhouse counsel, Nicole Vient (formerly Nicole \"Buba\"), \"rolled her\n\neyes\"    during    his   deposition,    indicating      her   unhappiness    with\n\nDennis' testimony.\n\n            Sylvania disagrees that Dennis gave testimony critical of\n\nthe     company,   arguing    instead    that     the      testimony   \"strongly\n\nsupported\" Sylvania's defense of Green's claims.3                  Furthermore,\n\nVient does not recall if she rolled her eyes during Dennis'\n\ndeposition and insists that she \"did not in any way criticize his\n\nperformance at the deposition.\"              Beckwith, for his part, denies\n\ninstructing Dennis during a break to answer questions in any\n\nparticular way.\n\n            On February 6, 2004, the day after Dennis' deposition\n\ntestimony, Vient began investigating Dennis in reference to a\n\ncomplaint, received by the company on January 28, 2004, from Miguel\n\nMolina.     Molina, an unsuccessful applicant for re-employment,\n\nclaimed    that    Dennis   had    subjected    him   to    \"inappropriate    and\n\nunprofessional\" conduct.          The investigation revealed that Dennis,\n\nwhen meeting with Molina, had made reference to Molina's problems\n\n\n3\n  In the proceeding below, the district court stated that \"[w]hile\nDennis did make several comments critical of Sylvania at his\ndeposition, his testimony does not appear to have been particularly\nharmful to Sylvania's legal position, and actually strongly\nsupported the company's position on a key issue of retaliation.\"\nDennis v. Osram Sylvania, Inc., No. 06-CV-029-SM, 2007 WL 2783369,\nat *8 n.6 (D.N.H. Sept. 24, 2007).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fwith his taxes and his rent.           Also, it revealed that Dennis had\n\nshared these details as well as details regarding Molina's marital\n\nlife with Molina's potential supervisor at the company.\n\n          Pamela Tracey, Sylvania's in-house counsel who oversaw\n\nVient's investigation, subsequently met with Dennis' supervisors,\n\nGeoffrey Hunt and William Franz, to discuss these incidents.4              They\n\ndecided that a warning should be placed in Dennis' file.               Franz\n\ndocumented Dennis' conduct towards Molina in a February 23, 2004\n\ninternal communication to Dennis.               He concluded that Dennis'\n\nactions were \"entirely inappropriate\" and requested Dennis to sign\n\na statement to that effect.          Dennis refused to sign the statement\n\nand told Franz that he viewed the Molina investigation and warning\n\nletter as retaliation for his deposition testimony in the Green\n\nmatter.      Dennis   also   accuses    Franz    of   \"look[ing]   away\"   and\n\nresponding that \"he knew nothing about [the deposition].\"              Franz\n\nconfirmed that he told Dennis that he did not know anything about\n\nthe deposition, but does not recall \"looking away.\"\n\n          On March 24, 2004, Sylvania terminated Dennis.              In his\n\ndeposition    testimony,     Franz    stated   that   Dennis'   position   was\n\n\"severely weakened\" by the Molina matter as well as by a 2001\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Tracey is Sylvania's Senior Labor and Employment Counsel; Hunt\nis Sylvania's Senior Vice President of Communications and Human\nResources; and Franz is Sylvania's Human Resources Director.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcomplaint by another former employee, Kim Serrechia.5                 Franz also\n\nstates   that   he       recommended    terminating      Dennis    because      his\n\nperformance was affected by \"extreme duress\" due to family issues\n\nand   because   of   a    reduction    in   force   in   Sylvania's      equipment\n\ndevelopment department, the latter forcing Franz to choose between\n\nDennis and Leah Weinberg, whom Franz referred to as a \"high\n\nachieving human resources manager.\"            Franz subsequently informed\n\nHunt, his supervisor, of his decision and Hunt approved.\n\n           After     initially    filing     his    complaint     with    the   New\n\nHampshire Commission for Human Rights (\"Commission\"), Dennis filed\n\nan action in Rockingham County Superior Court in New Hampshire\n\nalleging retaliation under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 354-A.6                 The case\n\nwas then removed to the United States District Court for the\n\n\n5\n   On April 11, 2001, Dennis signed a written warning statement\nthat concluded that Dennis had engaged in the inappropriate use of\ncompany e-mail by sending religious and inspirational messages to\nSerrechia.   Also, the warning stated that Dennis failed to use\n\"appropriate managerial judgment expected from a Human Resources\nprofessional in an employee relations matter,\" citing Dennis'\n\"numerous conversations of an intensely personal nature\" with\nSerrechia. Dennis maintains that Franz told him that \"he did not\nbelieve Serrechia's allegations\" and all references to the\nSerrechia matter would be removed from Dennis' file. He further\npoints out that although his post-termination file made no\nreference to the Serrechia matter and that his performance\nevaluations during this period praised him for his \"fine work\" and\ndid not mention the Serrechia allegations, the matter \"reappeared\"\nafter Dennis filed a complaint with the New Hampshire Commission\nfor Human Rights.\n6\n   Dennis successfully removed his case to the Superior Court\nbecause he had exhausted his administrative remedies and because it\nhad been over 180 days since he had filed his complaint with the\nCommission. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 354-A:21-a.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fDistrict of New Hampshire.           In the proceeding below, the district\n\ncourt granted Sylvania's motion for summary judgment stating that\n\nDennis had failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation\n\nbecause Franz and Hunt, the individuals responsible for terminating\n\nDennis, \"knew nothing about plaintiff's Green deposition.\"              Dennis\n\nv. Osram Sylvania, Inc., No. 06-CV-029-SM, 2007 WL 2783369, at *8\n\n(D.N.H.   Sept.       24,   2007).     The    district    court   alternatively\n\nconcluded that even if Dennis had established a prima facie case,\n\nSylvania had fired Dennis for legitimate non-discriminatory reasons\n\nsuch as his poor work performance and the fact that Franz wanted to\n\nretain another employee instead of Dennis because of the company's\n\nreduction in force.         Id. at *7.       Furthermore, the district court\n\nexplained that summary judgment was appropriate because the factual\n\ndisputes arising during Dennis' deposition testimony in the Green\n\nmatter with Beckwith and Vient were not material to the resolution\n\nof Dennis' case.        Id. at *8-9.\n\n                II.    Dennis' Motion for Summary Judgment\n\n           A.     Standard of Review\n\n           \"Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the pleadings, depositions,\n\nanswers   to     interrogatories,        admissions      on   file,   and   any\n\naffidavits.\"      Thompson v.

U.S. Dep't. of Justice, 355\n\nF.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n\n477 U.S. 242, 248-50 (1986)).   \"We review summary judgment rulings\n\nde novo, construing the record evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the nonmoving party.\"    Benoit v. Technical Mfg. Corp., 331 F.3d\n\n166, 173 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          \"Even in retaliation cases, 'where elusive concepts such\n\nas motive or intent are at issue, summary judgment is appropriate\n\nif the non-moving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations,\n\nimprobable inferences, and unsupported speculation.'\" Vives v.\n\nFajardo, 472 F.3d 19, 21 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Benoit, 331 F.3d\n\nat 173); see also Thompson, 522 F.3d at 175 (\"When considering\n\narguments for summary judgment, 'we must disregard improbable or\n\noverly attenuated inferences, unsupported conclusions, and rank\n\nspeculation.'\" (quoting Abbott v. Bragdon, 107 F.3d 934, 938 (1st\n\nCir. 1997))).\n\n          We will reverse \"only if, after reviewing the facts and\n\nmaking all inferences in favor of the non-moving party . . . the\n\nevidence on record is sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational\n\nfactfinder to resolve the issue in favor of either side.\"   Maymรญ v.\n\nP.R. Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal\n\nquotations omitted).\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f             As a preliminary matter, we note Dennis' citation to the\n\nthe    Supreme     Court's      ruling    in     Reeves    v.     Sanderson      Plumbing\n\nProducts, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 151 (2000), for the proposition that\n\nthis   court     at    summary    judgment       must     \"disregard     all     evidence\n\nfavorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to\n\nbelieve.\"        According to Dennis, our consideration of Sylvania\n\nofficials' declarations are impermissible under Reeves because the\n\nofficials are interested parties.                  See id. (\"[T]he court should\n\ngive credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as\n\nthat evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted\n\nand unimpeached, at least to the extent that that evidence comes\n\nfrom disinterested witnesses.\")(internal quotations omitted).\n\n             Dennis misreads the scope of Reeves. At summary judgment\n\nwe    need   not      exclude    all     interested       testimony,         specifically\n\ntestimony that is uncontradicted by the nonmovant.                       See Lauren W.\n\nex rel. Jean W. v. DeFlaminis, 480 F.3d 259, 271-72 (3d Cir. 2007)\n\n(\"We cannot believe that the law precludes a party from presenting\n\nhis own testimony on a summary judgment motion . . . . The fact is\n\nthat in considering a motion for summary judgment the court should\n\nbelieve      uncontradicted           testimony     unless        it    is     inherently\n\nimplausible      even    if     the    testimony    is     that    of   an    interested\n\nwitness.\").        Indeed, the exclusion of interested testimony would\n\nmake it difficult for an employer to present a legitimate non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason when defending against a retaliation claim.\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fAs the Sixth Circuit has noted, a rule barring all testimony from\n\ninterested witnesses would \"lead[] to absurd consequences because\n\ndefendants will often be able to respond only through the testimony\n\nof their employees.\" Stratienko v. Cordis Corp., 429 F.3d 592, 598\n\n(6th Cir. 2005) (internal quotations omitted).            Here, Dennis'\n\nargument is unpersuasive given his failure to present evidence to\n\ncontradict the declarations of Sylvania officials in which they\n\npresent a non-retaliatory motive.\n\n            B.   Applicable Law\n\n            N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 354-A:19 states that \"[i]t shall\n\nbe an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person engaged in\n\nany activity to which this chapter applies to discharge, expel, or\n\notherwise retaliate or discriminate against any person because he\n\nhas . . . testified or assisted in any proceeding under this\n\nchapter.\"\n\n            The New Hampshire Supreme Court looks to and finds\n\n\"instructive\" federal standards established under Title VII, 42\n\nU.S.C. ยง 2000e et seq., in resolving retaliation claims under N.H.\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. ยง 354-A.     Madeja v. MPB Corp., 149 N.H. 371, 378-\n\n79, 821 A.2d 1034, 1043 (2003).       Thus, to establish a prima facie\n\ncase of retaliation under either Title VII or N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\nยง 354-A, the plaintiff must show that \"(1) she engaged in a\n\nstatutorily-protected     activity;    (2)   she   suffered   an   adverse\n\nemployment action; and (3) the protected activity and the adverse\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\femployment action were causally connected.\"           Id. at 378 (citing\n\nMarrero v. Goya of P.R., Inc., 304 F.3d 7, 22 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n          Under   New   Hampshire      law,   \"[i]f     there   is   only\n\ncircumstantial evidence of retaliation,\" as Dennis alleges here, a\n\n\"'pretext' approach applies.\"    In re Montplaisir, 147 N.H. 297,\n\n300, 787 A.2d 178, 181 (2001) (citing Texas Dep't of Cmty. Affairs\n\nv. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53 (1983)).     This \"pretext\" approach\n\nprovides that \"an employee who carries her burden of coming forward\n\nwith evidence establishing a prima facie case of retaliation\n\ncreates a presumption of discrimination, shifting the burden to the\n\nemployer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for\n\nthe challenged actions.\" Billings v. Town of Grafton, 515 F.3d 39,\n\n55 (1st Cir. 2008). \"'If the employer's evidence creates a genuine\n\nissue of fact, the presumption of discrimination drops from the\n\ncase, and the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of showing that\n\nthe employer's stated reason for [the challenged actions] was in\n\nfact a pretext for retaliating . . . .'\" Id. (quoting Colburn v.\n\nParker Hannifin/Nichols Portland Div., 429 F.3d 325, 336 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (alteration in original)).       Pretext can be demonstrated by\n\n\"such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies,\n\nor contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons\n\n. . . that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them\n\nunworthy of credence and [with or without the additional evidence\n\nand inferences properly drawn therefrom] infer that the employer\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fdid not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\" Id. at\n\n55-56 (quoting Hodgens v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 168\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (alteration in original)).\n\n            C.    Discussion\n\n            In the instant case, it is a close question whether\n\nDennis can establish a prima facie case of retaliation.         Sylvania\n\ndoes not dispute that Dennis met the first two prongs of the prima\n\nfacie     test:   Dennis   (1)    engaged   in   protected   conduct   by\n\nparticipating in the Green deposition and (2) experienced an\n\nadverse employment action by way of his termination. However, with\n\nrespect to the third prong, Dennis relies on a series of strained\n\ninferences to establish a causal connection between the two.           He\n\nstates:\n\n            if a jury believed Dennis's testimony . . .\n            then it could infer . . . the attorneys\n            believed that some of Dennis's testimony could\n            have a negative effect on the company's\n            position in the Green case; that [Vient]\n            conducted her investigation into the Molina\n            allegations with anger or resentment over\n            Dennis's   unflattering   testimony  the   day\n            before; and that the lawyers conveyed their\n            concerns about the testimony to one or more of\n            Sylvania's in-house personnel.\n\n(Emphasis in original).\n\n            Dennis further emphasizes that Tracey, as Vient's direct\n\nsupervisor, was responsible for supervising Vient's investigation\n\ninto Molina's complaint. Dennis reasons that \"[a] jury could infer\n\nthat    Tracey    and   [Vient]   talked    regularly   about   [Vient's]\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\finvestigation of Dennis, and that Tracey heard [Vient's] concerns\n\nabout Dennis's deposition testimony which had taken place the day\n\nbefore the investigation began.\" (Emphasis in original).                    Because\n\nTracy \"directly advised\" Franz on the proper course to take in the\n\nMolina matter, Dennis contends that a jury could infer that Franz'\n\ndecision to recommend Dennis' termination was influenced by Dennis'\n\ntestimony in the Green matter.                Moreover, Dennis asserts that\n\nBeckwith and Vient's concern with his testimony showed that they\n\nhad a \"motive to retaliate against him and a motive to communicate\n\namong the management group about these issues.\"\n\n              For purposes of summary judgment we are required to draw\n\nevery    reasonable     inference   in    favor    of   the   nonmoving      party.\n\nHowever, at this stage we need not credit inferences that \"rely on\n\ntenuous insinuation.\" Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43\n\nF.3d 731, 743 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotations omitted).\n\nMoreover, the nonmovant still has \"the burden of producing specific\n\nfacts sufficient to deflect . . . summary judgment . . . .\"\n\nMulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf Co., 335 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n              While Dennis insists that his retaliation claim naturally\n\nflows from \"a straightforward series of reasonable inferences,\" he\n\nhas     failed    to   provide   specific      facts    indicating      that    his\n\ntermination was caused by his allegedly unfavorable testimony in\n\nthe   Green      matter.    Instead,     Dennis    speculates       about   alleged\n\ncommunications         between   Sylvania's       counsel     and     his    direct\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fsupervisors    and    imputes      these   attorneys'    alleged      motives     and\n\ndispleasure with Dennis' testimony to Franz and Hunt, the actual\n\ndecisionmakers responsible for his firing.\n\n            Dennis' contention that a jury could reasonably string\n\ntogether these inferences is speculative, especially in view of the\n\nfact that the only evidence that Dennis provides to demonstrate\n\nthat Franz and Hunt knew about his deposition testimony is Franz'\n\nalleged reaction when conversing with Dennis about the Molina\n\nwarning letter.       Franz' body language of \"looking away\" and his\n\nstatement     that    \"he   knew    nothing    about     [Dennis'     unfavorable\n\ntestimony]\" in response to Dennis' allegation that the firing was\n\nin   retaliation     for    Dennis'    deposition   in    the    Green     case    is\n\ninsufficient for a jury reasonably to infer that Franz or Hunt\n\nshared Vient and Tracy's alleged retaliatory sentiments.                           In\n\naddition, Dennis offers no evidence that Franz or Hunt, in arriving\n\nat their decision to terminate Dennis, consulted with anyone\n\npossessing a motive to retaliate against Dennis.                \"Nothing in the\n\nrecord supports an inference of complicity.\"                Bennett v. Saint-\n\nGobain Corp., 507 F.3d 23, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2007) (holding that\n\ncausation    prong    was   unmet     where   plaintiff    failed     to   provide\n\nsufficient    proof    that     individual    responsible       for   plaintiff's\n\ndischarge consulted with and shared sentiments with middle manager\n\nwho allegedly possessed retaliatory motive).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f              In addition to Dennis' inferential reasoning, we also\n\nconsider the nearness in time between Dennis' deposition testimony\n\nin the Green case and his termination.                As we have stated, \"Our law\n\nis   that     temporal     proximity        alone    can    suffice    to    'meet   the\n\nrelatively light burden of establishing a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation.'\"          DeCaire v. Mukasey, 530 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.\n\n2008)(quoting Mariani-Colรณn v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., ex rel.\n\nChertoff, 511 F.3d 215, 224 (1st Cir. 2007)).                   Given our analysis\n\nbelow, however, we need not decide whether the mere fact that less\n\nthan    two    months     elapsed      between      Dennis'    deposition      and   his\n\ntermination is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation.\n\n              Though     we    doubt    Dennis      could     prove    causation,    we\n\nnevertheless recognize that the employee's burden to establish a\n\nprima facie case in the retaliation context \"is not an onerous\n\none.\"   Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 26.               However, even assuming that\n\nDennis has established a prima facie case, his claim still fails\n\nbecause     he   cannot       show   that    his    termination       was   pretextual.\n\nSpecifically, Dennis has not adequately countered the legitimate\n\nnon-discriminatory reasons Sylvania has proffered for terminating\n\nDennis.       These reasons include Dennis' history of misconduct as\n\nwell as Sylvania's reduction in force argument.\n\n              As evidence of pretext, Dennis argues (1) that Sylvania\n\nhad \"shifting rationales\" for firing Dennis and (2) that there is\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\fa material dispute as to whether Dennis actually had a history of\n\nmisconduct.         With respect to the former, Dennis asserts that\n\nSylvania's    March       2005   response       to   Dennis'    complaint     to     the\n\nCommission cited only his history of misconduct, while Franz'\n\nNovember 2006 deposition identified the reduction in force as the\n\ntrue reason for Dennis' dismissal.              Regarding the alleged material\n\ndispute as to his history of misconduct, Dennis argues that the\n\nSerrechia matter should not be given any credence because it was\n\nallegedly purged from his file and that the Molina matter by itself\n\ndid not warrant his termination.\n\n             Both    of     Dennis'     arguments       suggesting       pretext     are\n\nunconvincing.        First, Sylvania did not shift its rationale for\n\nterminating Dennis.         The mere fact that Sylvania failed to include\n\nthe reduction in force reasoning in its March 2005 response does\n\nnot mean that it changed its story.              This is especially true given\n\nthe   fact   that     the   record    reflects       that     Franz   presented      the\n\nreduction    in     force    argument      as   early    as    October    2005     in    a\n\nCommission interview โ- over a year before the November 2006\n\ndeposition that Dennis cites for the alleged inconsistency.\n\n             Second,      the    dispute    surrounding       Dennis'     history       of\n\nmisconduct is not material because Sylvania had another reason to\n\nterminate Dennis' employment which was not contradicted.                           Franz\n\nexplicitly stated in his deposition testimony that even if Molina\n\nhad fabricated his complaint against Dennis, he would still have\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\freplaced Dennis with Weinberg because of the reduction in force.\n\nThus,   even    if   we   credit    Dennis'   argument    that    the   Serrechia\n\ncomplaint was removed from his file and that Dennis' misconduct in\n\nthe Molina matter by itself does not rise to a \"firing offense,\"\n\nDennis would still lose: Sylvania's decision to replace Dennis with\n\nthe better performing Weinberg as part of its reduction in force\n\nargument is a \"clear, specific reason[]\" for his termination\n\nseparate from any retaliatory animus.7           Id.     Dennis \"has failed to\n\npoint to specific facts that would demonstrate any sham or pretext\n\nintended   to    cover    up    defendant's    retaliatory       motive.\"     Id.\n\nMoreover, we should exercise caution in second guessing Sylvania's\n\nemployment decisions.          Courts should not act as \"'super personnel\n\ndepartments,'        substituting    their    judicial    judgments     for   the\n\nbusiness judgments of employers.\" Bennett, 507 F.3d at 32 (quoting\n\nMesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991)).\n\n                       III.    Dennis' Discovery Motions\n\n           Dennis additionally appeals the district court's denial\n\nof his motion to compel and his motion for extension of time under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).8         This court reviews both motions under an\n\n\n\n7\n   Because Dennis does not dispute much of the conduct that formed\nthe basis of the Molina warning letter, Sylvania still could have\npartially relied on the conduct in the Molina matter in deciding\nthat Weinberg was the more valuable employee.\n8\n   As noted above, after granting Sylvania's motion for summary\njudgment, the district court denied both these discovery motions as\nmoot.\n\n                                       -17-\n\fabuse of discretion standard. Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb\n\nCo., 95 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 1996)(\"It is well settled that the\n\ntrial judge has broad discretion in ruling on pre-trial management\n\nmatters, and we review the district court's denial of discovery\n\n[and   its   denial   of   a   Rule   56(f)   motion]   for   abuse   of   its\n\nconsiderable discretion.\")(internal citations omitted)).              We note\n\nthat \"[a]ppellate courts seldom intervene in discovery questions\"\n\nand that \"[t]he standard of review in discovery matters is not\n\nappellant-friendly.\" Modern Cont'l/Obayashi v. Occupational Safety\n\n& Health Review Comm'n, 196 F.3d 274, 281 (1st Cir. 1999) (internal\n\nquotations omitted). \"The court of appeals will intervene in such\n\nmatters only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is,\n\nwhere the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and\n\nresulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\"             Id.\n\n             In the proceeding below, Dennis moved to compel six\n\ndocuments Sylvania withheld on the basis of attorney client and\n\nwork product privilege.        Four of these documents pertain to the\n\nSerrechia complaint and the other two deal with the Molina matter.\n\nDennis argues that these documents are relevant because they could\n\nshed light on the misconduct Sylvania partially relied upon for\n\nterminating Dennis.\n\n             We need not reach the question of whether the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying Dennis' motion to compel\n\nbecause Dennis' access to those documents would not have changed\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fthe outcome in this case.             As we noted above, Dennis has not met\n\nhis burden of showing that Sylvania's reduction in force rationale\n\nfor terminating Dennis was pretextual. Dennis does not allege that\n\nthese documents would yield any information linking Sylvania's\n\nreduction in force argument to retaliatory animus.9\n\n               We are equally unsympathetic to Dennis' appeal of the\n\ndistrict court's ruling on his Rule 56(f) motion.                    Dennis argues\n\nthat the district erred by denying him additional time to file his\n\nopposition          to   Sylvania's   motion    for    summary   judgment.      In\n\nparticular, Dennis contends that he was awaiting the court's\n\nrulings on his motion to compel and needed more time to obtain\n\ndiscovery of Weinberg's personnel documents and other documents\n\npertaining to Sylvania's reduction in force.\n\n               We have stated that \"Rule 56(f) serves a salutary purpose\n\nwithin the summary judgment framework.                When a party confronted by\n\na motion for summary judgment legitimately needs additional time to\n\nmarshal the facts necessary to mount an opposition, the rule\n\nprovides a useful safety valve.\"            Rivera-Torres v. Rey-Hernรกndez,\n\n502 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 2007).             \"Deployed appropriately, '[t]he\n\nrule   .   .    .    safeguard[s]     against   judges    swinging    the   summary\n\njudgment axe too hastily.'\" Id. (quoting Resolution Trust Corp. v.\n\n\n\n9\n   Notably, the Serrechia documents were dated prior to Dennis'\ndeposition in the Green matter; thus, they cannot possibly contain\nany relevant information relating to Sylvania's alleged retaliatory\nmotives with respect to its reduction in force.\n\n                                         -19-\n\fN.    Bridge    Assocs.,   Inc.,   22     F.3d   1198,   1203   (1st   Cir.\n\n1994))(alterations in original).        Under Rule 56(f):\n\n            the litigant must submit to the trial court an\n            affidavit or other authoritative document\n            showing (i) good cause for his inability to\n            have discovered or marshaled the necessary\n            facts earlier in the proceedings; (ii) a\n            plausible basis for believing that additional\n            facts probably exist and can be retrieved\n            within a reasonable time; and (iii) an\n            explanation of how those facts, if collected,\n            will suffice to defeat the pending summary\n            judgment motion.\n\nId.   We have warned that \"Rule 56(f) is not designed to give relief\n\nto those who sleep upon their rights\" and that one who seeks a\n\nfavorable ruling under Rule 56(f) \"must demonstrate due diligence\n\nboth in conducting discovery before the emergence of the summary\n\njudgment motion and in pursuing an extension of time once the\n\nmotion has surfaced.\"      Id. at 10-11.\n\n            Here, even if the documents Dennis were to obtain through\n\nthis additional discovery raised a material dispute concerning\n\nSylvania's reduction in force rationale, the request was untimely.\n\nThe record indicates that on January 25, 2006, Dennis' counsel\n\nrequested the Commission's October 2005 interview notes with Franz.\n\nIn these notes, Franz discusses the company's plan to eliminate\n\nWeinberg's position and Franz' opinion that she was a more valuable\n\nemployee.      Although Dennis states that Sylvania \"fails to allege\n\nwhat date Dennis received the copies and that the interview notes\n\n(taken by the Commission investigator) do not contain the expanded\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\finformation revealed during Franz' deposition on November 16,\n\n2006,\"    he    does   not   deny   receiving   these   notes   well   before\n\nSylvania's motion for summary judgment.           Furthermore, even if we\n\naccept Dennis' contention that he only learned the true extent to\n\nwhich Sylvania relied on the reduction in force rationale during\n\nHunt and Franz' November 16, 2006 depositions, Dennis still did not\n\nfile his Rule 56(f) motion until more than thirty days after the\n\ndepositions, and nearly three weeks after Sylvania filed its motion\n\nfor summary judgment.         Regardless of whether Dennis' Rule 56(f)\n\nmotion was a delaying tactic as Sylvania maintains, Dennis should\n\nnot be entitled to the benefits of Rule 56(f) given the amount of\n\ntime he allowed to lapse between his knowledge of Sylvania's\n\nreduction in force justification and the filing of his Rule 56(f)\n\nmotion.    Dennis neither suffered any manifest injustice nor any\n\nsubstantial prejudice.\n\n               For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\norder.\n\n               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f",

Rev. Stat. Ann. ยง 354-A.           Dennis also appeals the\n\ndistrict court's decision to deny \"as moot\" two discovery motions:\n\n(1) a motion to compel discovery of privileged documents and (2) a\n\nmotion for an extension of time pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\nFor the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                              I.   Background\n\n            Dennis was employed with Sylvania from August 1995 to\n\nMarch 24, 2004, at which date he was terminated.          At the time of\n\nhis firing, Dennis was the Associate Development Program Manager in\n\nSylvania's   human   resources     department.     His   responsibilities\n\nincluded representing the company at recruitment fairs on campuses\n\nand overseeing Sylvania's internship program.\n\n            Dennis   claims   that   Sylvania    retaliated   against   him\n\nbecause he gave deposition testimony critical of the company in an\n\ninternal matter brought by Nancy Green, a former employee of\n\nSylvania.    Green had alleged that Sylvania retaliated against her\n\nbecause she had filed a sexual harassment complaint against a co-\n\nworker.   As the lead investigator of Green's complaint, Dennis was\n\ndeposed on February 5, 2004.       Dennis cites to several instances in\n\nhis deposition where he was critical of Sylvania's response to\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fGreen's claims, such as the company's \"soft punishment\" of the\n\nalleged harassers and the slow pace with which it conducted the\n\ninvestigation of her claims.1\n\n          In   addition,   Dennis    points    to   certain   actions   and\n\nstatements     by   Sylvania's       lawyers        demonstrating   their\n\ndissatisfaction with his testimony.        For example, Dennis claims\n\nthat Paul Beckwith, Sylvania's legal counsel, was \"hostile\" to him\n\nduring the deposition.     Dennis also alleges that Beckwith raised\n\nhis voice in response to Dennis' inquiries about the strength of\n\nthe Green case, exclaiming that he \"doesn't have time for this\n\nshit.\"   Dennis further claims that during a break, when he sought\n\nguidance from Beckwith regarding whether he had to reveal his\n\nknowledge of a company manager's romantic involvement with a\n\nsubordinate, Beckwith, \"in a forceful manner, ordered him to answer\n\n'yes,''no,' or 'I don't recall.'\"2        Dennis states that Beckwith\n\n\n1\n  Dennis further noted in his deposition that Sylvania's employees\nperceived that the alleged harassers \"could do what they wanted\nbecause they were friends with [the manager]\"; that there was a\njustified perception that it would be futile to file complaints\nagainst the manager's friends; that it was inappropriate for\nSylvania to have a public team meeting on the Green matter; that\nGreen was \"justified in being upset\" by Sylvania's handling of her\ncomplaint; and that Sylvania's issuance of a warning letter to\nGreen in response to her reaction at the team meeting was \"the\nstupidest thing [Dennis] heard.\"\n2\n    Dennis also notes a dispute regarding whether he met with\nBeckwith for a deposition preparation session at Sylvania on\nJanuary 22, 2004.    Dennis states that he does not recall any\nmeeting with Beckwith prior to his February 5, 2004 deposition and\ncontends that he was out of the country on January 22, 2004. This\ndispute is not material to the outcome of this case.\n\n                                    -3-\n\ftold him that the second part of his testimony was not as helpful\n\nas the first part. In addition, Dennis alleges that Sylvania's in-\n\nhouse counsel, Nicole Vient (formerly Nicole \"Buba\"), \"rolled her\n\neyes\"    during    his   deposition,    indicating      her   unhappiness    with\n\nDennis' testimony.\n\n            Sylvania disagrees that Dennis gave testimony critical of\n\nthe     company,   arguing    instead    that     the      testimony   \"strongly\n\nsupported\" Sylvania's defense of Green's claims.3                  Furthermore,\n\nVient does not recall if she rolled her eyes during Dennis'\n\ndeposition and insists that she \"did not in any way criticize his\n\nperformance at the deposition.\"              Beckwith, for his part, denies\n\ninstructing Dennis during a break to answer questions in any\n\nparticular way.\n\n            On February 6, 2004, the day after Dennis' deposition\n\ntestimony, Vient began investigating Dennis in reference to a\n\ncomplaint, received by the company on January 28, 2004, from Miguel\n\nMolina.     Molina, an unsuccessful applicant for re-employment,\n\nclaimed    that    Dennis   had    subjected    him   to    \"inappropriate    and\n\nunprofessional\" conduct.          The investigation revealed that Dennis,\n\nwhen meeting with Molina, had made reference to Molina's problems\n\n\n3\n  In the proceeding below, the district court stated that \"[w]hile\nDennis did make several comments critical of Sylvania at his\ndeposition, his testimony does not appear to have been particularly\nharmful to Sylvania's legal position, and actually strongly\nsupported the company's position on a key issue of retaliation.\"\nDennis v.

Franz\n\ndocumented Dennis' conduct towards Molina in a February 23, 2004\n\ninternal communication to Dennis.               He concluded that Dennis'\n\nactions were \"entirely inappropriate\" and requested Dennis to sign\n\na statement to that effect.          Dennis refused to sign the statement\n\nand told Franz that he viewed the Molina investigation and warning\n\nletter as retaliation for his deposition testimony in the Green\n\nmatter.      Dennis   also   accuses    Franz    of   \"look[ing]   away\"   and\n\nresponding that \"he knew nothing about [the deposition].\"              Franz\n\nconfirmed that he told Dennis that he did not know anything about\n\nthe deposition, but does not recall \"looking away.\"\n\n          On March 24, 2004, Sylvania terminated Dennis.

Also, the warning stated that Dennis failed to use\n\"appropriate managerial judgment expected from a Human Resources\nprofessional in an employee relations matter,\" citing Dennis'\n\"numerous conversations of an intensely personal nature\" with\nSerrechia. Dennis maintains that Franz told him that \"he did not\nbelieve Serrechia's allegations\" and all references to the\nSerrechia matter would be removed from Dennis' file. He further\npoints out that although his post-termination file made no\nreference to the Serrechia matter and that his performance\nevaluations during this period praised him for his \"fine work\" and\ndid not mention the Serrechia allegations, the matter \"reappeared\"\nafter Dennis filed a complaint with the New Hampshire Commission\nfor Human Rights.\n6\n   Dennis successfully removed his case to the Superior Court\nbecause he had exhausted his administrative remedies and because it\nhad been over 180 days since he had filed his complaint with the\nCommission.

Discussion\n\n            In the instant case, it is a close question whether\n\nDennis can establish a prima facie case of retaliation.         Sylvania\n\ndoes not dispute that Dennis met the first two prongs of the prima\n\nfacie     test:   Dennis   (1)    engaged   in   protected   conduct   by\n\nparticipating in the Green deposition and (2) experienced an\n\nadverse employment action by way of his termination. However, with\n\nrespect to the third prong, Dennis relies on a series of strained\n\ninferences to establish a causal connection between the two.           He\n\nstates:\n\n            if a jury believed Dennis's testimony . . .\n            then it could infer . . . the attorneys\n            believed that some of Dennis's testimony could\n            have a negative effect on the company's\n            position in the Green case; that [Vient]\n            conducted her investigation into the Molina\n            allegations with anger or resentment over\n            Dennis's   unflattering   testimony  the   day\n            before; and that the lawyers conveyed their\n            concerns about the testimony to one or more of\n            Sylvania's in-house personnel.\n\n(Emphasis in original).\n\n            Dennis further emphasizes that Tracey, as Vient's direct\n\nsupervisor, was responsible for supervising Vient's investigation\n\ninto Molina's complaint. Dennis reasons that \"[a] jury could infer\n\nthat    Tracey    and   [Vient]   talked    regularly   about   [Vient's]\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\finvestigation of Dennis, and that Tracey heard [Vient's] concerns\n\nabout Dennis's deposition testimony which had taken place the day\n\nbefore the investigation began.\" (Emphasis in original).                    Because\n\nTracy \"directly advised\" Franz on the proper course to take in the\n\nMolina matter, Dennis contends that a jury could infer that Franz'\n\ndecision to recommend Dennis' termination was influenced by Dennis'\n\ntestimony in the Green matter.                Moreover, Dennis asserts that\n\nBeckwith and Vient's concern with his testimony showed that they\n\nhad a \"motive to retaliate against him and a motive to communicate\n\namong the management group about these issues.\"\n\n              For purposes of summary judgment we are required to draw\n\nevery    reasonable     inference   in    favor    of   the   nonmoving      party.\n\nHowever, at this stage we need not credit inferences that \"rely on\n\ntenuous insinuation.\" Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v.

Instead,     Dennis    speculates       about   alleged\n\ncommunications         between   Sylvania's       counsel     and     his    direct\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fsupervisors    and    imputes      these   attorneys'    alleged      motives     and\n\ndispleasure with Dennis' testimony to Franz and Hunt, the actual\n\ndecisionmakers responsible for his firing.\n\n            Dennis' contention that a jury could reasonably string\n\ntogether these inferences is speculative, especially in view of the\n\nfact that the only evidence that Dennis provides to demonstrate\n\nthat Franz and Hunt knew about his deposition testimony is Franz'\n\nalleged reaction when conversing with Dennis about the Molina\n\nwarning letter.

Given our analysis\n\nbelow, however, we need not decide whether the mere fact that less\n\nthan    two    months     elapsed      between      Dennis'    deposition      and   his\n\ntermination is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation.\n\n              Though     we    doubt    Dennis      could     prove    causation,    we\n\nnevertheless recognize that the employee's burden to establish a\n\nprima facie case in the retaliation context \"is not an onerous\n\none.\"   Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 26.               However, even assuming that\n\nDennis has established a prima facie case, his claim still fails\n\nbecause     he   cannot       show   that    his    termination       was   pretextual.\n\nSpecifically, Dennis has not adequately countered the legitimate\n\nnon-discriminatory reasons Sylvania has proffered for terminating\n\nDennis.       These reasons include Dennis' history of misconduct as\n\nwell as Sylvania's reduction in force argument.\n\n              As evidence of pretext, Dennis argues (1) that Sylvania\n\nhad \"shifting rationales\" for firing Dennis and (2) that there is\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\fa material dispute as to whether Dennis actually had a history of\n\nmisconduct.         With respect to the former, Dennis asserts that\n\nSylvania's    March       2005   response       to   Dennis'    complaint     to     the\n\nCommission cited only his history of misconduct, while Franz'\n\nNovember 2006 deposition identified the reduction in force as the\n\ntrue reason for Dennis' dismissal.              Regarding the alleged material\n\ndispute as to his history of misconduct, Dennis argues that the\n\nSerrechia matter should not be given any credence because it was\n\nallegedly purged from his file and that the Molina matter by itself\n\ndid not warrant his termination.\n\n             Both    of     Dennis'     arguments       suggesting       pretext     are\n\nunconvincing.        First, Sylvania did not shift its rationale for\n\nterminating Dennis.         The mere fact that Sylvania failed to include\n\nthe reduction in force reasoning in its March 2005 response does\n\nnot mean that it changed its story.              This is especially true given\n\nthe   fact   that     the   record    reflects       that     Franz   presented      the\n\nreduction    in     force    argument      as   early    as    October    2005     in    a\n\nCommission interview โ- over a year before the November 2006\n\ndeposition that Dennis cites for the alleged inconsistency.\n\n             Second,      the    dispute    surrounding       Dennis'     history       of\n\nmisconduct is not material because Sylvania had another reason to\n\nterminate Dennis' employment which was not contradicted.                           Franz\n\nexplicitly stated in his deposition testimony that even if Molina\n\nhad fabricated his complaint against Dennis, he would still have\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\freplaced Dennis with Weinberg because of the reduction in force.\n\nThus,   even    if   we   credit    Dennis'   argument    that    the   Serrechia\n\ncomplaint was removed from his file and that Dennis' misconduct in\n\nthe Molina matter by itself does not rise to a \"firing offense,\"\n\nDennis would still lose: Sylvania's decision to replace Dennis with\n\nthe better performing Weinberg as part of its reduction in force\n\nargument is a \"clear, specific reason[]\" for his termination\n\nseparate from any retaliatory animus.7           Id.     Dennis \"has failed to\n\npoint to specific facts that would demonstrate any sham or pretext\n\nintended   to    cover    up    defendant's    retaliatory       motive.\"     Id.\n\nMoreover, we should exercise caution in second guessing Sylvania's\n\nemployment decisions.          Courts should not act as \"'super personnel\n\ndepartments,'        substituting    their    judicial    judgments     for   the\n\nbusiness judgments of employers.\" Bennett, 507 F.3d at 32 (quoting\n\nMesnick v.

Four of these documents pertain to the\n\nSerrechia complaint and the other two deal with the Molina matter.\n\nDennis argues that these documents are relevant because they could\n\nshed light on the misconduct Sylvania partially relied upon for\n\nterminating Dennis.\n\n             We need not reach the question of whether the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying Dennis' motion to compel\n\nbecause Dennis' access to those documents would not have changed\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fthe outcome in this case.

In\n\nparticular, Dennis contends that he was awaiting the court's\n\nrulings on his motion to compel and needed more time to obtain\n\ndiscovery of Weinberg's personnel documents and other documents\n\npertaining to Sylvania's reduction in force.\n\n               We have stated that \"Rule 56(f) serves a salutary purpose\n\nwithin the summary judgment framework.

Although Dennis states that Sylvania \"fails to allege\n\nwhat date Dennis received the copies and that the interview notes\n\n(taken by the Commission investigator) do not contain the expanded\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\finformation revealed during Franz' deposition on November 16,\n\n2006,\"    he    does   not   deny   receiving   these   notes   well   before\n\nSylvania's motion for summary judgment.           Furthermore, even if we\n\naccept Dennis' contention that he only learned the true extent to\n\nwhich Sylvania relied on the reduction in force rationale during\n\nHunt and Franz' November 16, 2006 depositions, Dennis still did not\n\nfile his Rule 56(f) motion until more than thirty days after the\n\ndepositions, and nearly three weeks after Sylvania filed its motion\n\nfor summary judgment.         Regardless of whether Dennis' Rule 56(f)\n\nmotion was a delaying tactic as Sylvania maintains, Dennis should\n\nnot be entitled to the benefits of Rule 56(f) given the amount of\n\ntime he allowed to lapse between his knowledge of Sylvania's\n\nreduction in force justification and the filing of his Rule 56(f)\n\nmotion.    Dennis neither suffered any manifest injustice nor any\n\nsubstantial prejudice.\n\n               For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\norder.\n\n               Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f</pre>",
