Coll.   of   Am.\n\nPathologists, 170 F.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n               The facts as described in plaintiff's complaint are as\n\nfollows.       Morales-Villalobos is an anesthesiologist living in the\n\ntown of Arecibo, approximately 56 miles west of San Juan.                     In July\n\n1995 she became an employee of Arecibo Respiratory Care, Inc.,\n\n(\"ARC\") one of the co-defendants.                 ARC provided anesthesiology\n\nservices under an exclusive contract to the two hospitals in\n\nArecibo performing surgeries: Hospital Dr. Susoni (\"HDS\") and\n\nHospital Regional de Arecibo Cayetano Coll y Toste, which was\n\nmanaged by       a   subsidiary    of    HDS,    Dr.   Susoni    Health     Community\n\nServices.      This subsidiary later purchased that hospital outright.\n\nThe   complaint      provides     no    information     on   the     length   of    the\n\nexclusive contract.           The co-defendants -- Miguel García-Lloréns,\n\nJosé Arturo García-Lloréns, and Manuel Matos -- are the sole\n\nshareholders of ARC and members of the Board of Directors of HDS.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fARC is, in turn, the majority shareholder of HDS.             José Arturo\n\nGarcía-Lloréns   and   Manuel   Matos     are    themselves     certified\n\nanesthesiologists.\n\n          Morales-Villalobos    alleges   that    José   Arturo   García-\n\nLloréns, Miguel García-Lloréns, and Manuel Matos were all involved\n\n-- as HDS directors -- in the decision to award an exclusive\n\ncontract to ARC; indeed, no other HDS board members participated in\n\nthe decision.    The complaint alleges that the exclusive contract\n\nbetween ARC and HDS was motivated by corrupt self-dealing between\n\nthe directors and stockholders of the two corporations, several of\n\nwhom are themselves anesthesiologists and presumably benefitted\n\nfrom the exclusive agreement.   The inference may be drawn that the\n\nreasons for the arrangement, accordingly, were not competitive.\n\nMorales-Villalobos received medical privileges as a physician at\n\nHDS in September 1995, which appear to have extended to the\n\nHospital Regional de Arecibo as well.           In September 1997, her\n\nprivileges were renewed at HDS and the Hospital Regional de Arecibo\n\nfor a further two years.\n\n          On December 1, 1998, Morales-Villalobos was fired from\n\nher position at ARC by Miguel García-Lloréns, the President of ARC,\n\ndespite the absence of patient complaints (as alleged in the\n\ncomplaint, which we must take to be true).         The following year,\n\nMorales-Villalobos was not recertified for privileges at HDS.\n\nBecause of ARC's exclusive arrangement with HDS, once plaintiff was\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\ffired by ARC, she could not find work as an anesthesiologist at\n\neither hospital in Arecibo.          HDS also rejected a request by Dr.\n\nRamos Escoda, Morales-Villalobos's former husband and a surgeon who\n\npractices in Arecibo, to have her administer anesthesia to his\n\nprivate surgery patients at HDS.             Other physicians in the area\n\nhave also indicated their willingness to use Morales-Villalobos's\n\nservices, but are prevented from doing so at these hospitals.\n\nMoreover,   HDS   prevented     Morales-Villalobos         from    entering   the\n\nmedical facility      by   placing     fliers   on   the   walls    and   posting\n\nsecurity guards at the hospital doors.\n\n            Morales-Villalobos alleges that HDS and the Hospital\n\nRegional de Arecibo have \"complete market power\" in the Arecibo\n\nregion, because they are able to offer a complete line of medical\n\nservices, and because they are the only hospitals approved as\n\nMedicare providers. They are the only hospitals within the Health\n\nRegion of Arecibo, as defined by the Health Reform Program of the\n\nGovernment of Puerto Rico, which provides medical care for indigent\n\npatients. Patients covered under the Health Reform Program are not\n\nallowed to seek services in San Juan or other cities in Puerto\n\nRico. Morales-Villalobos alleges she provides Medicare services to\n\npatients of Dr. Escoda.        Half of the total revenue received by the\n\nArecibo   hospitals    comes    from    Medicare,    which   provides     health\n\ncoverage for individuals 65 years old or older, 42 U.S.C. § 1395c\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f(2002).    An inference may be drawn that such patients are less\n\nlikely to be able to make a 56-mile trip to hospitals in San Juan.\n\n               The other health region relatively near Arecibo is the\n\nManatí Health Region, which encompasses the city of Manatí, in\n\nwhich there are three hospitals at which surgery is performed.\n\nMorales-Villalobos says it would be impossible for her to practice\n\nin Manatí, because all of these hospitals have exclusive contracts\n\nwith    anesthesiology     groups.       Perhaps   more    importantly,      her\n\nreferring physicians in the Arecibo region do not have privileges\n\nin Manatí.\n\n               Morales-Villalobos    also   alleges   that   the   quality    of\n\npatient care has worsened as a result of ARC's exclusive contract.\n\nShe    cites    understaffing,    with   one   anesthesiologist     routinely\n\nexpected to       cover   two   geographically-separated      hospitals,     and\n\nnurses administering anesthesia without the supervision of an\n\nanesthesiologist. She also alleges an increase in cost relative to\n\nother sectors of the market.\n\n               Morales-Villalobos alleges that she has been blocked from\n\npracticing anesthesiology in Arecibo, her hometown, and that she\n\nhas also suffered damages to her professional reputation as a\n\nresult of her termination by ARC.           She alleges there are doctors\n\nwho wish to use her as an anesthesiologist but cannot because she\n\nhas been denied privileges at the only hospitals in Arecibo.                 She\n\ncharacterizes herself as a competitor of ARC.             She requests either\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\frenewal of her medical privileges at HDS facilities and an order\n\nrequiring defendants to allow her to administer to elective private\n\npatients, or a declaration that the exclusive contract is illegal,\n\neconomic damages, and an order to open HDS to Medicare providers.\n\n                                          II.\n\n              The   district      court     dismissed      Morales-Villalobos's\n\ncomplaint on two bases: first, that she failed to adequately define\n\nthe geographic market; and second, that she lacked antitrust\n\nstanding.      Neither issue can be evaluated without reference to\n\nplaintiff's theories of recovery.               At this most preliminary stage,\n\nthe    bare   bones    of   two   different       theories   are   suggested   by\n\nplaintiff's complaint.         The first is that, as an anesthesiologist\n\nin Arecibo, she is a direct competitor of ARC and is precluded by\n\nthe exclusive dealing arrangement from offering her services to the\n\nonly two hospitals in Arecibo.             The second is that the defendants\n\nhave engaged in a group boycott, in a horizontal arrangement\n\nexcluding her through expulsion, which precludes her from offering\n\nher services.       Neither theory is actionable as a per se violation.\n\n              The district court dismissed the claim first for lack of\n\na proper geographic market.          Here, the plaintiff's claim is that,\n\nas a seller of services, she was foreclosed from the outlets\n\nreasonably available. For an anesthesiologist, the primary outlets\n\nfor her services are ordinarily hospitals and clinics.                Of course,\n\neven    substantial     foreclosure        in     a   relevant   market   is   not\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fnecessarily unlawful, see Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co.,\n\n365   U.S.   320,    328-29     (1961),   but   whether       the    restraint    is\n\nhorizontal or vertical, substantial foreclosure is ordinarily a\n\nrequirement    for    a   seller    arguing     that    she    or    he   has   been\n\nunreasonably excluded from opportunities to sell.                   Id.\n\n             In this instance, the extent of foreclosure depends\n\ngreatly   on   whether    the    plaintiff's     market       is    anesthesiology\n\nservices within Arecibo, or whether the market encompasses the\n\nneighboring town of Manatí, or whether it includes other parts or\n\nall of Puerto Rico, or whether it also includes part or all of the\n\ncontinental    United     States.     Depending        on   the     circumstances,\n\nforeclosure might range from nearly complete (in Arecibo) to a\n\ntrivial percentage (if the market is the entire United States).\n\nThere is no mechanical rule -- the issue depends on circumstances,\n\nsee 2A P.E. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 570, at 342-44\n\n(2d ed. 2002) -- and while there are arguments for a larger market,\n\nthe matter cannot be resolved on the face of the complaint.\n\n             The district court also dismissed on grounds that the\n\nplaintiff lacked antitrust standing.             The doctrine of antitrust\n\nstanding is occasionally used to describe but-for causation, see\n\nSAS of P.R., Inc. v. P.R. Tel. Co., 48 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 1995),\n\nand perhaps more often to exclude indirectly injured parties who\n\nhave suffered actual injury but as a result of violations that\n\ndirectly injured intermediate entities, e.g., Hanover Shoe, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fUnited Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 494 (1968) (excluding\n\nindirect purchasers). Perhaps the most common use of the phrase is\n\nto describe cases where there is actual injury from an antitrust\n\nviolation but the impact on the would-be plaintiff results from\n\nwhat closer analysis reveals to be a pro-competitive transaction.\n\nE.g., Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488\n\n(1977).\n\n            Here it is not apparent, on a motion to dismiss, why\n\nMorales-Villalobos lacks antitrust standing.            She claims to be\n\ndirectly injured by exclusion from ARC and, in consequence of that\n\nexclusion and the exclusive dealing arrangement, by exclusion from\n\nthe   two   Arecibo   hospitals.    There   is   thus    alleged   but-for\n\ncausation, a direct injury to plaintiff as a supplier, and no\n\nobvious reason why -- if the exclusive dealing or group boycott\n\ncharges amount to a violation -- the injury to her would not be of\n\nthe kind that antitrust laws are intended to address.              If some\n\nreason does exist, defendants can develop it on remand.\n\n            Of course, the defendants may be expected to argue that\n\nquality control and other legitimate concerns justify whatever\n\nexclusive dealing arrangements exist, as well as the exclusion of\n\nthe plaintiff from ARC.1      But these are matters that go to the\n\n\n      1\n       Going beyond the allegations of the complaint, defendants'\nmemorandum in support of their motion to dismiss states that\nplaintiff was fired because \"in [ARC's] principals' considered\nview, she was not performing her duties adequately.\"            Yet\ndefendants chose to test the complaint by Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and\n\n                                   -9-\n\fquestion   of   whether    the   arrangements   are   violations   of   the\n\nantitrust laws and not whether the plaintiff is a proper party to\n\nvindicate those claims.      As to whether the arrangements are anti-\n\ncompetitive, this is obviously a factual matter that -- given the\n\nallegations -- can hardly be resolved on the face of the complaint.\n\n           It is true that many of these antitrust cases brought by\n\nexcluded medical care providers are ultimately decided against\n\nplaintiffs, usually after summary judgment or trial.          See, e.g.,\n\nMathews v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp., 87 F.3d 624 (3d Cir. 1996);\n\nOksanen v. Page Mem'l Hosp., 945 F.2d 696 (4th Cir. 1991); Benjamin\n\n v. Aroostook Med. Ctr., 937 F. Supp. 957 (D. Me. 1996); Leak v.\n\nGrant Med. Ctr., 893 F. Supp. 757 (S.D. Ohio 1995).        But that does\n\nnot mean all such claims are hopeless and should be resolved by\n\nmotion to dismiss the complaint.\n\n           Reversed.      Costs are awarded to Morales-Villalobos.\n\n\n\n\nthe district court judge quite appropriately considered the motion\nunder the Rule 12(b)(6) standards.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

Morales-Villalobos is an anesthesiologist living in the town of Arecibo, approximately 56 miles west of San Juan. In July 1995 she became an employee of Arecibo Respiratory Care, Inc., (\"ARC\") one of the co-defendants. ARC provided anesthesiology services under an exclusive contract to the two hospitals in Arecibo performing surgeries: Hospital Dr. Susoni (\"HDS\") and Hospital Regional de Arecibo Cayetano Coll y Toste, which was managed by a subsidiary of HDS, Dr. Susoni Health Community Services. This subsidiary later purchased that hospital outright. The complaint provides no information on the length of the exclusive contract. The co-defendants &#8212; Miguel Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, Jos&#233; Arturo Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, and Manuel Matos &#8212; are the sole shareholders of ARC and members of the Board of Directors of HDS.

Jos&#233; Arturo Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns and Manuel Matos are themselves certified anesthesiologists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Villalobos alleges that Jos&#233; Arturo Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, Miguel Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, and Manuel Matos were all involved &#8212; as HDS directors &#8212; in the decision to award an exclusive contract to ARC; indeed, no other HDS board members participated in the decision. The complaint alleges that the exclusive contract between ARC and HDS was motivated by corrupt self-dealing between the directors and stockholders of the two corporations, several of whom are themselves anesthesiologists and presumably benefitted from the exclusive agreement. The inference may be drawn that the reasons for the arrangement, accordingly, were not competitive. Morales-Villalobos received medical privileges as a physician at HDS in September 1995, which appear to have extended to the Hospital Regional de Arecibo as well. In September 1997, her privileges were renewed at HDS and the Hospital Regional de Arecibo for a further two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 1, 1998, Morales-Villalobos was fired from her position at ARC by Miguel Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, the President of ARC, despite the absence of patient complaints (as alleged in the complaint, which we must take to be true). The following year, Morales-Villalobos was not recertified for privileges at HDS. Because of ARC's exclusive arrangement with HDS, once plaintiff was fired by ARC, she could not find work as an anesthesiologist at either hospital in Arecibo. HDS also rejected a request by Dr. Ramos Escoda, Morales-Villalobos's former husband and a surgeon who practices in Arecibo, to have her administer anesthesia to his private surgery patients at HDS. Other physicians in the area have also indicated their willingness to use Morales-Villalobos's services, but are prevented from doing so at these hospitals. Moreover, HDS prevented Morales-Villalobos from entering the medical facility by placing fliers on the walls and posting security guards at the hospital doors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Villalobos alleges that HDS and the Hospital Regional de Arecibo have \"complete market power\" in the Arecibo region, because they are able to offer a complete line of medical services, and because they are the only hospitals approved as Medicare providers. They are the only hospitals within the Health Region of Arecibo, as defined by the Health Reform Program of the Government of Puerto Rico, which provides medical care for indigent patients. Patients covered under the Health Reform Program are not allowed to seek services in San Juan or other cities in Puerto Rico. Morales-Villalobos alleges she provides Medicare services to patients of Dr. Escoda. Half of the total revenue received by the Arecibo hospitals comes from Medicare, which provides health coverage for individuals 65 years old or older, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395c (2002). An inference may be drawn that such patients are less likely to be able to make a 56-mile trip to hospitals in San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other health region relatively near Arecibo is the Manat&#237; Health Region, which encompasses the city of Manat&#237;, in which there are three hospitals at which surgery is performed. Morales-Villalobos says it would be impossible for her to practice in Manat&#237;, because all of these hospitals have exclusive contracts with anesthesiology groups. Perhaps more importantly, her referring physicians in the Arecibo region do not have privileges in Manat&#237;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Villalobos also alleges that the quality of patient care has worsened as a result of ARC's exclusive contract. She cites understaffing, with one anesthesiologist routinely expected to cover two geographically-separated hospitals, and nurses administering anesthesia without the supervision of an anesthesiologist. She also alleges an increase in cost relative to other sectors of the market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Villalobos alleges that she has been blocked from practicing anesthesiology in Arecibo, her hometown, and that she has also suffered damages to her professional reputation as a result of her termination by ARC. She alleges there are doctors who wish to use her as an anesthesiologist but cannot because she has been denied privileges at the only hospitals in Arecibo. She characterizes herself as a competitor of ARC. She requests either renewal of her medical privileges at HDS facilities and an order requiring defendants to allow her to administer to elective private patients, or a declaration that the exclusive contract is illegal, economic damages, and an order to open HDS to Medicare providers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed Morales-Villalobos's complaint on two bases: first, that she failed to adequately define the geographic market; and second, that she lacked antitrust standing. Neither issue can be evaluated without reference to plaintiff's theories of recovery. At this most preliminary stage, the bare bones of two different theories are suggested by plaintiff's complaint. The first is that, as an anesthesiologist in Arecibo, she is a direct competitor of ARC and is precluded by the exclusive dealing arrangement from offering her services to the only two hospitals in Arecibo. The second is that the defendants have engaged in a group boycott, in a horizontal arrangement excluding her through expulsion, which precludes her from offering her services. Neither theory is actionable as a per se violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the claim first for lack of a proper geographic market. Here, the plaintiff's claim is that, as a seller of services, she was foreclosed from the outlets reasonably available. For an anesthesiologist, the primary outlets for her services are ordinarily hospitals and clinics. Of course, even substantial foreclosure in a relevant market is not necessarily unlawful, <i>see Tampa Elec. Co. v.</i> <i>Nashville Coal Co.,</i> 365 U.S. 320, 328-29, 81 S.Ct. 623, 5 L.Ed.2d 580 (1961), but whether the restraint is horizontal or vertical, substantial foreclosure is ordinarily a <i>requirement</i> for a seller arguing that she or he has been unreasonably excluded from opportunities to sell. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the <i>extent</i> of foreclosure depends greatly on whether the plaintiff's market is anesthesiology services within Arecibo, or whether the market encompasses the neighboring town of Manat&#237;, or whether it includes other parts or all of Puerto Rico, or whether it also includes part or all of the continental United States. Depending on the circumstances, foreclosure might range from nearly complete (in Arecibo) to a trivial percentage (if the market is the entire United States). There is no mechanical rule &#8212; the issue depends on circumstances, <i>see</i> 2A P.E. Areeda &amp; H. Hovenkamp, <i>Antitrust Law</i> &#182; 570, at 342-44 (2d ed.2002) &#8212; and while there are arguments for a larger market, the matter cannot be resolved on the face of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also dismissed on grounds that the plaintiff lacked antitrust standing. The doctrine of antitrust standing is occasionally used to describe but-for causation, <i>see SAS of P.R., Inc. v. P.R. Tel. Co.,</i> 48 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir.1995), and perhaps more often to exclude indirectly injured parties who have suffered actual injury but as a result of violations that directly injured intermediate entities, <i>e.g., Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp.,</i> 392 U.S. 481, 494, 88 S.Ct. 2224, 20 L.Ed.2d 1231 (1968) (excluding indirect purchasers). Perhaps the most common use of the phrase is to describe cases where there is actual injury from an antitrust violation but the impact on the would-be plaintiff results from what closer analysis reveals to be a pro-competitive transaction. <i>E.g., Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc.,</i> 429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here it is not apparent, on a motion to dismiss, why Morales-Villalobos lacks antitrust standing. She claims to be directly injured by exclusion from ARC and, in consequence of that exclusion and the exclusive dealing arrangement, by exclusion from the two Arecibo hospitals. There is thus alleged but-for causation, a direct injury to plaintiff as a supplier, and no obvious reason why &#8212; if the exclusive dealing or group boycott charges amount to a violation &#8212; the injury to her would not be of the kind that antitrust laws are intended to address. If some reason does exist, defendants can develop it on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the defendants may be expected to argue that quality control and other legitimate concerns justify whatever exclusive dealing arrangements exist, as well as the exclusion of the plaintiff from ARC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> But these are matters that go to the question of whether the arrangements are violations of the antitrust laws and not whether the plaintiff is a proper party to vindicate those claims. As to whether the arrangements are anti-competitive, this is obviously a factual matter that &#8212; given the allegations &#8212; can hardly be resolved on the face of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that many of these antitrust cases brought by excluded medical care providers are ultimately decided against plaintiffs, usually after summary judgment or trial. <i>See, e.g., Mathews v. Lancaster</i> <i>Gen. Hosp.,</i> 87 F.3d 624 (3d Cir.1996); <i>Oksanen v. Page Mem'l Hosp.,</i> 945 F.2d 696 (4th Cir.1991); <i>Benjamin v. Aroostook Med. Ctr.,</i> 937 F.Supp. 957 (D.Me.1996); <i>Leak v. Grant Med. Ctr.,</i> 893 F.Supp. 757 (S.D.Ohio 1995).

She alleged that the exclusive dealing arrangement between the hospitals and the group prevented her from competing to offer her services.

Morales-Villalobos is an anesthesiologist living in the town of Arecibo, approximately 56 miles west of San Juan. In July 1995 she became an employee of Arecibo Respiratory Care, Inc., (\"ARC\") one of the co-defendants. ARC provided anesthesiology services under an exclusive contract to the two hospitals in Arecibo performing surgeries: Hospital Dr. Susoni (\"HDS\") and Hospital Regional de Arecibo Cayetano Coll y Toste, which was managed by a subsidiary of HDS, Dr. Susoni Health Community Services. This subsidiary later purchased that hospital outright. The complaint provides no information on the length of the exclusive contract. The co-defendants &#8212; Miguel Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, Jos&#233; Arturo Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, and Manuel Matos &#8212; are the sole shareholders of ARC and members of the Board of Directors of HDS. ARC is, in turn, the majority shareholder of HDS. Jos&#233; Arturo Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns and Manuel Matos are themselves certified anesthesiologists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Villalobos alleges that Jos&#233; Arturo Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, Miguel Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, and Manuel Matos were all involved &#8212; as HDS directors &#8212; in the decision to award an exclusive contract to ARC; indeed, no other HDS board members participated in the decision. The complaint alleges that the exclusive contract between ARC and HDS was motivated by corrupt self-dealing between the directors and stockholders of the two corporations, several of whom are themselves anesthesiologists and presumably benefitted from the exclusive agreement. The inference may be drawn that the reasons for the arrangement, accordingly, were not competitive. Morales-Villalobos received medical privileges as a physician at HDS in September 1995, which appear to have extended to the Hospital Regional de Arecibo as well. In September 1997, her privileges were renewed at HDS and the Hospital Regional de Arecibo for a further two years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 1, 1998, Morales-Villalobos was fired from her position at ARC by Miguel Garc&#237;a-Llor&#233;ns, the President of ARC, despite the absence of patient complaints (as alleged in the complaint, which we must take to be true). The following year, Morales-Villalobos was not recertified for privileges at HDS.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span> (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here it is not apparent, on a motion to dismiss, why Morales-Villalobos lacks antitrust standing. She claims to be directly injured by exclusion from ARC and, in consequence of that exclusion and the exclusive dealing arrangement, by exclusion from the two Arecibo hospitals. There is thus alleged but-for causation, a direct injury to plaintiff as a supplier, and no obvious reason why &#8212; if the exclusive dealing or group boycott charges amount to a violation &#8212; the injury to her would not be of the kind that antitrust laws are intended to address. If some reason does exist, defendants can develop it on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the defendants may be expected to argue that quality control and other legitimate concerns justify whatever exclusive dealing arrangements exist, as well as the exclusion of the plaintiff from ARC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> But these are matters that go to the question of whether the arrangements are violations of the antitrust laws and not whether the plaintiff is a proper party to vindicate those claims. As to whether the arrangements are anti-competitive, this is obviously a factual matter that &#8212; given the allegations &#8212; can hardly be resolved on the face of the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that many of these antitrust cases brought by excluded medical care providers are ultimately decided against plaintiffs, usually after summary judgment or trial. <i>See, e.g., Mathews v.
