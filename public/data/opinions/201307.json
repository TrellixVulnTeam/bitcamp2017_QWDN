R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-2199\n\n                     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                        BENJAMIN F.

Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Selya, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Brian M. Glover on brief for appellant.\n     Craig N. Moore, United States Attorney, Donald C. Lockhart,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Adi Goldstein, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 29, 2004\n\f       Per Curiam.      The issue in this sentencing appeal is whether\n\nlarceny from the person is a \"crime of violence\" within the meaning\n\nof the Sentencing Guidelines.           Because this court already decided\n\nthat issue in the affirmative in United States v. De Jesus, 984\n\nF.2d 21 (1st Cir. 1993), the defendant's sentence--which was based,\n\nin pertinent part, on his prior conviction of                     a \"crime of\n\nviolence,\" i.e., larceny from the person–-is summarily affirmed.\n\n             If a defendant convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)\n\nhas a prior conviction for a \"crime of violence,\" the defendant's\n\nbase   offense     level     is   automatically   20.    USSG    App.   A;   USSG\n\n§ 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). For this purpose, \"crime of violence\" is defined\n\nas an offense that\n\n       (1)   has   as   an    element   the   use,   attempted   use,   or\n\n             threatened use of physical force against the person\n\n             of another, or\n\n\n\n       (2)   . . . involves conduct that presents a serious\n\n             potential risk of physical injury to another.\n\n\n\nUSSG § 2K2.1, comment. (n.5); § 4B1.2(a).\n\n       In the district court, defendant focused only on subsection\n\n(1) of that definition and argued that the Rhode Island larceny-\n\nfrom-the-person statute does not have \"as an element the use,\n\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fperson of another.\"    That argument is a \"straw man\"; neither the\n\nProbation Department, the government, nor the district court relied\n\non subsection (1) of that definition. On appeal, defendant argues,\n\nfor the first time, that the Rhode Island statute also does not\n\nsatisfy subsection (2) of that definition.     Leaving to one side\n\nthat defendant forfeited the latter argument by failing to make it\n\nbelow, see B & T Masonry Constr. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Mut. Ins. Co.,\n\n2004 WL 1921827 *3 (1st Cir. Aug. 30, 2004), that argument is\n\nforeclosed by this court's decision in De Jesus.\n\n     In De Jesus, this court, applying subsection (2) of the above\n\ndefinition, held that \"as the crime of larceny from the person\n\nunder Massachusetts law bears an inherent risk of violent outbreak,\n\nit constitutes a crime of violence\" within the meaning of Guideline\n\n§ 4B1.2(a).   De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 25; see also id. at 24 n.6.   The\n\ncourt reached that conclusion even though the Massachusetts statute\n\nhas been construed to apply to stealing not only from the victim's\n\nperson but also \"'from the presence of the victim,'\" that is, from\n\n\"within his area of control.\"   Id. at 23 (quoting Commonwealth v.\n\nSubilosky, 352 Mass. 153, 166, 224 N.E.2d 197, 206 (1967)).       If\n\nanything, conduct that violates the Rhode Island statute at issue\n\nhere, which applies to stealing from the victim's \"immediate\n\npresence,\" State v. Shepard, 726 A.2d 1138, 1140, 1142 (R.I. 1999)\n\n(emphasis supplied), is even more likely than its Massachusetts\n\ncounterpart to involve violence between the offender and the\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fvictim.   Therefore, the district court was correct in concluding\n\nthat De Jesus is controlling here.\n\n     Nevertheless,   defendant     argues   that,   \"[despite]   this\n\nprecedent, . . . Larceny From the Person, by its nature, does not\n\npresent a substantial risk of personal injury.\"       In so arguing,\n\ndefendant appears to be asking that De Jesus be overruled, which a\n\npanel of this court may not do.    See United States v. Downs-Moses,\n\n329 F.3d 253, 263 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 305 (2003).\n\n     Moreover, overruling De Jesus would be unwarranted because its\n\nanalysis and conclusion are consistent with Supreme Court precedent\n\nas to how the Guidelines' definition of \"crime of violence\" should\n\nbe applied, see Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990),\n\nand with the decisions of every other circuit that has considered\n\nwhether larceny from a person is a \"crime of violence\" under that\n\ndefinition, see United States v. Smith, 359 F.3d 662, 665 (4th Cir.\n\n2004) (collecting cases).\n\n     Defendant here does not take issue with the categorical\n\napproach dictated by Taylor and applied in De Jesus.      Rather, he\n\nargues that the De Jesus panel erred in categorizing a violation of\n\nthe Rhode Island statute as a \"crime of violence\" because \"while\n\nsome instances of Larceny of the Person may present a serious\n\npotential risk of serious injury to another, there are numerous\n\nways in which no potential risk of serious injury arises, let alone\n\na serious one.\"   That argument, however, was expressly considered\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fand rejected in De Jesus itself.      As this court explained there,\n\nsuch an argument is foreclosed by Taylor, under which \"[t]he\n\nlinchpin of the taxonomy . . . is not the breadth of the statutory\n\nsweep but the degree of risk, expressed in terms of the probability\n\nof physical harm presented by the mine-run of conduct that falls\n\nwithin the heartland of the statute.\"     De Jesus, 984 F.2d at 24.\n\nThus, although larceny from the person \"'typically involves no\n\nthreat of violence,' the risk of ensuing struggle is omnipresent.\"\n\nId. (quoting United States v. McVicar, 907 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.\n\n1990)); see also United States v. Howze, 343 F.3d 919, 924 (7th Cir.\n\n2003) (categorizing larceny from the person as a crime of violence\n\nbecause every such larceny \"entails a close encounter between\n\ncriminal and victim, an encounter that creates the potential not\n\nonly for violence but also for injury caused by the act of\n\ntaking\").\n\n     Accordingly, defendant's sentence is summarily affirmed.    See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
