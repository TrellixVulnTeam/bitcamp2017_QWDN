Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                 Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                    and Young,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Mauricio Hernández Arroyo, with whom Law Offices of Mauricio\nHernández Arroyo was on brief, for appellant.\n     Aramis G. Ríos, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nRosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and Mariana E. Bauzá-\nAlmonte, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          August 17, 2007\n\n\n\n     *\n           Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.         This case presents our first\n\noccasion to address the bulk cash smuggling provisions of the 2001\n\nUSA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56, § 371, 115 Stat. 272, 336-38\n\n(codified as amended at 31 U.S.C. § 5332).        Defendant Otilio Jose\n\nchallenges the district court's forfeiture order in the amount of\n\n$114,948,   arguing    that   it   constitutes   an   excessive   fine   in\n\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment.           He does not challenge his\n\nstraight guilty plea to counts arising from his failure to declare\n\nthe amount of currency he was attempting to take with him out of\n\nthe country. We hold that the forfeiture order does not constitute\n\nan excessive fine, but remand, at the request of the United States,\n\nso that the sum of $1,400 can be deducted from the amount of\n\nforfeiture.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            On August 23, 2004, Jose checked two pieces of luggage on\n\na flight departing from Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in\n\nPuerto Rico.     Jose was on his way to St. Maarten, Netherlands\n\nAntilles.     Customs officers inspected Jose's checked luggage and\n\ndiscovered bundles of cash wrapped in tissue paper hidden in a pair\n\nof sneakers and other bundles wrapped in carbon paper hidden inside\n\na set of bed sheets.    The officers approached Jose and explained to\n\nhim the currency reporting requirements for transported amounts in\n\nexcess of $10,000.     See 31 U.S.C. § 5316(a)(1)(A).      Jose declared\n\nverbally and in writing that he was in possession of $1,400.             In\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\ffact, the cash on Jose, and in his luggage, amounted to a hefty\n\n$114,948.         Jose explained that he had found the money while\n\nvisiting Puerto Rico.            He said that he was at a San Juan hotel when\n\nhe   saw   someone      throw     something         into   a     trash   container;     that\n\nindividual looked around to see if anyone had seen him and then\n\nleft the area.          Jose went down to the trash and picked up a bag\n\nwhich contained a large amount of money.                    He said to himself, \"This\n\nis my fortune, I found it.               I put it in my bag and I go home.\"               He\n\nclaimed that he was unaware of any reporting requirements.\n\n             Jose was arrested on August 23 and later charged in an\n\nindictment with (1) knowingly and willfully failing to file a\n\nreport     when    he    was     about   to    transport         at   one   time   monetary\n\ninstruments of more than $10,000 from a place in the United States\n\nto a place outside the United States, in violation of 31 U.S.C.\n\n§ 5316(a)(1)(A) (the \"cash reporting requirement\"); (2) making a\n\nmaterially        false,       fictitious,          or     fraudulent       statement    or\n\nrepresentation          in   a    matter      within       the    jurisdiction     of   the\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security, an agency of the United States, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a); and (3) knowingly and willfully\n\nconcealing more than $10,000 in currency in an attempt to transport\n\nsuch currency from a place in the United States to a place outside\n\nthe United States without filing a report as required by the\n\nSecretary of the Treasury, in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5332(a) (the\n\n\"bulk cash smuggling statute\").                      The indictment also included\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\fallegations     seeking      forfeiture       of    the    $114,948    based    on    the\n\noffenses alleged in Counts One and Three, pursuant to 31 U.S.C.\n\n§ 5317(c)(1)(A) and 31 U.S.C. § 5332(b)(2), respectively.\n\n          On November 4, 2004, Jose entered a straight guilty plea\n\nto all three counts of the indictment.                   The district court advised\n\ndefendant of his rights and found that he had knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily     waived      them    by   pleading        guilty.    The    court     also\n\nexplained to Jose that by pleading guilty he could expect the\n\ngovernment to proceed to forfeit the money involved in the offense\n\nas a result of the violations of the cash reporting requirement and\n\nthe bulk cash smuggling statute. Jose agreed except for the $1,400\n\nhe did declare, which he expected to be allowed to keep.                              The\n\ngovernment clarified that it had already filed administrative\n\nproceedings     to    try   to     return    the    $1,400    to   defendant.         The\n\ngovernment sought forfeiture of the remaining funds, which Jose had\n\nattempted to smuggle, but nothing more than that.\n\n          On     December        13,     2004,     the    government      requested    a\n\npreliminary order of forfeiture for the entire amount of $114,948.\n\nThe government's motion cited both sections 5317(c)(1)(A) (the cash\n\nreporting requirement) and 5332(b)(2) (the bulk cash smuggling\n\nstatute) as authority for the forfeiture.                   It attached a proposed\n\norder   which        referenced        defendant's        violation    of      sections\n\n5316(a)(1)(A) and 5322.            The citation to section 5322, rather than\n\nsection 5332, clearly was a typographical error.                   The government's\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fforfeiture argument at the sentencing hearing was based on both the\n\ncash reporting requirement and the bulk cash smuggling statute.\n\n             At the hearing on December 14, 2004, the district court\n\nstated that it was not so naive as to believe defendant's story\n\nabout how he came to possess the $114,948.              The judge found that\n\nJose had attempted to mislead the court, and he sentenced Jose to\n\n18 months' imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently.\n\nJose also received three years of supervised release and was\n\nordered to pay a special monetary assessment of $100 on each count.\n\nIn light of defendant's financial situation, the court did not\n\nimpose   a   fine.     Judgment   entered      on    December   14,   2004;    no\n\nforfeiture order was included in the judgment, as provided for\n\nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2(b)(3).\n\n             On December 20, 2004, the government filed a motion to\n\namend the judgment, calling the district court's attention to the\n\nfact that the judgment did not include a forfeiture order and to\n\nthe outstanding issue concerning the $1,400 that Jose had declared.\n\nOn December 23, 2004, the district court adopted the government's\n\nearlier proposed order (with its typographical error) and issued a\n\npreliminary    order   of   forfeiture    as    to    the   entire    amount   of\n\n$114,948.    The court did not amend its earlier judgment to include\n\nthe forfeiture order.\n\n             In December 2005, defendant's appellate counsel filed a\n\nbrief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967),\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fasserting that there were no non-frivolous issues for appeal.         On\n\nMarch 21, 2006, this court rejected the Anders brief, but granted\n\ncounsel's request to withdraw.           We ordered appointment of new\n\ncounsel and requested briefing on (1) whether the district court\n\nerred in failing to conform with Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2, (2) whether\n\nthe district court erred in failing to resolve a contested issue\n\nregarding the amount of forfeiture, and (3) whether the forfeiture\n\norder violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of excessive\n\nfines.   Present counsel for defendant has submitted a merits brief\n\nonly as to the third issue outlined in our March 21 order.\n\nAccordingly, the first and second issues have been waived.           See\n\nUnited States v. Vigneau, 337 F.3d 62, 68 n.1 (1st Cir. 2003);\n\nUnited States v. Chapdelaine, 23 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir. 1994).         We\n\nconsider   only   whether   the   district   court's   forfeiture   order\n\nconstitutes an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           The Eighth Amendment provides: \"Excessive bail shall not\n\nbe required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual\n\npunishments inflicted.\"      U.S. Const. amend. VIII.      We review de\n\nnovo whether a fine is constitutionally excessive, but give due\n\ndeference to the district court's factual findings.       United States\n\nv. Ortiz-Cintrón, 461 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir. 2006).        On appeal from\n\na forfeiture order alleged to be an excessive fine, it is the\n\ndefendant's burden to show unconstitutionality.        See id. at 81-82;\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fUnited States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 223 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nHere, we review the forfeiture order only for plain error because\n\nJose did not raise his Eighth Amendment claim before the district\n\ncourt.1   See United States v. Beras, 183 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).    \"To establish plain error, a defendant must demonstrate\n\nthat: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error\n\naffected the defendant's substantial rights; and (4) the error\n\nadversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"   United States v. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221, 224\n\n(1st Cir. 2002) (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n732-36 (1993); United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2000)).\n\n           Jose's argument relies heavily on the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321 (1998).    In\n\nBajakajian, the defendant and his family had failed to report the\n\n$357,144 in cash they were attempting to take with them out of the\n\nUnited States on June 9, 1994.   Id. at 324-25.   The defendant pled\n\nguilty to a charge of violating 31 U.S.C. § 5316(a)(1)(A) and\n\nelected to have a bench trial on the forfeiture count brought under\n\n\n\n\n     1\n          Jose argues that his objection at the sentencing hearing\nto the forfeiture of the declared $1,400 suffices to merit de novo\nreview on appeal. This argument fails, as defendant never objected\nto the forfeiture on Eighth Amendment grounds before the district\ncourt.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1).2         Id. at 325.         The district court found\n\nthat, under section 982(a)(1), the entire $357,144 was forfeitable\n\nbecause    it    was   \"involved    in\"    the   offense.     Id.     at   325-26.\n\nNonetheless, the court ordered the forfeiture of only $15,000,\n\nbelieving that full forfeiture would violate the Excessive Fines\n\nClause. Id. at 326.       On the government's appeal, the Ninth Circuit\n\nheld that forfeiture of currency pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1)\n\nwas per se unconstitutional because unreported currency was not an\n\n\"instrumentality\" of the crime of failure to report. United States\n\nv. Bajakajian, 84 F.3d 334, 336-38 (9th Cir. 1996).\n\n            On    certiorari,      the    Supreme   Court   held    that   it   was\n\nirrelevant whether Bajakajian's money was an instrumentality of his\n\noffense.    524 U.S. at 333.       Instead, the Court asked first whether\n\nthe forfeiture constituted punishment and was thus a \"fine\" within\n\nthe meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause, id. at 327-28, and then\n\nconsidered whether the forfeiture was constitutionally excessive --\n\nthat is, whether the forfeiture was \"grossly disproportional to the\n\ngravity of the defendant's offense,\" id. at 337.                   The Court held\n\nthat the forfeiture of Bajakajian's money, which was \"imposed at\n\nthe culmination of a criminal proceeding and require[d] conviction\n\n\n     2\n          At the time, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) provided: \"The court,\nin imposing sentence on a person convicted of an offense in\nviolation of section . . . 5316, . . . shall order that the person\nforfeit to the United States any property, real or personal,\ninvolved in such offense, or any property traceable to such\nproperty.\" 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) (1994); see also Bajakajian, 524\nU.S. at 325.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fof an underlying felony,\" constituted punishment and was thus a\n\n\"fine.\"    Id. at 328.    On the question of excessiveness, the Court\n\nthought it was significant that the district court had found that\n\nBajakajian's offense was unrelated to any other illegal activities.\n\nId.   at   337-38.      Bajakajian      \"owed    no   customs    duties   to    the\n\nGovernment, and it was perfectly legal for him to possess the\n\n$357,144 in cash and to remove it from the United States.                       His\n\ncrime   was    simply   failing    to   report    the   wholly    legal   act    of\n\ntransporting his currency.\"          Id. at 338 n.13.       The Court further\n\nconsidered the maximum penalties available under the statute, as\n\nwell as the fact that under the Sentencing Guidelines \"the maximum\n\nsentence that could have been imposed on [Bajakajian] was six\n\nmonths, while the maximum fine was $5,000.\"             Id. at 338-39 & n.14.\n\nThe Court also found that \"[t]he harm that [Bajakajian] caused was\n\n. . . minimal.\"      Id. at 339.   These observations contributed to the\n\nCourt's conclusion that the full forfeiture of Bajakajian's money\n\n\"would be grossly disproportional to the gravity of his offense.\"\n\nId. at 339-40.\n\n              Congress responded to Bajakajian in the USA PATRIOT Act\n\nwhen it amended laws governing civil and criminal forfeiture in the\n\nwake of September 11, 2001.        Pub. L. No. 107-56, §§ 319, 371, 372,\n\n115 Stat. at 311-12, 336-39 (amending 18 U.S.C. §§ 981 and 982, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 853, and 31 U.S.C. § 5317, and creating 31 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f§ 5332).3     The USA PATRIOT Act inserted a criminal forfeiture\n\nprovision in 31 U.S.C. § 5317(c)(1)(A) for property involved in a\n\nviolation of 31 U.S.C. § 5316 and correspondingly deleted the\n\nreference to 31 U.S.C. § 5316 in 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1).4                   Id.\n\n§ 372, 115 Stat. at 338-39.\n\n            The   Act   also   defined   the   new   crime   of   \"bulk   cash\n\nsmuggling\" at 31 U.S.C. § 5332.          Id. § 371, 115 Stat. at 337-38.\n\nSection 5332(a)(1) provides:\n\n            Whoever, with the intent to evade a currency\n            reporting requirement under section 5316,\n            knowingly conceals more than $10,000 in\n            currency or other monetary instruments on the\n            person   of   such  individual   or   in   any\n            conveyance, article of luggage, merchandise,\n            or   other  container,   and   transports   or\n            transfers or attempts to transport or transfer\n            such currency or monetary instruments from a\n            place within the United States to a place\n            outside of the United States, or from a place\n            outside the United States to a place within\n            the United States, shall be guilty of a\n            currency smuggling offense and subject to\n            punishment pursuant to subsection (b).\n\nSection 5332(b)(2), in turn, provides for the forfeiture of \"any\n\nproperty, real or personal,\" involved in the violation of section\n\n5332(a)(1).\n\n\n\n     3\n          For a discussion of the USA PATRIOT Act's civil\nforfeiture provisions for interbank accounts, see United States v.\nUnion Bank for Savings & Investment, 487 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2007)\n(interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 981(k)).\n     4\n          31 U.S.C. § 5317(c)(1)(A) and the superseded version of\n18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) are virtually identical. Compare 31 U.S.C.\n§ 5317(c)(1)(A), with 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) (1994).\n\n                                    -10-\n\f          Although the elements of the offense defined at section\n\n5332(a)(1) largely track those of the offense defined at section\n\n5316(a)(1),5    section   5332   places   its   emphasis   on   the   knowing\n\nconcealment of \"more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary\n\ninstruments,\" rather than the requirement to file a report, as in\n\nsection 5316.     Indeed, Congress attached to section 5332 a note\n\nexpressing its finding that\n\n          [t]he current penalties for violations of the\n          currency    reporting     requirements    are\n          insufficient to provide a deterrent to the\n          laundering    of   criminal    proceeds.   In\n          particular, in cases where the only criminal\n          violation under current law is a reporting\n          offense, the law does not adequately provide\n          for the confiscation of smuggled currency. In\n          contrast, if the smuggling of bulk cash were\n          itself   an  offense,   the  cash   could  be\n          confiscated as the corpus delicti of the\n          smuggling offense.\n\n\n\n     5\n          Section 5316 provides in relevant part:\n\n          (a) Except as provided in subsection (c) of\n          this section, a person or an agent or bailee\n          of the person shall file a report under\n          subsection (b) of this section when the\n          person, agent, or bailee knowingly --\n\n           (1) transports, is about to transport, or has\n           transported, monetary instruments of more\n           than $10,000 at one time --\n\n               (A) from a place in the United States to or\n               through a place outside the United States;\n               or\n\n               (B) to a place in the United States from or\n               through a place outside the United States\n               . . . .\n\n                                   -11-\n\fUSA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56, § 371(a)(6), 115 Stat. at 337\n\n(emphases added).\n\n              Congress was explicit that its purposes in enacting\n\nsection 5332 were \"(1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash\n\nitself a criminal offense; (2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash\n\nor instruments of the smuggling offense; and (3) to emphasize the\n\nseriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.\"                  Id. § 371(b), 115\n\nStat.    at   337.       Congress    was    particularly       concerned    that   the\n\ntransportation and smuggling of large sums of cash was a \"warning\n\nsign[]     of     drug    trafficking,        terrorism,       money     laundering,\n\nracketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.\"                    Id. § 371(a)(3),\n\n115 Stat. at 337. Further, because couriers who attempt to smuggle\n\ncash out of the country are typically low-level employees of\n\ncriminal        organizations,       Congress       believed     that     \"only    the\n\nconfiscation of the smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the\n\ncycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash\n\nis a critical part.\"         Id. § 371(a)(5), 115 Stat. at 337.\n\n              Congress,     in    enacting        section   5332,      responded   to\n\nBajakajian in a way that it believed would, in most circumstances,\n\nconstitutionally         permit     the    full   forfeiture     of     currency   not\n\nreported to authorities as required by section 5316. The Report of\n\nthe House Committee on Financial Services stated:\n\n              The Committee believes . . . that bulk cash\n              smuggling is an inherently more serious\n              offense than simply failing to file a Customs\n              report. Because the constitutionality of a\n\n                                           -12-\n\f          forfeiture is dependent on the \"gravity of the\n          offense\" under Bajakajian, it is anticipated\n          that the full forfeiture of smuggled money\n          will withstand constitutional scrutiny in most\n          cases.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 107-250, at 53 (2001).   Section 5332 makes clear that\n\nCongress has now prohibited what it calls \"bulk cash smuggling,\"\n\nand that it considers this to be a very serious offense.   Congress\n\nhas thus tipped the forfeiture equation in favor of the prosecution\n\nin bulk cash smuggling cases.      Bajakajian itself stated that\n\n\"judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense belong\n\nin the first instance to the legislature.\"   524 U.S. at 336 (citing\n\nSolem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 290 (1983) (\"Reviewing courts . . .\n\nshould grant substantial deference to the broad authority that\n\nlegislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and\n\nlimits of punishments for crimes . . . .\"); Gore v. United States,\n\n357 U.S. 386, 393 (1958) (\"Whatever views may be entertained\n\nregarding severity of punishment, . . . these are peculiarly\n\nquestions of legislative policy.\")). But see United States v. Ely,\n\n468 F.3d 399, 402 n.2 (6th Cir. 2006) (stating that the difference\n\nbetween the superseded version of 18 U.S.C. § 982 and 31 U.S.C.\n\n§ 5332 \"[could not] be viewed as a meaningful change\").\n\n          We turn to the question of whether the district court's\n\nforfeiture order was plainly erroneous, given defendant's challenge\n\nunder the Excessive Fines Clause. In considering this question, we\n\nneed not, and do not, address whether Congress, in enacting section\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f5332, has eliminated in all instances any Eighth Amendment concerns\n\nwith respect to bulk cash smuggling forfeitures.                  In light of the\n\nfacts of this case, we conclude that there was no error at all,\n\nmuch less plain error.\n\n            We     consider     first      whether    the    forfeiture        order\n\nconstituted       punishment.        See    Heldeman,       402    F.3d   at     223\n\n(\"Forfeitures are subject to the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines\n\nclause 'if they constitute punishment for an offense.'\"                   (quoting\n\nBajakajian, 524 U.S. at 328)).          The order here, which was \"imposed\n\nat the culmination of a criminal proceeding,\" and which \"require[d]\n\nconviction    of    an   underlying     felony,\"     constituted     punishment.6\n\nBajakajian, 524 U.S. at 328.\n\n            Next, we consider whether the forfeiture of the $114,948\n\nwould be \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant's\n\noffense.\"        Id. at 337.        For Eighth Amendment excessive fine\n\npurposes, pertinent factors include: \"(1) whether the defendant\n\nfalls into the class of persons at whom the criminal statute was\n\nprincipally      directed;    (2)   other      penalties    authorized     by   the\n\n\n\n     6\n          The government has not argued on appeal that the\nforfeiture is merely a remedial customs remedy that does not\nconstitute punishment subject to the Excessive Fines Clause. See\nOne Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U.S. 232, 237\n(1972) (per curiam) (holding that customs statute requiring\nforfeiture of undeclared goods concealed in baggage and imposing a\nmonetary penalty equal to value of goods imposed \"remedial rather\nthan punitive sanctions\"). But see Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 340-41\n(distinguishing between punishment for criminal offenses and civil\nin rem forfeitures of goods imported in violation of customs laws).\n\n                                        -14-\n\flegislature (or the Sentencing Commission); and (3) the harm caused\n\nby the defendant.\" Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 223; see also Bajakajian,\n\n524 U.S. at 337-40; Beras, 183 F.3d at 29.\n\n          On the first factor, we inquire whether the statute is\n\nprincipally directed toward defendant.       Given that we take the\n\nforfeiture order to be independently based on Count Three, we\n\nconsider whether section 5332, the bulk cash smuggling statute, is\n\ndesigned for offenders like Jose. In its USA PATRIOT Act findings,\n\nCongress recognized that \"couriers who attempt to smuggle . . .\n\ncash out of the United States are typically low-level employees of\n\nlarge criminal organizations.\"    Pub. L. No. 107-56, § 371(a)(5),\n\n115 Stat. at 337 (emphasis added).      Here, the district court did\n\nnot find that defendant's funds were not linked to other crimes, as\n\nwas the case in Bajakajian.   See 524 U.S. at 326.    Although it is\n\ntrue that the district court did not expressly find that the funds\n\nwere related to illegal activities,7 it is Jose who bears the\n\nburden of showing that the forfeiture is unconstitutional.       See\n\nOrtiz-Cintrón, 461 F.3d at 81-82; Heldeman, 402 F.3d at 223.\n\n\n     7\n          After the district court announced Jose's sentence,\ndefense counsel characterized the court as having found that the\nfunds were \"related to a drug offense.\" The judge responded:\n\n          I didn't say that at any moment. . . . I said\n          that [Jose's] story . . . as to how he came\n          about the money is hard to believe. And I am\n          not so naive as to think that somebody would\n          throw away $114,948 in a trash can. That is\n          all I said.    I didn't use anything about\n          drugs, Counselor.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fIndeed, defendant's far-fetched story explaining how he found the\n\nmoney raises serious suspicions about whether the funds were\n\nlegally derived.   Forfeitures based on violations of the bulk cash\n\nsmuggling statute are principally directed toward money launderers,\n\ndrug traffickers, tax evaders, and terrorists, as well as their\n\ncouriers.    See USA PATRIOT Act, Pub. L. No. 107-56, § 371(a)(3),\n\n(5), 115 Stat. at 337.     Given the facts of this case and Jose's\n\nunlikely story, we cannot say that section 5332 is not principally\n\ndesigned for persons such as defendant.\n\n            Turning to the second factor, Jose, like Bajakajian,\n\nfaced a statutory maximum of 5 years' imprisonment.         See 31 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 5322(a), 5332(b)(1); Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 339 n.14.            Jose,\n\nhowever, faced a tougher Guidelines sentence than Bajakajian.             The\n\nmaximum Guidelines sentence that could have been imposed on Jose\n\nwas 18 months' imprisonment and a fine of $30,000, whereas the\n\nmaximum   Guidelines   sentence    that   could   have   been   imposed   on\n\nBajakajian was 6 months' imprisonment and a fine of only $5,000.\n\nThus, the forfeiture at issue here is less than 4 times the maximum\n\nfine allowable under the Guidelines, whereas the forfeiture in\n\nBajakajian exceeded the maximum fine under the then-mandatory\n\nGuidelines by a factor of more than 70.           This undermines Jose's\n\nargument that the forfeiture order is grossly out of proportion to\n\nthe gravity of his offense.       See Beras, 183 F.3d at 29 n.5 (noting\n\nthat Bajakajian \"suggests that the maximum penalties provided under\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fthe Guidelines should be given greater weight than the statute\n\nbecause the Guidelines take into consideration the culpability of\n\nthe individual defendant\").\n\n           The third factor requires us to evaluate the harm caused\n\nby defendant.   We consider the harm caused by Jose's violation of\n\nsection 5332, the bulk cash smuggling statute.        As Congress stated\n\nin its enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, it wanted to \"emphasize\n\nthe seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.\"             Pub. L. No.\n\n107-56, § 371(b), 115 Stat. at 337.       Further, Congress found a link\n\nbetween the laundering of bulk cash and various types of serious\n\ncriminal activity.     See id. § 371(a)(3), 115 Stat. at 337.               It\n\nexpressly tied the enforcement of section 5332 to efforts to \"break\n\nthe cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk\n\ncash is a critical part.\"     Id. § 371(a)(5), 115 Stat. at 337.            We\n\nadhere to Congress's view that defendant's violation of the bulk\n\ncash smuggling statute constitutes a significant harm.              Compare\n\nBajakajian, 524 U.S. at 339 (\"Failure to report [Bajakajian's]\n\ncurrency   affected   only   one   party,   the   Government,    and   in    a\n\nrelatively minor way. . . . Had his crime gone undetected, the\n\nGovernment would have been deprived only of the information that\n\n$357,144 had left the country.\").\n\n           Thus far we have concluded: (1) defendant's funds may\n\nwell have been linked to other criminal activities, (2) the amount\n\nof forfeiture is not grossly out of line with the maximum fine\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fauthorized by the Sentencing Guidelines, and (3) Congress has\n\nclearly expressed its belief that bulk cash smuggling is a serious\n\noffense linked to various kinds of harm.                   The consideration of a\n\nfourth factor makes abundantly clear that there was no error here.8\n\n               The Supreme Court noted in Bajakajian that the Excessive\n\nFines Clause was taken from the English Bill of Rights of 1689.\n\n524 U.S. at 335; see also Browning-Ferris Indus. of Vt., Inc. v.\n\nKelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257, 266-67 (1989).                        The English\n\nBill of Rights of 1689 was passed in response to the subversion of\n\nMagna       Charta   by     Stuart    judges    who    imposed   excessive      fines.\n\nBajakajian, 524 U.S. at 335.             Magna Charta, in turn, required that\n\n\"amercements         (the    medieval    predecessors       of   fines)    should     be\n\nproportioned to the offense and that they should not deprive a\n\nwrongdoer of his livelihood.\"                Id. (emphasis added); see also id.\n\nat 335-36 (\"'A Free-man shall not be amerced for a small fault, but\n\nafter the manner of the fault; and for a great fault after the\n\ngreatness      thereof,      saving     to    him   his   contenement;    (2)   and   a\n\nMerchant likewise, saving to him his merchandise; (3) and any\n\nother's villain than ours shall be likewise amerced, saving his\n\nwainage.'\"       (quoting Magna Charta, 9 Hen. III, ch. 14 (1225), 1\n\nStat. at Large 6-7 (1762 ed.))).                    Given the history behind the\n\nExcessive Fines Clause, it is appropriate to consider whether the\n\n\n        8\n          Even if we were measuring forfeiture by section 5316, the\ncash reporting requirement, we would still find no violation of the\nExcessive Fines Clause.\n\n                                             -18-\n\fforfeiture in question would deprive Jose of his livelihood.                     Cf.\n\nBajakajian, 524 U.S. at 339-40 & n.15 (concluding that the full\n\nforfeiture     sought       by     the    government        would     be    grossly\n\ndisproportional to the gravity of defendant's offense, but noting\n\nthat defendant did not present any arguments regarding wealth,\n\nincome, or deprivation of livelihood).\n\n           It cannot reasonably be argued that forfeiture of the\n\n$114,948   would    deprive      defendant      of   his   livelihood.      As   the\n\ndistrict court noted at sentencing, \"according to [Jose's] own\n\nwords, th[e] money wasn't his to start with. . . . So whether the\n\ngovernment forfeits it or not, it is really of no consequence to\n\nhim because it wasn't his to be forfeited.\"                         The money, by\n\ndefendant's own admission, was not related to efforts to maintain\n\nhis livelihood.       Further, at the change of plea hearing, the\n\ngovernment indicated that Jose's business merchandise, which was\n\ntaken from him in Puerto Rico, was in the process of being sent to\n\nhis wife in St. Maarten so that she could resell the goods there,\n\nin accordance with Jose's business practice.                We conclude that the\n\nforfeiture    order   does       not   implicate     the    historical     concerns\n\nunderlying the Excessive Fines Clause.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we hold that defendant has\n\nfailed to show that there was error, much less error that was\n\nplain.       The   amount     of   forfeiture        simply   is    not    \"grossly\n\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fdisproportional to the gravity of the defendant's offense.\" Id. at\n\n337.\n\n            The government has requested a limited remand so that it\n\ncan pursue its intention, stated at the change of plea hearing, to\n\nreturn to defendant the $1,400 he declared.           The government plans\n\nto   move   to   amend   the   district   court's   order   to   reflect   the\n\nremaining balance of $113,548. We remand for this limited purpose.\n\nIn all other respects, we affirm the district court's forfeiture\n\norder.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f",

Ríos, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and Mariana E. Bauzá-Almonte, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, and YOUNG,<sup>[*]</sup> District Judge.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This case presents our first occasion to address the bulk cash smuggling provisions of the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act, Pub.L. No. 107-56, § 371, 115 Stat. 272, 336-38 (codified as amended at 31 U.S.C. § 5332). Defendant Otilio Jose challenges the district court's forfeiture order in the amount of $114,948, arguing that it constitutes an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment. He does not challenge his straight guilty plea to counts arising from his failure to declare the amount of currency he was attempting to take with him out of the country. We hold that the forfeiture order does not constitute an excessive fine, but remand, at the request of the United States, so that the sum of $1,400 can be deducted from the amount of forfeiture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On August 23, 2004, Jose checked two pieces of luggage on a flight departing from Luis Muoz Marín International Airport in Puerto Rico. Jose was on his way to St. Maarten, Netherlands Antilles. Customs officers inspected Jose's checked luggage and discovered bundles of cash wrapped in tissue paper hidden in a pair of sneakers and other bundles wrapped in carbon paper hidden inside a set of bed sheets. The officers approached Jose and explained to him the currency reporting requirements for transported amounts in excess of $10,000. <i>See</i> 31 U.S.C. § 5316(a)(1)(A). Jose declared verbally and in writing that he was in possession of $1,400. In fact, the cash on Jose, and in his luggage, amounted to a hefty $114,948. Jose explained that he had found the money while visiting Puerto Rico. He said that he was at a San Juan hotel when he saw someone throw something into a trash container; that individual looked around to see if anyone had seen him and then left the area. Jose went down to the trash and picked up a bag which contained a large amount of money. He said to himself, \"This is my fortune, I found it. I put it in my bag and I go home.\" He claimed that he was unaware of any reporting requirements.</p>\n<p>Jose was arrested on August 23 and later charged in an indictment with (1) knowingly and willfully failing to file a report when he was about to transport at one time monetary instruments of more than $10,000 from a place in the United States to a place outside the United States, in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5316(a)(1)(A) (the \"cash reporting requirement\"); (2) making a materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, an agency of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a); and (3) knowingly and willfully concealing more than $10,000 in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*107</span> currency in an attempt to transport such currency from a place in the United States to a place outside the United States without filing a report as required by the Secretary of the Treasury, in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5332(a) (the \"bulk cash smuggling statute\"). The indictment also included allegations seeking forfeiture of the $114,948 based on the offenses alleged in Counts One and Three, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 5317(c)(1)(A) and 31 U.S.C. § 5332(b)(2), respectively.</p>\n<p>On November 4, 2004, Jose entered a straight guilty plea to all three counts of the indictment. The district court advised defendant of his rights and found that he had knowingly and voluntarily waived them by pleading guilty. The court also explained to Jose that by pleading guilty he could expect the government to proceed to forfeit the money involved in the offense as a result of the violations of the cash reporting requirement and the bulk cash smuggling statute. Jose agreed except for the $1,400 he did declare, which he expected to be allowed to keep. The government clarified that it had already filed administrative proceedings to try to return the $1,400 to defendant. The government sought forfeiture of the remaining funds, which Jose had attempted to smuggle, but nothing more than that.</p>\n<p>On December 13, 2004, the government requested a preliminary order of forfeiture for the entire amount of $114,948. The government's motion cited both sections 5317(c)(1)(A) (the cash reporting requirement) and 5332(b)(2) (the bulk cash smuggling statute) as authority for the forfeiture. It attached a proposed order which referenced defendant's violation of sections 5316(a)(1)(A) and 5322. The citation to section 5322, rather than section 5332, clearly was a typographical error. The government's forfeiture argument at the sentencing hearing was based on both the cash reporting requirement and the bulk cash smuggling statute.</p>\n<p>At the hearing on December 14, 2004, the district court stated that it was not so naive as to believe defendant's story about how he came to possess the $114,948. The judge found that Jose had attempted to mislead the court, and he sentenced Jose to 18 months' imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Jose also received three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a special monetary assessment of $100 on each count. In light of defendant's financial situation, the court did not impose a fine. Judgment entered on December 14, 2004; no forfeiture order was included in the judgment, as provided for under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(3).</p>\n<p>On December 20, 2004, the government filed a motion to amend the judgment, calling the district court's attention to the fact that the judgment did not include a forfeiture order and to the outstanding issue concerning the $1,400 that Jose had declared. On December 23, 2004, the district court adopted the government's earlier proposed order (with its typographical error) and issued a preliminary order of forfeiture as to the entire amount of $114,948. The court did not amend its earlier judgment to include the forfeiture order.</p>\n<p>In December 2005, defendant's appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to <i>Anders v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there were no non-frivolous issues for appeal. On March 21, 2006, this court rejected the <i>Anders</i> brief, but granted counsel's request to withdraw. We ordered appointment of new counsel and requested briefing on (1) whether the district court erred in failing to conform with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2, (2) whether the district court erred in failing to resolve a contested issue regarding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*108</span> the amount of forfeiture, and (3) whether the forfeiture order violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of excessive fines. Present counsel for defendant has submitted a merits brief only as to the third issue outlined in our March 21 order. Accordingly, the first and second issues have been waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vigneau,</i> 337 F.3d 62, 68 n. 1 (1st Cir. 2003); <i>United States v. Chapdelaine,</i> 23 F.3d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1994). We consider only whether the district court's forfeiture order constitutes an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>The Eighth Amendment provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" U.S. Const. amend. VIII. We review de novo whether a fine is constitutionally excessive, but give due deference to the district court's factual findings. <i>United States v. Ortiz-Cintrón,</i> 461 F.3d 78, 81 (1st Cir.2006). On appeal from a forfeiture order alleged to be an excessive fine, it is the defendant's burden to show unconstitutionality. <i>See id.</i> at 81-82; <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 223 (1st Cir.2005). Here, we review the forfeiture order only for plain error because Jose did not raise his Eighth Amendment claim before the district court.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Beras,</i> 183 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir.1999). \"To establish plain error, a defendant must demonstrate that: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error affected the defendant's substantial rights; and (4) the error adversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Riggs,</i> 287 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>United States v. Saxena,</i> 229 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000)).</p>\n<p>Jose's argument relies heavily on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. 321, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998). In <i>Bajakajian,</i> the defendant and his family had failed to report the $357,144 in cash they were attempting to take with them out of the United States on June 9, 1994. <i>Id.</i> at 324-25, 118 S.Ct. 2028. The defendant pled guilty to a charge of violating 31 U.S.C. § 5316(a)(1)(A) and elected to have a bench trial on the forfeiture count brought under 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1).<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 325, 118 S.Ct. 2028. The district court found that, under section 982(a)(1), the entire $357,144 was forfeitable because it was \"involved in\" the offense. <i>Id.</i> at 325-26, 118 S.Ct. 2028. Nonetheless, the court ordered the forfeiture of only $15,000, believing that full forfeiture would violate the Excessive Fines Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 326. On the government's appeal, the Ninth Circuit held that forfeiture of currency pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) was per se unconstitutional because unreported currency was not an \"instrumentality\" of the crime of failure to report. <i>United States v. Bajakajian,</i> 84 F.3d 334, 336-38 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*109</span> On certiorari, the Supreme Court held that it was irrelevant whether Bajakajian's money was an instrumentality of his offense. 524 U.S. at 333, 118 S.Ct. 2028. Instead, the Court asked first whether the forfeiture constituted punishment and was thus a \"fine\" within the meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause, <i>id.</i> at 327-28, 118 S.Ct. 2028, and then considered whether the forfeiture was constitutionally excessivethat is, whether the forfeiture was \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant's offense,\" <i>id.</i> at 337, 118 S.Ct. 2028. The Court held that the forfeiture of Bajakajian's money, which was \"imposed at the culmination of a criminal proceeding and require[d] conviction of an underlying felony,\" constituted punishment and was thus a \"fine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 328, 118 S.Ct. 2028. On the question of excessiveness, the Court thought it was significant that the district court had found that Bajakajian's offense was unrelated to any other illegal activities. <i>Id.</i> at 337-38, 118 S.Ct. 2028. Bajakajian \"owed no customs duties to the Government, and it was perfectly legal for him to possess the $357,144 in cash and to remove it from the United States. His crime was simply failing to report the wholly legal act of transporting his currency.\" <i>Id.</i> at 338 n. 13, 118 S.Ct. 2028. The Court further considered the maximum penalties available under the statute, as well as the fact that under the Sentencing Guidelines \"the maximum sentence that could have been imposed on [Bajakajian] was six months, while the maximum fine was $5,000.\" <i>Id.</i> at 338-39 &amp; n. 14, 118 S.Ct. 2028. The Court also found that \"[t]he harm that [Bajakajian] caused was . . . minimal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 339, 118 S.Ct. 2028. These observations contributed to the Court's conclusion that the full forfeiture of Bajakajian's money \"would be grossly disproportional to the gravity of his offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 339-40, 118 S.Ct. 2028.</p>\n<p>Congress responded to <i>Bajakajian</i> in the USA PATRIOT Act when it amended laws governing civil and criminal forfeiture in the wake of September 11, 2001. Pub.L. No. 107-56, §§ 319, 371, 372, 115 Stat. at 311-12, 336-39 (amending 18 U.S.C. §§ 981 and 982, 21 U.S.C. § 853, and 31 U.S.C. § 5317, and creating 31 U.S.C. § 5332).<sup>[3]</sup> The USA PATRIOT Act inserted a criminal forfeiture provision in 31 U.S.C. § 5317(c)(1)(A) for property involved in a violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5316 and correspondingly deleted the reference to 31 U.S.C. § 5316 in 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1).<sup>[4]</sup><i>Id.</i> § 372, 115 Stat. at 338-39.</p>\n<p>The Act also defined the new crime of \"bulk cash smuggling\" at 31 U.S.C. § 5332. <i>Id.</i> § 371, 115 Stat. at 337-38. Section 5332(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Whoever, with the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement under section 5316, knowingly conceals more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments on the person of such individual or in any conveyance, article of luggage, merchandise, or other container, and transports or transfers or attempts to transport or transfer such currency or monetary instruments from a place within the United States to a place outside of the United States, or from a place outside the United States to a place within the United States, shall be guilty of a currency smuggling offense <span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> and subject to punishment pursuant to subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<p>Section 5332(b)(2), in turn, provides for the forfeiture of \"any property, real or personal,\" involved in the violation of section 5332(a)(1).</p>\n<p>Although the elements of the offense defined at section 5332(a)(1) largely track those of the offense defined at section 5316(a)(1),<sup>[5]</sup> section 5332 places its emphasis on the <i>knowing concealment</i> of \"more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments,\" rather than the <i>requirement to file a report,</i> as in section 5316. Indeed, Congress attached to section 5332 a note expressing its finding that</p>\n<blockquote>[t]he current penalties for violations of the currency reporting requirements are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the laundering of criminal proceeds. In particular, in cases where the only criminal violation under current law is a <i>reporting offense,</i> the law does not adequately provide for the confiscation of smuggled currency. <i>In contrast, if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling offense.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>USA PATRIOT Act, Pub.L. No. 107-56, § 371(a)(6), 115 Stat. at 337 (emphases added).</p>\n<p>Congress was explicit that its purposes in enacting section 5332 were \"(1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a criminal offense; (2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of the smuggling offense; and (3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.\" <i>Id.</i> § 371(b), 115 Stat. at 337. Congress was particularly concerned that the transportation and smuggling of large sums of cash was a \"warning sign[] of drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.\" <i>Id.</i> § 371(a)(3), 115 Stat. at 337. Further, because couriers who attempt to smuggle cash out of the country are typically low-level employees of criminal organizations, Congress believed that \"only the confiscation of the smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.\" <i>Id.</i> § 371(a)(5), 115 Stat. at 337.</p>\n<p>Congress, in enacting section 5332, responded to <i>Bajakajian</i> in a way that it believed would, in most circumstances, constitutionally permit the full forfeiture of currency not reported to authorities as required by section 5316. The Report of the House Committee on Financial Services stated:</p>\n<blockquote>The Committee believes . . . that bulk cash smuggling is an inherently more serious offense than simply failing to file a Customs report. Because the constitutionality of a forfeiture is dependent on the \"gravity of the offense\" under <i>Bajakajian,</i> it is anticipated that the full forfeiture of smuggled money will withstand constitutional scrutiny in most cases.</blockquote>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 107-250(I), at 53 (2001). Section 5332 makes clear that Congress <span class=\"star-pagination\">*111</span> has now prohibited what it calls \"bulk cash smuggling,\" and that it considers this to be a very serious offense. Congress has thus tipped the forfeiture equation in favor of the prosecution in bulk cash smuggling cases. <i>Bajakajian</i> itself stated that \"judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense belong in the first instance to the legislature.\" 524 U.S. at 336, 118 S.Ct. 2028 (citing <i>Solem v. Helm,</i> 463 U.S. 277, 290, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983) (\"Reviewing courts . . . should grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes. . . .\"); <i>Gore v. United States,</i> 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958) (\"Whatever views may be entertained regarding severity of punishment, . . . these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.\")). <i>But see </i><i>United States v. Ely,</i> 468 F.3d 399, 402 n. 2 (6th Cir.2006) (stating that the difference between the superseded version of 18 U.S.C. § 982 and 31 U.S.C. § 5332 \"[could not] be viewed as a meaningful change\").</p>\n<p>We turn to the question of whether the district court's forfeiture order was plainly erroneous, given defendant's challenge under the Excessive Fines Clause. In considering this question, we need not, and do not, address whether Congress, in enacting section 5332, has eliminated in all instances any Eighth Amendment concerns with respect to bulk cash smuggling forfeitures. In light of the facts of this case, we conclude that there was no error at all, much less plain error.</p>\n<p>We consider first whether the forfeiture order constituted punishment. <i>See </i><i>Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 223 (\"Forfeitures are subject to the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause `if they constitute punishment for an offense.'\") (quoting <i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 328, 118 S.Ct. 2028). The order here, which was \"imposed at the culmination of a criminal proceeding,\" and which \"require[d] conviction of an underlying felony,\" constituted punishment.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 328, 118 S.Ct. 2028.</p>\n<p>Next, we consider whether the forfeiture of the $114,948 would be \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant's offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 337, 118 S.Ct. 2028. For Eighth Amendment excessive fine purposes, pertinent factors include: \"(1) whether the defendant falls into the class of persons at whom the criminal statute was principally directed; (2) other penalties authorized by the legislature (or the Sentencing Commission); and (3) the harm caused by the defendant.\" <i>Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 223; <i>see also </i><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 337-40, 118 S.Ct. 2028; <i>Beras,</i> 183 F.3d at 29.</p>\n<p>On the first factor, we inquire whether the statute is principally directed toward defendant. Given that we take the forfeiture order to be independently based on Count Three, we consider whether section 5332, the bulk cash smuggling statute, is designed for offenders like Jose. In its USA PATRIOT Act findings, Congress recognized that \"couriers who attempt to smuggle . . . cash out of the United States are typically low-level employees of large <i>criminal organizations.</i>\" Pub.L. No. 107-56, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> § 371(a)(5), 115 Stat. at 337 (emphasis added). Here, the district court did not find that defendant's funds were not linked to other crimes, as was the case in <i>Bajakajian. See</i> 524 U.S. at 326, 118 S.Ct. 2028. Although it is true that the district court did not expressly find that the funds <i>were</i> related to illegal activities,<sup>[7]</sup> it is Jose who bears the burden of showing that the forfeiture is unconstitutional. <i>See </i><i>Ortiz-Cintrón,</i> 461 F.3d at 81-82; <i>Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 223. Indeed, defendant's far-fetched story explaining how he found the money raises serious suspicions about whether the funds were legally derived. Forfeitures based on violations of the bulk cash smuggling statute are principally directed toward money launderers, drug traffickers, tax evaders, and terrorists, as well as their couriers. <i>See</i> USA PATRIOT Act, Pub.L. No. 107-56, § 371(a)(3), (5), 115 Stat. at 337. Given the facts of this case and Jose's unlikely story, we cannot say that section 5332 is not principally designed for persons such as defendant.</p>\n<p>Turning to the second factor, Jose, like Bajakajian, faced a statutory maximum of 5 years' imprisonment. <i>See</i> 31 U.S.C. §§ 5322(a), 5332(b)(1); <i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 339 n. 14, 118 S.Ct. 2028. Jose, however, faced a tougher Guidelines sentence than Bajakajian. The maximum Guidelines sentence that could have been imposed on Jose was 18 months' imprisonment and a fine of $30,000, whereas the maximum Guidelines sentence that could have been imposed on Bajakajian was 6 months' imprisonment and a fine of only $5,000. Thus, the forfeiture at issue here is less than 4 times the maximum fine allowable under the Guidelines, whereas the forfeiture in <i>Bajakajian</i> exceeded the maximum fine under the then-mandatory Guidelines by a factor of more than 70. This undermines Jose's argument that the forfeiture order is grossly out of proportion to the gravity of his offense. <i>See </i><i>Beras,</i> 183 F.3d at 29 n. 5 (noting that <i>Bajakajian</i> \"suggests that the maximum penalties provided under the Guidelines should be given greater weight than the statute because the Guidelines take into consideration the culpability of the individual defendant\").</p>\n<p>The third factor requires us to evaluate the harm caused by defendant. We consider the harm caused by Jose's violation of section 5332, the bulk cash smuggling statute. As Congress stated in its enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, it wanted to \"emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.\" Pub.L. No. 107-56, § 371(b), 115 Stat. at 337. Further, Congress found a link between the laundering of bulk cash and various types of serious criminal activity. <i>See id.</i> § 371(a)(3), 115 Stat. at 337. It expressly tied the enforcement of section 5332 to efforts to \"break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.\" <i>Id.</i> § 371(a)(5), 115 Stat. at 337. We adhere to Congress's view that defendant's violation of the bulk cash smuggling statute constitutes a significant harm. <i>Compare </i><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 339, 118 S.Ct. 2028 (\"Failure to report [Bajakajian's] currency affected only one party, the Government, and in a relatively minor way. . . . Had his crime gone undetected, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> the Government would have been deprived only of the information that $357,144 had left the country.\").</p>\n<p>Thus far we have concluded: (1) defendant's funds may well have been linked to other criminal activities, (2) the amount of forfeiture is not grossly out of line with the maximum fine authorized by the Sentencing Guidelines, and (3) Congress has clearly expressed its belief that bulk cash smuggling is a serious offense linked to various kinds of harm. The consideration of a fourth factor makes abundantly clear that there was no error here.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court noted in <i>Bajakajian</i> that the Excessive Fines Clause was taken from the English Bill of Rights of 1689. 524 U.S. at 335, 118 S.Ct. 2028; <i>see also </i><i>Browning-Ferris Indus. of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc.,</i> 492 U.S. 257, 266-67, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 106 L.Ed.2d 219 (1989). The English Bill of Rights of 1689 was passed in response to the subversion of Magna Charta by Stuart judges who imposed excessive fines. <i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 335, 118 S.Ct. 2028. Magna Charta, in turn, required that \"amercements (the medieval predecessors of fines) should be proportioned to the offense and that they <i>should not deprive a wrongdoer of his livelihood.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added); <i>see also id.</i> at 335-36, 118 S.Ct. 2028 (\"`A Free-man shall not be amerced for a small fault, but after the manner of the fault; and for a great fault after the greatness thereof, saving to him his contenement; (2) and a Merchant likewise, saving to him his merchandise; (3) and any other's villain than ours shall be likewise amerced, saving his wainage.'\" (quoting Magna Charta, 9 Hen. III, ch. 14 (1225), 1 Stat. at Large 6-7 (1762 ed.))). Given the history behind the Excessive Fines Clause, it is appropriate to consider whether the forfeiture in question would deprive Jose of his livelihood. <i>Cf. </i><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 339-40 &amp; n. 15, 118 S.Ct. 2028 (concluding that the full forfeiture sought by the government would be grossly disproportional to the gravity of defendant's offense, but noting that defendant did not present any arguments regarding wealth, income, or deprivation of livelihood).</p>\n<p>It cannot reasonably be argued that forfeiture of the $114,948 would deprive defendant of his livelihood. As the district court noted at sentencing, \"according to [Jose's] own words, th[e] money wasn't his to start with. . . . So whether the government forfeits it or not, it is really of no consequence to him because it wasn't his to be forfeited.\" The money, by defendant's own admission, was not related to efforts to maintain his livelihood. Further, at the change of plea hearing, the government indicated that Jose's business merchandise, which was taken from him in Puerto Rico, was in the process of being sent to his wife in St. Maarten so that she could resell the goods there, in accordance with Jose's business practice. We conclude that the forfeiture order does not implicate the historical concerns underlying the Excessive Fines Clause.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that defendant has failed to show that there was error, much less error that was plain. The amount of forfeiture simply is not \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant's offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 337, 118 S.Ct. 2028.</p>\n<p>The government has requested a limited remand so that it can pursue its intention, stated at the change of plea hearing, to return to defendant the $1,400 he declared. The government plans to move to amend the district court's order to reflect the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> remaining balance of $113,548. We remand for this limited purpose. In all other respects, we affirm the district court's forfeiture order.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Jose argues that his objection at the sentencing hearing to the forfeiture of the declared $1,400 suffices to merit de novo review on appeal. This argument fails, as defendant never objected to the forfeiture on Eighth Amendment grounds before the district court.</p>\n<p>[2]  At the time, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) provided: \"The court, in imposing sentence on a person convicted of an offense in violation of section . . . 5316, . . . shall order that the person forfeit to the United States any property, real or personal, involved in such offense, or any property traceable to such property.\" 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) (1994); <i>see also </i><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 325, 118 S.Ct. 2028.</p>\n<p>[3]  For a discussion of the USA PATRIOT Act's civil forfeiture provisions for interbank accounts, see <i>United States v.

United States,</i> 409 U.S. 232, 237, 93 S.Ct. 489, 34 L.Ed.2d 438 (1972) (per curiam) (holding that customs statute requiring forfeiture of undeclared goods concealed in baggage and imposing a monetary penalty equal to value of goods imposed \"remedial rather than punitive sanctions\"). <i>But see </i><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 340-41, 118 S.Ct. 2028 (distinguishing between punishment for criminal offenses and civil <i>in rem</i> forfeitures of goods imported in violation of customs laws).</p>\n<p>[7]  After the district court announced Jose's sentence, defense counsel characterized the court as having found that the funds were \"related to a drug offense.\" The judge responded:\n</p>\n<p>I didn't say that at any moment. . . . I said that [Jose's] story . . . as to how he came about the money is hard to believe. And I am not so naive as to think that somebody would throw away $114,948 in a trash can. That is all I said. I didn't use anything about drugs, Counselor.</p>\n<p>[8]  Even if we were measuring forfeiture by section 5316, the cash reporting requirement, we would still find no violation of the Excessive Fines Clause.</p>\n\n</div>",

No. 107-56, § 371, 115 Stat. 272, 336-38 (codified as amended at 31 U.S.C. § 5332). Defendant Otilio Jose challenges the district court's forfeiture order in the amount of $114,948, arguing that it constitutes an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment. He does not challenge his straight guilty plea to counts arising from his failure to declare the amount of currency he was attempting to take with him out of the country. We hold that the forfeiture order does not constitute an excessive fine, but remand, at the request of the United States, so that the sum of $1,400 can be deducted from the amount of forfeiture.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>On August 23, 2004, Jose checked two pieces of luggage on a flight departing from Luis Muoz Marín International Airport in Puerto Rico. Jose was on his way to St. Maarten, Netherlands Antilles. Customs officers inspected Jose's checked luggage and discovered bundles of cash wrapped in tissue paper hidden in a pair of sneakers and other bundles wrapped in carbon paper hidden inside a set of bed sheets. The officers approached Jose and explained to him the currency reporting requirements for transported amounts in excess of $10,000. <i>See</i> 31 U.S.C. § 5316(a)(1)(A). Jose declared verbally and in writing that he was in possession of $1,400. In fact, the cash on Jose, and in his luggage, amounted to a hefty $114,948. Jose explained that he had found the money while visiting Puerto Rico. He said that he was at a San Juan hotel when he saw someone throw something into a trash container; that individual looked around to see if anyone had seen him and then left the area. Jose went down to the trash and picked up a bag which contained a large amount of money. He said to himself, \"This is my fortune, I found it. I put it in my bag and I go home.\" He claimed that he was unaware of any reporting requirements.</p>\n<p>Jose was arrested on August 23 and later charged in an indictment with (1) knowingly and willfully failing to file a report when he was about to transport at one time monetary instruments of more than $10,000 from a place in the United States to a place outside the United States, in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5316(a)(1)(A) (the \"cash reporting requirement\"); (2) making a materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, an agency of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a); and (3) knowingly and willfully concealing more than $10,000 in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*107</span> currency in an attempt to transport such currency from a place in the United States to a place outside the United States without filing a report as required by the Secretary of the Treasury, in violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5332(a) (the \"bulk cash smuggling statute\"). The indictment also included allegations seeking forfeiture of the $114,948 based on the offenses alleged in Counts One and Three, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 5317(c)(1)(A) and 31 U.S.C. § 5332(b)(2), respectively.</p>\n<p>On November 4, 2004, Jose entered a straight guilty plea to all three counts of the indictment. The district court advised defendant of his rights and found that he had knowingly and voluntarily waived them by pleading guilty. The court also explained to Jose that by pleading guilty he could expect the government to proceed to forfeit the money involved in the offense as a result of the violations of the cash reporting requirement and the bulk cash smuggling statute. Jose agreed except for the $1,400 he did declare, which he expected to be allowed to keep. The government clarified that it had already filed administrative proceedings to try to return the $1,400 to defendant. The government sought forfeiture of the remaining funds, which Jose had attempted to smuggle, but nothing more than that.</p>\n<p>On December 13, 2004, the government requested a preliminary order of forfeiture for the entire amount of $114,948. The government's motion cited both sections 5317(c)(1)(A) (the cash reporting requirement) and 5332(b)(2) (the bulk cash smuggling statute) as authority for the forfeiture. It attached a proposed order which referenced defendant's violation of sections 5316(a)(1)(A) and 5322. The citation to section 5322, rather than section 5332, clearly was a typographical error. The government's forfeiture argument at the sentencing hearing was based on both the cash reporting requirement and the bulk cash smuggling statute.</p>\n<p>At the hearing on December 14, 2004, the district court stated that it was not so naive as to believe defendant's story about how he came to possess the $114,948. The judge found that Jose had attempted to mislead the court, and he sentenced Jose to 18 months' imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Jose also received three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a special monetary assessment of $100 on each count. In light of defendant's financial situation, the court did not impose a fine. Judgment entered on December 14, 2004; no forfeiture order was included in the judgment, as provided for under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(3).</p>\n<p>On December 20, 2004, the government filed a motion to amend the judgment, calling the district court's attention to the fact that the judgment did not include a forfeiture order and to the outstanding issue concerning the $1,400 that Jose had declared. On December 23, 2004, the district court adopted the government's earlier proposed order (with its typographical error) and issued a preliminary order of forfeiture as to the entire amount of $114,948. The court did not amend its earlier judgment to include the forfeiture order.</p>\n<p>In December 2005, defendant's appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to <i>Anders v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107423\"><a href=\"/opinion/107423/anders-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107423\"><a href=\"/opinion/107423/anders-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On March 21, 2006, this court rejected the <i>Anders</i> brief, but granted counsel's request to withdraw. We ordered appointment of new counsel and requested briefing on (1) whether the district court erred in failing to conform with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2, (2) whether the district court erred in failing to resolve a contested issue regarding <span class=\"star-pagination\">*108</span> the amount of forfeiture, and (3) whether the forfeiture order violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of excessive fines. Present counsel for defendant has submitted a merits brief only as to the third issue outlined in our March 21 order. Accordingly, the first and second issues have been waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

In <i>Bajakajian,</i> the defendant and his family had failed to report the $357,144 in cash they were attempting to take with them out of the United States on June 9, 1994. <i>Id.</i> at 324-25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The defendant pled guilty to a charge of violating 31 U.S.C. § 5316(a)(1)(A) and elected to have a bench trial on the forfeiture count brought under 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1).<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span>. The district court found that, under section 982(a)(1), the entire $357,144 was forfeitable because it was \"involved in\" the offense. <i>Id.</i> at 325-26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nonetheless, the court ordered the forfeiture of only $15,000, believing that full forfeiture would violate the Excessive Fines Clause. <i>Id.</i> at 326. On the government's appeal, the Ninth Circuit held that forfeiture of currency pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) was per se unconstitutional because unreported currency was not an \"instrumentality\" of the crime of failure to report. <i>United States v.

Pub.L. No. 107-56, §§ 319, 371, 372, 115 Stat. at 311-12, 336-39 (amending 18 U.S.C. §§ 981 and 982, 21 U.S.C. § 853, and 31 U.S.C. § 5317, and creating 31 U.S.C. § 5332).<sup>[3]</sup> The USA PATRIOT Act inserted a criminal forfeiture provision in 31 U.S.C. § 5317(c)(1)(A) for property involved in a violation of 31 U.S.C. § 5316 and correspondingly deleted the reference to 31 U.S.C. § 5316 in 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1).<sup>[4]</sup><i>Id.</i> § 372, 115 Stat. at 338-39.</p>\n<p>The Act also defined the new crime of \"bulk cash smuggling\" at 31 U.S.C. § 5332. <i>Id.</i> § 371, 115 Stat. at 337-38. Section 5332(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Whoever, with the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement under section 5316, knowingly conceals more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments on the person of such individual or in any conveyance, article of luggage, merchandise, or other container, and transports or transfers or attempts to transport or transfer such currency or monetary instruments from a place within the United States to a place outside of the United States, or from a place outside the United States to a place within the United States, shall be guilty of a currency smuggling offense <span class=\"star-pagination\">*110</span> and subject to punishment pursuant to subsection (b).</blockquote>\n<p>Section 5332(b)(2), in turn, provides for the forfeiture of \"any property, real or personal,\" involved in the violation of section 5332(a)(1).</p>\n<p>Although the elements of the offense defined at section 5332(a)(1) largely track those of the offense defined at section 5316(a)(1),<sup>[5]</sup> section 5332 places its emphasis on the <i>knowing concealment</i> of \"more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments,\" rather than the <i>requirement to file a report,</i> as in section 5316. Indeed, Congress attached to section 5332 a note expressing its finding that</p>\n<blockquote>[t]he current penalties for violations of the currency reporting requirements are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the laundering of criminal proceeds. In particular, in cases where the only criminal violation under current law is a <i>reporting offense,</i> the law does not adequately provide for the confiscation of smuggled currency. <i>In contrast, if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling offense.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>USA PATRIOT Act, Pub.L. No. 107-56, § 371(a)(6), 115 Stat. at 337 (emphases added).</p>\n<p>Congress was explicit that its purposes in enacting section 5332 were \"(1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a criminal offense; (2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of the smuggling offense; and (3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.\" <i>Id.</i> § 371(b), 115 Stat. at 337. Congress was particularly concerned that the transportation and smuggling of large sums of cash was a \"warning sign[] of drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.\" <i>Id.</i> § 371(a)(3), 115 Stat. at 337. Further, because couriers who attempt to smuggle cash out of the country are typically low-level employees of criminal organizations, Congress believed that \"only the confiscation of the smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.\" <i>Id.</i> § 371(a)(5), 115 Stat. at 337.</p>\n<p>Congress, in enacting section 5332, responded to <i>Bajakajian</i> in a way that it believed would, in most circumstances, constitutionally permit the full forfeiture of currency not reported to authorities as required by section 5316. The Report of the House Committee on Financial Services stated:</p>\n<blockquote>The Committee believes . . . that bulk cash smuggling is an inherently more serious offense than simply failing to file a Customs report. Because the constitutionality of a forfeiture is dependent on the \"gravity of the offense\" under <i>Bajakajian,</i> it is anticipated that the full forfeiture of smuggled money will withstand constitutional scrutiny in most cases.</blockquote>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 107-250(I), at 53 (2001). Section 5332 makes clear that Congress <span class=\"star-pagination\">*111</span> has now prohibited what it calls \"bulk cash smuggling,\" and that it considers this to be a very serious offense. Congress has thus tipped the forfeiture equation in favor of the prosecution in bulk cash smuggling cases. <i>Bajakajian</i> itself stated that \"judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense belong in the first instance to the legislature.\" 524 U.S. at 336, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Next, we consider whether the forfeiture of the $114,948 would be \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant's offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 337, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span>. For Eighth Amendment excessive fine purposes, pertinent factors include: \"(1) whether the defendant falls into the class of persons at whom the criminal statute was principally directed; (2) other penalties authorized by the legislature (or the Sentencing Commission); and (3) the harm caused by the defendant.\" <i>Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 223; <i>see also </i><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 337-40, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span>; <i>Beras,</i> 183 F.3d at 29.</p>\n<p>On the first factor, we inquire whether the statute is principally directed toward defendant. Given that we take the forfeiture order to be independently based on Count Three, we consider whether section 5332, the bulk cash smuggling statute, is designed for offenders like Jose. In its USA PATRIOT Act findings, Congress recognized that \"couriers who attempt to smuggle . . . cash out of the United States are typically low-level employees of large <i>criminal organizations.</i>\" Pub.L. No. 107-56, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*112</span> § 371(a)(5), 115 Stat. at 337 (emphasis added). Here, the district court did not find that defendant's funds were not linked to other crimes, as was the case in <i>Bajakajian. See</i> 524 U.S. at 326, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span>. Although it is true that the district court did not expressly find that the funds <i>were</i> related to illegal activities,<sup>[7]</sup> it is Jose who bears the burden of showing that the forfeiture is unconstitutional. <i>See </i><i>Ortiz-Cintrón,</i> 461 F.3d at 81-82; <i>Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d at 223. Indeed, defendant's far-fetched story explaining how he found the money raises serious suspicions about whether the funds were legally derived. Forfeitures based on violations of the bulk cash smuggling statute are principally directed toward money launderers, drug traffickers, tax evaders, and terrorists, as well as their couriers. <i>See</i> USA PATRIOT Act, Pub.L. No. 107-56, § 371(a)(3), (5), 115 Stat. at 337. Given the facts of this case and Jose's unlikely story, we cannot say that section 5332 is not principally designed for persons such as defendant.</p>\n<p>Turning to the second factor, Jose, like Bajakajian, faced a statutory maximum of 5 years' imprisonment. <i>See</i> 31 U.S.C. §§ 5322(a), 5332(b)(1); <i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 339 n. 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span>. Jose, however, faced a tougher Guidelines sentence than Bajakajian. The maximum Guidelines sentence that could have been imposed on Jose was 18 months' imprisonment and a fine of $30,000, whereas the maximum Guidelines sentence that could have been imposed on Bajakajian was 6 months' imprisonment and a fine of only $5,000. Thus, the forfeiture at issue here is less than 4 times the maximum fine allowable under the Guidelines, whereas the forfeiture in <i>Bajakajian</i> exceeded the maximum fine under the then-mandatory Guidelines by a factor of more than 70. This undermines Jose's argument that the forfeiture order is grossly out of proportion to the gravity of his offense. <i>See </i><i>Beras,</i> 183 F.3d at 29 n. 5 (noting that <i>Bajakajian</i> \"suggests that the maximum penalties provided under the Guidelines should be given greater weight than the statute because the Guidelines take into consideration the culpability of the individual defendant\").</p>\n<p>The third factor requires us to evaluate the harm caused by defendant. We consider the harm caused by Jose's violation of section 5332, the bulk cash smuggling statute. As Congress stated in its enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, it wanted to \"emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.\" Pub.L. No. 107-56, § 371(b), 115 Stat. at 337. Further, Congress found a link between the laundering of bulk cash and various types of serious criminal activity. <i>See id.</i> § 371(a)(3), 115 Stat. at 337. It expressly tied the enforcement of section 5332 to efforts to \"break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.\" <i>Id.</i> § 371(a)(5), 115 Stat. at 337. We adhere to Congress's view that defendant's violation of the bulk cash smuggling statute constitutes a significant harm. <i>Compare </i><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 339, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span> (\"Failure to report [Bajakajian's] currency affected only one party, the Government, and in a relatively minor way. . . . Had his crime gone undetected, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*113</span> the Government would have been deprived only of the information that $357,144 had left the country.\").</p>\n<p>Thus far we have concluded: (1) defendant's funds may well have been linked to other criminal activities, (2) the amount of forfeiture is not grossly out of line with the maximum fine authorized by the Sentencing Guidelines, and (3) Congress has clearly expressed its belief that bulk cash smuggling is a serious offense linked to various kinds of harm. The consideration of a fourth factor makes abundantly clear that there was no error here.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court noted in <i>Bajakajian</i> that the Excessive Fines Clause was taken from the English Bill of Rights of 1689. 524 U.S. at 335, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span> (1989). The English Bill of Rights of 1689 was passed in response to the subversion of Magna Charta by Stuart judges who imposed excessive fines. <i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 335, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span>. Magna Charta, in turn, required that \"amercements (the medieval predecessors of fines) should be proportioned to the offense and that they <i>should not deprive a wrongdoer of his livelihood.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added); <i>see also id.</i> at 335-36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

III, ch. 14 (1225), 1 Stat. at Large 6-7 (1762 ed.))). Given the history behind the Excessive Fines Clause, it is appropriate to consider whether the forfeiture in question would deprive Jose of his livelihood. <i>Cf. </i><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 339-40 &amp; n. 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the district court noted at sentencing, \"according to [Jose's] own words, th[e] money wasn't his to start with. . . . So whether the government forfeits it or not, it is really of no consequence to him because it wasn't his to be forfeited.\" The money, by defendant's own admission, was not related to efforts to maintain his livelihood. Further, at the change of plea hearing, the government indicated that Jose's business merchandise, which was taken from him in Puerto Rico, was in the process of being sent to his wife in St. Maarten so that she could resell the goods there, in accordance with Jose's business practice. We conclude that the forfeiture order does not implicate the historical concerns underlying the Excessive Fines Clause.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that defendant has failed to show that there was error, much less error that was plain. The amount of forfeiture simply is not \"grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant's offense.\" <i>Id.</i> at 337, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>The government has requested a limited remand so that it can pursue its intention, stated at the change of plea hearing, to return to defendant the $1,400 he declared. The government plans to move to amend the district court's order to reflect the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*114</span> remaining balance of $113,548. We remand for this limited purpose. In all other respects, we affirm the district court's forfeiture order.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Jose argues that his objection at the sentencing hearing to the forfeiture of the declared $1,400 suffices to merit de novo review on appeal. This argument fails, as defendant never objected to the forfeiture on Eighth Amendment grounds before the district court.</p>\n<p>[2]  At the time, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) provided: \"The court, in imposing sentence on a person convicted of an offense in violation of section . . . 5316, . . . shall order that the person forfeit to the United States any property, real or personal, involved in such offense, or any property traceable to such property.\" 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) (1994); <i>see also </i><i>Bajakajian,</i> 524 U.S. at 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
