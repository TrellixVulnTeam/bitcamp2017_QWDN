Bryan's no-\n     deference rationale is inconsistent with the plain\n     language of sections 2254(d) and (e), which require our\n     deference to all state court factfinding which is not\n     \"unreasonable.\" See Lambert v.

Absent\n\nevidence that, if accepted, could overcome the deference due to the\n\nstate-court finding, there is nothing to be tried in an evidentiary\n\nhearing.\"\n\n     On page 12, lines 25-27, replace the final sentence on the\n\npage with \"This was hardly evidence that the state finding was\n\nwrong.\"\n\f",
