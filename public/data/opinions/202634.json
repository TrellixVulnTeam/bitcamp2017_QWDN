Dimler for appellant.\n     Jack B. Patrick, Senior Litigation Counsel, Fraud Section,\nCriminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, with whom Thomas P.\nColantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        February 16, 2007\n\n\n______________________\n     *Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. The primary claim in this criminal\n\nappeal is the familiar one that a conspiracy conviction was flawed\n\nbecause the facts revealed multiple conspiracies rather than the\n\nsingle overarching scheme that was charged. The indictment against\n\ndefendant-appellant William P. Trainor, charging both conspiracy to\n\ncommit wire fraud and multiple episodes of the substantive crime,\n\nstemmed from his role in fraudulently securing mortgages on two\n\nadjacent properties owned by his family in Maine.   Asserting that\n\nthe conduct related to each property was separate, appellant argues\n\nthat the conspiracy count – which treated the two ventures as a\n\nsingle scheme – should have been dismissed as duplicitous.      He\n\nalternatively argues prejudicial variance, contending that the\n\nevidence presented at trial showed separate schemes and thus was\n\ninsufficient to prove the single charged conspiracy.       He also\n\nclaims that spillover in evidence between the two schemes denied\n\nhim a fair trial on the wire fraud charges, requiring that those\n\nconvictions also be set aside.\n\n          We find no merit in these contentions or his related\n\nevidentiary claim.   The jury was properly instructed to consider\n\nwhether a single conspiracy had been proven, and the record amply\n\nsupports its verdict.   We therefore affirm appellant’s conviction\n\non all counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f                                     I.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n           Appellant Trainor and his family owned two lakeside\n\nproperties – 12 Trainor Road and 16 Trainor Road – in Lebanon,\n\nMaine.    Appellant allegedly orchestrated a complex series of\n\nfinancial transactions involving sham deposits, altered checks,\n\nforged   signatures   and   myriad    other   false   representations   to\n\nfraudulently elicit mortgage funds from two different financial\n\ninstitutions.   We present the facts as the jury could have found\n\nthem, reserving additional detail for our discussion of defendant’s\n\nclaims of error.   See United States v. Byrne, 435 F.3d 16, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n           1. The Mortgage on 12 Trainor Road\n\n           In the summer of 2000, Trainor approached co-defendant\n\nJohn DesMarais, a family friend and carpenter who had done work for\n\nhim,1 about buying the house and land at 12 Trainor Road, which was\n\nheld in the name of Trainor’s wife.        DesMarais earned only $40,000\n\na year and had filed for bankruptcy in 1995, but Trainor offered to\n\n\n\n     1\n       DesMarais and a third alleged co-conspirator, Donald Smith,\neach pled guilty to a single wire fraud count. As part of their\nplea agreements, the government agreed to dismiss the other charges\npending against them at the time of their sentencing. Both men\ntestified that they hoped their cooperation would lead to more\nlenient sentences.     The evidence presented by the government\ndepicted Trainor as the more experienced and sophisticated\nbusinessman who led the two younger men into the scheme and, at\ntimes, deceived them as well as others about the nature of his\nactivities.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fhelp       him   secure     financing.    The   original   purchase   and   sale\n\nagreement showed a sale price of $550,000 and an initial deposit of\n\n$10,000.         DesMarais had not, in fact, given such a deposit.           He\n\npreviously had purchased a boat from Trainor for $6,000, and\n\nTrainor told DesMarais he would credit the money from the boat\n\npurchase toward the property deal.2\n\n                 In helping DesMarais obtain a $400,000 mortgage from\n\nChase Manhattan Mortgage (“Chase”), appellant took various steps\n\naimed at creating the false impression that DesMarais had the\n\nresources        to   buy    the   property.    For   example,   at   Trainor’s\n\nsuggestion, DesMarais borrowed $20,000 from an acquaintance, Don\n\nWalden, which DesMarais used in part to purchase stock in a company\n\nassociated with Trainor.3           DesMarais understood that, like the boat\n\npurchase, the money for the stock would be considered a deposit on\n\nthe property.          Walden’s money also was used to fund a $5,240\n\npersonal check written to Trainor’s wife, Geraldine, as a deposit.\n\nDesMarais subsequently told a Chase loan officer, David Barney,\n\nthat he planned to finance the property purchase by selling stock\n\n\n\n       2\n       DesMarais acknowledged at trial that he did not fully\nunderstand why Trainor was re-allocating the money he paid for the\nboat to the home purchase, but he assumed Trainor was doing it to\nhelp DesMarais buy the house. The prosecutor suggested to the jury\nthat Trainor was willing to “invest” the $6,000 to facilitate the\nmortgage – which would produce substantially more cash.\n       3\n      Following Trainor’s instructions, DesMarais wired $7,500 to\nan individual in Chile to buy stock in Rapid Diagnostics, a\nprivately held company in which Trainor was involved.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fworth $157,500.     DesMarais testified that the stock value was set\n\nby Trainor, and he admitted at trial that he did not own stock of\n\nthat value.      During the loan process, DesMarais did not disclose\n\nthat he had borrowed money to finance the down-payment, a fact that\n\nwould have disinclined the mortgage company to issue the loan\n\nbecause an outlay of cash is considered some security against\n\ndefault.\n\n            As   part   of   the   loan    application     process,    Trainor\n\nsubmitted appraisals for the property that the jury could have\n\nfound were inflated.     See infra note 18.        Also among the documents\n\nprovided to Chase was a memo stating that DesMarais had exchanged\n\nhis original stock for shares of another company, and that he had\n\na buyer ready to purchase that stock for $106,250.            The memo bore\n\nthe heading “From the Office of John Desmarais” and was signed with\n\nthe initials “J.D.” DesMarais testified, however, that he had not\n\ncreated the document, that it was not his handwriting on it, and\n\nthat he never spelled his last name with a lower-case “m.”              Barney\n\nalso was sent a revised purchase and sale agreement, which showed\n\na new sale price of $500,000 and referenced $22,500 in deposits\n\nthat DesMarais was to have paid by September 30, 2000.              DesMarais\n\ntestified that he did not see the revised purchase and sale\n\nagreement   until    after   his   arrest,   and    also   stated     that   the\n\nsignature that appears on it – his name – was not written by him.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f           On December 11, 2000, the mortgage company received\n\nanother memo purportedly from DesMarais, along with photocopies of\n\ncancelled checks that were meant to be evidence of his down-\n\npayments on the property.        The evidence showed, however, that some\n\nof the photocopied checks had been altered.4            On December 21, the\n\ncompany received a faxed copy of DesMarais’s bank statement showing\n\ndeposits   of    $18,000   and    $87,500    and   an   account   balance   of\n\n$106,690.83 – “proof” that DesMarais had sufficient funds of his\n\nown for the loan to close.          The two deposited checks had been\n\nwritten by Trainor, however, on an account of “Fradco Holdings,\n\nInc.” that at the time contained only $7.65.              At the closing on\n\nDecember 22, Trainor provided the $91,855.69 that was due from the\n\nborrower by using another Fradco Holdings check, this time for\n\n$75,000,   and   a   cashier’s    check    for   $16,855.69.      Trainor   had\n\npurchased the cashier’s check with money he obtained from Walden;\n\nhe gave Walden in return a $17,000 Fradco Holdings check that\n\nWalden was told he should hold off on cashing until he heard back\n\nfrom Trainor.\n\n           Chase provided $390,083.90 for the closing, and that\n\nmoney was disbursed based on directions from Trainor, who stated in\n\n\n\n     4\n       For example, the original version of Check No. 1860,\nobtained from the bank and introduced by the government, was made\nout to Bill Trainor Jr. and noted on the memo line that it was for\nthe purchase of Rapid Diagnostics stock; the memo line on the faxed\nversion stated that it was a deposit, and the “Jr.” no longer\nappeared on the payee line.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fhis letter to the mortgage company that he and his wife were\n\ndonating most of the sale proceeds.    The specified disbursements\n\nincluded a $120,000 payment wired to the Fradco Holdings account,\n\nwhich covered the checks that Trainor recently had written on that\n\naccount: the $17,000 to Walden for the cashier’s check, the $75,000\n\npaid at closing, and the $18,000 check deposited into DesMarais’s\n\naccount.5   Trainor put a stop payment order on the $87,500 Fradco\n\nHoldings check that also had been deposited into DesMarais’s\n\naccount. Another $20,000 was used to repay Walden for his original\n\nloan to DesMarais.\n\n            DesMarais moved into the house at 12 Trainor Road and\n\nmanaged to make the loan payments for eighteen months before the\n\nbank foreclosed on the property.\n\n            2. The Mortgage on 16 Trainor Road\n\n            Within weeks after the closing on 12 Trainor Road,\n\nTrainor approached DesMarais with a new proposal.     He suggested\n\nthat DesMarais become involved in a plan to purchase the adjoining\n\nfour-acre plot at 16 Trainor Road, which was held in the name of\n\nTrainor’s son, and to build a custom home on the property; the sale\n\nof the house would generate funds to help DesMarais afford his loan\n\npayments on 12 Trainor Road.    DesMarais introduced Trainor to his\n\n\n     5\n       Included in the requested disbursements was $20,000 to a\n“Dr. Anderson” who “runs a clinic and a special education program\nfor problem children.” A business associate of Trainor’s, Robert\nJones, testified that Trainor paid that sum to his ex-wife, Diana\nAnderson, as an “alimony or support payment[]” for Jones.\n\n                                 -7-\n\ffriend, builder Donald Smith – the third co-conspirator in this\n\ncase – and the discussions eventually led to DesMarais bowing out\n\nof the financing for 16 Trainor Road because of his inability to\n\nborrow any more money.     Trainor and Smith agreed that Smith would\n\nserve as the buyer, and DesMarais would receive a $10,000 finder’s\n\nfee from the loan proceeds.\n\n           Trainor again provided a purchase and sale agreement,\n\nwhich listed the sale price as $250,000 and stated that the\n\npurchase   would   be   accomplished   with    a   $50,000   deposit   and    a\n\n$200,000 mortgage. Smith and Trainor had agreed, however, that the\n\n“real” sale price for the land was $130,000 and that Smith did not\n\nhave to make the $50,000 deposit.        Smith gave Trainor $20,000, but\n\nunderstood that he would be reimbursed when the loan closed.                 On\n\nApril 20, 2001, a deed was executed showing transfer of the\n\nproperty to Smith.\n\n           Meanwhile, Trainor had interested Walden – the individual\n\nwho had lent money to DesMarais for the earlier purchase – in\n\ninvesting in Trainor’s businesses.            When Walden became nervous\n\nabout his investments, Trainor offered him a security interest in\n\nthe 16 Trainor Road property as a “line of credit” up to a $200,000\n\ninvestment.   In essence, this arrangement meant that Walden would\n\nbecome the mortgage-holder on 16 Trainor Road, with the security\n\ninterest in the land protecting him in case his investments with\n\nTrainor turned out badly.     The deal allowed Trainor to create the\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fimpression that Smith had purchased the property with a temporary\n\nmortgage    funded   by   Walden;       Trainor   prepared   a   mortgage     and\n\npromissory note in which Smith agreed to pay Walden $200,000.\n\n            Using the Walden “mortgage” as evidence that $200,000 had\n\nchanged hands in his purchase of the property, Smith submitted an\n\napplication to Citizens Mortgage Corporation (“Citizens”) for a\n\n$419,000    construction   loan     –    $200,000   intended     to   repay   the\n\noriginal mortgage and the remainder to finance construction of the\n\nhouse.     Smith told the loan officer that the house would be a\n\nvacation home rather than a custom investment house – a deception\n\nnecessary to gain approval for the loan. The mortgage company also\n\nwas deceived about the $50,000 down payment, another prerequisite\n\nto its loan.    Trainor sent an email message to the loan officer\n\nconfirming the sale price of $250,000 and stating that he had\n\nreceived $20,000 from Smith.        He also reported that the remaining\n\n$30,000 would come from DesMarais’s payment for an easement on the\n\nproperty.    Smith testified at trial that the representations about\n\nthe sales price and easement were false.\n\n            A construction loan in the amount of $400,000 closed on\n\nOctober 19, 2001, but only the initial $200,000 was disbursed at\n\nthat time.    Trainor provided instructions directing that $108,300\n\nbe paid to Walden and that the remainder be given to Trainor in\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\ffive checks totaling $91,700.6      Two of those checks went to Smith;\n\nhe was given a check for $20,000 to repay him for his original\n\n“deposit,” and he received another check for $33,870.71. DesMarais\n\nreceived his $10,000 “finder’s fee.”         About two weeks after the\n\nclosing, Walden was convinced to re-invest most of the proceeds he\n\nhad received from the loan in another Trainor deal,7 so Trainor\n\nended up benefitting from more than $130,000 of the Citizens\n\nmortgage funds.\n\n            3. The Lee Transaction\n\n            During   the   same   time   period   in   which   Trainor   was\n\narranging the transaction with Smith, he also transferred 16\n\nTrainor Road to an unrelated individual in a multi-party settlement\n\nof debts.    The recipient of the property, Nevada attorney James\n\nLee, had represented a client, Robert Jones,8 who was unable to pay\n\nattorney’s fees totaling more than $200,000.           Trainor owed Jones a\n\nsubstantial amount of money, and he offered to pay off his debt by\n\ntransferring property in Maine to Lee – thereby taking care of\n\nJones’s attorney’s fee problem.      Lee agreed to the deal, intending\n\nto obtain a loan on the property and then sell it.\n\n\n     6\n       The amount paid to Walden was what he had invested with\nTrainor, plus $500 that the two men treated as interest.\n     7\n       On November 5, 2001, Walden wired $100,000 to                 Rapid\nDiagnostics, which he understood to be Trainor’s company.\n     8\n       Jones was the individual whose ex-wife received $20,000 of\nthe proceeds from the 12 Trainor Road mortgage proceeds. See supra\nnote 5.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f          Between February and April 2001, Trainor arranged for the\n\nfiling of several documents relating to Lee’s purchase of 16\n\nTrainor Road: a deed showing sale of the property to the “Law\n\nOffices of James J. Lee”; a “lien certificate” claiming a lien\n\nagainst the property based on purported obligations to various\n\nindividuals and businesses, including Fradco Holdings; and a lien\n\nrelease that purportedly transferred the property from Lee back to\n\nTrainor’s son.9   Lee was unaware of the lien transactions – which\n\n\"returned\" the property to Trainor so the sale to Smith could occur\n\n– and he testified that when he discovered that activity,10 “I think\n\nwe contacted the authorities.”     An investigation followed.\n\nB. Procedural Background\n\n          Trainor,   DesMarais,    and   Smith   were   charged   in   an\n\nindictment with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and multiple counts of wire fraud, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343.11     As noted earlier, DesMarais and\n\n\n     9\n       Both the lien certificate and lien release stated that, in\nfiling the documents, Trainor was acting “in his capacity as Agent\nfor the parties.”\n     10\n       Lee previously had become aware of the building permit that\nhad been issued for the property and called Smith, whose name\nappeared on the permit as the contractor. Smith testified that he\nwas “totally confused” by Lee’s claim that he owned the property,\nand he tried multiple times, unsuccessfully, to reach Trainor.\n     11\n       DesMarais and Trainor were charged in all seven wire fraud\ncounts; Smith was charged with the four counts of wire fraud\nrelating to the 16 Trainor Road mortgage.     Each count involves\neither the transmission of allegedly fraudulent information about\none of the two properties or the wiring of funds (closing costs or\n\n                                  -11-\n\fSmith entered into plea agreements with the government, and each\n\npled guilty to a single count of wire fraud.              Trainor filed a\n\nmotion to dismiss the conspiracy count and to sever Counts Two\n\nthrough Four – relating to 12 Trainor Road – from Counts Five\n\nthrough Eight – relating to 16 Trainor Road.              The motion was\n\ndenied, and Trainor was convicted by a jury of conspiracy and five\n\ncounts of wire fraud.12\n\n               The district court sentenced Trainor to a 60-month term\n\nof imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release.\n\nThe court also imposed an assessment of $600 and restitution,\n\nshared jointly and severally with DesMarais and Smith, in the\n\namount    of    $202,895.84.13   On   appeal,   Trainor   sets   out   four\n\ncontentions: (1) the district court erred in refusing to dismiss\n\nthe conspiracy count for duplicity; (2) the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to sever the wire fraud counts pertaining to\n\n12 Trainor Road from the counts pertaining to 16 Trainor Road; (3)\n\nbecause the evidence at trial showed multiple conspiracies rather\n\nthan one, variance occurred and his conviction on Count 1, which\n\ncharged a single conspiracy, lacked sufficient support in the\n\n\n\nloan proceeds) into or out of an account Trainor controlled.\n     12\n       The district court dismissed Counts Seven and Eight at the\nclose of the government’s case.\n     13\n       The court ordered $106,895.84 restitution to Chase Manhattan\nMortgage Corp. and $96,000 restitution to Stewart Title Guaranty\nCorp.\n\n                                   -12-\n\frecord; and (4) the court abused its discretion in requiring\n\nredaction of the listing price for 12 Trainor Road from a real\n\nestate brochure admitted as an exhibit.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           Appellant’s counsel acknowledged at oral argument that\n\nhis client’s first three claims of error reduce to two primary\n\npoints: the record mandates a conclusion that two conspiracies\n\nexisted, rather than one, and the spillover in evidence concerning\n\nthose separate transactions injected unfair prejudice into his\n\ntrial.    Our conclusion that appellant is wrong as to the first of\n\nthese contentions leads inevitably to the failure of the second.14\n\nA. Conspiracy, Duplicity and Variance\n\n           A claim that the government improperly has characterized\n\na series of allegedly unlawful transactions as a single enterprise\n\ncan implicate both the doctrine of “duplicity” – the joining of two\n\nor more distinct offenses in a single count of an indictment, see,\n\ne.g., United States v. Verrecchia, 196 F.3d 294, 297 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), and the doctrine of “variance” – the presentation at trial\n\nof evidence that varies materially from the crime charged in the\n\nindictment, see, e.g., United States v. Balthazard, 360 F.3d 309,\n\n315 (1st Cir. 2004).    Trainor asserts both here.   He claims that\n\nthe indictment’s allegations reflect a “surgical division between\n\n\n\n     14\n        Counsel also acknowledged that his claim of prejudicial\nspillover would fail if a single conspiracy were properly charged.\n\n                                -13-\n\fthe two sets of charges” and that Count One thus improperly joins\n\nthem in a single alleged conspiracy.               In addition, he maintains\n\nthat the evidence produced at trial proved “two different and\n\ndisconnected conspiracies.”\n\n             Appellant argues, in other words, that the indictment\n\nalone establishes reversible error on the conspiracy count because\n\nthe two conspiracies were improperly joined in a single count, but\n\nthat,     even   if   we   reject    the    duplicity   claim,   the   conspiracy\n\nconviction       nonetheless    is    defective    because   the   evidence    as\n\npresented at trial depicted two separate conspiracies.                 He further\n\nargues that error of either type requires that we reverse the\n\njury’s verdicts on all counts because of the prejudice resulting\n\nfrom trying the two transactions together.15\n\n\n\n\n     15\n        A subsidiary claim of error is that the district court\nabused its discretion in refusing to sever the wire fraud counts\nrelating to 12 Trainor Road from those relating to 16 Trainor Road.\nA defendant may be entitled to severance under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 14(a) if joinder of offenses (or defendants)\nwould be prejudicial. United States v. Boulanger, 444 F.3d 76, 87\n(1st Cir. 2006). Given our conclusion that the government properly\nalleged and proved a single conspiracy, this claim is unavailing;\nall of the alleged acts of wire fraud were within that conspiracy\nand thus necessarily a part of the same case.         Moreover, as\nrevealed by our discussion of harmless error in Section B, we would\nreject the severance claim even if we accepted appellant’s multiple\nconspiracy theory. See infra pp. 22-24; see also Boulanger, 444\nF.3d at 88 (“[W]e see no prejudice beyond the type of ‘standard\nfare [that exists] whenever counts involving discrete incidents are\nlinked in a single indictment. We have repeatedly held that such\na garden variety side effect, without more, is insufficient to\nrequire severance.’”) (second alteration in original) (citation\nomitted).\n\n                                           -14-\n\f          We find it unnecessary in this case to discuss duplicity\n\nseparately.   Appellant does not argue that the facts presented at\n\ntrial differed from the factual allegations in the indictment –\n\nonly that these facts, as alleged and proven, established two\n\nconspiracies rather than one.    Our conclusion that the evidence\n\nsufficiently supported the jury’s verdict on Count One as alleged\n\n– i.e., that appellant participated in a single, overarching\n\nconspiracy – necessarily dooms his contention that the indictment\n\nwas fatally flawed.   This is so because, in rejecting his variance\n\nclaim, we also are implicitly concluding that the facts set out in\n\nthe indictment – which mirror the facts proven at trial – describe\n\na scenario that is permissibly viewed as a single conspiracy. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Mastelotto, 717 F.2d 1238, 1244 (9th Cir.\n\n1983), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Miller, 471\n\nU.S. 130, 134-36 (1985) (“[T]he question for review is simply\n\nwhether the indictment may be read to allege a single unified\n\nscheme in each count.”).   We therefore address the legality of the\n\nconspiracy conviction solely as an issue of variance.16\n\n\n     16\n        Proceeding in this fashion here does not compromise the\nconcerns   underlying    the   prohibition    against   duplicitous\nindictments. The primary “vice of duplicity is that a jury may\nfind [a] defendant guilty on the count without having reached a\nunanimous verdict on the commission of any particular offense,”\nUnited States v. Huguenin, 950 F.2d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 1991) (per\ncuriam) (describing holding in United States v. Saleh, 875 F.2d\n535, 537 (6th Cir. 1989)); see also Verrecchia, 196 F.3d at 297,\nwhich in turn may prejudice a later double jeopardy defense, United\nStates v. Morse, 785 F.2d 771, 774 (9th Cir. 1986). Here, however,\nthe fact that the jury returned guilty verdicts on all wire fraud\n\n                                -15-\n\f          In    assessing   whether   the   government’s   case   varied\n\nmaterially from the crime charged in the indictment, \"the initial\n\nquestion – and the only one that we need to reach here – is one of\n\nevidentiary sufficiency.\" United States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1,\n\n7 (1st Cir. 2003); see also    United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761,\n\n773 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting United      States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855,\n\n858 (1st Cir. 1987)).17\n\n          [W]e employ the same framework that we employ\n          in   connection    with   other   sufficiency\n          challenges in criminal cases: we “canvass the\n          evidence (direct and circumstantial) in the\n          light most agreeable to the prosecution and\n          decide whether that evidence, including all\n          plausible inferences extractable therefrom,\n          enables a rational factfinder to conclude\n          beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\n          committed the charged crime.”\n\nPerez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 7 (quoting United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d\n\n490, 494 (1st   Cir. 1997)); see also Balthazard, 360 F.3d at 315.\n\nSpecifically,    when   the   question      is   “‘the   singleness   or\n\nmultiplicities of the conspiratorial relationships,’” United States\n\nv. Morrow, 39 F.3d 1228, 1234 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting American Law\n\n\ncounts assures that Trainor was deemed responsible for the conduct\nsurrounding both mortgages. Appellant also had ample “notice of\nthe nature and cause of the proceedings against him[] so that he\n[could] effectively prepare a defense.” Huguenin, 950 F.2d at 26\n(citing 8 Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 8.03[1]). Similar concerns\nunderlie the variance doctrine, reinforcing the notion that we need\nnot separately discuss appellant's duplicity claim. See infra at\n22-23 & note 21.\n     17\n       Additional questions must be addressed only if the evidence\nis not sufficient \"to permit a jury to find the . . . agreement\nthat the indictment charges.\" Glenn, 828 F.2d at 858.\n\n                                 -16-\n\fInstitute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries 423 (1985)), we\n\nconsider all relevant circumstances and focus on such factors as\n\n“whether the alleged conspirators shared a common purpose, whether\n\ntheir actions demonstrated interdependency, and the extent to which\n\nparticipants overlapped during the life of the alleged conspiracy.”\n\nBalthazard, 360 F.3d at 315; see also, e.g.,           Perez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d\n\nat 7.   “At the end of the day, a defendant cannot succeed with a\n\nsufficiency challenge ‘as long as a plausible reading of the record\n\nsupports the jury’s implied finding that he knowingly participated\n\nin the charged conspiracy.’”     Balthazard, 360 F.3d at 315 (quoting\n\nPerez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d at 7).\n\n          Such is the case here.         The government alleged a scheme\n\nin which appellant and his co-defendants conspired to enrich\n\nthemselves   and   others   by   securing    mortgages     based   on   false\n\nrepresentations.     From the evidence presented at trial, the jury\n\nreasonably   could   conclude    that,    from   the   beginning,   Trainor\n\nanticipated using both of his family’s Trainor Road properties to\n\neffectuate the scheme.      He initiated the second deal on the heels\n\nof the closing for the first property, proposing DesMarais’s\n\npurchase of 16 Trainor Road as, in essence, a method of obtaining\n\nadditional financing for the purchase of 12 Trainor Road. Although\n\nthere was no evidence that DesMarais initially shared Trainor’s\n\nlong-range vision, the jury rationally could find that DesMarais\n\nagreed to extend the original conspiracy to protect his interest in\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f12 Trainor Road, and that he did so by recruiting partners to\n\npurchase 16 Trainor Road. Similarly, while Smith was uninvolved in\n\nthe first phase of the alleged conspiracy, the evidence of his\n\nfriendship with DesMarais and his presumed awareness of DesMarais’s\n\nneed for cash permitted the jury to find that Smith knew from the\n\noutset   of    his    participation     that    the     unorthodox   financial\n\narrangements that Trainor proposed – e.g., selling the property for\n\n$130,000 while seeking a $200,000 mortgage – were part of the\n\nlarger   scheme      involving   both     pieces   of    property.        Smith’s\n\nacquiescence in DesMarais’s role as a silent partner in the second\n\ndeal – as the recipient of a finder’s fee – reinforces the\n\ninference that Smith knew the 16 Trainor Road transaction was\n\nintended, at least in part, to prop up the original deception.                 The\n\ncircumstances were thus readily susceptible to a finding of shared\n\npurpose among the three charged co-conspirators.\n\n           Moreover, the collaborators’ overlapping participation is\n\non its own a significant factor.             DesMarais was a key player in\n\nboth deals, serving as the central co-conspirator in the first\n\nenterprise and playing an important role in the second transaction\n\nby bringing in Smith.        For his efforts, he was rewarded with the\n\n$10,000 fee in connection with 16 Trainor Road, and thus benefitted\n\nfrom both transactions. The fact that Smith was not involved until\n\nthe   second   transaction    did   not    inevitably     signal   that    a   new\n\nenterprise was born:      “[O]ne conspiracy [does not] necessarily end\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fand a new one begin each time a new member joins the organization.”\n\nBalthazard, 360 F.3d at 314.\n\n           Both episodes also used similar techniques, including\n\nsham down-payments and falsely reported sales prices, and were in\n\nvarious ways interdependent.        For example, the jury could have\n\nfound that the appraisals appellant obtained for 12 Trainor Road\n\nwere inflated;18 those valuations later were used as comparable\n\nsales to justify the also inflated $445,000 appraisal reported for\n\n16 Trainor Road.19   By invoking DesMarais’ purported payment for an\n\neasement, appellant took advantage of DesMarais’ ownership of 12\n\nTrainor Road to generate – on paper – $30,000 of the $50,000 down-\n\npayment that Smith needed to qualify for the mortgage on 16 Trainor\n\nRoad.     Both   mortgage   deals   also   used   Walden   as   a   financial\n\n\n\n     18\n       The two appraisals that appellant submitted for 12 Trainor\nRoad listed its value as $500,000 and $510,000. Appraiser Dorothy\nHarris had appraised the property at $450,000, and she testified\nthat she resisted appellant’s pressure to report a higher value.\nA local real estate broker, Kathryn Harrison, testified that 12\nTrainor Road had been sold more than once during the several years\npreceding the 2004 trial and that it last sold for under $300,000.\nShe further acknowledged, in response to a question from the\nprosecutor, that the real estate market in that area had\n“continually gone up” between 2000 and 2004.\n     19\n       An appraisal of 16 Trainor Road completed in early 2001 by\nan appraiser recommended by appellant – and relying on the 12\nTrainor Road transaction as a comparable sale – estimated the value\nof the 16 Trainor Road property at $445,000. Two other appraisals\nperformed in the spring of 2001 by appraisers who had no\nrelationship with appellant valued the property at $95,000 and\n$100,000. The local broker, Harrison, testified that the $445,000\nappraisal was “[w]ay out of line” and that the property was worth\nbetween $100,000 and $150,000.\n\n                                    -19-\n\fresource.        Indeed,   the    successful        payoff    to    Walden      from   the\n\nproceeds obtained from the 12 Trainor Road mortgage set the stage\n\nfor his willingness to go along with appellant’s odd proposal that\n\nhe accept a mortgage on 16 Trainor Road as security for his\n\ninvestments – an arrangement that advanced Smith’s application for\n\na construction loan on the property.\n\n               We think this evidence sufficient to permit the jury to\n\nfind appellant guilty of the charged single conspiracy.                         It is of\n\nsignificance,      too,    that   the       court   gave   the     jury    an   extended\n\ninstruction on the government’s burden to prove the existence of\n\n“one    overall     conspiracy     .    .    .   as   opposed      to     separate     and\n\nindependent      conspiracies.”20           Determining      whether      one   or     more\n\n\n       20\n            We cannot imagine a more thorough instruction on this issue:\n\n            The government has the burden of proving that only\n       one overall conspiracy existed as opposed to separate and\n       independent conspiracies. In other words, the government\n       must prove that there was one conspiracy to commit wire\n       fraud against Chase Mortgage, Citizens Mortgage, and\n       others as alleged.\n            Whether there was one conspiracy or several\n       conspiracies or indeed, no conspiracy at all, is a\n       question of fact for you, the jury, to determine in\n       accordance with these instructions.\n            When two or more people join together to further one\n       common unlawful design, purpose      or overall plan, a\n       single conspiracy exists. On the other hand, multiple\n       conspiracies exist when there are separate unlawful\n       agreements to achieve separate and distinct purposes.\n            You may find that there was a single conspiracy\n       despite the fact that there were changes in personnel by\n       termination, withdrawal, additions of new members, or in\n       activities, or both, so long as you find that some of the\n       co-conspirators continued to act for the entire duration\n       of the conspiracy for the purpose charged in the\n\n                                        -20-\n\fconspiracies existed is “ordinarily . . . a question of fact for\n\nthe jury to resolve,” Balthazard, 360 F.3d at 315; see also United\n\n\n\n     indictment.   The fact that the members of the – of a\n     conspiracy are not always identical does not necessarily\n     [imply] that separate conspiracies exist.      It is not\n     necessary that you find that the alleged co-conspirators\n     join the conspiracy at the same time or shared the same\n     knowledge beyond their understanding, tacit or otherwise,\n     that their illicit agreement existed.        Nor do the\n     participants in the conspiracy need to have known all of\n     their co-conspirators or to have participated at the same\n     time in furtherance of their criminal venture. What is\n     essential is that the criminal goal or overall plan\n     persisted without fundamental alteration notwithstanding\n     variations in personnel and their roles.\n          In determining whether there was a single conspiracy\n     or multiple conspiracies you may consider a wide range of\n     factors such as: Whether there was a common goal; the\n     nature of the scheme; overlapping of participants in\n     various dealings; the nature, design, implementation and\n     logistics of the illegal activity; the participants’\n     method of operation; the relevant geography; and the\n     scope of co-conspirator involvement.\n          If you find that the conspiracy charged in Count 1\n     of the indictment did not exist, you cannot find the\n     defendant guilty of that conspiracy. This is so even if\n     you find that some conspiracy other than the one charged\n     in Count 1 existed, even though the purposes of both\n     conspiracies may have been the same and even though there\n     may have been some overlap in membership. If you find\n     that there was not one overall conspiracy as alleged by\n     the government but instead there were actually several\n     separate and independent conspiracies, then you must find\n     the defendant not guilty of the conspiracy charged in\n     Count 1.\n          Similarly, if you find that the defendant was a\n     member of another conspiracy, and not the one charged in\n     Count 1, then you must find the defendant not guilty of\n     the conspiracy charged in Count 1.\n          Therefore, what you must do is determine whether the\n     conspiracy charged in the indictment existed. If it did,\n     you then must determine who were its members.\n\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fStates v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 696 (1st Cir. 1999), and this\n\njury, properly instructed, knew how to make that judgment.\n\nB. Harmless Error\n\n           Though we reject appellant's multiple conspiracy claim,\n\nwe   acknowledge   that   the   evidence   was   not   so   potent   that   it\n\ncompelled a finding of a single conspiracy.            However, even if we\n\nwere wrong in our assessment, appellant could not prevail.              “[A]\n\nvariance is fatal only if the defendant shows prejudice.”             United\n\nStates v. Mueffelman, 470 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir. 2006); see also\n\nKotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 756-57 (1946) (quoting\n\nBerger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 82 (1935)); United States v.\n\nFornia-Castillo, 408 F.3d 52, 66 (1st Cir. 2005).           Here, appellant\n\nwas found guilty on all of the wire fraud counts presented to the\n\njury, and he was the central actor in each of the two enterprises.\n\nThe jury thus found that he criminally participated in both loan\n\ntransactions, eliminating any risk that the conspiracy conviction\n\napplied to only one of the “two” conspiracies.\n\n           The only possible ground for prejudice would be a type of\n\nevidentiary spillover – i.e., if the guilty verdicts on the fraud\n\ncounts relating to one transaction were influenced by evidence\n\nrelating to the other transaction – but the interconnectedness of\n\nthe two deals compels a conclusion of harmlessness.21          Indeed, even\n\n\n      21\n       Most commonly, the spillover concern is addressed to whether\nincriminating evidence against co-defendants who were involved in\nseparate conspiracies affected the jury’s consideration of the\n\n                                   -22-\n\fif the government had alleged two separate conspiracies, we think\n\nthere is little chance that a trial court would have agreed to try\n\nthem separately given their proximate timing and the substantial\n\noverlap.   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a).22   While the evidence of the\n\nlater transaction arguably was unnecessary to prove a conspiracy\n\nrelating solely to 12 Trainor Road, a conspiracy relating solely to\n\n16 Trainor Road surely would have required considerable focus on\n\nthe earlier deal to explain the roles played later by DesMarais and\n\nWalden.    Moreover, as appellant has asserted in arguing that two\n\nconspiracies were proven, the evidence on each loan was presented\n\ndistinctly – undermining any claim that the jury’s verdicts were\n\n\n\n\nevidence against the defendant.      See, e.g., United States v.\nCandelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d 19, 40 (1st Cir. 1999).                A\n“‘transference of guilt’” also can occur from one charge to\nanother. Portela, 167 F.3d at 700 (citation omitted). The other\nconcerns that commonly arise from a variance claim are whether the\ndefendant could be twice subject to prosecution for the same\noffense and whether the defendant had sufficient notice “‘to\nprepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial,’” Fornia-\nCastillo, 408 F.3d at 67-68 (citation omitted); see also\nCandelaria-Silva, 166 F.3d at 40; Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 774.\n     22\n       Rule 8(a) provides that separate offenses may be charged in\nthe same indictment if they are “of the same or similar character,\nor are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with\nor constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” See, e.g., United\nStates v. Chambers, 964 F.2d 1250, 1250-51 (1st Cir. 1992). The\ntrial court has the discretion both to sever counts to avoid\nprejudice, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(a), and to “order that separate\ncases be tried together as though brought in a single indictment .\n. . if all offenses and all defendants could have been joined in a\nsingle indictment,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 13.\n\n                               -23-\n\finfected by “cross-information.”23        While appellant emphasizes the\n\n“mountainous amount of otherwise inadmissible 404(b) spillover\n\nevidence,”24 his view that the transactions are distinct leads him\n\nto understate the quantity of fully relevant crossover evidence.\n\nIn any event, a claim of prejudicial spillover cannot succeed\n\nunless “a defendant . . . prove[s] prejudice so pervasive that a\n\nmiscarriage of justice looms.”      United States v. Levy-Cordero, 67\n\nF.3d 1002, 1008 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal citation omitted). Given\n\nthe   close   relationship   of   the   two   transactions,   appellant’s\n\nacknowledgment that the evidence at trial differentiated between\n\n\n\n\n      23\n        Additionally, the court minimized the risk of improper\nspillover by instructing the jury that each count charged a\nseparate offense and that the jury must individually consider each\none:\n\n           Each count charges the defendant with a separate\n      offense.   You must consider each count separately and\n      return a verdict on each count.\n           It is your duty to give separate individual\n      consideration to each offense charged against the\n      defendant. When you do so, you should analyze what the\n      evidence in the case is, if any, with respect to each\n      count.\n\nLater in the charge, the court reiterated that the jurors should\n“[c]onsider each count separately,” instructing them to “determine\nwhether or not the government has proved each of the material\nelements beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to each count.”\n      24\n       Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) does not allow “[e]vidence\nof other crimes, wrongs, or acts . . . to prove the character of a\nperson in order to show action in conformity therewith.”      Such\nevidence may be allowed, however, to prove, inter alia, “motive,\nopportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\nabsence of mistake or accident.” Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).\n\n                                   -24-\n\fthem, and the court’s careful instructions, appellant has not come\n\nclose to such a showing.\n\nC. Evidentiary Claim\n\n          Appellant’s final claim of error is that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in ordering redaction of a portion of\n\na real estate brochure that was admitted as an exhibit.   See United\n\nStates v. Maldonado-García, 446 F.3d 227, 231 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(noting abuse of discretion standard for evidentiary issues).   The\n\nbrochure contained pictures, written descriptions, and sales prices\n\nfor three properties, including 12 Trainor Road.      The redacted\n\nexhibit deletes the information about the two unrelated properties\n\nand the $695,000 selling price for 12 Trainor Road.\n\n          The government sought exclusion of the selling price on\n\nthe ground that the information did not relate to the time period\n\nof the charged offenses and therefore was both irrelevant and\n\nconfusing for the jury.    The trial judge agreed, stating that he\n\ndid not think the defense “should be allowed to argue price on\n\nsomething that hasn’t been testified to and is not in the right\n\ntime frame” because it would be “misleading and improper.”\n\n          On appeal, appellant contends that the brochure price was\n\n“vital” to his attempt to show that the appraisals he had obtained\n\nwere reasonable, and he argues that there was, in fact, record\n\nsupport for the price. He points to the following colloquy between\n\ndefense counsel and appraiser Hill:\n\n\n                               -25-\n\f            Q:        Do you see the real estate appraisal\n                      value to the left-hand side of the\n                      photo?\n            A:        Yes, sir.\n            Q:        Do you think that accurately describes\n                      the property description as of October\n                      25th, 2000?\n            A:        Yes, sir.\n\n\n            The government asserts that appellant is off-the-mark in\n\nsuggesting that defense counsel’s use of the words “appraisal\n\nvalue” in his question indicates that Hill’s response endorses the\n\n$695,000    selling    price;   rather,     the    government    contends,    the\n\nresponse more reasonably is understood to be Hill’s affirmation\n\nthat the property description is accurate.                 We think this is the\n\nonly sensible characterization of the evidence.                Not only did the\n\nquestions immediately following the excerpted colloquy pertain to\n\nthe wording of the property description, but Hill had performed one\n\nof the appraisals on the property admitted into evidence.                 Hill’s\n\nappraisal set the property value in October 2000 at $510,000.\n\nGiven that context, the testimony cited above cannot be understood\n\nto support the $695,000 price in the brochure, and the district\n\ncourt cannot be faulted for excluding it.\n\n                                     III.\n\n            Appellant’s    duplicity      and     variance   claims    both   fail\n\nbecause the facts as alleged and proven at trial permitted the\n\njury’s     finding,    guided   by   the        district     court’s   exemplary\n\ninstruction, that a single conspiracy existed.                    As appellant\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\facknowledges,     the   single   conspiracy     determination   means   that\n\nevidence on both transactions was properly admitted and that his\n\nseverance claim must fail.       Even if the single conspiracy finding\n\nwere erroneous, appellant’s assertion of prejudicial spillover\n\nwould be unavailing.       Given the factual overlap between the two\n\ntransactions and the court’s careful instruction that the jury\n\nconsider   each   count    separately,     he   could   not   show   that   “a\n\nmiscarriage of justice looms.”        Finally, the court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in ordering redaction of the real estate brochure.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.      So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\f",

The indictment against defendant-appellant William P. Trainor, charging both conspiracy to commit wire fraud and multiple episodes of the substantive crime, stemmed from his role in fraudulently securing mortgages on two adjacent properties owned by his family in Maine. Asserting that the conduct related to each property was separate, appellant argues that the conspiracy count &#8212; which treated the two ventures as a single scheme &#8212; should have been dismissed as duplicitous. He alternatively argues prejudicial variance, contending that the evidence presented at trial showed separate schemes and thus was insufficient to prove the single charged conspiracy. He also claims that spillover in evidence between the two schemes denied him a fair trial on the wire fraud charges, requiring that those convictions also be set aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no merit in these contentions or his related evidentiary claim. The jury was properly instructed to consider whether a single conspiracy had been proven, and the record amply supports its verdict. We therefore affirm appellant's conviction on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Trainor and his family owned two lakeside properties &#8212; 12 Trainor Road and 16 Trainor Road &#8212; in Lebanon, Maine. Appellant allegedly orchestrated a complex series of financial transactions involving sham deposits, altered checks, forged signatures and myriad other false representations to fraudulently elicit mortgage funds from two different financial institutions. We present the facts as the jury could have found them, reserving additional detail for our discussion of defendant's claims of error. <i>See United States v. Byrne,</i> 435 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Mortgage on 12 Trainor Road</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 2000, Trainor approached co-defendant John DesMarais, a family friend and carpenter who had done work for him,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> about buying the house and land at 12 Trainor Road, which was held in the name of Trainor's wife. DesMarais earned only $40,000 a year and had filed for bankruptcy in 1995, but Trainor offered to help him secure financing. The original purchase and sale agreement showed a sale price of $550,000 and an initial deposit of $10,000. DesMarais had not, in fact, given such a deposit. He previously had purchased a boat from Trainor for $6,000, and Trainor told DesMarais he would credit the money from the boat purchase toward the property deal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In helping DesMarais obtain a $400,000 mortgage from Chase Manhattan Mortgage (\"Chase\"), appellant took various steps aimed at creating the false impression that DesMarais had the resources to buy the property. For example, at Trainor's suggestion, DesMarais borrowed $20,000 from an acquaintance, Don Walden, which DesMarais used in part to purchase stock in a company associated with Trainor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> DesMarais understood that, like the boat purchase, the money for the stock would be considered a deposit on the property. Walden's money also was used to fund a $5,240 personal check written to Trainor's wife, Geraldine, as a deposit. DesMarais subsequently told a Chase loan officer, David Barney, that he planned to finance the property purchase by selling stock worth $157,500. DesMarais testified that the stock value was set by Trainor, and he admitted at trial that he did not own stock of that value. During the loan process, DesMarais did not disclose that he had borrowed money to finance the down-payment, a fact that would have disinclined the mortgage company to issue the loan because an outlay of cash is considered some security against default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the loan application process, Trainor submitted appraisals for the property that the jury could have found were inflated. <i>See infra</i> note 18. Also among the documents provided to Chase was a memo stating that DesMarais had exchanged his original stock for shares of another company, and that he had a buyer ready to purchase that stock for $106,250. The memo bore the heading \"From the Office of John Desmarais\" and was signed with the initials \"J.D.\" DesMarais testified, however, that he had not created the document, that it was not his handwriting on it, and that he never spelled his last name with a lower-case \"m.\" Barney also was sent a revised purchase and sale agreement, which showed a new sale price of $500,000 and referenced $22,500 in deposits that DesMarais was to have paid by September 30, 2000. DesMarais testified that he did not see the revised purchase and sale agreement until after his arrest, and also stated that the signature that appears on it &#8212; his name &#8212; was not written by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 2000, the mortgage company received another memo purportedly from DesMarais, along with photocopies of cancelled checks that were meant to be evidence of his down-payments on the property. The evidence showed, however, that some of the photocopied checks had been altered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On December 21, the company received a faxed copy of DesMarais's bank statement showing deposits of $18,000 and $87,500 and an account balance of $106,690.83 &#8212; \"proof\" that DesMarais had sufficient funds of his own for the loan to close. The two deposited checks had been written by Trainor, however, on an account of \"Fradco Holdings, Inc.\" that at the time contained only $7.65. At the closing on December 22, Trainor provided the $91,855.69 that was due from the borrower by using another Fradco Holdings check, this time for $75,000, and a cashier's check for $16,855.69. Trainor had purchased the cashier's check with money he obtained from Walden; he gave Walden in return a $17,000 Fradco Holdings check that Walden was told he should hold off on cashing until he heard back from Trainor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chase provided $390,083.90 for the closing, and that money was disbursed based on directions from Trainor, who stated in his letter to the mortgage company that he and his wife were donating most of the sale proceeds. The specified disbursements included a $120,000 payment wired to the Fradco Holdings account, which covered the checks that Trainor recently had written on that account: the $17,000 to Walden for the cashier's check, the $75,000 paid at closing, and the $18,000 check deposited into DesMarais's account.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Trainor put a stop payment order on the $87,500 Fradco Holdings check that also had been deposited into DesMarais's account. Another $20,000 was used to repay Walden for his original loan to DesMarais.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DesMarais moved into the house at 12 Trainor Road and managed to make the loan payments for eighteen months before the bank foreclosed on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Mortgage on 16 Trainor Road</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within weeks after the closing on 12 Trainor Road, Trainor approached DesMarais with a new proposal. He suggested that DesMarais become involved in a plan to purchase the adjoining four-acre plot at 16 Trainor Road, which was held in the name of Trainor's son, and to build a custom home on the property; the sale of the house would generate funds to help DesMarais afford his loan payments on 12 Trainor Road. DesMarais introduced Trainor to his friend, builder Donald Smith &#8212; the third co-conspirator in this case &#8212; and the discussions eventually led to DesMarais bowing out of the financing for 16 Trainor Road because of his inability to borrow any more money. Trainor and Smith agreed that Smith would serve as the buyer, and DesMarais would receive a $10,000 finder's fee from the loan proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trainor again provided a purchase and sale agreement, which listed the sale price as $250,000 and stated that the purchase would be accomplished with a $50,000 deposit and a $200,000 mortgage. Smith and Trainor had agreed, however, that the \"real\" sale price for the land was $130,000 and that Smith did not have to make the $50,000 deposit. Smith gave Trainor $20,000, but understood that he would be reimbursed when the loan closed. On April 20, 2001, a deed was executed showing transfer of the property to Smith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Trainor had interested Walden &#8212; the individual who had lent money to DesMarais for the earlier purchase &#8212; in investing in Trainor's businesses. When Walden became nervous about his investments, Trainor offered him a security interest in the 16 Trainor Road property as a \"line of credit\" up to a $200,000 investment. In essence, this arrangement meant that Walden would become the mortgage-holder on 16 Trainor Road, with the security interest in the land protecting him in case his investments with Trainor turned out badly. The deal allowed Trainor to create the impression that Smith had purchased the property with a temporary mortgage funded by Walden; Trainor prepared a mortgage and promissory note in which Smith agreed to pay Walden $200,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using the Walden \"mortgage\" as evidence that $200,000 had changed hands in his purchase of the property, Smith submitted an application to Citizens Mortgage Corporation (\"Citizens\") for a $419,000 construction loan &#8212; $200,000 intended to repay the original mortgage and the remainder to finance construction of the house. Smith told the loan officer that the house would be a vacation home rather than a custom investment house &#8212; a deception necessary to gain approval for the loan. The mortgage company also was deceived about the $50,000 down payment, another prerequisite to its loan. Trainor sent an email message to the loan officer confirming the sale price of $250,000 and stating that he had received $20,000 from Smith. He also reported that the remaining $30,000 would come from DesMarais's payment for an easement on the property. Smith testified at trial that the representations about the sales price and easement were false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A construction loan in the amount of $400,000 closed on October 19, 2001, but only the initial $200,000 was disbursed at that time. Trainor provided instructions directing that $108,300 be paid to Walden and that the remainder be given to Trainor in five checks totaling $91,700.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Two of those checks went to Smith; he was given a check for $20,000 to repay him for his original \"deposit,\" and he received another check for $33,870.71. DesMarais received his $10,000 \"finder's fee.\" About two weeks after the closing, Walden was convinced to re-invest most of the proceeds he had received from the loan in another Trainor deal,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> so Trainor ended up benefitting from more than $130,000 of the Citizens mortgage funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Lee Transaction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the same time period in which Trainor was arranging the transaction with Smith, he also transferred 16 Trainor Road to an unrelated individual in a multi-party settlement of debts. The recipient of the property, Nevada attorney James Lee, had represented a client, Robert Jones,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> who was unable to pay attorney's fees totaling more than $200,000. Trainor owed Jones a substantial amount of money, and he offered to pay off his debt by transferring property in Maine to Lee &#8212; thereby taking care of Jones's attorney's fee problem. Lee agreed to the deal, intending to obtain a loan on the property and then sell it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between February and April 2001, Trainor arranged for the filing of several documents relating to Lee's purchase of 16 Trainor Road: a deed showing sale of the property to the \"Law Offices of James J. Lee\"; a \"lien certificate\" claiming a lien against the property based on purported obligations to various individuals and businesses, including Fradco Holdings; and a lien release that purportedly transferred the property from Lee back to Trainor's son.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Lee was unaware of the lien transactions &#8212; which \"returned\" the property to Trainor so the sale to Smith could occur &#8212; and he testified that when he discovered that activity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> \"I think we contacted the authorities.\" An investigation followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trainor, DesMarais, and Smith were charged in an indictment with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, and multiple counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> As noted earlier, DesMarais and Smith entered into plea agreements with the government, and each pled guilty to a single count of wire fraud. Trainor filed a motion to dismiss the conspiracy count and to sever Counts Two through Four &#8212; relating to 12 Trainor Road &#8212; from Counts Five through Eight &#8212; relating to 16 Trainor Road. The motion was denied, and Trainor was convicted by a jury of conspiracy and five counts of wire fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Trainor to a 60-month term of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed an assessment of $600 and restitution, shared jointly and severally with DesMarais and Smith, in the amount of $202,895.84.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> On appeal, Trainor sets out four contentions: (1) the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the conspiracy count for duplicity; (2) the court abused its discretion in refusing to sever the wire fraud counts pertaining to 12 Trainor Road from the counts pertaining to 16 Trainor Road; (3) because the evidence at trial showed multiple conspiracies rather than one, variance occurred and his conviction on Count 1, which charged a single conspiracy, lacked sufficient support in the record; and (4) the court abused its discretion in requiring redaction of the listing price for 12 Trainor Road from a real estate brochure admitted as an exhibit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's counsel acknowledged at oral argument that his client's first three claims of error reduce to two primary points: the record mandates a conclusion that two conspiracies existed, rather than one, and the spillover in evidence concerning those separate transactions injected unfair prejudice into his trial. Our conclusion that appellant is wrong as to the first of these contentions leads inevitably to the failure of the second.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Conspiracy, Duplicity and Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claim that the government improperly has characterized a series of allegedly unlawful transactions as a single enterprise can implicate both the doctrine of \"duplicity\" &#8212; the joining of two or more distinct offenses in a single count of an indictment, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d 294, 297 (1st Cir.1999), and the doctrine of \"variance\" &#8212; the presentation at trial of evidence that varies materially from the crime charged in the indictment, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Balthazard,</i> 360 F.3d 309, 315 (1st Cir.2004). Trainor asserts both here. He claims that the indictment's allegations reflect a \"surgical division between the two sets of charges\" and that Count One thus improperly joins them in a single alleged conspiracy. In addition, he maintains that the evidence produced at trial proved \"two different and disconnected conspiracies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues, in other words, that the indictment alone establishes reversible error on the conspiracy count because the two conspiracies were improperly joined in a single count, but that, even if we reject the duplicity claim, the conspiracy conviction nonetheless is defective because the evidence as presented at trial depicted two separate conspiracies. He further argues that error of either type requires that we reverse the jury's verdicts on all counts because of the prejudice resulting from trying the two transactions together.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it unnecessary in this case to discuss duplicity separately. Appellant does not argue that the facts presented at trial differed from the factual allegations in the indictment &#8212; only that these facts, as alleged and proven, established two conspiracies rather than one. Our conclusion that the evidence sufficiently supported the jury's verdict on Count One as alleged &#8212; i.e., that appellant participated in a single, overarching conspiracy &#8212; necessarily dooms his contention that the indictment was fatally flawed. This is so because, in rejecting his variance claim, we also are implicitly concluding that the facts set out in the indictment &#8212; which mirror the facts proven at trial &#8212; describe a scenario that is permissibly viewed as a single conspiracy. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Mastelotto,</i> 717 F.2d 1238, 1244 (9th Cir. 1983), <i>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Miller,</i> 471 U.S. 130, 134-36, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99 (1985) (\"[T]he question for review is simply whether the indictment may be read to allege a single unified scheme in each count.\"). We therefore address the legality of the conspiracy conviction solely as an issue of variance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing whether the government's case varied materially from the crime charged in the indictment, \"the initial question-and the only one that we need to reach here &#8212; is one of evidentiary sufficiency.\" <i>United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2003); <i>see also United States v. Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d 761, 773 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>United States v.

Morrow,</i> 39 F.3d 1228, 1234 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting American Law Institute, <i>Model Penal Code and Commentaries</i> 423 (1985)), we consider all relevant circumstances and focus on such factors as \"whether the alleged conspirators shared a common purpose, whether their actions demonstrated interdependency, and the extent to which participants overlapped during the life of the alleged conspiracy.\" <i>Balthazard,</i> 360 F.3d at 315; <i>see also, e.g., Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 7. \"At the end of the day, a defendant cannot succeed with a sufficiency challenge `as long as a plausible reading of the record supports the jury's implied finding that he knowingly participated in the charged conspiracy.'\" <i>Balthazard,</i> 360 F.3d at 315 (quoting <i>Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d at 7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such is the case here. The government alleged a scheme in which appellant and his co-defendants conspired to enrich themselves and others by securing mortgages based on false representations. From the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could conclude that, from the beginning, Trainor anticipated using both of his family's Trainor Road properties to effectuate the scheme. He initiated the second deal on the heels of the closing for the first property, proposing DesMarais's purchase of 16 Trainor Road as, in essence, a method of obtaining additional financing for the purchase of 12 Trainor Road. Although there was no evidence that DesMarais initially shared Trainor's long-range vision, the jury rationally could find that DesMarais agreed to extend the original conspiracy to protect his interest in 12 Trainor Road, and that he did so by recruiting partners to purchase 16 Trainor Road. Similarly, while Smith was uninvolved in the first phase of the alleged conspiracy, the evidence of his friendship with DesMarais and his presumed awareness of DesMarais's need for cash permitted the jury to find that Smith knew from the outset of his participation that the unorthodox financial arrangements that Trainor proposed &#8212; e.g., selling the property for $130,000 while seeking a $200,000 mortgage &#8212; were part of the larger scheme involving both pieces of property. Smith's acquiescence in DesMarais's role as a silent partner in the second deal &#8212; as the recipient of a finder's fee &#8212; reinforces the inference that Smith knew the 16 Trainor Road transaction was intended, at least in part, to prop up the original deception. The circumstances were thus readily susceptible to a finding of shared purpose among the three charged co-conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the collaborators' overlapping participation is on its own a significant factor. DesMarais was a key player in both deals, serving as the central co-conspirator in the first enterprise and playing an important role in the second transaction by bringing in Smith. For his efforts, he was rewarded with the $10,000 fee in connection with 16 Trainor Road, and thus benefitted from both transactions. The fact that Smith was not involved until the second transaction did not inevitably signal that a new enterprise was born: \"[O]ne conspiracy [does not] necessarily end and a new one begin each time a new member joins the organization.\" <i>Balthazard,</i> 360 F.3d at 314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both episodes also used similar techniques, including sham down-payments and falsely reported sales prices, and were in various ways interdependent. For example, the jury could have found that the appraisals appellant obtained for 12 Trainor Road were inflated;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> those valuations later were used as comparable sales to justify the also inflated $445,000 appraisal reported for 16 Trainor Road.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> By invoking DesMarais' purported payment for an easement, appellant took advantage of DesMarais' ownership of 12 Trainor Road to generate &#8212; on paper &#8212; $30,000 of the $50,000 down-payment that Smith needed to qualify for the mortgage on 16 Trainor Road. Both mortgage deals also used Walden as a financial resource. Indeed, the successful payoff to Walden from the proceeds obtained from the 12 Trainor Road mortgage set the stage for his willingness to go along with appellant's odd proposal that he accept a mortgage on 16 Trainor Road as security for his investments &#8212; an arrangement that advanced Smith's application for a construction loan on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this evidence sufficient to permit the jury to find appellant guilty of the charged single conspiracy. It is of significance, too, that the court gave the jury an extended instruction on the government's burden to prove the existence of \"one overall conspiracy . . . as opposed to separate and independent conspiracies.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> Determining whether one or more conspiracies existed is \"ordinarily . . . a question of fact for the jury to resolve,\" <i>Balthazard,</i> 360 F.3d at 315; <i>see also United States v. Portela,</i> 167 F.3d 687, 696 (1st Cir.1999), and this jury, properly instructed, knew how to make that judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Harmless Error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though we reject appellant's multiple conspiracy claim, we acknowledge that the evidence was not so potent that it compelled a finding of a single conspiracy. However, even if we were wrong in our assessment, appellant could not prevail. \"[A] variance is fatal only if the defendant shows prejudice.\" <i>United States v. Mueffelman,</i> 470 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also Kotteakos v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 750, 756-57, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946) (quoting <i>Berger v. United States,</i> 295 U.S. 78, 82, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935)); <i>United States v. Fornia-Castillo,</i> 408 F.3d 52, 66 (1st Cir.2005). Here, appellant was found guilty on all of the wire fraud counts presented to the jury, and he was the central actor in each of the two enterprises. The jury thus found that he criminally participated in both loan transactions, eliminating any risk that the conspiracy conviction applied to only one of the \"two\" conspiracies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only possible ground for prejudice would be a type of evidentiary spillover &#8212; i.e., if the guilty verdicts on the fraud counts relating to one transaction were influenced by evidence relating to the other transaction &#8212; but the interconnectedness of the two deals compels a conclusion of harmlessness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Indeed, even if the government had alleged two separate conspiracies, we think there is little chance that a trial court would have agreed to try them separately given their proximate timing and the substantial overlap. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 8(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> While the evidence of the later transaction arguably was unnecessary to prove a conspiracy relating solely to 12 Trainor Road, a conspiracy relating solely to 16 Trainor Road surely would have required considerable focus on the earlier deal to explain the roles played later by DesMarais and Walden. Moreover, as appellant has asserted in arguing that two conspiracies were proven, the evidence on each loan was presented distinctly &#8212; undermining any claim that the jury's verdicts were infected by \"cross-information.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> While appellant emphasizes the \"mountainous amount of otherwise inadmissible 404(b) spillover evidence,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> his view that the transactions are distinct leads him to understate the quantity of fully relevant crossover evidence. In any event, a claim of prejudicial spillover cannot succeed unless \"a defendant . . . prove[s] prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.\" <i>United States v. Levy-Cordero,</i> 67 F.3d 1002, 1008 (1st Cir.1995) (internal citation omitted). Given the close relationship of the two transactions, appellant's acknowledgment that the evidence at trial differentiated between them, and the court's careful instructions, appellant has not come close to such a showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidentiary Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final claim of error is that the district court abused its discretion in ordering redaction of a portion of a real estate brochure that was admitted as an exhibit. <i>See United States v. Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> 446 F.3d 227, 231 (1st Cir.2006) (noting abuse of discretion standard for evidentiary issues). The brochure contained pictures, written descriptions, and sales prices for three properties, including 12 Trainor Road. The redacted exhibit deletes the information about the two unrelated properties and the $695,000 selling price for 12 Trainor Road.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government sought exclusion of the selling price on the ground that the information did not relate to the time period of the charged offenses and therefore was both irrelevant and confusing for the jury. The trial judge agreed, stating that he did not think the defense \"should be allowed to argue price on something that hasn't been testified to and is not in the right time frame\" because it would be \"misleading and improper.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellant contends that the brochure price was \"vital\" to his attempt to show that the appraisals he had obtained were reasonable, and he argues that there was, in fact, record support for the price. He points to the following colloquy between defense counsel and appraiser Hill:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Do you see the real estate appraisal value to the left-hand side of the photo?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Do you think that accurately describes the property description as of October 25th, 2000?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that appellant is off-the-mark in suggesting that defense counsel's use of the words \"appraisal value\" in his question indicates that Hill's response endorses the $695,000 selling price; rather, the government contends, the response more reasonably is understood to be Hill's affirmation that the property description is accurate. We think this is the only sensible characterization of the evidence. Not only did the questions immediately following the excerpted colloquy pertain to the wording of the property description, but Hill had performed one of the appraisals on the property admitted into evidence. Hill's appraisal set the property value in October 2000 at $510,000. Given that context, the testimony cited above cannot be understood to support the $695,000 price in the brochure, and the district court cannot be faulted for excluding it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's duplicity and variance claims both fail because the facts as alleged and proven at trial permitted the jury's finding, guided by the district court's exemplary instruction, that a single conspiracy existed. As appellant acknowledges, the single conspiracy determination means that evidence on both transactions was properly admitted and that his severance claim must fail. Even if the single conspiracy finding were erroneous, appellant's assertion of prejudicial spillover would be unavailing. Given the factual overlap between the two transactions and the court's careful instruction that the jury consider each count separately, he could not show that \"a miscarriage of justice looms.\" Finally, the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering redaction of the real estate brochure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

Boulanger,</i> 444 F.3d 76, 87 (1st Cir.2006). Given our conclusion that the government properly alleged and proved a single conspiracy, this claim is unavailing; all of the alleged acts of wire fraud were within that conspiracy and thus necessarily a part of the same case. Moreover, as revealed by our discussion of harmless error in Section B, we would reject the severance claim even if we accepted appellant's multiple conspiracy theory. <i>See infra</i> pp. 35-36; <i>see also Boulanger,</i> 444 F.3d at 88 (\"[W]e see no prejudice beyond the type of `standard fare [that exists] whenever counts involving discrete incidents are linked in a single indictment.

Morse,</i> 785 F.2d 771, 774 (9th Cir.1986). Here, however, the fact that the jury returned guilty verdicts on all wire fraud counts assures that Trainor was deemed responsible for the conduct surrounding both mortgages. Appellant also had ample \"notice of the nature and cause of the proceedings against him[ ] so that he [could] effectively prepare a defense.\" <i>Huguenin,</i> 950 F.2d at 26 (citing 8 <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> &#182; 8.03[1] ).

A local real estate broker, Kathryn Harrison, testified that 12 Trainor Road had been sold more than once during the several years preceding the 2004 trial and that it last sold for under $300,000.

In other words, the government must prove that there was one conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Chase Mortgage, Citizens Mortgage, and others as alleged.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Whether there was one conspiracy or several conspiracies or indeed, no conspiracy at all, is a question of fact for you, the jury, to determine in accordance with these instructions.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">When two or more people join together to further one common unlawful design, purpose or overall plan, a single conspiracy exists. On the other hand, multiple conspiracies exist when there are separate unlawful agreements to achieve separate and distinct purposes.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">You may find that there was a single conspiracy despite the fact that there were changes in personnel by termination, withdrawal, additions of new members, or in activities, or both, so long as you find that some of the co-conspirators continued to act for the entire duration of the conspiracy for the purpose charged in the indictment. The fact that the members of the-of a conspiracy are not always identical does not necessarily [imply] that separate conspiracies exist. It is not necessary that you find that the alleged co-conspirators join the conspiracy at the same time or shared the same knowledge beyond their understanding, tacit or otherwise, that their illicit agreement existed. Nor do the participants in the conspiracy need to have known all of their co-conspirators or to have participated at the same time in furtherance of their criminal venture. What is essential is that the criminal goal or overall plan persisted without fundamental alteration notwithstanding variations in personnel and their roles.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether there was a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies you may consider a wide range of factors such as: Whether there was a common goal; the nature of the scheme; overlapping of participants in various dealings; the nature, design, implementation and logistics of the illegal activity; the participants' method of operation; the relevant geography; and the scope of co-conspirator involvement.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If you find that the conspiracy charged in Count 1 of the indictment did not exist, you cannot find the defendant guilty of that conspiracy. This is so even if you find that some conspiracy other than the one charged in Count 1 existed, even though the purposes of both conspiracies may have been the same and even though there may have been some overlap in membership. If you find that there was not one overall conspiracy as alleged by the government but instead there were actually several separate and independent conspiracies, then you must find the defendant not guilty of the conspiracy charged in Count 1.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, if you find that the defendant was a member of another conspiracy, and not the one charged in Count 1, then you must find the defendant not guilty of the conspiracy charged in Count 1.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, what you must do is determine whether the conspiracy charged in the indictment existed.

The indictment against defendant-appellant William P. Trainor, charging both conspiracy to commit wire fraud and multiple episodes of the substantive crime, stemmed from his role in fraudulently securing mortgages on two adjacent properties owned by his family in Maine. Asserting that the conduct related to each property was separate, appellant argues that the conspiracy count &#8212; which treated the two ventures as a single scheme &#8212; should have been dismissed as duplicitous. He alternatively argues prejudicial variance, contending that the evidence presented at trial showed separate schemes and thus was insufficient to prove the single charged conspiracy. He also claims that spillover in evidence between the two schemes denied him a fair trial on the wire fraud charges, requiring that those convictions also be set aside.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no merit in these contentions or his related evidentiary claim. The jury was properly instructed to consider whether a single conspiracy had been proven, and the record amply supports its verdict. We therefore affirm appellant's conviction on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Trainor and his family owned two lakeside properties &#8212; 12 Trainor Road and 16 Trainor Road &#8212; in Lebanon, Maine. Appellant allegedly orchestrated a complex series of financial transactions involving sham deposits, altered checks, forged signatures and myriad other false representations to fraudulently elicit mortgage funds from two different financial institutions. We present the facts as the jury could have found them, reserving additional detail for our discussion of defendant's claims of error. <i>See United States v. Byrne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202005\"><a href=\"/opinion/202005/united-states-v-byrne/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Mortgage on 12 Trainor Road</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 2000, Trainor approached co-defendant John DesMarais, a family friend and carpenter who had done work for him,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> about buying the house and land at 12 Trainor Road, which was held in the name of Trainor's wife. DesMarais earned only $40,000 a year and had filed for bankruptcy in 1995, but Trainor offered to help him secure financing. The original purchase and sale agreement showed a sale price of $550,000 and an initial deposit of $10,000. DesMarais had not, in fact, given such a deposit. He previously had purchased a boat from Trainor for $6,000, and Trainor told DesMarais he would credit the money from the boat purchase toward the property deal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In helping DesMarais obtain a $400,000 mortgage from Chase Manhattan Mortgage (\"Chase\"), appellant took various steps aimed at creating the false impression that DesMarais had the resources to buy the property. For example, at Trainor's suggestion, DesMarais borrowed $20,000 from an acquaintance, Don Walden, which DesMarais used in part to purchase stock in a company associated with Trainor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> DesMarais understood that, like the boat purchase, the money for the stock would be considered a deposit on the property. Walden's money also was used to fund a $5,240 personal check written to Trainor's wife, Geraldine, as a deposit. DesMarais subsequently told a Chase loan officer, David Barney, that he planned to finance the property purchase by selling stock worth $157,500. DesMarais testified that the stock value was set by Trainor, and he admitted at trial that he did not own stock of that value. During the loan process, DesMarais did not disclose that he had borrowed money to finance the down-payment, a fact that would have disinclined the mortgage company to issue the loan because an outlay of cash is considered some security against default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of the loan application process, Trainor submitted appraisals for the property that the jury could have found were inflated. <i>See infra</i> note 18. Also among the documents provided to Chase was a memo stating that DesMarais had exchanged his original stock for shares of another company, and that he had a buyer ready to purchase that stock for $106,250. The memo bore the heading \"From the Office of John Desmarais\" and was signed with the initials \"J.D.\" DesMarais testified, however, that he had not created the document, that it was not his handwriting on it, and that he never spelled his last name with a lower-case \"m.\" Barney also was sent a revised purchase and sale agreement, which showed a new sale price of $500,000 and referenced $22,500 in deposits that DesMarais was to have paid by September 30, 2000. DesMarais testified that he did not see the revised purchase and sale agreement until after his arrest, and also stated that the signature that appears on it &#8212; his name &#8212; was not written by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 11, 2000, the mortgage company received another memo purportedly from DesMarais, along with photocopies of cancelled checks that were meant to be evidence of his down-payments on the property. The evidence showed, however, that some of the photocopied checks had been altered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On December 21, the company received a faxed copy of DesMarais's bank statement showing deposits of $18,000 and $87,500 and an account balance of $106,690.83 &#8212; \"proof\" that DesMarais had sufficient funds of his own for the loan to close. The two deposited checks had been written by Trainor, however, on an account of \"Fradco Holdings, Inc.\" that at the time contained only $7.65. At the closing on December 22, Trainor provided the $91,855.69 that was due from the borrower by using another Fradco Holdings check, this time for $75,000, and a cashier's check for $16,855.69. Trainor had purchased the cashier's check with money he obtained from Walden; he gave Walden in return a $17,000 Fradco Holdings check that Walden was told he should hold off on cashing until he heard back from Trainor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chase provided $390,083.90 for the closing, and that money was disbursed based on directions from Trainor, who stated in his letter to the mortgage company that he and his wife were donating most of the sale proceeds. The specified disbursements included a $120,000 payment wired to the Fradco Holdings account, which covered the checks that Trainor recently had written on that account: the $17,000 to Walden for the cashier's check, the $75,000 paid at closing, and the $18,000 check deposited into DesMarais's account.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Trainor put a stop payment order on the $87,500 Fradco Holdings check that also had been deposited into DesMarais's account. Another $20,000 was used to repay Walden for his original loan to DesMarais.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DesMarais moved into the house at 12 Trainor Road and managed to make the loan payments for eighteen months before the bank foreclosed on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Mortgage on 16 Trainor Road</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within weeks after the closing on 12 Trainor Road, Trainor approached DesMarais with a new proposal. He suggested that DesMarais become involved in a plan to purchase the adjoining four-acre plot at 16 Trainor Road, which was held in the name of Trainor's son, and to build a custom home on the property; the sale of the house would generate funds to help DesMarais afford his loan payments on 12 Trainor Road. DesMarais introduced Trainor to his friend, builder Donald Smith &#8212; the third co-conspirator in this case &#8212; and the discussions eventually led to DesMarais bowing out of the financing for 16 Trainor Road because of his inability to borrow any more money. Trainor and Smith agreed that Smith would serve as the buyer, and DesMarais would receive a $10,000 finder's fee from the loan proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trainor again provided a purchase and sale agreement, which listed the sale price as $250,000 and stated that the purchase would be accomplished with a $50,000 deposit and a $200,000 mortgage. Smith and Trainor had agreed, however, that the \"real\" sale price for the land was $130,000 and that Smith did not have to make the $50,000 deposit. Smith gave Trainor $20,000, but understood that he would be reimbursed when the loan closed. On April 20, 2001, a deed was executed showing transfer of the property to Smith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Trainor had interested Walden &#8212; the individual who had lent money to DesMarais for the earlier purchase &#8212; in investing in Trainor's businesses. When Walden became nervous about his investments, Trainor offered him a security interest in the 16 Trainor Road property as a \"line of credit\" up to a $200,000 investment. In essence, this arrangement meant that Walden would become the mortgage-holder on 16 Trainor Road, with the security interest in the land protecting him in case his investments with Trainor turned out badly. The deal allowed Trainor to create the impression that Smith had purchased the property with a temporary mortgage funded by Walden; Trainor prepared a mortgage and promissory note in which Smith agreed to pay Walden $200,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using the Walden \"mortgage\" as evidence that $200,000 had changed hands in his purchase of the property, Smith submitted an application to Citizens Mortgage Corporation (\"Citizens\") for a $419,000 construction loan &#8212; $200,000 intended to repay the original mortgage and the remainder to finance construction of the house. Smith told the loan officer that the house would be a vacation home rather than a custom investment house &#8212; a deception necessary to gain approval for the loan. The mortgage company also was deceived about the $50,000 down payment, another prerequisite to its loan. Trainor sent an email message to the loan officer confirming the sale price of $250,000 and stating that he had received $20,000 from Smith. He also reported that the remaining $30,000 would come from DesMarais's payment for an easement on the property. Smith testified at trial that the representations about the sales price and easement were false.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A construction loan in the amount of $400,000 closed on October 19, 2001, but only the initial $200,000 was disbursed at that time. Trainor provided instructions directing that $108,300 be paid to Walden and that the remainder be given to Trainor in five checks totaling $91,700.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Two of those checks went to Smith; he was given a check for $20,000 to repay him for his original \"deposit,\" and he received another check for $33,870.71. DesMarais received his $10,000 \"finder's fee.\" About two weeks after the closing, Walden was convinced to re-invest most of the proceeds he had received from the loan in another Trainor deal,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> so Trainor ended up benefitting from more than $130,000 of the Citizens mortgage funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Lee Transaction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the same time period in which Trainor was arranging the transaction with Smith, he also transferred 16 Trainor Road to an unrelated individual in a multi-party settlement of debts. The recipient of the property, Nevada attorney James Lee, had represented a client, Robert Jones,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> who was unable to pay attorney's fees totaling more than $200,000. Trainor owed Jones a substantial amount of money, and he offered to pay off his debt by transferring property in Maine to Lee &#8212; thereby taking care of Jones's attorney's fee problem. Lee agreed to the deal, intending to obtain a loan on the property and then sell it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between February and April 2001, Trainor arranged for the filing of several documents relating to Lee's purchase of 16 Trainor Road: a deed showing sale of the property to the \"Law Offices of James J. Lee\"; a \"lien certificate\" claiming a lien against the property based on purported obligations to various individuals and businesses, including Fradco Holdings; and a lien release that purportedly transferred the property from Lee back to Trainor's son.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Lee was unaware of the lien transactions &#8212; which \"returned\" the property to Trainor so the sale to Smith could occur &#8212; and he testified that when he discovered that activity,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> \"I think we contacted the authorities.\" An investigation followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trainor, DesMarais, and Smith were charged in an indictment with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, and multiple counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> As noted earlier, DesMarais and Smith entered into plea agreements with the government, and each pled guilty to a single count of wire fraud. Trainor filed a motion to dismiss the conspiracy count and to sever Counts Two through Four &#8212; relating to 12 Trainor Road &#8212; from Counts Five through Eight &#8212; relating to 16 Trainor Road. The motion was denied, and Trainor was convicted by a jury of conspiracy and five counts of wire fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Trainor to a 60-month term of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. The court also imposed an assessment of $600 and restitution, shared jointly and severally with DesMarais and Smith, in the amount of $202,895.84.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> On appeal, Trainor sets out four contentions: (1) the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the conspiracy count for duplicity; (2) the court abused its discretion in refusing to sever the wire fraud counts pertaining to 12 Trainor Road from the counts pertaining to 16 Trainor Road; (3) because the evidence at trial showed multiple conspiracies rather than one, variance occurred and his conviction on Count 1, which charged a single conspiracy, lacked sufficient support in the record; and (4) the court abused its discretion in requiring redaction of the listing price for 12 Trainor Road from a real estate brochure admitted as an exhibit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's counsel acknowledged at oral argument that his client's first three claims of error reduce to two primary points: the record mandates a conclusion that two conspiracies existed, rather than one, and the spillover in evidence concerning those separate transactions injected unfair prejudice into his trial. Our conclusion that appellant is wrong as to the first of these contentions leads inevitably to the failure of the second.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Conspiracy, Duplicity and Variance</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A claim that the government improperly has characterized a series of allegedly unlawful transactions as a single enterprise can implicate both the doctrine of \"duplicity\" &#8212; the joining of two or more distinct offenses in a single count of an indictment, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Verrecchia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766723\"><a href=\"/opinion/766723/united-states-v-albert-verrecchia/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 297 (1st Cir.1999), and the doctrine of \"variance\" &#8212; the presentation at trial of evidence that varies materially from the crime charged in the indictment, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Balthazard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200903\"><a href=\"/opinion/200903/united-states-v-balthazard/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span>, 315 (1st Cir.2004). Trainor asserts both here. He claims that the indictment's allegations reflect a \"surgical division between the two sets of charges\" and that Count One thus improperly joins them in a single alleged conspiracy. In addition, he maintains that the evidence produced at trial proved \"two different and disconnected conspiracies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues, in other words, that the indictment alone establishes reversible error on the conspiracy count because the two conspiracies were improperly joined in a single count, but that, even if we reject the duplicity claim, the conspiracy conviction nonetheless is defective because the evidence as presented at trial depicted two separate conspiracies. He further argues that error of either type requires that we reverse the jury's verdicts on all counts because of the prejudice resulting from trying the two transactions together.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find it unnecessary in this case to discuss duplicity separately. Appellant does not argue that the facts presented at trial differed from the factual allegations in the indictment &#8212; only that these facts, as alleged and proven, established two conspiracies rather than one. Our conclusion that the evidence sufficiently supported the jury's verdict on Count One as alleged &#8212; i.e., that appellant participated in a single, overarching conspiracy &#8212; necessarily dooms his contention that the indictment was fatally flawed. This is so because, in rejecting his variance claim, we also are implicitly concluding that the facts set out in the indictment &#8212; which mirror the facts proven at trial &#8212; describe a scenario that is permissibly viewed as a single conspiracy. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

The government alleged a scheme in which appellant and his co-defendants conspired to enrich themselves and others by securing mortgages based on false representations. From the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could conclude that, from the beginning, Trainor anticipated using both of his family's Trainor Road properties to effectuate the scheme. He initiated the second deal on the heels of the closing for the first property, proposing DesMarais's purchase of 16 Trainor Road as, in essence, a method of obtaining additional financing for the purchase of 12 Trainor Road. Although there was no evidence that DesMarais initially shared Trainor's long-range vision, the jury rationally could find that DesMarais agreed to extend the original conspiracy to protect his interest in 12 Trainor Road, and that he did so by recruiting partners to purchase 16 Trainor Road. Similarly, while Smith was uninvolved in the first phase of the alleged conspiracy, the evidence of his friendship with DesMarais and his presumed awareness of DesMarais's need for cash permitted the jury to find that Smith knew from the outset of his participation that the unorthodox financial arrangements that Trainor proposed &#8212; e.g., selling the property for $130,000 while seeking a $200,000 mortgage &#8212; were part of the larger scheme involving both pieces of property. Smith's acquiescence in DesMarais's role as a silent partner in the second deal &#8212; as the recipient of a finder's fee &#8212; reinforces the inference that Smith knew the 16 Trainor Road transaction was intended, at least in part, to prop up the original deception. The circumstances were thus readily susceptible to a finding of shared purpose among the three charged co-conspirators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the collaborators' overlapping participation is on its own a significant factor. DesMarais was a key player in both deals, serving as the central co-conspirator in the first enterprise and playing an important role in the second transaction by bringing in Smith. For his efforts, he was rewarded with the $10,000 fee in connection with 16 Trainor Road, and thus benefitted from both transactions. The fact that Smith was not involved until the second transaction did not inevitably signal that a new enterprise was born: \"[O]ne conspiracy [does not] necessarily end and a new one begin each time a new member joins the organization.\" <i>Balthazard,</i> 360 F.3d at 314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both episodes also used similar techniques, including sham down-payments and falsely reported sales prices, and were in various ways interdependent. For example, the jury could have found that the appraisals appellant obtained for 12 Trainor Road were inflated;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> those valuations later were used as comparable sales to justify the also inflated $445,000 appraisal reported for 16 Trainor Road.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> By invoking DesMarais' purported payment for an easement, appellant took advantage of DesMarais' ownership of 12 Trainor Road to generate &#8212; on paper &#8212; $30,000 of the $50,000 down-payment that Smith needed to qualify for the mortgage on 16 Trainor Road. Both mortgage deals also used Walden as a financial resource. Indeed, the successful payoff to Walden from the proceeds obtained from the 12 Trainor Road mortgage set the stage for his willingness to go along with appellant's odd proposal that he accept a mortgage on 16 Trainor Road as security for his investments &#8212; an arrangement that advanced Smith's application for a construction loan on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this evidence sufficient to permit the jury to find appellant guilty of the charged single conspiracy.

Here, appellant was found guilty on all of the wire fraud counts presented to the jury, and he was the central actor in each of the two enterprises. The jury thus found that he criminally participated in both loan transactions, eliminating any risk that the conspiracy conviction applied to only one of the \"two\" conspiracies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only possible ground for prejudice would be a type of evidentiary spillover &#8212; i.e., if the guilty verdicts on the fraud counts relating to one transaction were influenced by evidence relating to the other transaction &#8212; but the interconnectedness of the two deals compels a conclusion of harmlessness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Indeed, even if the government had alleged two separate conspiracies, we think there is little chance that a trial court would have agreed to try them separately given their proximate timing and the substantial overlap. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Crim.P. 8(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> While the evidence of the later transaction arguably was unnecessary to prove a conspiracy relating solely to 12 Trainor Road, a conspiracy relating solely to 16 Trainor Road surely would have required considerable focus on the earlier deal to explain the roles played later by DesMarais and Walden. Moreover, as appellant has asserted in arguing that two conspiracies were proven, the evidence on each loan was presented distinctly &#8212; undermining any claim that the jury's verdicts were infected by \"cross-information.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> While appellant emphasizes the \"mountainous amount of otherwise inadmissible 404(b) spillover evidence,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> his view that the transactions are distinct leads him to understate the quantity of fully relevant crossover evidence.

Given the close relationship of the two transactions, appellant's acknowledgment that the evidence at trial differentiated between them, and the court's careful instructions, appellant has not come close to such a showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidentiary Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final claim of error is that the district court abused its discretion in ordering redaction of a portion of a real estate brochure that was admitted as an exhibit. <i>See United States v. Maldonado-Garc&#237;a,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202192\"><a href=\"/opinion/202192/united-states-v-maldonado-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 231 (1st Cir.2006) (noting abuse of discretion standard for evidentiary issues). The brochure contained pictures, written descriptions, and sales prices for three properties, including 12 Trainor Road. The redacted exhibit deletes the information about the two unrelated properties and the $695,000 selling price for 12 Trainor Road.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government sought exclusion of the selling price on the ground that the information did not relate to the time period of the charged offenses and therefore was both irrelevant and confusing for the jury. The trial judge agreed, stating that he did not think the defense \"should be allowed to argue price on something that hasn't been testified to and is not in the right time frame\" because it would be \"misleading and improper.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellant contends that the brochure price was \"vital\" to his attempt to show that the appraisals he had obtained were reasonable, and he argues that there was, in fact, record support for the price. He points to the following colloquy between defense counsel and appraiser Hill:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Do you see the real estate appraisal value to the left-hand side of the photo?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: Do you think that accurately describes the property description as of October 25th, 2000?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes, sir.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that appellant is off-the-mark in suggesting that defense counsel's use of the words \"appraisal value\" in his question indicates that Hill's response endorses the $695,000 selling price; rather, the government contends, the response more reasonably is understood to be Hill's affirmation that the property description is accurate. We think this is the only sensible characterization of the evidence. Not only did the questions immediately following the excerpted colloquy pertain to the wording of the property description, but Hill had performed one of the appraisals on the property admitted into evidence. Hill's appraisal set the property value in October 2000 at $510,000. Given that context, the testimony cited above cannot be understood to support the $695,000 price in the brochure, and the district court cannot be faulted for excluding it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's duplicity and variance claims both fail because the facts as alleged and proven at trial permitted the jury's finding, guided by the district court's exemplary instruction, that a single conspiracy existed. As appellant acknowledges, the single conspiracy determination means that evidence on both transactions was properly admitted and that his severance claim must fail. Even if the single conspiracy finding were erroneous, appellant's assertion of prejudicial spillover would be unavailing. Given the factual overlap between the two transactions and the court's careful instruction that the jury consider each count separately, he could not show that \"a miscarriage of justice looms.\" Finally, the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering redaction of the real estate brochure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.

Similar concerns underlie the variance doctrine, reinforcing the notion that we need not separately discuss appellant's duplicity claim. <i>See infra</i> at 36 &amp; note 21.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Additional questions must be addressed only if the evidence is not sufficient \"to permit a jury to find the . . . agreement that the indictment charges.\"<i>Glenn,</i> 828 F.2d at 858.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> The two appraisals that appellant submitted for 12 Trainor Road listed its value as $500,000 and $510,000. Appraiser Dorothy Harris had appraised the property at $450,000, and she testified that she resisted appellant's pressure to report a higher value. A local real estate broker, Kathryn Harrison, testified that 12 Trainor Road had been sold more than once during the several years preceding the 2004 trial and that it last sold for under $300,000. She further acknowledged, in response to a question from the prosecutor, that the real estate market in that area had \"continually gone up\" between 2000 and 2004</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> An appraisal of 16 Trainor Road completed in early 2001 by an appraiser recommended by appellant &#8212; and relying on the 12 Trainor Road transaction as a comparable sale &#8212; estimated the value of the 16 Trainor Road property at $445,000. Two other appraisals performed in the spring of 2001 by appraisers who had no relationship with appellant valued the property at $95,000 and $100,000. The local broker, Harrison, testified that the $445,000 appraisal was \"[w]ay out of line\" and that the property was worth between $100,000 and $150,000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn20\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20_ref\">20</a>\n        <p> We cannot imagine a more thorough instruction on this issue:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The government has the burden of proving that only one overall conspiracy existed as opposed to separate and independent conspiracies. In other words, the government must prove that there was one conspiracy to commit wire fraud against Chase Mortgage, Citizens Mortgage, and others as alleged.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Whether there was one conspiracy or several conspiracies or indeed, no conspiracy at all, is a question of fact for you, the jury, to determine in accordance with these instructions.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">When two or more people join together to further one common unlawful design, purpose or overall plan, a single conspiracy exists. On the other hand, multiple conspiracies exist when there are separate unlawful agreements to achieve separate and distinct purposes.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">You may find that there was a single conspiracy despite the fact that there were changes in personnel by termination, withdrawal, additions of new members, or in activities, or both, so long as you find that some of the co-conspirators continued to act for the entire duration of the conspiracy for the purpose charged in the indictment. The fact that the members of the-of a conspiracy are not always identical does not necessarily [imply] that separate conspiracies exist. It is not necessary that you find that the alleged co-conspirators join the conspiracy at the same time or shared the same knowledge beyond their understanding, tacit or otherwise, that their illicit agreement existed. Nor do the participants in the conspiracy need to have known all of their co-conspirators or to have participated at the same time in furtherance of their criminal venture. What is essential is that the criminal goal or overall plan persisted without fundamental alteration notwithstanding variations in personnel and their roles.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether there was a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies you may consider a wide range of factors such as: Whether there was a common goal; the nature of the scheme; overlapping of participants in various dealings; the nature, design, implementation and logistics of the illegal activity; the participants' method of operation; the relevant geography; and the scope of co-conspirator involvement.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If you find that the conspiracy charged in Count 1 of the indictment did not exist, you cannot find the defendant guilty of that conspiracy. This is so even if you find that some conspiracy other than the one charged in Count 1 existed, even though the purposes of both conspiracies may have been the same and even though there may have been some overlap in membership. If you find that there was not one overall conspiracy as alleged by the government but instead there were actually several separate and independent conspiracies, then you must find the defendant not guilty of the conspiracy charged in Count 1.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, if you find that the defendant was a member of another conspiracy, and not the one charged in Count 1, then you must find the defendant not guilty of the conspiracy charged in Count 1.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, what you must do is determine whether the conspiracy charged in the indictment existed. If it did, you then must determine who were its members.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> Most commonly, the spillover concern is addressed to whether incriminating evidence against co-defendants who were involved in separate conspiracies affected the jury's consideration of the evidence against the defendant<i>See, e.g., United States v. Candelaria-Silva,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198309\"><a href=\"/opinion/198309/united-states-v-candelaria-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.1999). A \"`transference of guilt'\" also can occur from one charge to another. <i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 700 (citation omitted). The other concerns that commonly arise from a variance claim are whether the defendant could be twice subject to prosecution for the same offense and whether the defendant had sufficient notice \"`to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial,'\" <i>Fornia-Castillo,</i> 408 F.3d at 67-68 (citation omitted); <i>see also Candelaria-Silva,</i> 166 F.3d at 40; <i>Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d at 774.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> Rule 8(a) provides that separate offenses may be charged in the same indictment if they are \"of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\"<i>See, e.g., United States v. Chambers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583863\"><a href=\"/opinion/583863/united-states-v-james-chambers/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span>, 1250-51 (1st Cir.1992). The trial court has the discretion both to sever counts to avoid prejudice, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 14(a), and to \"order that separate cases be tried together as though brought in a single indictment . . . if all offenses and all defendants could have been joined in a single indictment,\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 13.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn23\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23_ref\">23</a>\n        <p> Additionally, the court minimized the risk of improper spillover by instructing the jury that each count charged a separate offense and that the jury must individually consider each one:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Each count charges the defendant with a separate offense. You must consider each count separately and return a verdict on each count.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">It is your duty to give separate individual consideration to each offense charged against the defendant. When you do so, you should analyze what the evidence in the case is, if any, with respect to each count.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Later in the charge, the court reiterated that the jurors should \"[c]onsider each count separately,\" instructing them to \"determine whether or not the government has proved each of the material elements beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to each count.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn24\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24_ref\">24</a>\n        <p> Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) does not allow \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts . . . to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" Such evidence may be allowed, however, to prove,<i>inter alia,</i> \"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
