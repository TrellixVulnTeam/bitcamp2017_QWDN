Bond with whom Matthew H. Snell and The Kaplan/Bond\nGroup were on brief for appellant.\n     John H. Bruno, II with whom Masi & Bruno was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           December 22, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.    On August 25, 2002, Mark Broadley\n\nwas injured at the Mashpee Neck Marina (\"Marina\") at Cape Cod when\n\nhis foot became caught in a gap between the main dock and a\n\nfloating dock where his vessel was moored.        The gap between the\n\ndocks is about two to three inches wide when the water is calm, but\n\nthe wake of a passing boat can cause the docks to move and the gap\n\nto widen.      Broadley fractured his ankle and was left with a\n\npermanent loss of function.\n\n            Broadley alleged that Marina's negligence caused the\n\naccident: the space between docks was a potential hazard that could\n\nhave been mitigated either by using a flexible material to cover\n\nthe gap or by tying the docks together more tightly.      Marina denied\n\nliability,    citing   the   boilerplate   exculpatory   clause   of   the\n\ncontract for seasonal mooring between the parties.          That clause\n\nread:\n\n             The OWNER [Broadley] warrants and [covenants] that\n             . . . the OWNER . . . will [not] make any claims,\n             demands, causes of action of any kind and nature,\n             or obtain or enforce any judgments, executions or\n             levies thereon . . . against MARINA, its officers,\n             directors, agents, servants, or its employees,\n             arising out of any damage, loss, personal injury\n             or death suffered by [him]. . . . The OWNER . . .\n             agree[s] and covenant[s] that [he] will defend,\n             indemnify and save MARINA harmless from any and\n             all of such claims, demands, causes of action,\n             judgments and executions, and the MARINA shall be\n             entitled to responsible attorneys fees in the\n             event of breach of the OWNER's covenant hereunder.\n\n            Marina claimed that this exculpatory clause precluded\n\nBroadley from bringing suit for personal injury due to Marina's\n\n                                   -2-\n\fnegligence.    Broadley responded that under admiralty law, a party\n\nmay limit but may not completely absolve itself from liability for\n\nordinary    negligence;     and    that   the        clause   was    over-broad       and\n\ntherefore unenforceable insofar as it absolved Marina of liability\n\nfor gross negligence and intentional wrongdoing.                      Because of its\n\nconnection to maritime activities, the clause is governed by\n\nfederal admiralty law.          S.C. State Ports Auth. v. Silver Anchor,\n\nS.A., 23 F.3d 842, 846 n.3 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\n            The district court issued summary judgment in Marina's\n\nfavor, holding that the clause should be reformed to limit it to\n\nordinary    negligence.          Broadley          had    conceded    that    Marina's\n\nnegligence did not rise to the level of gross negligence, so as\n\nreformed the clause barred his claim.                    This appeal followed.        We\n\nreview grants of summary judgment de novo.                     Iverson v. City of\n\nBoston, 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Broadley's    main      argument        on    appeal     is   that,   under\n\nadmiralty   law,    a   party     may   not    completely      absolve       itself   of\n\nliability for ordinary negligence; for support, Broadley cites the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corp., 349\n\nU.S. 85 (1955), and our own decision in La Esperanza de P.R., Inc.\n\nv. Perez Y Cia de P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 10 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            Bisso   could    be    read       as    laying    down    a   flat    rule,\n\napplicable to all cases, forbidding clauses that entirely exculpate\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fa party for its own simple negligence.1          However, Bisso focused on\n\ntowing    contracts   and     the   special     threat     of       \"monopolistic\n\ncompulsions.\"     349 U.S. at 91.           The Court also cited case law\n\nforbidding exculpatory clauses in common law relationships where\n\nunequal bargaining power is presumed (e.g., utilities and their\n\ncustomers).    349 U.S. at 90-91.       Thus Bisso can easily be read as\n\nlimited   to   relationships    where    unequal   power       is    inherent    or\n\nestablished.\n\n           Agreements   to    waive    claims    for    mere    negligence      are\n\ngenerally enforceable at common law.          See Keeton et al., Prosser &\n\nKeeton on Torts § 68, at 482-83 (5th ed. 1984).                 Qualifications\n\nexist-–the relevant doctrines are unconscionability and contracts\n\nof adhesion-–turning on factors like adequate disclosure, relative\n\nbargaining power and the like.              1-2 Farnsworth, Farnsworth on\n\nContracts §§ 4.26, 4.28, 5.2 (3d ed. 2004).            But an admiralty rule,\n\nflatly preventing parties from contracting away claims for simple\n\nnegligence in all circumstances, would be surprising.\n\n           Since Bisso, decisions in other circuits have addressed\n\nthis issue in admiralty cases but no consensus exists as to how\n\nBisso should be read.       Two circuits would allow a release from all\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Court applied the \"judicial rule, based on public policy,\ninvalidating contracts releasing towers from all liability for\ntheir negligence,\" and noted that \"[t]his rule is merely a\nparticular application to the towage business of a general rule\nlong used by courts and legislatures to prevent enforcement of\nrelease-from-negligence contracts.\" Bisso, 349 U.S. at 90.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fliability for negligence (at least in the dockage context) and one\n\ncircuit   arguably    would     not.2     Another   circuit     has     upheld\n\nexculpatory clauses that limited but did not entirely preclude\n\nliability for negligence; but in our case the clause completely\n\nexculpates from such liability, so this last circuit's cases are\n\ndistinguishable.3\n\n          As for this circuit, the main thrust of the language in\n\nLa Esperanza was to uphold exculpatory clauses directed to mere\n\nnegligence so long as \"expressed clearly in contracts entered into\n\nfreely by parties of equal bargaining power.\"             The sentence ended\n\nwith the phrase: \"provided that the clause not provide for a total\n\nabsolution of liability.\"        124 F.3d at 19.     But this may simply\n\nmean (unexceptionally) that parties cannot contract out of gross\n\nnegligence.\n\n          Nor did La Esperanza hold invalid a properly disclosed\n\nclause,   not    unfairly     imposed,    waiving   all    claims     for   all\n\nnegligence.     The decision upheld application of a clause barring\n\nrecovery for lost profits or lost use of vessel caused by a\n\n\n     2\n      Compare Sander v. Alexander Richardson Invs., 334             F.3d 712,\n719 (8th Cir. 2003), and Morton v. Zidell Explorations,             Inc., 695\nF.2d 347, 350-51 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460                 U.S. 1039\n(1983), with Edward Leasing Corp. v. Uhlig & Assocs.,               Inc., 785\nF.2d 877, 888-89 (11th Cir. 1986).\n     3\n      Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Turbine Serv., Inc., 674 F.2d 401,\n410 (5th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom, 459 U.S. 1036 (1982); Alcoa\nS.S. Co. v. Charles Ferran & Co., 383 F.2d 46, 55 (5th Cir. 1967),\ncert. denied, 393 U.S. 836 (1968); see also Diesel \"Repower\", Inc.\nv. Islander Invs. Ltd., 271 F.3d 1318, 1325 (11th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                    -5-\n\fshipyard's negligence.   So La Esperanza's dicta, however read,\n\ncannot control the present case.   See United States v. Barnes, 251\n\nF.3d 251, 258 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 967 (2001).    In\n\nour view, the better rule is that an exculpatory clause limited to\n\nbarring liability for ordinary negligence would be valid, assuming\n\nit were not inflicted by a monopolist or one with greatly superior\n\nbargaining power.\n\n          Broadley does not claim that Marina had undue bargaining\n\npower--presumably because there are alternative marinas in the\n\ngeneral area--but this is not the end of the inquiry.   There is no\n\ndoubt that the clause as written is vastly overbroad and against\n\npublic policy insofar as it purports to absolve Marina of liability\n\nfor gross negligence, recklessness and intentional wrongdoing.4\n\nThus, the question remains whether a court should be willing to\n\nnarrow the clause and apply it only to the extent that it excludes\n\nliability for simple negligence.\n\n          The district court said that it would \"reform\" the\n\nclause, narrowing it to apply only to negligence; but reformation\n\nis normally appropriate where the language somehow fails to express\n\nthe actual intention of the parties and is conformed merely to\n\nreflect their actual intent or, where the contents have been\n\n\n     4\n      Royal Ins. Co. v. Southwest Marine, 194 F.3d 1009, 1016 (9th\nCir. 1999) (exculpatory clause in admiralty contract may not limit\nliability for gross negligence); La Esperanza, 124 F.3d at 19\n(same); Prosser & Keeton on Torts § 68, at 484 (same in common law\ncontext).\n\n                               -6-\n\ffraudulently misrepresented by one party, to conform the contract\n\nto the terms conveyed to the defrauded party.              See Restatement\n\n(Second) Contracts §§ 155, 166; 2 Farnsworth on Contracts § 7.5.\n\nNeither situation is present here.\n\n            The doctrine pertinent where a contract provision is\n\nunlawfully overbroad is that which permits a court to sever or\n\ndivide provisions that are unlawful as written, retaining those\n\nprovisions    or   applications   of       them    that   are   permissible.\n\n2 Farnsworth on Contracts § 5.8.       State law is not uniform, but a\n\nmodern version of the doctrine, as reflected in the Restatement\n\n(Second) of Contracts § 184 (emphasis added) provides:\n\n            A court may treat only part of a term as\n            unenforceable . . . if the party who seeks to\n            enforce the term obtained it in good faith and\n            in accordance with reasonable standards of\n            fair dealing.\n\n            One of the illustrations makes clear that where the\n\nparties actually negotiated an overbroad exculpatory clause that\n\nclearly   encompasses   negligence,    a    good   case   can   be   made   for\n\nnarrowing it to apply only to negligence, id. § 184 illus. 4; but\n\nanother comment, arguably more pertinent here, says that \"[t]he\n\nfact that the [overbroad] term is contained in a standard form\n\nsupplied by the dominant party argues against aiding him in this\n\nrequest.\"    Id. § 184 cmt. b.\n\n            There is no finding in this case as to the good or bad\n\nfaith of the marina owner. Quite possibly this was a form contract\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fof a kind often furnished by trade associations seeking to give\n\ntheir members every advantage.         In all events, we will assume that\n\nthere was no subjective bad faith by Marina. Instead, the question\n\nfor us is whether the clause represents fair dealing so that a\n\njudicial narrowing is sound public policy.\n\n            The   substantial    overbreadth      of     the   clause    has    two\n\nnegative consequences. Obviously such a clause can discourage\n\nperfectly    legitimate     claims-–e.g.,       for    gross     negligence      or\n\ndeliberate wrongdoing--from ever being brought by the injured\n\nparty.   The injured slip-renter often has ample reason to hesitate\n\nabout suing--time, uncertainty, expenses--especially where, as\n\nhere, the contract provides for attorney's fees to Marina for\n\nbreach of the agreement not to sue.\n\n            A second concern is that the clause never says that it\n\nexempts Marina from negligence.              The language used, although\n\nbroader, is also blander: there is no reference to fault; and,\n\nalthough the clause literally encompasses negligence, Sander, 334\n\nF.3d at 716, it is less likely to convey an effective warning to\n\nthe reader than would a clear and specific disclaimer of liability\n\nfor negligence.\n\n            Finally, Marina does not suggest that there was actual\n\nnegotiation about such terms. If the negligence issue had been the\n\nsubject of actual bargaining and discussion, we might well have a\n\ndifferent   reaction;     but   this   is    evidently    a    typical   case    of\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fboilerplate.        Boilerplate even in contracts of adhesion is not\n\nautomatically unlawful; but it is a relevant consideration in\n\ndeciding whether to rescue the contract from overbreadth.                       See,\n\ne.g., Richards v. Richards, 513 N.W.2d 118, 123 (Wis. 1994);\n\nRestatement (Second) Contracts § 184 cmt. b.\n\n              The   case   law   is   not     very    helpful      in providing a\n\ncontrolling      answer.    There     are    two    admiralty     cases    in   other\n\ncircuits sharing our reading of Bisso that have narrowed such\n\nclauses;5 but neither addresses specifically the considerations of\n\nconcern to us.        Cases applying state law are divided, with some\n\ncourts narrowing such clauses and others declining to do so very\n\nmuch for the reasons we have already given.6                    We find the latter\n\nmore persuasive.\n\n              The marina agreement in this case has, as part of the\n\nboilerplate, a severability clause.                But the same public policy\n\nconcerns we have described lead us to reject the application of\n\nthis clause to rescue the overbroad exculpatory clause. Otherwise,\n\nthe   narrow    and   explicit   language,         which   we    think    should   be\n\n\n\n\n      5\n          Sander, 334 F.3d at 716; Royal Ins. Co., 194 F.3d at 1014.\n      6\n      Compare, e.g., In re Pacific Adventures, Inc., 27 F. Supp. 2d\n1223, 1224-25 (D. Haw. 1998) (applying Hawaii law), and Richards,\n513 N.W.2d at 122-23, with Harmon v. Mt. Hood Meadows, Ltd., 932\nP.2d 92, 95-96 (Or. Ct. App. 1997), and Swartzentruber v. Wee-K\nCorp., 690 N.E.2d 941, 944-46 (Ohio Ct. App.), appeal denied, 678\nN.E.2d 1231 (1997).\n\n                                       -9-\n\frequired, could be side-stepped by leaving the broad language in\n\nplace and including the severability clause as a companion.\n\n            In declining to narrow the exculpatory clause, we rely on\n\nthe extreme overbreadth of the clause and the plainness of its\n\nillegality, the boilerplate character of the contract and lack of\n\nspecific negotiation, the absence of an explicit reference to\n\nnegligence which would provide better warning, and the attorney's\n\nfees clause.       Any competent lawyer could write a straightforward\n\nexclusion of liability for negligence that we would sustain.\n\n            Only    some   elements    of    this   analysis   were   made   by\n\nBroadley.   In the district court a simple overbreadth argument was\n\nadverted to; in this court Broadley stresses lack of clarity.                A\n\nlitigant is not expected to guess just how a court will explain its\n\nresult; but it would be easy enough for us to avoid the issue and\n\nto affirm on the ground that the overbreadth argument was not\n\nadequately developed and is therefore forfeit.             United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1082\n\n(1990).\n\n            But the forfeiture doctrine is not an absolute limitation\n\non judicial power but a prudential limitation subject to the\n\nreviewing court's discretion. Indeed, a court may, although rarely\n\nwill, forgive a knowing waiver where extreme injustice would be\n\ndone.    United States v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).    Here, it is important that the validity issue be resolved\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\ffor the sake of future case law, and invalidity is the juster\n\nresult.\n\n            The only concern where the court develops issues not\n\nadequately argued is that a party not apprised may have arguments\n\nagainst the court's reasoning. But in this instance an overbreadth\n\nclaim as such was raised in the district court and we know what\n\nMarina said in response.        Similarly, we are especially open in\n\ncases of this kind to petitions for rehearing and are ready to\n\nrevise reasoning and result if this is warranted.\n\n            With that qualification, we reverse the decision of the\n\ndistrict court and remand for further proceedings. No criticism of\n\nthe very able district judge is intended; we are dealing with\n\npoorly    developed   and   confusing    admiralty   law   in   aggravated\n\ncircumstances, and the district court did not receive much help.\n\nEach side will bear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\f",

The OWNER . . . agree[s] and covenant[s] that [he] will defend, indemnify and save MARINA harmless from any and all of such claims, demands, causes of action, judgments and executions, and the MARINA shall be entitled to responsible attorneys fees in the event of breach of the OWNER's covenant hereunder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marina claimed that this exculpatory clause precluded Broadley from bringing suit for personal injury due to Marina's negligence. Broadley responded that under admiralty law, a party may limit but may not completely absolve itself from liability for ordinary negligence; and that the clause was over-broad and therefore unenforceable insofar as it absolved Marina of liability for gross negligence and intentional wrongdoing. Because of its connection to maritime activities, the clause is governed by federal admiralty law. <i>S.C. State Ports Auth. v. Silver Anchor, S.A.,</i> 23 F.3d 842, 846 n. 3 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued summary judgment in Marina's favor, holding that the clause should be reformed to limit it to ordinary negligence. Broadley had conceded that Marina's negligence did not rise to the level of gross negligence, so as reformed the clause barred his claim. This appeal followed. We review grants of summary judgment de novo. <i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir. 2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broadley's main argument on appeal is that, under admiralty law, a party may not completely absolve itself of liability for ordinary negligence; for support, Broadley cites the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corp.,</i> 349 U.S. 85, 75 S.Ct. 629, 99 L.Ed. 911 (1955), and our own decision in <i>La Esperanza de P.R., Inc. v. Perez Y Cia de P.R., Inc.,</i> 124 F.3d 10 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bisso</i> could be read as laying down a flat rule, applicable to all cases, forbidding clauses that entirely exculpate a party for its own simple negligence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> However, <i>Bisso</i> focused on towing contracts and the special threat of \"monopolistic compulsions.\" 349 U.S. at 91, 75 S.Ct. 629. The Court also cited case law forbidding exculpatory clauses in common law relationships where unequal bargaining power is presumed (e.g., utilities and their customers). 349 U.S. at 90-91, 75 S.Ct. 629. Thus <i>Bisso</i> can easily be read as limited to relationships where unequal power is inherent or established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agreements to waive claims for mere negligence are generally enforceable at common law. <i>See</i> Keeton et al., <i>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts</i> &#167; 68, at 482-83 (5th ed.1984). Qualifications exist &#8212; the relevant doctrines are unconscionability and contracts of adhesion &#8212; turning on factors like adequate disclosure, relative bargaining power and the like. 1-2 Farnsworth, <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167;&#167; 4.26, 4.28, 5.2 (3d ed.2004). But an admiralty rule, flatly preventing parties from contracting away claims for simple negligence in all circumstances, would be surprising.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Bisso,</i> decisions in other circuits have addressed this issue in admiralty cases but no consensus exists as to how <i>Bisso</i> should be read. Two circuits would allow a release from all liability for negligence (at least in the dockage context) and one circuit arguably would not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Another circuit has upheld exculpatory clauses that limited but did not entirely preclude liability for negligence; but in our case the clause completely exculpates from such liability, so this last circuit's cases are distinguishable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for this circuit, the main thrust of the language in <i>La Esperanza</i> was to uphold exculpatory clauses directed to mere negligence so long as \"expressed clearly in contracts entered into freely by parties of equal bargaining power.\" The sentence ended with the phrase: \"provided that the clause not provide for a total absolution of liability.\" 124 F.3d at 19. But this may simply mean (unexceptionally) that parties cannot contract out of gross negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did <i>La Esperanza hold</i> invalid a properly disclosed clause, not unfairly imposed, waiving all claims for all negligence. The decision upheld application of a clause barring recovery for lost profits or lost use of vessel caused by a shipyard's negligence. So <i>La Esperanza's</i> dicta, however read, cannot control the present case. <i>See United States v. Barnes,</i> 251 F.3d 251, 258 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 534 U.S. 967, 122 S.Ct. 379, 151 L.Ed.2d 289 (2001). In our view, the better rule is that an exculpatory clause limited to barring liability for ordinary negligence would be valid, assuming it were not inflicted by a monopolist or one with greatly superior bargaining power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broadley does not claim that Marina had undue bargaining power&#8212;presumably because there are alternative marinas in the general area&#8212;but this is not the end of the inquiry. There is no doubt that the clause as written is vastly overbroad and against public policy insofar as it purports to absolve Marina of liability for gross negligence, recklessness and intentional wrongdoing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, the question remains whether a court should be willing to narrow the clause and apply it only to the extent that it excludes liability for simple negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court said that it would \"reform\" the clause, narrowing it to apply only to negligence; but reformation is normally appropriate where the language somehow fails to express the actual intention of the parties and is conformed merely to reflect their actual intent or, where the contents have been fraudulently misrepresented by one party, to conform the contract to the terms conveyed to the defrauded party. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) Contracts &#167;&#167; 155, 166; 2 <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 7.5. Neither situation is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine pertinent where a contract provision is unlawfully overbroad is that which <i>permits</i> a court to sever or divide provisions that are unlawful as written, retaining those provisions or applications of them that are permissible. 2 <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 5.8. State law is not uniform, but a modern version of the doctrine, as reflected in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 184 (emphasis added) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court <i>may</i> treat only part of a term as unenforceable . . . if the party who seeks to enforce the term obtained it in good faith and in accordance with <i>reasonable standards of fair dealing.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the illustrations makes clear that where the parties actually negotiated an overbroad exculpatory clause that clearly encompasses negligence, a good case can be made for narrowing it to apply only to negligence, <i>id.</i> &#167; 184 illus. 4; but another comment, arguably more pertinent here, says that \"[t]he fact that the [overbroad] term is contained in a standard form supplied by the dominant party argues against aiding him in this request.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 184 cmt. b.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no finding in this case as to the good or bad faith of the marina owner. Quite possibly this was a form contract of a kind often furnished by trade associations seeking to give their members every advantage. In all events, we will assume that there was no subjective bad faith by Marina. Instead, the question for us is whether the clause represents fair dealing so that a judicial narrowing is sound public policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantial overbreadth of the clause has two negative consequences. Obviously such a clause can discourage perfectly legitimate claims &#8212; <i>e.g.,</i> for gross negligence or deliberate wrongdoing &#8212; from ever being brought by the injured party. The injured slip-renter often has ample reason to hesitate about suing &#8212; time, uncertainty, expenses &#8212; especially where, as here, the contract provides for attorney's fees to Marina for breach of the agreement not to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second concern is that the clause never says that it exempts Marina from negligence. The language used, although broader, is also blander: there is no reference to fault; and, although the clause literally encompasses negligence, <i>Sander,</i> 334 F.3d at 716, it is less likely to convey an <i>effective</i> warning to the reader than would a clear and specific disclaimer of liability for <i>negligence.</i> Finally, Marina does not suggest that there was actual negotiation about such terms. If the negligence issue had been the subject of actual bargaining and discussion, we might well have a different reaction; but this is evidently a typical case of boilerplate. Boilerplate even in contracts of adhesion is not automatically unlawful; but it is a relevant consideration in deciding whether to rescue the contract from overbreadth. <i>See, e.g., Richards v. Richards,</i> 181 Wis.2d 1007, 513 N.W.2d 118, 123 (1994); Restatement (Second) Contracts &#167; 184 cmt. b.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law is not very helpful in providing a controlling answer. There are two admiralty cases in other circuits sharing our reading of <i>Bisso</i> that have narrowed such clauses;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> but neither addresses specifically the considerations of concern to us. Cases applying state law are divided, with some courts narrowing such clauses and others declining to do so very much for the reasons we have already given.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We find the latter more persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The marina agreement in this case has, as part of the boilerplate, a severability clause. But the same public policy concerns we have described lead us to reject the application of this clause to rescue the overbroad exculpatory clause. Otherwise, the narrow and explicit language, which we think should be required, could be side-stepped by leaving the broad language in place and including the severability clause as a companion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In declining to narrow the exculpatory clause, we rely on the extreme overbreadth of the clause and the plainness of its illegality, the boilerplate character of the contract and lack of specific negotiation, the absence of an explicit reference to negligence which would provide better warning, and the attorney's fees clause. Any competent lawyer could write a straightforward exclusion of liability for negligence that we would sustain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only some elements of this analysis were made by Broadley. In the district court a simple overbreadth argument was adverted to; in this court Broadley stresses lack of clarity. A litigant is not expected to guess just how a court will explain its result; but it would be easy enough for us to avoid the issue and to affirm on the ground that the overbreadth argument was not adequately developed and is therefore forfeit. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 494 U.S. 1082, 110 S.Ct. 1814, 108 L.Ed.2d 944 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the forfeiture doctrine is not an absolute limitation on judicial power but a prudential limitation subject to the reviewing court's discretion. Indeed, a court may, although rarely will, forgive a knowing waiver where extreme injustice would be done. <i>United States v. La Guardia,</i> 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir.1990). Here, it is important that the validity issue be resolved for the sake of future case law, and invalidity is the juster result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only concern where the court develops issues not adequately argued is that a party not apprised may have arguments against the court's reasoning. But in this instance an overbreadth claim as such was raised in the district court and we know what Marina said in response. Similarly, we are especially open in cases of this kind to petitions for rehearing and are ready to revise reasoning and result if this is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With that qualification, we <i>reverse</i> the decision of the district court and <i>remand</i> for further proceedings. No criticism of the very able district judge is intended; we are dealing with poorly developed and confusing admiralty law in aggravated circumstances, and the district court did not receive much help. Each side will bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Court applied the \"judicial rule, based on public policy, invalidating contracts releasing towers from all liability for their negligence,\" and noted that \"[t]his rule is merely a particular application to the towage business of a general rule long used by courts and legislatures to prevent enforcement of release-from-negligence contracts.\"<i>Bisso,</i> 349 U.S. at 90, 75 S.Ct. 629.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> <i>Compare Sander v.

The gap between the docks is about two to three inches wide when the water is calm, but the wake of a passing boat can cause the docks to move and the gap to widen. Broadley fractured his ankle and was left with a permanent loss of function.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broadley alleged that Marina's negligence caused the accident: the space between docks was a potential hazard that could have been mitigated either by using a flexible material to cover the gap or by tying the docks together more tightly. Marina denied liability, citing the boilerplate exculpatory clause of the contract for seasonal mooring between the parties. That clause read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OWNER [Broadley] warrants and [covenants] that . . . the OWNER . . . will [not] make any claims, demands, causes of action of any kind and nature, or obtain or enforce any judgments, executions or levies thereon . . . against MARINA, its officers, directors, agents, servants, or its employees, arising out of any damage, loss, personal injury or death suffered by [him]. . . . The OWNER . . . agree[s] and covenant[s] that [he] will defend, indemnify and save MARINA harmless from any and all of such claims, demands, causes of action, judgments and executions, and the MARINA shall be entitled to responsible attorneys fees in the event of breach of the OWNER's covenant hereunder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marina claimed that this exculpatory clause precluded Broadley from bringing suit for personal injury due to Marina's negligence. Broadley responded that under admiralty law, a party may limit but may not completely absolve itself from liability for ordinary negligence; and that the clause was over-broad and therefore unenforceable insofar as it absolved Marina of liability for gross negligence and intentional wrongdoing. Because of its connection to maritime activities, the clause is governed by federal admiralty law. <i>S.C. State Ports Auth. v.

The Court also cited case law forbidding exculpatory clauses in common law relationships where unequal bargaining power is presumed (e.g., utilities and their customers). 349 U.S. at 90-91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105300\"><a href=\"/opinion/105300/bisso-v-inland-waterways-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus <i>Bisso</i> can easily be read as limited to relationships where unequal power is inherent or established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agreements to waive claims for mere negligence are generally enforceable at common law. <i>See</i> Keeton et al., <i>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts</i> &#167; 68, at 482-83 (5th ed.1984). Qualifications exist &#8212; the relevant doctrines are unconscionability and contracts of adhesion &#8212; turning on factors like adequate disclosure, relative bargaining power and the like. 1-2 Farnsworth, <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167;&#167; 4.26, 4.28, 5.2 (3d ed.2004). But an admiralty rule, flatly preventing parties from contracting away claims for simple negligence in all circumstances, would be surprising.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since <i>Bisso,</i> decisions in other circuits have addressed this issue in admiralty cases but no consensus exists as to how <i>Bisso</i> should be read. Two circuits would allow a release from all liability for negligence (at least in the dockage context) and one circuit arguably would not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Another circuit has upheld exculpatory clauses that limited but did not entirely preclude liability for negligence; but in our case the clause completely exculpates from such liability, so this last circuit's cases are distinguishable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for this circuit, the main thrust of the language in <i>La Esperanza</i> was to uphold exculpatory clauses directed to mere negligence so long as \"expressed clearly in contracts entered into freely by parties of equal bargaining power.\" The sentence ended with the phrase: \"provided that the clause not provide for a total absolution of liability.\" 124 F.3d at 19. But this may simply mean (unexceptionally) that parties cannot contract out of gross negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did <i>La Esperanza hold</i> invalid a properly disclosed clause, not unfairly imposed, waiving all claims for all negligence. The decision upheld application of a clause barring recovery for lost profits or lost use of vessel caused by a shipyard's negligence. So <i>La Esperanza's</i> dicta, however read, cannot control the present case. <i>See United States v. Barnes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199417\"><a href=\"/opinion/199417/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span>, 258 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></span> (2001). In our view, the better rule is that an exculpatory clause limited to barring liability for ordinary negligence would be valid, assuming it were not inflicted by a monopolist or one with greatly superior bargaining power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broadley does not claim that Marina had undue bargaining power&#8212;presumably because there are alternative marinas in the general area&#8212;but this is not the end of the inquiry. There is no doubt that the clause as written is vastly overbroad and against public policy insofar as it purports to absolve Marina of liability for gross negligence, recklessness and intentional wrongdoing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, the question remains whether a court should be willing to narrow the clause and apply it only to the extent that it excludes liability for simple negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court said that it would \"reform\" the clause, narrowing it to apply only to negligence; but reformation is normally appropriate where the language somehow fails to express the actual intention of the parties and is conformed merely to reflect their actual intent or, where the contents have been fraudulently misrepresented by one party, to conform the contract to the terms conveyed to the defrauded party. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) Contracts &#167;&#167; 155, 166; 2 <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 7.5. Neither situation is present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine pertinent where a contract provision is unlawfully overbroad is that which <i>permits</i> a court to sever or divide provisions that are unlawful as written, retaining those provisions or applications of them that are permissible. 2 <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 5.8. State law is not uniform, but a modern version of the doctrine, as reflected in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 184 (emphasis added) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court <i>may</i> treat only part of a term as unenforceable . . . if the party who seeks to enforce the term obtained it in good faith and in accordance with <i>reasonable standards of fair dealing.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the illustrations makes clear that where the parties actually negotiated an overbroad exculpatory clause that clearly encompasses negligence, a good case can be made for narrowing it to apply only to negligence, <i>id.</i> &#167; 184 illus. 4; but another comment, arguably more pertinent here, says that \"[t]he fact that the [overbroad] term is contained in a standard form supplied by the dominant party argues against aiding him in this request.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 184 cmt. b.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no finding in this case as to the good or bad faith of the marina owner. Quite possibly this was a form contract of a kind often furnished by trade associations seeking to give their members every advantage. In all events, we will assume that there was no subjective bad faith by Marina. Instead, the question for us is whether the clause represents fair dealing so that a judicial narrowing is sound public policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantial overbreadth of the clause has two negative consequences. Obviously such a clause can discourage perfectly legitimate claims &#8212; <i>e.g.,</i> for gross negligence or deliberate wrongdoing &#8212; from ever being brought by the injured party. The injured slip-renter often has ample reason to hesitate about suing &#8212; time, uncertainty, expenses &#8212; especially where, as here, the contract provides for attorney's fees to Marina for breach of the agreement not to sue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second concern is that the clause never says that it exempts Marina from negligence. The language used, although broader, is also blander: there is no reference to fault; and, although the clause literally encompasses negligence, <i>Sander,</i> 334 F.3d at 716, it is less likely to convey an <i>effective</i> warning to the reader than would a clear and specific disclaimer of liability for <i>negligence.</i> Finally, Marina does not suggest that there was actual negotiation about such terms. If the negligence issue had been the subject of actual bargaining and discussion, we might well have a different reaction; but this is evidently a typical case of boilerplate. Boilerplate even in contracts of adhesion is not automatically unlawful; but it is a relevant consideration in deciding whether to rescue the contract from overbreadth. <i>See, e.g., Richards v. Richards,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1913642\"><a href=\"/opinion/1913642/richards-v-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1913642\"><a href=\"/opinion/1913642/richards-v-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 123 (1994); Restatement (Second) Contracts &#167; 184 cmt. b.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law is not very helpful in providing a controlling answer. There are two admiralty cases in other circuits sharing our reading of <i>Bisso</i> that have narrowed such clauses;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> but neither addresses specifically the considerations of concern to us. Cases applying state law are divided, with some courts narrowing such clauses and others declining to do so very much for the reasons we have already given.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We find the latter more persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The marina agreement in this case has, as part of the boilerplate, a severability clause. But the same public policy concerns we have described lead us to reject the application of this clause to rescue the overbroad exculpatory clause. Otherwise, the narrow and explicit language, which we think should be required, could be side-stepped by leaving the broad language in place and including the severability clause as a companion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In declining to narrow the exculpatory clause, we rely on the extreme overbreadth of the clause and the plainness of its illegality, the boilerplate character of the contract and lack of specific negotiation, the absence of an explicit reference to negligence which would provide better warning, and the attorney's fees clause. Any competent lawyer could write a straightforward exclusion of liability for negligence that we would sustain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only some elements of this analysis were made by Broadley. In the district court a simple overbreadth argument was adverted to; in this court Broadley stresses lack of clarity. A litigant is not expected to guess just how a court will explain its result; but it would be easy enough for us to avoid the issue and to affirm on the ground that the overbreadth argument was not adequately developed and is therefore forfeit. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, a court may, although rarely will, forgive a knowing waiver where extreme injustice would be done. <i>United States v. La Guardia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541060\"><a href=\"/opinion/541060/united-states-v-julio-la-guardia-united-states-of-america-v-eredia/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span>, 1013 (1st Cir.1990). Here, it is important that the validity issue be resolved for the sake of future case law, and invalidity is the juster result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only concern where the court develops issues not adequately argued is that a party not apprised may have arguments against the court's reasoning. But in this instance an overbreadth claim as such was raised in the district court and we know what Marina said in response. Similarly, we are especially open in cases of this kind to petitions for rehearing and are ready to revise reasoning and result if this is warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With that qualification, we <i>reverse</i> the decision of the district court and <i>remand</i> for further proceedings. No criticism of the very able district judge is intended; we are dealing with poorly developed and confusing admiralty law in aggravated circumstances, and the district court did not receive much help. Each side will bear its own costs on this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Court applied the \"judicial rule, based on public policy, invalidating contracts releasing towers from all liability for their negligence,\" and noted that \"[t]his rule is merely a particular application to the towage business of a general rule long used by courts and legislatures to prevent enforcement of release-from-negligence contracts.\"<i>Bisso,</i> 349 U.S. at 90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105300\"><a href=\"/opinion/105300/bisso-v-inland-waterways-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
