Julissa Aponte-Rivera (\"Aponte\") sued\n\nher   former   employer,   DHL    Solutions,    Inc.    (\"DHL\"),   claiming\n\ngender-based     discrimination    and    hostile    work   environment   in\n\nviolation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2000e et seq., and Puerto Rico law.       The jury returned a verdict\n\nin favor of Aponte and awarded her emotional distress damages. The\n\ndistrict court upheld the jury's verdict, but remitted the damages\n\naward.    On appeal, DHL disputes the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the jury's verdict, the amount of the remitted damages\n\naward, and evidentiary rulings.           For the following reasons, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\nA.    Facts\n\n      Aponte began working at DHL in 2000.          By 2003, she worked as\n\na logistics operations manager, a role in which she supervised\n\nemployees, oversaw shipments and documentation, and interacted with\n\nDHL's clients.\n\n      In 2004, Enrique Frias was named regional manager and became\n\nAponte's supervisor.    In the months following his appointment, two\n\nmajor clients of DHL's Puerto Rico operation complained about DHL's\n\nperformance. Frias and other management investigated the causes of\n\nthe customer problems and implemented plans to remedy them.\n\n      In June 2004, Aponte filed a written complaint with DHL's\n\nhuman resources department.        She complained that her supervisor\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fcreated an \"uncomfortable\" work environment by giving her an\n\noverwhelming workload and making several comments with sexual\n\nconnotations.      Blanca Hernandez, a DHL human resources manager,\n\ninterviewed    Aponte      and   Frias    in   response    to   the    complaint.\n\nHernandez told Frias, \"don't get personal\" and \"focus in [sic] the\n\noperation and in work.\"           Shortly after filing this complaint,\n\nAponte took a leave of absence that lasted approximately one month.\n\n       A position for program manager became available in November\n\n2004, and Aponte applied for the position.           Aponte testified that,\n\nduring her interview with Frias, he was aggressive and would not\n\nallow her to fully answer questions. Rafael Camacho was eventually\n\nchosen for the position.\n\n       Aponte testified that Camacho, after he began working at DHL,\n\nreferred to a woman in an authority position as \"jefecita\" (\"little\n\nboss\"), and stated that women were good for household chores.                   She\n\nalso   testified    that    Camacho      generally   referred     to    women    as\n\n\"brutas,\"     or   \"dumbies.\"         Aponte    worked     with   Camacho       for\n\napproximately one month before leaving work for eleven months on a\n\nsecond leave of absence.\n\n       Aponte returned to DHL in November 2005 and was assigned to\n\nreport to Camacho. Frias and Camacho confronted Aponte, asking her\n\nwhy she returned instead of resigning.            They also said the person\n\nwho ran the operation \"had to have balls.\"                Aponte also reported\n\nthat Frias told her the logistics operation in Puerto Rico had its\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fbest year in 2005 because it was being run by a man.                          Joyce\n\nMercado, a co-employee, testified that she overheard this exchange\n\nand it was \"shameful,\" and the two men spoke to Aponte in very loud\n\ntones.   She said that Frias and Camacho generally spoke to male\n\nemployees \"appropriately,\" and would \"treat them okay,\" which was\n\ndifferent from how they treated female employees.\n\n     Over the next few months, Camacho gave Aponte a verbal warning\n\nand a written warning regarding her performance at work.                   In March\n\n2006, Aponte again complained to human resources, stating she felt\n\n\"discriminated       based   on    gender,    overwhelmed,       distressed    and\n\npressured    labor    wise.\"       Maude    Cesari,    a   DHL   human   resources\n\nemployee, went to the office later that month to resolve the\n\ncomplaint.    Shortly after their meeting, Aponte thanked Cesari and\n\nsaid she had noticed a positive change.\n\n     However, Aponte took another leave of absence a month later,\n\nand ultimately resigned from DHL on June 17.                     Her resignation\n\nletter stated that her resignation was involuntary but necessary\n\ndue to the gender discrimination she suffered at work that left her\n\n\"in an emotional deterioration.\"\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n     Aponte    brought       a    hostile    work     environment    and    gender\n\ndiscrimination claim against DHL, pursuant to Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 and various laws of the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico.    During trial, DHL moved for judgment as a matter of\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\flaw,       which   was   granted   for    some   claims   but    denied   for   the\n\ngender-based hostile work environment claim.                    After a four-day\n\ntrial, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of Aponte and awarded\n\nher $350,000 in emotional distress damages.1\n\n       DHL renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and\n\nasked the district court to set aside the verdict.                        It also\n\nrequested, in the alternative, that a new trial or remittitur be\n\ngranted.       The district court found there was sufficient evidence\n\nfor a reasonable jury to find in Aponte's favor, and a new trial\n\nwas not warranted. However, the court determined that \"[w]hile the\n\nevidence produced at trial regarding Defendant's liability for a\n\nhostile      work   environment     was     sufficient,   similar   evidence    is\n\nlacking to support the damages awarded.\"                  After reviewing the\n\nevidence      and   comparing      awards    from   similar   cases,   the   court\n\nremitted the award from $350,000 to $200,000.2\n\n       On appeal, DHL maintains that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport Aponte's hostile work environment claim, and alternatively,\n\nthat the award should be further remitted.                DHL also argues that\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Pursuant to Puerto Rico law, the district court applied\nmandatory doubling of damages provisions to the Commonwealth\nclaims, and awarded $1.00 to the Title VII claim, resulting in a\ntotal award of $699,999.\n       2\n       After applying the doubling required by Puerto Rico law, as\nwell as attorneys' fees awarded separately, the remitted award\namounts to $449,998.75.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fthe district court made evidentiary errors that require a new\n\ntrial.\n\n                                             II.\n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n     i.      Standard of Review\n\n     When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, a jury's\n\nverdict \"must be upheld unless the facts and inferences, viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, point so strongly and\n\noverwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could\n\nnot have returned the verdict.\"                Astro-Med, Inc. v. Nihon Kohden\n\nAm., Inc., 591 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).         Our analysis \"is weighted toward preservation of\n\nthe jury verdict.\" Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc.,\n\n399 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n     ii.     Analysis\n\n     Title     VII      of     the   Civil    Rights   Act   of   1964    prohibits\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex with respect to the terms,\n\nconditions,        or        privileges      of    employment.           42    U.S.C.\n\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1).         The plaintiff must establish that (1) she is a\n\nmember of a protected class; (2) she was subjected to unwelcome\n\nharassment; (3) the harassment was based upon gender; (4) the\n\nharassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive that it altered the\n\nconditions    of     her      employment     and   created   an   abusive     working\n\nenvironment; (5) the offending conduct was both objectively and\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fsubjectively offensive; and (6) some basis for employer liability\n\nhas been established.   Douglas v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc., 474 F.3d\n\n10, 15 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n     \"When   the   workplace   is     permeated   with   discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and\n\ncreate an abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.\"\n\nHarris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993).               This\n\nstandard \"takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct\n\nthat is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a\n\ntangible psychological injury.\"       Id.   The conduct must create an\n\nobjectively hostile work environment, as well as the plaintiff's\n\nsubjective perception that the environment is abusive.          Id. at\n\n21-22.\n\n     This is not a \"mathematically precise test,\" and whether an\n\nenvironment is \"hostile\" or \"abusive\" is determined by looking at\n\nall the circumstances. Id. at 22-23. Relevant factors may include\n\nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether\n\nit is physically threatening or humiliating as opposed to a mere\n\noffensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interferes with an\n\nemployee's work performance.   Id. at 23.     While psychological harm\n\nmay be taken into account, no single factor is required.       Id.\n\n     DHL argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish\n\nthat any harassment Aponte experienced was severe and pervasive.\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fDHL further contends that Aponte fails to show she was treated\n\ndifferently because of her gender, and maintains that many of the\n\ncomments made to Aponte could be interpreted in a way that does not\n\nrefer to women.     It argues that \"rudeness or ostracism, standing\n\nalone, usually is not enough to support a hostile work environment\n\nclaim.\"   See Noviello v. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 92 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n     Aponte     testified    that    Frias    and   Camacho     made   several\n\ngender-based comments to her, including:            \"that what he had been\n\ntaught was that women were supposed to do [] household chores\";\n\n\"the person who ran this operation had to have balls to run the\n\noperation\"; referring to a female executive as \"jefecita,\" or\n\n\"little boss\"; stating that the operation had to be run by a man;\n\ngenerally referring to women as \"brutas,\" or \"dumbies\"; and asking\n\nher if she was a \"pendeja,\" a pejorative term used to refer to\n\nwomen. She also maintained that Frias and Camacho \"didn't have any\n\nwillingness\" to train her on certain tasks. She testified that she\n\ntook a leave of absence because of the emotional hardship she\n\nexperienced.\n\n     Aponte filed two internal complaints with DHL Human Resources.\n\nIn the second complaint, she wrote that \"the work environment has\n\nbecome completely hostile and without respect to my person, I feel\n\ndiscriminated     based     on   gender,     overwhelmed,     distressed   and\n\npressured labor wise.\"           She felt \"completely disoriented\" and\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f\"constantly deprived of authority by Rafael Camacho.\"     She also\n\nfelt that there \"really is no change as to my feelings since I\n\nreported ill [] January 10, 2005 and my return on November 21,\n\n2005.   On the contrary, I feel more discriminated than before[.]\n\nI feel at all times the discrimination for reasons of gender.\"\n\n     Mercado testified that the way Camacho and Frias communicated\n\nwith Aponte \"was not very good,\" \"shameful,\" and \"[t]hey would\n\nspeak to her in a very loud tone, and the way they treated her\n\nwasn't the best.\" She also overheard Frias and Camacho \"screaming\"\n\nat Aponte.   When Frias and Camacho spoke to Aponte, \"the tones of\n\nvoice would be very loud, they would be very disrespectful.\"     By\n\ncontrast, Frias's and Camacho's communication with male employees\n\nwas \"normal,\" which \"was different than how I saw that it was\n\ntoward the women, the girls there.\"\n\n     Both Frias and Camacho denied saying those comments, and DHL\n\noffered a different interpretation of the work situation.      They\n\nasserted that Aponte was treated differently because of her poor\n\nwork performance, rather than gender.    They claimed that clients\n\ncomplained about Aponte's performance.\n\n     Viewing the evidence presented in the light most favorable to\n\nAponte, a reasonable jury could have determined that Frias and\n\nCamacho subjected Aponte to discriminatory intimidation, ridicule,\n\nand insult sufficiently pervasive to alter the condition of her\n\nemployment and create a hostile work environment.   See Harris, 510\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fU.S. at 21; Astro-Med, 591 F.3d at 13.              It was the jury's role to\n\ndetermine witness credibility, and the verdict indicates that the\n\njury believed Aponte's version of the work environment and its\n\neffect on her.    This case does not present a situation in which the\n\nevidence \"so strongly and overwhelmingly\" supports DHL's position\n\nthat we should disturb the jury's verdict. See Astro-Med, 519 F.3d\n\nat 13; Rodriguez-Torres, 399 F.3d at 57; cf. Alvarez-Fonseca v.\n\nPepsi Cola, 152 F.3d 17, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n     iii. DHL's Faragher Defense\n\n     An    employer    is    vicariously      liable       for   a   supervisor's\n\nharassment of an employee. Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524\n\nU.S. 742, 745 (1998).       The Faragher affirmative defense shields an\n\nemployer   from   such      liability   if    (1)    the    employer    exercised\n\nreasonable care to prevent and correct harassment, and (2) the\n\nemployee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or\n\ncorrective opportunities provided by the employer.                   Faragher v.\n\nCity of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 807 (1998).\n\n     DHL argues that, even taking Aponte's version of the facts as\n\ntrue, the jury unreasonably rejected DHL's Faragher defense.                  It\n\nmaintains that the company acted promptly and appropriately, and\n\nthe March 30 email shows that it improved Aponte's situation.\n\n     Aponte    filed     her    initial      complaint      in   November    2004\n\ncomplaining of Frias's unprofessional behavior, which prompted\n\nHernandez to interview both Aponte and Frias.               Two years later, in\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fMarch 2006, Aponte filed a second complaint with Cesari.                        Cesari\n\nmet with Aponte and Camacho later that month.                On March 30, 2006,\n\nAponte sent Cesari an email thanking her for intervening and\n\nreporting that the situation had improved.\n\n      Aponte later testified that the harassment at work only\n\ntemporarily improved after the meeting, and the situation soon\n\n\"turned totally hostile.\"          Specifically, she felt \"pressure\" from\n\nthe     work    tasks     given    her,    and     Camacho    and      Frias      were\n\n\"underestimating\"         her,     being   \"disrespectful\"        to      her,     and\n\n\"constantly\" pressuring her about backlogged work.                  Aponte took a\n\nleave of absence in April 2006, and eventually resigned from her\n\nposition at DHL in June 2006.          She maintains that her decision not\n\nto    file     another    formal     complaint     prior     to   resigning       was\n\nunderstandable, given the fact that her prior complaints \"had only\n\nresulted in a worsening of her circumstances.\"\n\n      A reasonable jury could find that Aponte availed herself of\n\nDHL's    corrective      opportunities     without   experiencing         a   lasting\n\nimprovement in her work situation.               She complained in writing on\n\ntwo separate occasions, and testified that she ultimately had to\n\nquit her job in order to avoid the hostile situation.                  See White v.\n\nN. H. Dep't of Corrections, 221 F.3d 254, 261-62 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(\"The record contains evidence from which the jury could have\n\nconcluded      that     the   [employer]    did    not   handle     the       internal\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\finvestigation properly or timely, and that the [employer] allowed\n\nthe conduct and comments to continue.\").\n\n      A   juror   could   certainly   reach    the   opposite    conclusion,\n\nparticularly given the conflicting content of Aponte's March 30\n\nletter.    However, \"[d]etermining what constitutes a 'prompt and\n\nappropriate' employer response to allegations of sexual harassment\n\noften requires the sort of case-specific, fact-intensive analysis\n\nbest left to a jury.\"        Forrest v. Brinker Int'l Payroll Co., 511\n\nF.3d 225, 232 (1st Cir. 2007).         Moreover, it was DHL's burden to\n\nshow its actions both corrected and prevented further harassment.\n\nSee Burlington, 524 U.S. at 745.           Thus, DHL's entitlement to the\n\nFaragher defense is not \"so clearly against the weight of the\n\nevidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"               See\n\nAstro-Med, 591 F.3d at 13.\n\nB.    Remittitur\n\n      We may overturn a damages award only if it is \"grossly\n\nexcessive or so high as to shock the conscience of this court.\"\n\nRodriguez-Garcia v. Miranda-Marin, 610 F.3d 756, 773 (1st Cir.\n\n2010) (quoting Valentin-Almeyda v. Mun. of Aguadilla, 447 F.3d 85,\n\n103 (1st Cir. 2006)).        We afford \"broad discretion\" to the trial\n\ncourt's decision, because of that court's \"greater familiarity with\n\nlocal community standards and with the witnesses' demeanor at the\n\ntrial.\"    Id.    \"We will not disturb an award of damages because it\n\nis   extremely    generous    or   because    we   think   the   damages   are\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fconsiderably less.\"   Koster v. Trans World Airlines, 181 F.3d 24,\n\n34 (1st Cir. 1999).   \"Where the trial court already has invoked its\n\ndiscretion in granting a remittitur, the scope of review is even\n\nnarrower than usual.\"     Sanchez v. P.R. Oil Co., 37 F.3d 712, 724\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n      Here, the district court remitted the jury's award from\n\n$350,000 to $200,000, explaining in length its reasons for doing\n\nso.   The court found that although the evidence produced at trial\n\nwas sufficient to show a hostile work environment, the evidence did\n\nnot support the amount of damages awarded. The court described the\n\nsource of the emotional distress as \"at best, mixed.\"               Aponte\n\nexperienced    distress   due   to    mental   health   issues,   physical\n\nailments, and general work stress in addition to the stress from\n\nher hostile work environment.         Moreover, Aponte suffered from a\n\nback problem, and DHL's business was expanding during the relevant\n\ntime period.     Additionally, the court explained that economic\n\ndamages such as claims for failure to promote, front pay, back pay,\n\nand constructive discharge were not part of the verdict.\n\n      The court also pointed out that Aponte \"did not introduce any\n\ntestimony by a medical expert,\" \"presented no notable evidence of\n\noutward manifestations of emotional distress,\" and \"presented no\n\nevidence of long term depression or medical treatment.\"           \"Although\n\ntestimony from a mental health expert is not required to sustain an\n\naward for emotional distress, the absence of such evidence is\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fuseful in comparing the injury to the award of damages.\"                Koster,\n\n181 F.3d at 35.\n\n     Awards in comparable cases are instructive.            The plaintiff in\n\nSanchez,   who   was   discriminated       against    because   of    his   age,\n\ntestified about the humiliation he suffered from losing his job and\n\nfiling for bankruptcy, but failed to present any medical testimony\n\nregarding his mental condition.       37 F.3d at 724.       The jury awarded\n\nhim $150,000 in emotional distress damages.                Id. at 723.       The\n\ndistrict court reduced the award to $37,500, and we affirmed.                Id.\n\nat 726.    We held that, although emotional damages are warranted\n\neven without medical or psychiatric evidence, the lack of such\n\nevidence is relevant to the amount of the award.            Id. at 724 n.13.\n\n     In Rodriguez-Garcia, the jury awarded the plaintiff $350,000\n\nfor emotional pain and suffering related to a retaliatory demotion.\n\n610 F.3d at 760.       The plaintiff, as well as her psychiatrist,\n\ntestified that she experienced depression.             Id. at 773.     We held\n\nthat, \"[a]lthough generous, the award of $350,000 was not grossly\n\nexcessive or so high as to shock the conscience.\"                  Id. at 774.\n\nAdditionally, the amount of the award was similar to noneconomic\n\ncompensatory     damages   awards   we      upheld    in   other     employment\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation contexts.             Id.\n\n     In Monteagudo v. Asociacion de Empleados del Estado Libre\n\nAsociado de Puerto Rico, 554 F.3d 164 (1st Cir. 2009), we upheld a\n\n$333,000 damages award in a sexual harassment case. Id. at 174-75.\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fThe plaintiff testified that she was harassed by a male supervisor,\n\nmaking her work conditions intolerable.                  Id. at 168.     She stated\n\nthat she suffered from depression, cried every evening, and was\n\nunable    to    sleep.      Id.    at    174-75.      Although     we    wrote   that\n\n\"[a]dmittedly the jury was generous in awarding this amount,\" we\n\nheld that the district court did not abuse its discretion, given\n\ncomparable awards and the highly deferential standard of review.\n\nId. at 175.\n\n     We have also upheld damages awards where the plaintiff did not\n\nseek medical treatment or have long-term physical symptoms.                      See\n\nMcDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d 8, 22 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(upholding award of $300,000 in Title VII retaliation case, where\n\n\"the bulk\" of the award was for emotional distress in the form of\n\nhumiliation and damage to reputation and family relationships);\n\nRodriguez-Torres, 399 F.3d at 64 (affirming a $250,000 emotional\n\ndistress       award     where    plaintiff        testified   that      employment\n\ndiscrimination         caused    her    marriage    to    suffer   and    made   her\n\ndepressed); Koster, 181 F.3d at 35-36 (upholding $250,000 award\n\nwhere plaintiff testified that employer's conduct caused him to\n\nsuffer anxiety and insomnia and damaged his family life).\n\n     In light of these comparable cases, and given the court's\n\nlengthy explanation for its remittitur, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in awarding Aponte the remitted amount.                     The\n\ncourt    noted   that     Aponte's      testimony    regarding     her   distressed\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\femotional state was corroborated by the emails she sent Human\n\nResources, her resignation letter, and other testimony at trial.\n\nThe court explained that it used the \"maximum recovery rule\" to\n\nremit her damages to the \"maximum amount that is supported by the\n\nevidence.\"    See Marchant v. Dayton Tire & Rubber Co., 836 F.2d 695,\n\n704 (1st Cir. 1988). Additionally, the court's decision to set the\n\namount at $200,000 is supported by awards in comparable cases.\n\nAlthough the jury may have been \"generous,\" the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion. See Monteagudo, 554 F.3d at 175; Koster,\n\n181 F.3d at 34-35.\n\nC.   Motion for a New Trial Based on Evidentiary Rulings\n\n     We   review    an     order    denying     a   new   trial   for   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.    A new trial is warranted only \"if the verdict, though\n\nrationally based in the evidence, was so clearly against the weight\n\nof the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n\nAstro-Med,    591   F.3d    at     13.    We    review    the   district   court's\n\nevidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.               Blinzler v. Marriott\n\nInt'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n     DHL argues that Aponte introduced irrelevant and hearsay\n\nstatements under the guise of refreshed recollections.                      While\n\nAponte testified, her lawyer sought to establish that she received\n\ncommendations at work prior to Frias's supervision beginning in\n\n2004. To refresh her recollection of the commendations, her lawyer\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fshowed her documents dating from 2001 to 2004.              See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n612.\n\n       The district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing\n\nthe documents to refresh Aponte's recollections.               Consistent with\n\nthe requirements of Fed R. Evid. 612, the court ensured that DHL\n\nhad copies of the documents, assured the documents were relevant to\n\nthe    case,    allowed   DHL   to   cross-examine    Aponte      regarding   the\n\nrecollections recorded, and instructed Aponte to testify to her own\n\nrecollections and not hearsay.           Aponte's counsel instructed her,\n\n\"Don't read the documents.           Just read the documents for yourself,\n\nand if that refreshes your recollection, tell the jury what . . . .\n\ndid you do to receive the commendations?\"             Aponte then described\n\nwhat she did to receive a commendation in each instance.\n\n       DHL next argues that the court erred by failing to give a\n\ncurative instruction regarding certain comments Frias made to\n\nAponte in 2004.         Aponte testified that Frias made two sexually\n\nsuggestive comments that year:           (1) asking her \"where one could\n\nparty in San Juan\"; and (2) inquiring whether she had not yet\n\nmarried because she was waiting for a man like him.               Because there\n\nwas an 11-month period between these two comments and her remaining\n\nallegations of hostile work environment, the court determined the\n\ncomments       were   sufficiently    removed   in   time   and    sufficiently\n\ndifferent in nature to sever them from her hostile work environment\n\nclaim.     The court therefore instructed the jury:            \"Yesterday the\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fplaintiff rested.        After the plaintiff rested, I removed from the\n\ncase the allegations of sexual statements.                  So the issue for you to\n\ndecide is whether or not the . . . plaintiff was subjected to\n\nharassment in the work place.\"\n\n       Although the court could have been more specific about the\n\n\"sexual statements\" it was referring to, the curative instruction\n\ndoes       not   constitute       an   abuse   of    discretion.        Even   if    the\n\ninstruction should have been more specific, the error was harmless.\n\nSee Moulton v. Rival Co., 116 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1997).                      Aponte\n\npresented sufficient evidence of Frias's statements to support the\n\njury's ultimate verdict regarding her hostile work environment\n\nclaim.\n\n       Finally, DHL argues that the jury was confused by Aponte's\n\ntestimony that she did not receive a promotion. Aponte's complaint\n\noriginally       included     a    claim   for    failure    to    promote,    but   the\n\ndistrict court found that it was time-barred.                     Nonetheless, Aponte\n\nintroduced evidence at trial that she was denied a promotion and\n\nthat she felt compelled to resign due to the harassment she\n\nexperienced.         On appeal, DHL contends that this evidence was\n\nintroduced in support of a constructive discharge claim that Aponte\n\nwithdrew before the jury retired.3                  DHL claims that this sequence\n\n\n       3\n         It is unclear whether Aponte brought a constructive\ndischarge claim. Pre-trial rulings suggest that the district court\nconsidered constructive discharge to have been pled, but at trial,\nAponte denied bringing such a claim. In an excess of caution, the\ntrial court agreed to \"grant the directed verdict as to the claim\n\n                                           -18-\n\fallowed Aponte to bring her time-barred claim before the jury\n\nthrough a back door, and contends that the court should have\n\nprovided a curative instruction.\n\n     The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing DHL's\n\nrequests to provide a curative instruction on this point.   At the\n\nclose of Aponte's case, the court stated:\n\n     Members of the jury, this testimony concerning the\n     promotion . . . is not part of the case for damages\n     purposes. We're just going into the history of . . . the\n     plaintiff with the company. So she's testifying that she\n     did not get a promotion. That is not part of her case\n     for which she's asking damages.\n\nThe court also told the jury that the case involved a claim of\n\nhostile work environment based on sex discrimination, and not\n\nconstructive discharge.   The court's statements to the jury belie\n\nDHL's claim that the jury was \"undoubtedly confused.\"\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\nif there was one.\"\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

Julissa Aponte-Rivera (\"Aponte\") sued\n\nher   former   employer,   DHL    Solutions,    Inc.

The jury returned a verdict\n\nin favor of Aponte and awarded her emotional distress damages. The\n\ndistrict court upheld the jury's verdict, but remitted the damages\n\naward.    On appeal, DHL disputes the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nsupporting the jury's verdict, the amount of the remitted damages\n\naward, and evidentiary rulings.           For the following reasons, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\nA.    Facts\n\n      Aponte began working at DHL in 2000.          By 2003, she worked as\n\na logistics operations manager, a role in which she supervised\n\nemployees, oversaw shipments and documentation, and interacted with\n\nDHL's clients.\n\n      In 2004, Enrique Frias was named regional manager and became\n\nAponte's supervisor.    In the months following his appointment, two\n\nmajor clients of DHL's Puerto Rico operation complained about DHL's\n\nperformance. Frias and other management investigated the causes of\n\nthe customer problems and implemented plans to remedy them.\n\n      In June 2004, Aponte filed a written complaint with DHL's\n\nhuman resources department.        She complained that her supervisor\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fcreated an \"uncomfortable\" work environment by giving her an\n\noverwhelming workload and making several comments with sexual\n\nconnotations.      Blanca Hernandez, a DHL human resources manager,\n\ninterviewed    Aponte      and   Frias    in   response    to   the    complaint.\n\nHernandez told Frias, \"don't get personal\" and \"focus in [sic] the\n\noperation and in work.\"           Shortly after filing this complaint,\n\nAponte took a leave of absence that lasted approximately one month.\n\n       A position for program manager became available in November\n\n2004, and Aponte applied for the position.           Aponte testified that,\n\nduring her interview with Frias, he was aggressive and would not\n\nallow her to fully answer questions. Rafael Camacho was eventually\n\nchosen for the position.\n\n       Aponte testified that Camacho, after he began working at DHL,\n\nreferred to a woman in an authority position as \"jefecita\" (\"little\n\nboss\"), and stated that women were good for household chores.                   She\n\nalso   testified    that    Camacho      generally   referred     to    women    as\n\n\"brutas,\"     or   \"dumbies.\"         Aponte    worked     with   Camacho       for\n\napproximately one month before leaving work for eleven months on a\n\nsecond leave of absence.\n\n       Aponte returned to DHL in November 2005 and was assigned to\n\nreport to Camacho. Frias and Camacho confronted Aponte, asking her\n\nwhy she returned instead of resigning.            They also said the person\n\nwho ran the operation \"had to have balls.\"                Aponte also reported\n\nthat Frias told her the logistics operation in Puerto Rico had its\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fbest year in 2005 because it was being run by a man.                          Joyce\n\nMercado, a co-employee, testified that she overheard this exchange\n\nand it was \"shameful,\" and the two men spoke to Aponte in very loud\n\ntones.   She said that Frias and Camacho generally spoke to male\n\nemployees \"appropriately,\" and would \"treat them okay,\" which was\n\ndifferent from how they treated female employees.\n\n     Over the next few months, Camacho gave Aponte a verbal warning\n\nand a written warning regarding her performance at work.                   In March\n\n2006, Aponte again complained to human resources, stating she felt\n\n\"discriminated       based   on    gender,    overwhelmed,       distressed    and\n\npressured    labor    wise.\"       Maude    Cesari,    a   DHL   human   resources\n\nemployee, went to the office later that month to resolve the\n\ncomplaint.    Shortly after their meeting, Aponte thanked Cesari and\n\nsaid she had noticed a positive change.\n\n     However, Aponte took another leave of absence a month later,\n\nand ultimately resigned from DHL on June 17.                     Her resignation\n\nletter stated that her resignation was involuntary but necessary\n\ndue to the gender discrimination she suffered at work that left her\n\n\"in an emotional deterioration.\"\n\nB.   Procedural History\n\n     Aponte    brought       a    hostile    work     environment    and    gender\n\ndiscrimination claim against DHL, pursuant to Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 and various laws of the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico.    During trial, DHL moved for judgment as a matter of\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\flaw,       which   was   granted   for    some   claims   but    denied   for   the\n\ngender-based hostile work environment claim.                    After a four-day\n\ntrial, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of Aponte and awarded\n\nher $350,000 in emotional distress damages.1\n\n       DHL renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and\n\nasked the district court to set aside the verdict.                        It also\n\nrequested, in the alternative, that a new trial or remittitur be\n\ngranted.       The district court found there was sufficient evidence\n\nfor a reasonable jury to find in Aponte's favor, and a new trial\n\nwas not warranted. However, the court determined that \"[w]hile the\n\nevidence produced at trial regarding Defendant's liability for a\n\nhostile      work   environment     was     sufficient,   similar   evidence    is\n\nlacking to support the damages awarded.\"                  After reviewing the\n\nevidence      and   comparing      awards    from   similar   cases,   the   court\n\nremitted the award from $350,000 to $200,000.2\n\n       On appeal, DHL maintains that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport Aponte's hostile work environment claim, and alternatively,\n\nthat the award should be further remitted.                DHL also argues that\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Pursuant to Puerto Rico law, the district court applied\nmandatory doubling of damages provisions to the Commonwealth\nclaims, and awarded $1.00 to the Title VII claim, resulting in a\ntotal award of $699,999.\n       2\n       After applying the doubling required by Puerto Rico law, as\nwell as attorneys' fees awarded separately, the remitted award\namounts to $449,998.75.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fthe district court made evidentiary errors that require a new\n\ntrial.\n\n                                             II.\n\nA.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n     i.      Standard of Review\n\n     When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, a jury's\n\nverdict \"must be upheld unless the facts and inferences, viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, point so strongly and\n\noverwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could\n\nnot have returned the verdict.\"                Astro-Med, Inc. v.

She also maintained that Frias and Camacho \"didn't have any\n\nwillingness\" to train her on certain tasks. She testified that she\n\ntook a leave of absence because of the emotional hardship she\n\nexperienced.\n\n     Aponte filed two internal complaints with DHL Human Resources.\n\nIn the second complaint, she wrote that \"the work environment has\n\nbecome completely hostile and without respect to my person, I feel\n\ndiscriminated     based     on   gender,     overwhelmed,     distressed   and\n\npressured labor wise.\"           She felt \"completely disoriented\" and\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f\"constantly deprived of authority by Rafael Camacho.\"     She also\n\nfelt that there \"really is no change as to my feelings since I\n\nreported ill [] January 10, 2005 and my return on November 21,\n\n2005.   On the contrary, I feel more discriminated than before[.]\n\nI feel at all times the discrimination for reasons of gender.\"\n\n     Mercado testified that the way Camacho and Frias communicated\n\nwith Aponte \"was not very good,\" \"shameful,\" and \"[t]hey would\n\nspeak to her in a very loud tone, and the way they treated her\n\nwasn't the best.\" She also overheard Frias and Camacho \"screaming\"\n\nat Aponte.   When Frias and Camacho spoke to Aponte, \"the tones of\n\nvoice would be very loud, they would be very disrespectful.\"     By\n\ncontrast, Frias's and Camacho's communication with male employees\n\nwas \"normal,\" which \"was different than how I saw that it was\n\ntoward the women, the girls there.\"\n\n     Both Frias and Camacho denied saying those comments, and DHL\n\noffered a different interpretation of the work situation.      They\n\nasserted that Aponte was treated differently because of her poor\n\nwork performance, rather than gender.    They claimed that clients\n\ncomplained about Aponte's performance.\n\n     Viewing the evidence presented in the light most favorable to\n\nAponte, a reasonable jury could have determined that Frias and\n\nCamacho subjected Aponte to discriminatory intimidation, ridicule,\n\nand insult sufficiently pervasive to alter the condition of her\n\nemployment and create a hostile work environment.

It\n\nmaintains that the company acted promptly and appropriately, and\n\nthe March 30 email shows that it improved Aponte's situation.\n\n     Aponte    filed     her    initial      complaint      in   November    2004\n\ncomplaining of Frias's unprofessional behavior, which prompted\n\nHernandez to interview both Aponte and Frias.               Two years later, in\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fMarch 2006, Aponte filed a second complaint with Cesari.

On March 30, 2006,\n\nAponte sent Cesari an email thanking her for intervening and\n\nreporting that the situation had improved.\n\n      Aponte later testified that the harassment at work only\n\ntemporarily improved after the meeting, and the situation soon\n\n\"turned totally hostile.\"          Specifically, she felt \"pressure\" from\n\nthe     work    tasks     given    her,    and     Camacho    and      Frias      were\n\n\"underestimating\"         her,     being   \"disrespectful\"        to      her,     and\n\n\"constantly\" pressuring her about backlogged work.                  Aponte took a\n\nleave of absence in April 2006, and eventually resigned from her\n\nposition at DHL in June 2006.          She maintains that her decision not\n\nto    file     another    formal     complaint     prior     to   resigning       was\n\nunderstandable, given the fact that her prior complaints \"had only\n\nresulted in a worsening of her circumstances.\"\n\n      A reasonable jury could find that Aponte availed herself of\n\nDHL's    corrective      opportunities     without   experiencing         a   lasting\n\nimprovement in her work situation.               She complained in writing on\n\ntwo separate occasions, and testified that she ultimately had to\n\nquit her job in order to avoid the hostile situation.                  See White v.\n\nN. H.

While\n\nAponte testified, her lawyer sought to establish that she received\n\ncommendations at work prior to Frias's supervision beginning in\n\n2004. To refresh her recollection of the commendations, her lawyer\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fshowed her documents dating from 2001 to 2004.              See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n612.\n\n       The district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing\n\nthe documents to refresh Aponte's recollections.               Consistent with\n\nthe requirements of Fed R. Evid. 612, the court ensured that DHL\n\nhad copies of the documents, assured the documents were relevant to\n\nthe    case,    allowed   DHL   to   cross-examine    Aponte      regarding   the\n\nrecollections recorded, and instructed Aponte to testify to her own\n\nrecollections and not hearsay.           Aponte's counsel instructed her,\n\n\"Don't read the documents.

Aponte testified that Frias made two sexually\n\nsuggestive comments that year:           (1) asking her \"where one could\n\nparty in San Juan\"; and (2) inquiring whether she had not yet\n\nmarried because she was waiting for a man like him.               Because there\n\nwas an 11-month period between these two comments and her remaining\n\nallegations of hostile work environment, the court determined the\n\ncomments       were   sufficiently    removed   in   time   and    sufficiently\n\ndifferent in nature to sever them from her hostile work environment\n\nclaim.     The court therefore instructed the jury:            \"Yesterday the\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fplaintiff rested.        After the plaintiff rested, I removed from the\n\ncase the allegations of sexual statements.                  So the issue for you to\n\ndecide is whether or not the . . . plaintiff was subjected to\n\nharassment in the work place.\"\n\n       Although the court could have been more specific about the\n\n\"sexual statements\" it was referring to, the curative instruction\n\ndoes       not   constitute       an   abuse   of    discretion.        Even   if    the\n\ninstruction should have been more specific, the error was harmless.\n\nSee Moulton v. Rival Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741905\"><a href=\"/opinion/741905/prodliabrep-cch-p-14989-christopher-moulton-v-the-rival-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26 (1st Cir. 1997).                      Aponte\n\npresented sufficient evidence of Frias's statements to support the\n\njury's ultimate verdict regarding her hostile work environment\n\nclaim.\n\n       Finally, DHL argues that the jury was confused by Aponte's\n\ntestimony that she did not receive a promotion. Aponte's complaint\n\noriginally       included     a    claim   for    failure    to    promote,    but   the\n\ndistrict court found that it was time-barred.                     Nonetheless, Aponte\n\nintroduced evidence at trial that she was denied a promotion and\n\nthat she felt compelled to resign due to the harassment she\n\nexperienced.         On appeal, DHL contends that this evidence was\n\nintroduced in support of a constructive discharge claim that Aponte\n\nwithdrew before the jury retired.3                  DHL claims that this sequence\n\n\n       3\n         It is unclear whether Aponte brought a constructive\ndischarge claim. Pre-trial rulings suggest that the district court\nconsidered constructive discharge to have been pled, but at trial,\nAponte denied bringing such a claim. In an excess of caution, the\ntrial court agreed to \"grant the directed verdict as to the claim\n\n                                           -18-\n\fallowed Aponte to bring her time-barred claim before the jury\n\nthrough a back door, and contends that the court should have\n\nprovided a curative instruction.\n\n     The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing DHL's\n\nrequests to provide a curative instruction on this point.   At the\n\nclose of Aponte's case, the court stated:\n\n     Members of the jury, this testimony concerning the\n     promotion . . . is not part of the case for damages\n     purposes. We're just going into the history of . . . the\n     plaintiff with the company. So she's testifying that she\n     did not get a promotion. That is not part of her case\n     for which she's asking damages.\n\nThe court also told the jury that the case involved a claim of\n\nhostile work environment based on sex discrimination, and not\n\nconstructive discharge.   The court's statements to the jury belie\n\nDHL's claim that the jury was \"undoubtedly confused.\"\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\nif there was one.\"\n\n                               -19-\n\f</pre>",
