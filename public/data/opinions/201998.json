Daniel R. Dominguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n          Torruella, Selya, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Alexander Zeno on brief for the defendant, appellant.\n     Jacqueline D. Novas, Assistant United States Attorney, Nelson\nPerez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Senior Appellate\nAttorney in Charge, and H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, on\nbrief for the appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                             January 5, 2006\n\f       Per Curiam.         Defendant, Fernando Llera-Plaza, pled guilty to\n\ntwo counts (in two separate cases) of conspiring to possess with\n\nintent to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง 846.                          He\n\nwas    sentenced      to   62     months'     imprisonment,      the   middle     of   the\n\napplicable      guidelines          range,     on     each    count    (to   be   served\n\nconcurrently).             In    these      appeals    from    his    convictions      and\n\nsentences, he argues that the district court erred in two respects:\n\n(1) in accepting his guilty plea, because he did not adequately\n\nunderstand the nature of the charges or the consequences of his\n\nplea,    and    (2)   in        using   a   \"mechanical       sentencing     policy\"    in\n\nsentencing him to the middle of the applicable guidelines range.\n\nBecause neither of those alleged errors was preserved below, they\n\nare reviewable only for plain error.                    United States v. Delgado-\n\nHernandez, 420 F.3d 16, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v.\n\nVazquez-Molina, 389 F.3d 54, 57, 60 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. granted,\n\njudgment vacated, and case remanded on other grounds, 125 S. Ct.\n\n1713    (U.S.   Mar.       28,    2005).       Under    that    appellant-unfriendly\n\nstandard, we reject both of those arguments and affirm defendant's\n\nconvictions and sentences.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA.    Validity of Guilty Plea\n\n       Defendant argues that his plea was not valid because he did\n\nnot understand the nature of the charges or the consequences of his\n\nplea.    Specifically, he claims that he did not understand how he\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fcould    be   charged     with    conspiring            to   possess   with     intent    to\n\ndistribute one kilogram of heroin when the substance involved was\n\nnot actually heroin and he was pleading guilty to a smaller amount\n\nthan specified in the indictment.                  He also claims that he did not\n\nfully understand the consequences of the plea because he did not\n\nknow of the sentencing judge's usual practice of declining to\n\nsentence      repeat     offenders      to    the        bottom   of    the     applicable\n\nguidelines range, which is what the parties agreed to recommend.\n\n       Defendant's entire argument as to his lack of understanding of\n\nthe nature of the charges stems from a statement by defendant's\n\ncounsel,      at   the   outset    of    the       change-of-plea        hearing,       that\n\ndefendant \"is concerned about the statement of facts which . . .\n\nstates that when they did the transaction . . . they were handling\n\na kilogram of heroin, which was a mistake.                     As a matter of fact it\n\nwasn't a kilogram of heroin, but they believed that it was.                              And\n\nhe's    pleading    in    the    agreement         to    a   lesser    amount    than    one\n\nkilogram.\"     The court addressed that concern by saying, \"So that's\n\ngood for him, because it's less than the amount that he believes.\n\nThat is a benefit for him under the plea agreement.\"\n\n       In assessing defendant's claim of confusion, that exchange\n\ncannot be considered in isolation.                  Based on our \"review [of] the\n\ntotality of the Rule 11 hearing,\" United States v. Cheal, 389 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f35, 43 (1st Cir. 2004), we are satisfied that defendant ultimately\n\nunderstood the nature of the charges.1\n\n      Defendant's claim that he did not understand the consequences\n\nof the plea is even weaker.      Both in the plea agreement and at the\n\nchange-of-plea hearing, defendant repeatedly acknowledged that the\n\ncourt was not bound by the parties' joint recommendation that\n\ndefendant be sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range and\n\nthat, if the court imposed a higher sentence, such would not be a\n\nground for withdrawing his guilty plea.              Moreover, the record\n\nindicates that defendant's counsel was aware of the court's usual\n\npractice of declining to sentence repeat offenders at the bottom of\n\nthe guidelines range.       Therefore, the fact that the district court\n\nfollowed its usual practice and declined to adopt the parties'\n\nrecommendation to sentence defendant to 57 months' imprisonment,\n\nthe   bottom   of   the   applicable    guidelines   range,   and   chose   to\n\nsentence him to 62 months' imprisonment instead does not warrant\n\nvacating his plea.        United States v. Mercedes Mercedes, 428 F.3d\n\n355, 359 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n      In any event, given the weight of the evidence against him and\n\nthe   substantial     benefits   defendant     received   from      the   plea\n\nagreement, it is highly unlikely that, even if the court had given\n\n\n      1\n      Defendant's claim of confusion as to the nature of the\ncharges is further undercut by his admittedly \"good education,\"\nUnited States v. Pagan-Ortega, 372 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir. 2004); he\ngraduated from high school, attended one year of college, and\nreceived an associates degree in banking procedures.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fa    fuller   explanation   of   the   nature   of   the   charges   and   the\n\nconsequences of the plea, defendant would have opted to go to trial\n\nrather than plead guilty.         Accordingly, any error in the plea\n\ncolloquy does not warrant relief under plain-error standards.\n\nUnited States v. Medina-Roman, 376 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 125 S. Ct. 512 (2004).\n\nB.    \"Mechanistic\" Sentencing\n\n       Defendant's remaining claim of error is that the judge used a\n\n\"mechanical sentencing policy\" in declining to sentence him to the\n\nbottom of the applicable guidelines range because he was a repeat\n\noffender. Assuming, without deciding, that we have jurisdiction to\n\nreview that claim,2 see      Vazquez-Molina, 389 F.3d at 58; see also\n\nid. at 60, any such error does not warrant relief under plain-error\n\nstandards.\n\n       First, as this court has previously held, the sentencing\n\ncourt's reliance on a defendant's prior conviction as a basis for\n\nchoosing a sentence within the applicable guidelines range is\n\n\"entirely permissible.\"      Vazquez-Molina, 389 F.3d at 61.         Second,\n\nfrom the judge's comments at sentencing, it appears that the\n\njudge's \"policy\" is not as absolute or mechanistic as defendant\n\nclaims. In any event, in this case, the judge expressly considered\n\n\n\n       2\n      After United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), a\nsentence   within  the   guidelines  range   is  reviewable  for\nreasonableness, id. at 765.    Here, however, defendant does not\nargue that his sentence is unreasonable.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fboth defendant's individual circumstances and the purposes of\n\nsentencing in deciding what sentence to impose.\n\n     The district court's judgment and sentence in Case No. 04-019\n\nand its judgment and sentence in Case No. 04-020 are summarily\n\naffirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f",
