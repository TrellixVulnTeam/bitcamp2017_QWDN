John A. Woodcock Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n              Selya, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jane Doe on brief pro se.\n     Robert H. Stier, Jr., on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            October 28, 2005\n\f             Per Curiam. After a thorough review of the record and of\n\nthe parties’ submissions, we summarily affirm the judgment below.\n\n             The lower court did not err in its handling of the\n\ndiscovery disputes between the parties.           The district court has\n\nbroad discretion to control pre-trial discovery, and this court\n\n“review[s] the district court’s denial of discovery for abuse of\n\nits considerable discretion.” Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb\n\nCo., 95, F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). “‘We will\n\nintervene in such matters only upon a clear showing of manifest\n\ninjustice, that is, where the lower court’s discovery order was\n\nplainly     wrong   and   resulted   in    substantial   prejudice   to   the\n\naggrieved party.’”        Id. (quoting Mack v. Great Atlantic & Pacific\n\nTea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir. 1989)).              This deferential\n\nstandard “recogniz[es] that an appeals court simply cannot manage\n\nthe intricate process of discovery from a distance.”             Brandt v.\n\nWand Partners, 242 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n             On one side of the discovery dispute here, the magistrate\n\njudge faced a pro se plaintiff, Jane Doe, who charged that the\n\ndefendant,      Solvay     Pharmaceuticals,     Inc.,    was   withholding\n\ndocuments.1      On the other side, the magistrate judge faced a\n\ndefendant who claimed to have disclosed all responsive documents\n\nand who voluntarily made all remaining documents available for\n\nDoe’s review.       By holding a series of discovery conferences, the\n\n\n     1\n         Jane Doe is a pseudonym.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fmagistrate judge made several concerted attempts to clarify Doe’s\n\nrequests   and   to   obtain   from   Solvay   some   assurances   that   the\n\ndocuments Doe wanted were in its possession and would be made\n\navailable to Doe.      The court twice gave Doe an extension of time\n\nwithin which to complete discovery, and it made a room and a\n\ncomputer at the courthouse available for Doe’s convenience in\n\nreviewing documents in camera. Solvay seems to have exhibited some\n\ngood faith, by making many of the confidential documents available\n\nto Doe at a convenient location and at its own expense.            When that\n\nproved to be insufficient, Solvay offered Doe free rein to peruse\n\nthe entire collection of documents relevant to Luvox (the drug in\n\nquestion) at Solvay’s headquarters, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n33(d).\n\n           Doe suggests that Solvay was acting in bad faith, hoping\n\nshe would be so overwhelmed not only with the task of reviewing so\n\nmany documents but also with the trouble and expense of traveling\n\nto Solvay’s headquarters in Georgia that she would forgo the\n\nexercise altogether.      But from a practical standpoint, we do not\n\nknow what other reasonable steps the magistrate judge could have\n\ntaken at that point.     As the magistrate judge told Doe at the final\n\ndiscovery conference, at some point she needed to bring discovery\n\nto a close.   The deadline already had been extended twice, and the\n\ncourt had tried other, less burdensome approaches for getting Doe\n\nthe documents that allegedly were in Solvay’s possession.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            The crux of the matter is that Solvay said it already had\n\nprovided everything Doe requested.        Doe disagreed and said that\n\nSolvay was not telling the truth.              The only way for Doe to\n\nestablish that she was right, at that juncture, was to go to\n\nGeorgia and find the missing documents herself.        We see no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the magistrate judge’s decision to resolve the\n\ndiscovery dispute in that manner.\n\n            We also discern no error in the court’s decision allowing\n\nsummary judgment in Solvay’s favor.       Many of Doe’s arguments are\n\npremised on the assumption that Solvay engaged in misconduct during\n\ndiscovery   and   that,   accordingly,   (i)    evidence   supporting   its\n\nsummary judgment motion should have been excluded pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 37(c)(1), or (ii) Doe should have been excused for\n\nfailing to produce evidence establishing that the facts were in\n\ncontroversy. The difficulty with these arguments is that Doe never\n\nestablished that Solvay engaged in discovery misconduct.\n\n            Doe also claims that disposition of the summary judgment\n\nmotion should have been delayed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\nAs we already have determined, however, the court did not err\n\neither in its handling of the discovery disputes or in closing\n\ndiscovery when it did.      In all events, the requirements for the\n\ninvocation of Rule 56(f) were not met.         See, e.g., Velez v. Awning\n\nWindows, Inc., 375 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2004); Resolution Trust\n\nCorp v. North Bridge Assocs., 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f           To the extent Doe argues that any of her claims did not\n\nneed to be supported by expert testimony, she is mistaken.             Maine\n\nlaw   requires   that,   with   respect   to   subjects   that   are   highly\n\ntechnical or specialized, expert testimony must be presented unless\n\nthe question is “sufficiently obvious as to lie within [the] common\n\nknowledge” of the ordinary layperson.          Forbes v. Osteopathic Hosp.\n\nof Me., Inc., 552 A.2d 16, 17 (Me. 1988) (medical malpractice case;\n\nexpert testimony required unless “negligence and harmful results\n\nare sufficiently obvious as to lie within common knowledge”)\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).                 The issues\n\npresented in this case were not “sufficiently obvious as to lie\n\nwith the common knowledge of the ordinary layperson.”\n\n           We also reject Doe’s contention that the court should not\n\nhave applied the learned intermediary rule to her defective warning\n\nclaim.   This court already has decided that Maine courts would\n\nadopt that rule.    See Violette v. Smith & Nephew Dyonics, 62 F.3d\n\n8, 13 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that “the general rule regarding\n\nmedical devices (and, more frequently and by analogy, prescription\n\ndrugs) is that the manufacturer must warn the physician – the so-\n\ncalled ‘learned intermediary’ – and not the patient directly”).\n\n           We need go no further.         We have reviewed the remaining\n\narguments in Doe’s brief and find them to be either unsupported by\n\nthe record, entirely without merit, or forfeited.\n\n           Affirmed.     See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
