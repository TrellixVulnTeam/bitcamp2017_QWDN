Garcia, United States Attorney, was on brief, for Appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           May 26, 2006\n\f     John R. Gibson, Circuit Judge.    Orlando Ortiz-Torres, Omar\n\nCosme-Piri, Raymond Torres-Santiago, José Renovales-Vélez, and\n\nJulio Mattei-Albizu appeal their convictions and sentences for\n\nconspiracy to distribute multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846.   We affirm.\n\n     Appellants were members of a drug-trafficking organization\n\nthat operated drug distribution points in and around La Plena Ward\n\nin Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico from 1994 to 2001.1       A grand jury\n\nindicted each of them with conspiring to distribute \"multi-kilogram\n\nquantities\" of heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846, and with a forfeiture\n\nallegation of up to $1 million pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 982.\n\nAppellant Mattei-Albizu entered a straight plea of guilty to\n\nconspiring to possess with intent to distribute and conspiring to\n\ndistribute at least 3.5 kilograms but less than 5 kilograms of\n\ncocaine. After a jury was empaneled, the remaining appellants each\n\npled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute\n\ncocaine as part of a package plea agreement.\n\n     Appellants raise numerous claims of error on appeal.   Cosme-\n\nPiri and Ortiz-Torres challenge their convictions on the ground\n\n\n\n     1\n      Because appellants' convictions and sentences followed\nadmissions of guilt, we glean the pertinent facts from the change-\nof-plea colloquies, the plea agreements, the presentence reports,\nand the transcripts of the sentencing and change of plea hearings.\nSee United States v. Colon-Solis, 354 F.3d 101, 102 (1st Cir.\n2004).\n\n                               -4-\n\fthat their guilty pleas were not voluntary.                Cosme-Piri, Ortiz-\n\nTorres, Renovales-Vélez, and Mattei-Albizu raise an assortment of\n\nchallenges to their sentences.        Lastly, each appellant requests a\n\nremand for sentencing in accordance with United States v. Booker,\n\n543 U.S. 220 (2005).    We address each claim in turn.\n\n\n\nI.   Voluntary Guilty Plea\n\n     Cosme-Piri and Ortiz-Torres ask us to vacate their convictions\n\nand remand their cases for trial on the ground that their guilty\n\npleas were not voluntary.       While the entry of a guilty plea \"does\n\nnot preclude an attack on the plea's voluntariness,\" United States\n\nv. Sahlin, 399 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2005), because neither\n\nappellant sought to withdraw his guilty plea before the district\n\ncourt, we review the district court's acceptance of their pleas for\n\nplain error.    United States v. Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d 1, 7 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (citing United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 59 (2002)),\n\ncert. denied, 543 U.S. 1175, 1176 (2005).\n\n     To establish that the district court committed error in\n\naccepting    their   guilty    pleas,       appellants     must   point   to     a\n\n\"fundamental defect\" in the change of plea hearing itself.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Bierd, 217 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2000); see also\n\nSahlin, 399 F.3d at 31 (error must affect substantial rights).\n\nAppellants   argue   that     the   joint    change   of   plea   hearing      was\n\nfundamentally defective because it failed to ensure that their\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fguilty pleas, entered as part of a package plea agreement, were\n\ntruly voluntary.    As in many such \"package plea\" arrangements, the\n\ngovernment offered the entire group of defendants charged in\n\nconnection with the La Plena drug point a favorable plea and\n\nsentencing   recommendation   on   the   condition   that   all   the   co-\n\ndefendants enter guilty pleas.\n\n     We have previously recognized that such package deals create\n\na significant risk that one defendant will plead guilty against his\n\nwill in order for his co-defendants to obtain the offered benefit.\n\nUnited States    v. Abbott, 241 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 732-33 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nThus, we have crafted two safeguards designed to minimize this risk\n\nof coercion.    Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d at 8 (citing Martinez-Molina,\n\n64 F.3d at 732-33).      First, the prosecution should inform the\n\ndistrict court that the defendant's guilty plea is part of a\n\npackage deal.    Id.   Second, the district court should carefully\n\nascertain the voluntariness of the defendant's plea during the Rule\n\n11 colloquy, with an eye toward minimizing the risk of co-defendant\n\ncoercion inherent in the package-plea context.        Id.\n\n     The record of the Rule 11 proceeding below reflects that both\n\nsafeguards were observed.     First, there is little doubt that the\n\ndistrict court was fully aware that all the defendants, save for\n\nMattei-Albizu, were entering their pleas as part of a package deal.\n\nAt the joint change of plea hearing, in the presence of all\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fdefendants and their respective counsel, the government disclosed\n\nto the court that the individual pleas were part of a package deal.\n\nIndeed, on several occasions throughout the change of plea hearing\n\nthe district court specifically referred to the package nature of\n\ndefendants' pleas.\n\n      Second, the district court's Rule 11 inquiry was more than\n\nsufficient to guard against the risk of co-defendant coercion. The\n\ncourt individually questioned the defendants, asking whether they\n\nwere threatened or coerced by \"anyone\" or \"anybody\" into entering\n\ntheir individual guilty pleas.          Although this alone was likely\n\nsufficient, see, e.g., Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d at 9 (\"anyone\" or\n\n\"anybody\"); United States v. Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d 17, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (\"anyone\"), the court inquired further. It specifically\n\nnamed    each   co-defendant    and   asked   whether    any    of   them   had\n\nthreatened or coerced Ortiz-Torres or Cosme-Piri into pleading\n\nguilty, thereby probing whether the increased likelihood of co-\n\ndefendant coercion in the package-plea context had affected either\n\nof their decisions to plead guilty.\n\n        In light of these additional safeguards, the district court\n\nwas     entitled   to   rely   upon   Cosme-Piri's      and    Ortiz-Torres's\n\nrepresentations, made under oath, that they were neither coerced\n\nnor threatened into making their pleas.              See United States v.\n\nMarrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 349 (1st Cir. 1997).                   The only\n\nindication of the contrary comes from Cosme-Piri's and Ortiz-\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fTorres's general allegations of coercion on appeal, which are\n\ninsufficient, absent record support, to invalidate their guilty\n\npleas.       See Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d at 23.           Finding no error,\n\nplain or otherwise, in the district court's acceptance of their\n\nguilty       pleas,     we    affirm    Ortiz-Torres's     and    Cosme-Piri's\n\nconvictions.\n\n\n\nII.   Sentencing Issues\n\n      The entry of a guilty plea does not itself waive a defendant's\n\nright       to   challenge   the   ensuing    sentence.    United      States   v.\n\nGonzalez-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 301 (1st Cir. 2005). Renovales-\n\nVélez, Cosme-Piri, Ortiz-Torres, and Mattei-Albizu advance such\n\nchallenges.\n\n      A.         Renovales-Vélez\n\n      Renovales-Vélez         argues   that   the   district   court    erred   by\n\nfailing to impose his federal sentence concurrently with his\n\nundischarged term of state imprisonment as required under Guideline\n\n§5G1.3(b) (2002).2           Like his co-defendants, Renovales-Vélez was\n\n\n\n        2\n      Effective November 1, 2003, a little more than one month\nafter Renovales-Vélez's September 30, 2003 sentencing, Guideline §\n5G1.3(b) was amended. Because neither party argues otherwise, we\nassume that the version in effect at the time of Renovales-Vélez's\nsentencing applies. United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040,\n1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A]       defendant is to be punished\naccording to the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.\");\nsee also United States v. Rouse, 362 F.3d 256, 261-62 (4th Cir.\n2004) (holding that 2003 amendment to Guideline § 5G1.3(b) does not\napply retroactively), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 867 (2004).\n\n                                        -8-\n\fcharged with distributing more than five kilograms of both cocaine\n\nand cocaine base, more than one kilogram of heroin, and more than\n\nfifty pounds of marijuana.   However, also like all but one of his\n\nco-defendants,   Renovales-Vélez    entered   into   a   plea   agreement,\n\npursuant to which he pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute at least 150 kilograms of cocaine, in return\n\nfor the government's recommendation of 252 months' imprisonment.\n\nThe parties further agreed that if Renovales-Vélez's presentence\n\ninvestigation revealed convictions for offenses that took place\n\nduring the time period of the conspiracy, they would not be counted\n\nin determining his criminal history category.\n\n     Ultimately, Renovales-Vélez's presentence report listed four\n\nprior drug-related convictions in the Superior Court of Puerto\n\nRico: on December 21, 1994, Renovales-Vélez was arrested for\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute for which he was\n\nsentenced to three years' imprisonment; on January 25, 1995, he was\n\narrested and charged with the second and third offenses, possession\n\nof marijuana and heroin with the intent to distribute, for which he\n\nwas sentenced to a total of six years' imprisonment; and on\n\nFebruary 23, 1995, he was arrested and charged with possession with\n\nthe intent to distribute cocaine, for which he was sentenced to two\n\nyears' imprisonment.3   Although he received a sentence of eleven-\n\n\n\n     3\n      The sentences for all four convictions were imposed on May\n13, 1996 and ordered to run consecutively.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fyears' imprisonment on the four offenses, Renovales-Vélez had\n\nserved only 35 months of that sentence before being transferred to\n\nfederal custody to face the instant charges.\n\n     Since his prior drug offenses occurred during the period of\n\nthe charged cocaine trafficking conspiracy, the presentence report\n\nrecommended that they be treated as overt acts, resulting in zero\n\ncriminal history points. Consistent with the recommendation of the\n\npresentence report and the agreement of the parties, the district\n\ncourt assessed Renovales-Vélez zero criminal history points for his\n\nprior convictions, leaving him with a criminal history category of\n\nI.   Recognizing that Renovales-Vélez had been incarcerated due to\n\nthese prior convictions during a significant portion of the charged\n\nconspiracy, the district court found him to be less culpable than\n\nhis co-defendants, and accordingly, sentenced him to 238 months'\n\nimprisonment, rather than the 252-month sentence provided for in\n\nthe plea agreement.4\n\n     On appeal Renovales-Vélez argues that the district court was\n\nrequired      under   Guideline   §5G1.3(b)(2002)   to   run   his   federal\n\n\n\n      4\n          The sentencing court stated:\n\n     And the Court, because this defendant spent a\n     considerable amount of time in jail during the\n     conspiracy, and his participation is less than the other\n     gentlemen who have been also sentenced by this Court,\n     therefore, sentences him within the guideline but to a\n     lower amount than recommended in the plea . . . .\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fsentence concurrently with the undischarged portion of his state\n\nterm of imprisonment. Because, as Renovales-Vélez concedes, he did\n\nnot object to his sentence on this ground, we employ plain error\n\nreview. United States v. Cruz, 213 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993)).                     To\n\ndecide whether the district court erred in imposing his sentence,\n\nwe must determine whether his state offenses were \"fully taken into\n\naccount\"      in    determining     his   offense   level.   See   Guideline   §\n\n5G1.3(b)(2002).5       If they were, then Guideline § 5G1.3(b) required\n\nthe   court    to    impose   the    federal     term   concurrently   with   the\n\nundischarged state term, which would have reduced the federal\n\nsentence by approximately 97 months—the difference between the\n\nentire eleven-year state term and the 35 months Renovales-Vélez had\n\nserved on it before being transferred to federal custody.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Caraballo, 200 F.3d 20, 28-29 (1st Cir. 1999); see\n\nalso U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(b), cmt. (n.2) (2002).\n\n\n      5\n          At the time of sentencing, Guideline § 5G1.3 provided:\n\n      (b) If . . . the undischarged term of imprisonment\n      resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into\n      account in the determination of the offense level for the\n      instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense\n      shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged\n      term of imprisonment.\n\n      (c) (Policy Statement) In any other case involving an\n      undischarged term of imprisonment, the sentence for the\n      instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently,\n      partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior\n      undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable\n      punishment for the instant offense.\n\n                                          -11-\n\f     Renovales-Vélez argues that because his state court offenses\n\nwere treated as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, they\n\nwere treated as relevant conduct under Guideline § 1B1.3, and\n\ntherefore \"fully taken into account\" under Guideline § 5G1.3(b).\n\nBecause   Guideline   §    5G1.3   \"is   directed   at   the   prevention   of\n\nduplicative sentencing for any particular conduct,\" we held in\n\nCaraballo that \"only relevant conduct that has resulted in-or that\n\ncould have resulted in-a change in the instant offense's            'offense\n\nlevel' is 'fully taken into account' under § 5G1.3(b).\"                     Id.\n\n(emphasis in original).      However, we also reasoned that mandatory\n\nconcurrent sentencing would be inappropriate where the defendant's\n\nundischarged prison term was for multiple offenses, but only some\n\nof those offenses were \"fully taken into account\" in determining\n\nthe instant offenses's offense level, since in such a situation the\n\ninstant offense may involve conduct unrelated to the conduct\n\nunderlying the undischarged term. Id. at 28. Accordingly, we held\n\nthat \"[w]hen some of the conduct underlying an undischarged term\n\nimpacted the offense level, but other aspects of that conduct did\n\nnot,\" the district court is free, under § 5G1.3(c), to choose\n\nwholly concurrent, partially concurrent, or wholly consecutive\n\nsentencing.   Id. at 29.\n\n     In the instant case, we face precisely this kind of \"multiple\n\noffense\" situation.       Renovales-Vélez's undischarged term of state\n\nimprisonment was the result of four separate offenses.                  Even\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fassuming that, in reaching its drug quantity determination and\n\ncorresponding offense level, the district court took into account\n\nhis two prior cocaine offenses,6 it could not have taken into\n\naccount   offenses   for   possession       of   marijuana   with    intent   to\n\ndistribute   and   possession   of    heroin,     since   these     convictions\n\npunished conduct unrelated to that punished by the instant cocaine\n\ntrafficking conviction.     Thus, as in Caraballo, Renovales-Vélez's\n\nundischarged state term was the result of multiple offenses, some\n\nof which may have been taken into account in setting his offense\n\nlevel for the federal conviction, while the rest clearly were not.\n\n200 F.3d at 27-28.    \"In short, because not all of the conduct from\n\nwhich [Renovales-Vélez's Puerto Rico] term resulted influenced his\n\nultimate offense level, not all of it was 'fully taken into\n\naccount' under § 5G1.3(b). The court below thus correctly chose to\n\napply § 5G1.3(c) instead.\"      Id. at 29.\n\n     Thus proceeding under subsection (c), the district court\n\n\n\n     6\n      The record does not conclusively demonstrate that the\ndistrict court took into account the unspecified quantities of\ncocaine involved in Renovales-Vélez's prior cocaine offenses in\ndetermining that he was responsible for at least 150 kilograms of\ncocaine and assessing the corresponding offense level of 38. See\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 (2002).    Indeed, the district court stated at\nsentencing that it was specifically relying on Renovales-Vélez's\nadmission in his plea that he was guilty of conspiring to possess\nwith intent to distribute \"at least 150 kilograms of cocaine\" and\nhis specific stipulation to an offense level of 38 in his plea\nagreement. However, because we conclude that even if his prior\ncocaine offenses were taken into account, Renovales-Vélez\nnonetheless is not entitled to wholly concurrent sentencing, we\nneed not resolve this question.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fenjoyed the discretion to impose a wholly concurrent, partially\n\nconcurrent, or wholly consecutive sentence, so long as the end\n\nresult was reasonable.       See United States v. Vazquez-Alomar, 342\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Caraballo, 200 F.3d at 28-29).\n\nThe court exercised this discretion by sentencing Renovales-Vélez\n\nto a term of imprisonment 14 months less than that stipulated to in\n\nthe plea agreement, which had the effect of imposing part of his\n\nfederal sentence concurrently with his undischarged state sentence,\n\nwhile imposing the remainder consecutively. The court specifically\n\nstated that it was imposing this sentence in recognition of the\n\ntime Renovales-Vélez was incarcerated on his prior drug offenses,\n\nthereby furthering the underlying policy of Guideline § 5G1.3 in\n\npreventing \"duplicative sentencing for any particular conduct.\"\n\nCaraballo, 200 F.3d at 27.       Renovales-Vélez makes no argument that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion in doing so, nor does he\n\nclaim that his sentence is otherwise unreasonable.               See Vazquez-\n\nAlomar,   342   F.3d   at   5;   see   also   Caraballo,   200   F.3d   at   29\n\n(affirming district court's exercise of discretion under Guideline\n\n§ 5G1.3(c) to run part of defendant's federal sentence concurrent\n\nwith undischarged state sentence).            Accordingly, we affirm his\n\nsentence.7\n\n\n     7\n      Had Renovales-Vélez been sentenced after the November 1, 2003\neffective date of the 2003 amendments to § 5G1.3(b), which\njettisoned the somewhat confusing \"fully taken into account\"\nlanguage as well as any reference to \"undischarged\" terms of\nimprisonment, we would reach the same result.          The amended\n\n                                       -14-\n\f     B.   Cosme-Piri\n\n          1. Drug quantity\n\n     Cosme-Piri argues that the district court sentenced him based\n\non a flawed drug-quantity calculation.         Because he objected to the\n\ncalculation   at   sentencing,   we   review   any   legal   error   of   the\n\ndistrict court de novo, United States v. Barbour, 393 F.3d 82, 91-\n\n92 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 212 (2005), while\n\nreviewing its factual findings for clear error.         United States v.\n\nSantos, 357 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n     Cosme-Piri stipulated to the scope of the conspiracy's drug\n\ntrafficking operations as well as to the amount of narcotics for\n\nwhich he was personally responsible.8          Based on this stipulated\n\n\nsubsection requires concurrent sentencing:\n\n     If . . . a term of imprisonment resulted from another\n     offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense\n     of conviction under the provisions of subsections (a)(1),\n     (a)(2), or (a)(3) of § 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) and that\n     was the basis for an increase in the offense level for\n     the instant offense under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct)\n     or Chapter Three (Adjustments) . . . .\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(b) (2003) (emphasis added). Under this framework,\nRenovales-Vélez would likewise not be entitled to concurrent\nsentencing because he fails to demonstrate that his prior cocaine-\nrelated offenses were \"the basis for an increase\" in the drug\nquantity determination underlying the offense level for the instant\ncocaine trafficking offense.\n\n\n     8\n      According to the stipulated facts in the plea agreement, each\nmonth for the duration of the conspiracy the organization sold at\nleast five kilograms of cocaine, one kilogram of heroin, more than\nfifty grams of cocaine base, and approximately five pounds of\n\n                                  -15-\n\fdrug quantity, the parties agreed that the applicable sentencing\n\nrange was from 235 to 293 months' imprisonment, and the government\n\nagreed to recommend a sentence of 252 months.          At the change of\n\nplea hearing, Cosme-Piri acknowledged these stipulations and stated\n\nthat he understood the terms of the plea agreement.\n\n     At sentencing, counsel for Cosme-Piri objected to the offense-\n\nlevel computation in the presentence investigation report.              He\n\nrequested   that   the   district     court   lower   the    drug-quantity\n\ncalculation because Cosme-Piri had participated in the conspiracy\n\nfor a shorter period of time than other co-conspirators whose plea\n\nagreements provided for lesser drug quantities.             The government\n\nresponded that Cosme-Piri had specifically stipulated in his plea\n\nagreement to the amount of cocaine for which he personally was\n\nresponsible and this amount was not tied to the length of his\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy.\n\n     The court rejected Cosme-Piri's request and sentenced him to\n\n252 months' imprisonment, as provided in the plea agreement.           The\n\ncourt explained that other co-defendants had received drug-quantity\n\nreductions in return for their stipulation to leadership role\n\nenhancements, and not because their involvement in the conspiracy\n\nwas any less than that originally contemplated in their plea\n\n\nmarijuana.   Notwithstanding these conspiracy-wide amounts, the\nparties agreed that Cosme-Piri would be held responsible for \"not\nless than one hundred fifty kilograms of cocaine\" and that \"such\namount should be the proper drug quantity to be considered\" for\nsentencing purposes.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fagreements.    This    trade-off     was   necessary   to   ensure    that   the\n\ngovernment's sentencing recommendation would remain 252 months' as\n\nstipulated in the plea agreements.\n\n      Cosme-Piri argues that the district court erred in sentencing\n\nhim based on the stipulated drug quantity instead of making an\n\nindividualized finding as to the amount of drugs specifically\n\nattributable to him.      In support, he relies upon United States v.\n\nColon-Solis, 354 F.3d 101, 102-03 (1st Cir. 2004), which held that\n\na   district   court   could   not    automatically    shift   a     stipulated\n\nconspiracy-wide drug-quantity amount to an individual conspirator\n\nin order to trigger a statutory mandatory minimum.\n\n      However, this reliance is misplaced, since the defendant in\n\nColon-Solis had stipulated only to the conspiracy-wide drug amount,\n\nand there remained an \"open question\" as to whether he personally\n\nwas responsible for a lesser quantity.            See id. at 102.        Here,\n\nCosme-Piri's stipulation as to the amount of drugs specifically\n\nattributable to him left no such open question.                 Although the\n\ndistrict court was not required to follow this stipulation, it was\n\nentitled to rely upon it in determining the appropriate sentence,\n\nUnited States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir. 2001), and such\n\nreliance is not clearly erroneous, see United States v. Santos, 357\n\nF.3d 136, 140-41 (1st Cir. 2004).9\n\n\n      9\n      Nor does this court's recent decision in United States v.\nRodriguez-Gonzalez, 433 F.3d 165, 168 (1st Cir. 2005), call for a\ncontrary result.   Unlike the \"possibly suspect stipulation\" in\n\n                                      -17-\n\f     Cosme-Piri's second attack on the drug-quantity calculation\n\nfocuses on the drug-quantity reductions granted to some of his co-\n\nconspirators.         Citing no legal authority in support, Cosme-Piri\n\nclaims that, notwithstanding his plea agreement, he is entitled to\n\na similar reduction because the district court's stated reasons for\n\nthe reductions were arbitrary and not related to facts proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.10\n\n     A review of the record convinces us that the district court's\n\ndrug-quantity determination as to Cosme-Piri was anything but\n\narbitrary; rather, it reflected, to the kilogram, the quantity\n\n\n\nRodriguez-Gonzalez, there was nothing suspect about Cosme-Piri's\ndrug-quantity stipulation because he did not dispute it at the\nchange of plea hearing or at sentencing. See id. at 166-67.\n        10\n             The discussion before the district court was, in pertinent\npart:\n\n     MR. PÉREZ [counsel for Cosme-Piri]: We were referring to\n     the fact that he was -- this will be 150 kilograms. And\n     his involvement was for a shorter time than the rest of\n     the individuals involved. And we thought that he should\n     be benefitting from that, from the reduced amount that\n     some of them have been granted.\n\n     THE COURT: But some of them have been granted reduced\n     amounts because they're going to accept the status or\n     because of something else. Wasn't this what you agreed\n     to in the very beginning? . . . .\n\n          [W]asn't this a reverse, sort or, agreement where\n     you all agreed on the final number? . . . What the Court\n     is doing is adding two points [to another co-defendant]\n     because he is a leader, and on the other hand reducing\n     the drugs a little bit so that you all end up in the same\n     place which was what you had bargained for.\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fCosme-Piri admitted to in his plea agreement.         Once again, the\n\ncourt was not bound by this admission, and could have determined\n\nthat he was responsible for less.        Its refusal to do so was not\n\nclearly erroneous.     See Teeter, 257 F.3d at 28; Santos, 357 F.3d at\n\n140.\n\n             2. Term of Supervised Release\n\n       Cosme-Piri advances two arguments in favor of vacating the\n\nsupervised release term of his sentence. First, he claims that the\n\nfive-year term in the written judgment violated his right to be\n\npresent at sentencing because the district court had announced a\n\ncontrary, three-year term, at sentencing.11        Second, Cosme-Piri\n\nargues that the drug testing condition of his supervised release\n\nimproperly delegates authority to the probation officer.\n\n       We review Cosme-Piri's right to be present claim for harmless\n\nerror.      United States v. Meléndez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93, 108 (1st\n\nCir. 2003), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Padilla,\n\n415 F.3d 211 (1st Cir. 2005) (en banc).      \"A criminal defendant has\n\nthe right to be present at his own sentencing.\"      United States v.\n\nVega-Ortiz, 425 F.3d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 2005).      Thus, if a district\n\ncourt's oral sentence materially conflicts with its subsequent\n\n\n       11\n      At sentencing the district judge stated, \"Upon release from\nconfinement the defendant [Cosme-Piri] shall be placed on\nsupervised release for a term of at least three years under\n[certain] terms and conditions.\" (Emphasis added). However, the\nwritten judgment stated, \"Upon release from imprisonment, the\ndefendant shall be on supervised release for a term of Five (5)\nYEARS.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n                                  -19-\n\fwritten expression, the tendency is to honor the oral.                         Id.\n\n(quoting United States v. Cali, 87 F.3d 571, 579 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\nHowever, no material conflict exists where the defendant is on\n\nnotice that he is subject to the terms included in the written\n\njudgment. Vega-Ortiz, 425 F.3d at 22-23 (citing United States v.\n\nTulloch, 380 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 2004)); see also United States v.\n\nFerrario-Pozzi,   368   F.3d    5,   8-9    (1st   Cir.     2004)   (finding    no\n\nmaterial   conflict   between    oral      sentence   and    written   judgment\n\nimposing $3.7 million forfeiture where defendant had notice that\n\nforfeiture of at least two million dollars would be component of\n\nsentence).\n\n     While there was surely a conflict between the district court's\n\noral pronouncement of a three-year term of supervised release and\n\nthe five-year term included in the written judgment, there is\n\noverwhelming evidence that Cosme-Piri knew well before the written\n\njudgment was issued that he faced a five-year term of supervised\n\nrelease and that the three-year term was announced in error.\n\nFirst, and foremost, the statute criminalizing the drug offense to\n\nwhich Cosme-Piri pled guilty mandates a supervised release term of\n\n\"at least five-years.\"     See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) (emphasis\n\nadded).    While the mere existence of this mandatory minimum may\n\nprovide sufficient \"constructive notice\" that a five-year term\n\nwould apply, see Tulloch, 380 F.3d at 11-14, the five-year term was\n\nalso included in the plea agreement, explained to Cosme-Piri and\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\faccepted by him at the change of plea hearing, and reiterated in\n\nthe presentence investigation report.\n\n       At no point did Cosme-Piri object to the length of the\n\nsupervised release term.        When the district court stated that it\n\nwas imposing a three-year term, in contravention of the statutory\n\nminimum, the plea agreement, and the presentence investigation\n\nreport, it became incumbent upon Cosme-Piri to request further\n\nclarification, which he did not do.          See Tulloch, 380 F.3d at 14\n\nn.7.        Indeed, the need for clarification was especially acute in\n\nthis case, since the district court's oral pronouncement of a\n\nthree-year term at sentencing hearing was immediately preceded by\n\nits reference to a five-year term.12        In this context, the district\n\ncourt's isolated reference to a three-year term appears to have\n\nbeen    an     inadvertent   mistake.      Although   this   reference   was\n\nerroneous, the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming\n\nevidence that Cosme-Piri had notice that a five-year term would\n\napply. See Vega-Ortiz, 425 F.3d at 21-23.\n\n\n       12\n            The district court stated:\n\n            Based on a total offense level of 38, and criminal\n       history category one, the guideline imprisonment range in\n       this particular case is from 235 to 293 months, with a\n       fine range of twenty-five thousand to four million, plus\n       a supervised release term of not more than five years.\n\n            The Court will follow the plea agreement as\n       stipulated by the parties and sentence the defendant\n       accordingly.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n                                    -21-\n\f     Cosme-Piri's       second   challenge     to   the   term   of   supervised\n\nrelease likewise fails.          Both at sentencing and in its written\n\njudgment, the district court stated that Cosme-Piri's term of\n\nsupervised release would be subject to the following condition:\n\n     The defendant . . . shall submit to a drug test within\n     fifteen (15) days of release on supervised release, and\n     thereafter when so requested by the U.S. Probation\n     Officer.\n\nCosme-Piri     argues    that    this     condition   improperly      delegates\n\nauthority to the probation officer to determine the frequency and\n\nquantity of drug testing.\n\n     In United States v. Meléndez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93 (1st Cir.\n\n2003), a panel of this court held that a district court commits\n\nplain error by delegating to a probation officer the authority to\n\ndetermine a defendant's drug-testing regimen while on supervised\n\nrelease. Id. at 106 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d) (2000)).13 Sitting\n\nen banc, our court overruled Meléndez-Santana to the extent that it\n\nheld that such an improper delegation would automatically rise to\n\nthe level of plain error, although the defendant was free to argue\n\n\n\n     13\n          18 U.S.C. § 3583(d) (2000) provides in relevant part:\n\n     The court shall also order, as an explicit condition of\n     supervised release, that the defendant refrain from any\n     unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to a\n     drug test within 15 days of release on supervised release\n     and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as\n     determined by the court) for use of a controlled\n     substance.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n                                        -22-\n\fthat the plain error requirements were met in the individual case.\n\nUnited States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211, 220-23 (1st Cir. 2005) (en\n\nbanc).    For the reasons stated in Padilla, we conclude that the\n\nimproper delegation that occurred here does not rise to the level\n\nof plain error, since it neither affects substantial rights nor\n\n\"impugn[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the\n\ncriminal proceeding as a whole.\"            Id. at 220-23; see also Vega-\n\nOrtiz, 425 F.3d at 22; United States v. Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d\n\n65, 81-82 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1105 (2006).\n\nAccordingly, we decline to correct it.\n\n     C.    Ortiz-Torres\n\n     Ortiz-Torres claims that, pursuant to Guideline § 3E1.1(a)\n\n(2002), the district court should have awarded him a three-level\n\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility instead of the two-level\n\nreduction he received. It was Ortiz-Torres's burden to demonstrate\n\nthat he was entitled to the additional point reduction, and we will\n\nreverse   the   withholding     of   such   a   reduction    only   if   clearly\n\nerroneous.      United States    v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    Initially, we recognize, as did the district court, that\n\nOrtiz-Torres's request for a three-level reduction contradicts his\n\nstipulation     to   a   two-level   reduction    in   his   plea   agreement.\n\nHowever, like the district court, we conclude that even in the\n\nabsence of this stipulation, Ortiz-Torres was not entitled to a\n\nthree-level reduction because his guilty plea was untimely.\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f      A defendant qualifies for a two-level reduction for acceptance\n\nof   responsibility    under   Guideline   §   3E1.1(a)   if   he   \"clearly\n\ndemonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\"                A\n\ndefendant may receive an additional level reduction by, inter alia,\n\n\"timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of\n\nguilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for\n\ntrial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their\n\nresources efficiently.\" U.S.S.G, § 3E1.1(b)(2) (2002). As we have\n\npreviously   recognized,       \"[t]he   two-level    reduction      is   for\n\ncontrition,\" while \"the third level is for helping the authorities\n\nsave resources.\"      United States v. Hines, 196 F.3d 270, 274 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); see also U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. (n.2) (2002).\n\n      Ortiz-Torres argues that his acceptance of responsibility was\n\nsufficiently timely and beneficial to the government to warrant a\n\nthree-level reduction in light of the numerous witnesses and\n\nanticipated length of the trial the government and district court\n\nwere able to avoid.     To earn a three-level reduction, a defendant\n\nmust give notice of his intent to plead guilty \"at a sufficiently\n\nearly point in the process so that the government may avoid\n\npreparing for trial,\" which will usually be \"particularly early in\n\nthe case.\"   U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. n.6 (2002).           Ortiz-Torres and\n\nthe bulk of his indicted co-conspirators entered into the package\n\nplea deal after a jury had already been selected; the district\n\ncourt concluded that this was not early enough in the process to\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fmerit a three-level reduction.14 This determination was not clearly\n\nerroneous. See United States v. Donovan, 996 F.2d 1343, 1345 (1st\n\nCir.    1993)     (sustaining      denial    of    three-level     reduction   for\n\ndefendant who pled guilty on the eve of trial).\n\n       D.      Mattei-Albizu\n\n       Unlike his co-defendants, Mattei-Albizu was not a party to the\n\npackage plea agreement.            Instead, he entered a straight plea of\n\nguilty to conspiring to sell five kilograms or more of cocaine, as\n\nalleged in the indictment, an offense that carried a statutory\n\nminimum sentence of ten years.                   See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)\n\n(2000).       He also admitted to participating in the conspiracy from\n\n1997 until his September 2001 arrest.\n\n       The government stated at the change of plea hearing that if\n\nthe    case     had   gone   to   trial,    it    would   have   proven   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt that Mattei-Albizu conspired to distribute in\n\nexcess of 150 kilograms of cocaine and that he possessed a firearm\n\nin connection to the charged drug trafficking offense.                     Mattei-\n\nAlbizu requested and received an evidentiary hearing to contest\n\nthese sentencing factors. At the hearing, the government presented\n\n\n\n       14\n            As the district court explained:\n\n       If the Court were to grant you three points that would\n       mean that everyone would wait until the jury is selected.\n       And the law is clear that three points are granted only\n       if it is timely. And a plea entered after the jury has\n       been selected is definitely not timely.\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fthe testimony of two witnesses.        The first was Victor Iglesias-\n\nMoreno, a task force agent with the Ponce, Puerto Rico Drug\n\nEnforcement Agency, who had investigated the La Plena drug point.\n\nThe second witness was Josué Camacho-Aponte, an unindicted co-\n\nconspirator testifying as a material witness for the government,\n\nwho had participated in the La Plena drug point from 2000-2001.\n\nMattei-Albizu presented three witnesses to rebut any evidence that\n\nhe participated in a homicide.\n\n     Following the evidentiary hearings, the district court imposed\n\na two-level enhancement under Guideline § 2D1.1(b)(1)(2002) for\n\npossession of a dangerous weapon during the commission of a drug-\n\ntrafficking offense, determined that Mattei-Albizu was responsible\n\nfor in excess of 150 kilograms of cocaine,         and granted him a two-\n\nlevel reduction for acceptance of responsibility under Guideline §\n\n3E1.1(a)(2002).       Based on a total offense level of 38 and a\n\ncriminal    history    category   of   IV,   the   applicable   guideline\n\nimprisonment range was 324 to 405 months.          See Guideline § 2D1.1.\n\n(2002).    The district court sentenced Mattei-Albizu to 324 months'\n\nimprisonment, the bottom of the guidelines range.\n\n     Mattei-Albizu contends that the drug-quantity determination\n\nand firearm enhancement were unwarranted and that the district\n\ncourt's criminal history calculation was in error.         We review the\n\ndistrict court's interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de\n\nnovo and its findings of fact for clear error.         United States   v.\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fCaldwell, 358 F.3d 138, 142 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n      1.   Firearm enhancement\n\n      Mattei-Albizu challenges the two-level enhancement he received\n\nfor possession of a dangerous weapon during the commission of a\n\ndrug trafficking offense on the ground that the government failed\n\nto   establish   that   it   was   reasonably   foreseeable     to   him   that\n\nfirearms would be possessed in furtherance of the conspiracy.               See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1) (2002).           He argues that the government\n\nfailed to prove that he was involved in any of the murders alleged\n\nto have been committed by members of the La Plena drug trafficking\n\norganization and that the district court found at sentencing that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to link him to the murders.                  He\n\nclaims that without such proof the district court could not impose\n\nthe two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon.\n\n      Mattei-Albizu's argument would gain greater traction if the\n\ngovernment had stuck to its initial position: seeking a dangerous\n\nweapon enhancement based on proof that he was involved in a drug-\n\nrelated murder committed in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.\n\nHowever,   it    abandoned    that     theory   and   instead    sought     the\n\nenhancement under Guideline § 2D1.1(b)(1) by proving that \"it was\n\nreasonably foreseeable that a co-conspirator would possess a gun in\n\nfurtherance of the criminal activity.\" United States v. Casas, 356\n\nF.3d 104, 129 (1st Cir. 2004); see also United States v. May, 343\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2003).         Thus, the question was not, as Mattei-\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fAlbizu now argues, whether the government was able to prove his\n\ninvolvement in a murder, but rather, whether it was reasonably\n\nforeseeable to him that weapons would be used in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n     The district court made a finding of reasonable forseeability\n\nhere, stating that it had \"plenty of evidence\" from which to\n\nconclude that weapons were used by members of the conspiracy and\n\nthat this use of weapons was foreseeable to Mattei-Albizu.    Agent\n\nIglesias-Moreno testified that members of the La Plena organization\n\ncarried a variety of weapons and handguns, with sellers carrying\n\nweapons for \"keeping everything under control\" at the drug point,\n\nand that he had seen weapons seized by police from members of the\n\norganization.   Unindicted co-conspirator Camacho-Aponte testified\n\nthat he and Mattei-Albizu were drug sellers, that sellers were\n\nalways armed at the drug point, and that he personally saw Mattei-\n\nAlbizu carrying weapons on several occasions when the two went out\n\n\"hunting\" for members of rival drug gangs in order to kill them.\n\nFrom this testimony, the district court could have concluded that\n\nit was reasonably foreseeable to Mattei-Albizu that a dangerous\n\nweapon would be possessed in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n     Pointing to Camacho-Aponte's criminal record, his hope of\n\nobtaining a more lenient sentence in cases pending against him in\n\nstate court, and his desire to deter federal authorities from\n\nfiling charges against him for his admitted participation in a\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fdrug-related murder, Mattei-Albizu argues that Camacho-Aponte's\n\ntestimony should have been completely disregarded as unreliable or,\n\nat the very least, considered with caution.                 It is for the\n\nsentencing court to assess the credibility of the witness, and it\n\nis the for the appellate court to defer to that assessment unless\n\nit is clearly erroneous.         See, e.g., United States v. Nunez, 19\n\nF.3d 719, 724 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing United States v. Brum, 948\n\nF.2d 817, 819 (1st Cir. 1991)); see also 18 U.S.C. § 3742 (e)\n\n(stating that \"court of appeals shall give due regard to the\n\nopportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses\").      Indeed, in this case the district court specifically\n\ncredited Camacho-Aponte's testimony due to his personal involvement\n\nin the illegal activities to which he testified, despite the\n\ncourt's   frank    recognition    of    the   negative   credibility   issues\n\nsurrounding the testimony.15           In light of the district court's\n\ncareful consideration of Camacho-Aponte's credibility, we cannot\n\n\n\n     15\n      The district court repeatedly referred to Camacho-Aponte as\na \"bad hombre\" who \"admitted to murders in front of me\" and\nrecognized that Camacho-Aponte had not been charged in the murder\nto which he admitted participating. In one exchange with defense\ncounsel in this regard, the court stated:\n\n     I am very aware that the witness produced by the United\n     States, Mr. Camacho, would not qualify to be working in\n     the last ten years with Mother Teresa in Calcutta, nor\n     with Sister Isolina in Ponce. These were tough hombres\n     working together selling drugs, and they were armed\n     pursuant to the testimony of Mr. Camacho.\n\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\fconclude that it was clear error for the court to rely upon it in\n\nmaking its dangerous weapon finding.        See, e.g., United States v.\n\nWhalen, 82 F.3d 528, 531 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding district court's\n\nfinding   not    clearly   erroneous   despite   crediting   of   testimony\n\ndistrict court characterized as problematic).\n\n     2.    Drug quantity\n\n     Mattei-Albizu contends that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the district court's determination that he should be held\n\nresponsible for 150 kilograms of cocaine, and therefore, he should\n\nbe held responsible only for the amount he admitted to at his\n\nchange of plea hearing.        As an admitted participant in a drug\n\ntrafficking     conspiracy,    Mattei-Albizu     is    responsible   under\n\nGuideline § 1B1.3 for drugs he himself sold, transported, or\n\nnegotiated, as well as for drug quantities attributable to others\n\nthat are reasonably foreseeable to him in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.     See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 cmt. (n.2) (2002); May, 343 F.3d\n\nat 6; United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 228 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).     The district court's finding as to the amount of drugs\n\nreasonably foreseeable to Mattei-Albizu need only be supported by\n\na preponderance of the evidence and need not be exact so long as\n\nthe approximation represents a reasoned estimate. United States v.\n\nSantos, 357 F.3d 136, 141 (1st Cir. 2004).            We will set aside a\n\ndrug-quantity calculation only if clearly erroneous; if there are\n\ntwo reasonable views of the record, the district court's choice\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fbetween the two cannot be considered clearly erroneous.                  Id.\n\n     Mattei-Albizu       argues    that     the     testimony    at    sentencing\n\nregarding the conspiracy-wide drug-quantity was too inconsistent,\n\nand hence, too unreliable, to support an individualized drug-\n\nquantity finding.        Specifically, he points to the wide variance\n\nbetween the conspiracy-wide amounts testified to by Agent Iglesias-\n\nMoreno and co-conspirator Camacho-Aponte. Though the two witnesses\n\nprovided differing quantities, both testified to amounts greater\n\nthan the amount the district court attributed to Mattei-Albizu.\n\n     Based   on   drug    seizures    by     other    agents    and   information\n\nprovided by Camacho-Aponte, Agent Iglesias-Moreno testified that\n\napproximately two kilos each of heroin, cocaine and crack were sold\n\nout of the La Plena drug point each week.                      From this, Agent\n\nIglesias-Moreno estimated that from 1997 until 2001, the period in\n\nwhich Mattei-Albizu admitted to participating in the conspiracy, at\n\nleast five hundred kilos of cocaine were distributed at La Plena.\n\nHowever, Camacho-Aponte testified that he, like Mattei-Albizu and\n\nother sellers at La Plena, sold one kilogram each of heroin,\n\ncocaine, and crack every eight days.              The government concedes that\n\nan extrapolation of Camacho-Aponte's testimony yields a total of\n\napproximately     45   kilograms     of    each    narcotic    per    year,    which\n\nmultiplied by the four to five years Mattei-Albizu admitted to\n\nbeing a member of the conspiracy, yields an amount between 180 and\n\n225 kilograms of each narcotic, a significantly lower total than\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fthe \"at least 500 kilograms\" testified to by Agent Iglesias-Moreno.\n\n     The district court recognized that the drug quantity testified\n\nto by Agent Iglesias was more than double that testified to by\n\nCamacho-Aponte     at   the     evidentiary    hearing.         However,   it\n\nspecifically   credited       Camacho-Aponte's    testimony     and   adopted\n\nCamacho-Aponte's drug-quantity estimate in finding that Mattei-\n\nAlbizu was responsible for at least 150 kilograms of cocaine for an\n\noffense level of 38.      See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c) (2002).             Because\n\nCamacho-Aponte's    testimony     directly    supports   this   finding,   we\n\ncannot conclude that the district court's choice between two\n\nplausible views of the record was clearly erroneous.16           See Santos,\n\n357 F.3d at 141. Indeed, the district court's explicit recognition\n\nthat it was taking a cautious, \"conservative approach\" in adopting\n\nthe lower of the two estimates, sufficiently insulates this finding\n\nfrom clear error attack.       See United States v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107,\n\n113-14 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n     3.   Criminal history\n\n     Based on Mattei-Albizu's two prior offenses, the district\n\ncourt assigned him a criminal history category of IV.                 Mattei-\n\n\n\n     16\n      Again, Mattei-Albizu seeks to impeach the testimony of\nCamacho-Aponte on appeal, arguing that his bad acts and conflict of\ninterest made him an incredible and unreliable witness. Again, we\ndefer to the credibility assessments made by the sentencing court.\nSee United States v. Brewster, 1 F.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir. 1993). For\nthe reasons stated with respect to the firearm enhancement, we\nconclude that the district court's decision to credit Aponte's\ntestimony was not clearly erroneous.\n\n                                    -32-\n\fAlbizu claims that this was error because both prior offenses were\n\n\"relevant conduct\" to the instant conspiracy, and therefore neither\n\nshould have been counted in calculating his criminal history\n\ncategory.    See   U.S.S.G.   §§    4A1.2,   1B1.3   (2002).   By   his\n\ncalculation, if the district court had properly excluded both prior\n\noffenses, his criminal history category would have been I, or if\n\nthe district court had counted one offense, but not the other, his\n\ncriminal history category would have been III; in any event, he\n\nargues that his criminal history category should have been lower\n\nthan the one he received.\n\n     Mattei-Albizu was convicted for possessing narcotics in 1993\n\nand 1994, and sentenced for both offenses in 1995.       In connection\n\nwith the instant conspiracy prosecution, the government filed an\n\ninformative motion designating the 1993 and 1994 offenses as overt\n\nacts in furtherance of the conspiracy.          At his plea hearing,\n\nMattei-Albizu admitted to being a member of the charged conspiracy\n\nfrom 1997 to 2001. Because Mattei-Albizu did not admit to being a\n\nmember of the conspiracy during the time he committed his prior\n\noffenses, the presentence report recommended a criminal history\n\ncategory of IV to take into account the two prior offenses, rather\n\nthan treating them as relevant conduct to the charged conspiracy.\n\n     Before presenting its evidence at sentencing, the government\n\ninformed the district court that it would not dispute Mattei-\n\nAlbizu's stipulation that his participation in the conspiracy began\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fin 1997.   However, in so doing, it took the position that the 1993\n\nand 1994 offenses could no longer be considered as overt acts in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy, and should therefore be counted\n\ntowards his criminal history category.           Mattei-Albizu disputed the\n\ngovernment's contention that the prior offenses were outside the\n\nscope of the conspiracy, citing the government's informative motion\n\nin which it had specifically designated them as overt acts.                     In\n\nresponse, the government conceded that if the case had proceeded to\n\ntrial it would indeed have sought to prove that Mattei-Albizu was\n\ninvolved   in   the   conspiracy   as   early     as     1994   and   would   have\n\npresented the second offense as an overt act in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.     However, the government reminded the court that the\n\ncase was not going to trial because of Mattei-Albizu's guilty plea,\n\nwhich included the stipulation that he joined the conspiracy in\n\n1997.\n\n     In attempting to sort out the parties' arguments, the district\n\ncourt explained that the parties had to choose between treating the\n\nprior offenses as overt acts or for criminal history purposes. The\n\ndistrict court chose the latter, adopting the recommendation of the\n\npresentence report and assessing Mattei-Albizu six criminal history\n\npoints for the two prior offenses, as well as an additional two\n\npoints because he committed the instant offense within two years\n\nafter his release from imprisonment on the prior offenses.                    See\n\nU.S.S.G.   §    4A1.1(e)   (2002).          In   light    of    Mattei-Albizu's\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fstipulation that he was only a member of the conspiracy from 1997\n\nonward, we conclude that district court correctly counted the prior\n\noffenses for criminal history purposes.                    There was no error in\n\nholding Mattei-Albizu to the facts to which he stipulated.\n\n\n\nIII. Booker Claims\n\n     Appellants            Ortiz-Torres,         Cosme-Piri,     Torres-Santiago,\n\nRenovales-Vélez, and Mattei-Albizu each ask for their cases to be\n\nremanded to the district court for re-sentencing in accordance with\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).                    Torres-Santiago,\n\nOrtiz-Torres, Renovales-Vélez, and Cosme-Piri concede that they\n\nfailed to preserve their Booker claims in the district court; thus,\n\nwe review their sentences for plain error.                  See United States v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).17                  Mattei-Albizu\n\nargues that he preserved his Booker claim by objecting to the\n\nsentencing           court's   drug-quantity     determination.      A    defendant\n\npreserves Booker error by arguing to the district court that it\n\nerred        under    either   Apprendi   or     Blakely   or   arguing   that   the\n\nGuidelines were unconstitutional.                 United States v. McLean, 409\n\n\n\n        17\n      While conceding that he failed to preserve his Booker claim,\nTorres-Santiago urges us to presume prejudice because the plain\nerror standard is \"too restrictive.\" See, e.g., United States v.\nCrosby, 397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir. 2005). A panel of this circuit has\npreviously rejected this position, see Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at\n79-80, and we are not free to disregard it. See United States v.\nSerrano-Beauvaix, 400 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 2005) (Lipez, J.,\nconcurring).\n\n                                          -35-\n\fF.3d 492, 505 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at\n\n76), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 466 (2005).   Mattei-Albizu raised no\n\nsuch argument before the district court.    Therefore he, like his\n\nco-conspirators, must proceed under the plain error standard.\n\n     Under that standard, a defendant must show four things: (1)\n\nthat an error occurred, (2) that the error was clear or obvious,\n\n(3) that it affected substantial rights, and (4) that the error\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.    Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75 (citing\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-736 (1993)). Because the\n\ndistrict court treated the guidelines as mandatory at sentencing,\n\nthe first two requirements are satisfied. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Kornegay, 410 F.3d 89, 99 (1st Cir. 2005).18   At issue is whether\n\nappellants satisfy the third and the fourth.\n\n     The operative question with respect to the third requirement\n\nis “whether defendant has shown a reasonable probability the\n\nsentencing judge would, in a non-mandatory Guidelines system, have\n\nimposed a more lenient sentence.”   United States v. Ayala-Pizarro,\n\n407 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 247 (2005).\n\n\n\n     18\n      To the extent Ortiz-Torres, Cosme-Piri and Renovales-Vélez\nargue that the Sixth Amendment entitles them to jury findings on\nthe factual predicates of the sentencing enhancements they\nreceived, by stipulating to the enhancements as part of their\nguilty pleas, they waived the right to a jury determination on\nthese issues. United States v. Sahlin, 399 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.\n2005); United States v. González-Mercado, 402 F.3d 294, 299 (1st\nCir. 2005).\n\n                               -36-\n\fWe are not overly demanding in our proof; where the record or a\n\nplausible proffer reasonably indicates that an advisory guideline\n\nregime might have led the sentencing judge to a different result,\n\nwe will remand for resentencing. United States v. Lewis, 406 F.3d\n\n11, 21 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d\n\n220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005)).       However, the mere assertion that the\n\ndistrict court would have imposed a more favorable sentence is\n\ninsufficient.      McLean, 409 F.3d at 505.         Instead, we require the\n\nappellant to present \"specific facts\" to justify a Booker remand.\n\nKornegay, 410 F.3d at 100.\n\n     A.    Torres-Santiago\n\n     Pursuant to a plea agreement, Torres-Santiago stipulated to\n\nbeing responsible for between 50 and 150 kilograms of cocaine for\n\na base offense level of 36.     See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(2) (2002).          He\n\nfurther stipulated to a two-level enhancement for possession of a\n\nfirearm in relation to the charged crime, a four-level enhancement\n\nfor his leadership role, and a two-level reduction for acceptance\n\nof responsibility.      U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(1), 3B1.1(a), 3E1.1(a)\n\n(2002).    With a criminal history category of I, the applicable\n\nguidelines range would have been between 292 to 365 months; the\n\ndistrict   court    sentenced   him    to    336   months'   imprisonment   in\n\naccordance with the plea agreement.\n\n     Torres-Santiago argues that consideration of the sentencing\n\nfactors of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) would have resulted in a more\n\n                                      -37-\n\flenient sentence under an advisory guideline regime.      However, he\n\nfails to indicate how any of the listed factors would have created\n\na reasonable probability of a more lenient sentence. See Kornegay,\n\n410 F.3d at 100 (requiring \"specific facts\" to justify Booker\n\nremand, not merely recitation of sentencing factors).       Moreover,\n\nthe district court's comments at sentencing suggest that Torres-\n\nSantiago would be far more likely to receive a harsher sentence,\n\nnot a more lenient one, on remand.19    See United States v. Mercado,\n\n412 F.3d 243, 253 (1st Cir. 2005).     Finding no prejudice, we affirm\n\nthe sentence imposed by the district court.\n\n     B.   Cosme-Piri\n\n     Pursuant to a plea agreement with the government, Cosme-Piri\n\nstipulated that he was responsible for \"not less than one hundred\n\nfifty kilograms of cocaine\" and that \"such amount should be the\n\n\n     19\n      Before sentencing Torres-Santiago to 336 months' imprisonment\npursuant to the plea agreement, the district court stated:\n\n          Now, I'm going to respect that [plea] agreement, but\n     I want you all to know that I barely accept it . . .\n     because this gentleman has a few, and I mean a few\n     murders pending in the state court.\n\n          You know very well that we're doing him a favor by\n     sentencing him today because I would very well, say,\n     let's wait until we see what happens with those murders,\n     and when he comes back, if he's ever found in one, he's\n     serving life. But that was the agreement and I'm going\n     to respect it. But I want him to know that I have the\n     option today to postpone until all criminal cases are\n     finished in the local court. And if he had any murder or\n     any manslaughter this is a lifer, you know that.\n\n\n                               -38-\n\fproper drug quantity to be considered\" for sentencing purposes. He\n\nalso stipulated to a two-level enhancement for possession of a\n\nfirearm and a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(1), 3E1.1(a) (2002).           The parties agreed that\n\nthe applicable sentencing range under the guidelines was from 235\n\nto 293 months' imprisonment; the district court sentenced him to\n\n252 months as provided in the plea agreement.\n\n     Like Torres-Santiago, Cosme-Piri argues that consideration of\n\nthe § 3553(a) factors would have led to a more lenient sentence\n\nunder an advisory guidelines regime.             However, also like Torres-\n\nSantiago, Cosme-Piri puts forth no facts that he would offer on\n\nremand to justify a more lenient sentence, save for those arguments\n\nalready    considered     and   rejected    by    the    district   court    at\n\nsentencing.      Although the district court was aware that it was not\n\nrequired    to    honor   the   252-month        sentencing    recommendation\n\nstipulated to in the plea agreement, it did so nonetheless, even in\n\nthe face of Cosme-Piri's claim that he was less culpable than his\n\nco-defendants due to his shorter participation in the conspiracy.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that the district court would weigh the\n\nduration   of    Cosme-Piri's   participation       in   the   conspiracy   any\n\ndifferently under an advisory guidelines regime.\n\n     C.    Ortiz-Torres\n\n     Pursuant to a plea agreement, Ortiz-Torres stipulated that he\n\nwas responsible for at least 150 kilograms of cocaine.                He also\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\fstipulated to a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm\n\nand    a     two-level     reduction    for   acceptance   of    responsibility.\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(1), 3E1.1(a) (2002).                  The plea agreement\n\nprovided that the applicable guidelines range was between 235 and\n\n293 months' imprisonment.               However, Ortiz-Torres's presentence\n\nreport recommended a two-level leadership role enhancement that he\n\nhad not admitted to in the plea agreement, which would have\n\nresulted in a guidelines sentencing range of 292 to 365 months,\n\nwell    above     the    252-month     sentence   stipulated    to   in    the   plea\n\nagreement.\n\n       At sentencing, this discrepancy was brought to the attention\n\nof the district court. In order to accommodate the leadership role\n\nenhancement        while     still     honoring    the   252-month        sentencing\n\nrecommendation, the court recommended that the parties amend the\n\nplea agreement by reducing the drug quantity from 150 kilograms to\n\nbetween 50 and 150 kilograms of cocaine.20 The parties followed the\n\ndistrict court's recommendation and amended the plea agreement\n\naccordingly.         Accepting the amended plea, the district court\n\nsentenced Ortiz-Torres to the 252 months to which the parties had\n\nagreed.\n\n\n       20\n            Specifically, the court stated:\n\n       This is what he agreed to, so why don't we briefly amend\n       the plea, decrease the drugs, we remain with the amount\n       [of] leadership that was found and it is a just solution\n       to all. I am willing to approve it in that fashion.\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\f      Ortiz-Torres points to nothing in the record suggesting a\n\nreasonable probability that he would fare any better under an\n\nadvisory guidelines regime.            Indeed, he would be hard-pressed to\n\nmake such a showing in light of the district court's stated desire\n\nto honor the agreed to 252-month sentence, even in the face of a\n\ncontrary,    and    significantly        higher,     recommendation         in    the\n\npresentence investigation report.            The district court's statements\n\nthat it was \"going out of [its] way\" to honor the 252-month\n\nrecommendation suggests a reasonable probability that Ortiz-Torres\n\nwould receive an identical sentence on remand.                    Because Ortiz-\n\nTorres shows nothing to the contrary, he fails to establish that he\n\nwas   prejudiced    by   the    sentencing      court's    enforcement      of    his\n\nbargain.\n\n      D.    Renovales-Vélez\n\n      In his plea agreement, Renovales-Vélez admitted responsibility\n\nfor at least 150 kilograms of cocaine for a base offense level of\n\n38.   U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1).          He further stipulated to a two-level\n\nenhancement for possession of a firearm and a two-level reduction\n\nfor   acceptance    of   responsibility.           U.S.S.G.     §§    2D1.1(b)(1),\n\n3E1.1(a) (2002).     Assuming a criminal history category of I, which\n\nthe   presentence    report     ultimately      recommended,     the    applicable\n\nguidelines   sentencing        range   was     between    235   and   293   months'\n\nimprisonment.      The government agreed to a sentence of 252 months'\n\nimprisonment.         Recognizing        that     Renovales-Vélez       had      been\n\n\n                                        -41-\n\fincarcerated during a significant portion of the conspiracy, the\n\ndistrict     court   found   him    to     be    less   culpable    than   his     co-\n\ndefendants,     and,    notwithstanding          the    government's    objection,\n\nsentenced him to 238 months' imprisonment—fourteen months less than\n\nthe 252-month term the parties had stipulated to in the plea\n\nagreement and three months above the bottom of the applicable\n\nguidelines range.\n\n       To establish a reasonable probability of a more lenient\n\nsentence on remand, Renovales-Vélez relies solely on the fact that\n\nhis sentence was fourteen months lower than the sentence the\n\ngovernment agreed to in the plea agreement.                     Although he argues\n\nthat this is evidence the district court would go even lower under\n\nan advisory guidelines regime, it could just as easily indicate\n\nthat   the   district   court      would    exercise      its    discretion   in    an\n\nidentical manner on remand.         See Sahlin, 399 F.3d at 33 (finding no\n\npossible claim of prejudice where defendant receives sentence lower\n\nthan that stipulated to in a plea agreement).                      Renovales-Vélez\n\npoints to no additional facts he would present to the district\n\ncourt to convince it that it should go lower than the plea\n\nagreement than it already did.                  See McLean, 409 F.3d at 505.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the sentence he received was near the\n\nbottom of the applicable guidelines range is insufficient, standing\n\nalone, to establish prejudice.                  Kornegay, 410 F.3d at 99-100.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Renovales-Vélez fails to show he was\n\n\n                                         -42-\n\fprejudiced by the court's mandatory application of the sentencing\n\nguidelines.\n\n      E.   Mattei Albizu\n\n      Mattei-Albizu entered a straight plea of guilty to conspiring\n\nto sell five kilograms or more of cocaine, as alleged in the\n\nindictment, which carried a statutory minimum sentence of ten years\n\nand a maximum of life imprisonment.            See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1).     At\n\nthe change of plea hearing the government stated that if the case\n\nhad gone to trial it would have proven beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Mattei-Albizu conspired to distribute in excess of five\n\nkilograms of cocaine and that he possessed a firearm in relation to\n\nthe drug trafficking offense charged.\n\n      Following an evidentiary hearing on the drug-quantity and\n\nfirearm-possession sentencing factors, the district court imposed\n\na two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon during\n\nthe   commission   of       a    drug   trafficking     offense.   U.S.S.G.    §\n\n2D1.1(b)(1) (2002).         The court further determined that Mattei-\n\nAlbizu was responsible for in excess of 150 kilograms of cocaine\n\nfor a base offense level of 38, U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(1) (2002),\n\nand   granted   him     a       two-level   reduction    for   acceptance     of\n\nresponsibility,       U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a) (2002).           Based on a total\n\noffense level of 38 and a criminal history category of IV, the\n\napplicable guideline imprisonment range was 324 to 405 months. The\n\ndistrict court sentenced Mattei-Albizu to 324 months' imprisonment.\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\f     Mattei-Albizu contends that the disparity between his 324-\n\nmonth sentence and the 108-month sentence received by one of his\n\ncoconspirators, Jorge Lagase,21 requires a remand so that he may be\n\nresentenced in accordance with his \"real conduct.\" As the district\n\ncourt recognized, Lagase and Mattei-Albizu were not similarly\n\nsituated; thus, there is no reason for their sentences to be\n\nsimilar.   Lagase entered into a plea agreement much earlier in the\n\nprosecution of the present conspiracy and, unlike Mattei-Albizu,\n\ndid not request an evidentiary hearing to contest all the facts\n\nunderlying the applicable sentencing factors.        Stripped of its\n\nsentencing   disparity   patina,   Mattei-Albizu's   Booker   claim   is\n\nnothing more than a challenge to the district court's drug-quantity\n\ndetermination, a challenge which we have already rejected. Because\n\nhe fails to show prejudice as a result of the district court's\n\nmandatory application of the sentencing guidelines, we reject his\n\nBooker claim as well.\n\n\n\n\n     21\n      Despite admitting to a supervisory role in the La Plena drug\ntrafficking organization, Lagase was held accountable for a lesser\nquantity of cocaine:    between 3.5 and 5 kilograms compared to\nMattei-Albizu's in excess of 150 kilograms. In addition, unlike\nMattei-Albizu, Lagase did not receive a two-level enhancement for\npossession of a dangerous weapon. Accordingly, Lagase received a\nsignificantly lower sentence than did Mattei-Albizu: 108 months'\nimprisonment as compared to 324 months.\n\n                                   -44-\n\fIV.   Conclusion\n\n      The convictions and sentences imposed by the district court\n\nare affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -45-\n\f",

We affirm.\n\n     Appellants were members of a drug-trafficking organization\n\nthat operated drug distribution points in and around La Plena Ward\n\nin Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico from 1994 to 2001.1       A grand jury\n\nindicted each of them with conspiring to distribute \"multi-kilogram\n\nquantities\" of heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846, and with a forfeiture\n\nallegation of up to $1 million pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 982.\n\nAppellant Mattei-Albizu entered a straight plea of guilty to\n\nconspiring to possess with intent to distribute and conspiring to\n\ndistribute at least 3.5 kilograms but less than 5 kilograms of\n\ncocaine.

As in many such \"package plea\" arrangements, the\n\ngovernment offered the entire group of defendants charged in\n\nconnection with the La Plena drug point a favorable plea and\n\nsentencing   recommendation   on   the   condition   that   all   the   co-\n\ndefendants enter guilty pleas.\n\n     We have previously recognized that such package deals create\n\na significant risk that one defendant will plead guilty against his\n\nwill in order for his co-defendants to obtain the offered benefit.\n\nUnited States    v.

Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d at 8 (citing Martinez-Molina,\n\n64 F.3d at 732-33).      First, the prosecution should inform the\n\ndistrict court that the defendant's guilty plea is part of a\n\npackage deal.    Id.   Second, the district court should carefully\n\nascertain the voluntariness of the defendant's plea during the Rule\n\n11 colloquy, with an eye toward minimizing the risk of co-defendant\n\ncoercion inherent in the package-plea context.        Id.\n\n     The record of the Rule 11 proceeding below reflects that both\n\nsafeguards were observed.     First, there is little doubt that the\n\ndistrict court was fully aware that all the defendants, save for\n\nMattei-Albizu, were entering their pleas as part of a package deal.\n\nAt the joint change of plea hearing, in the presence of all\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fdefendants and their respective counsel, the government disclosed\n\nto the court that the individual pleas were part of a package deal.\n\nIndeed, on several occasions throughout the change of plea hearing\n\nthe district court specifically referred to the package nature of\n\ndefendants' pleas.\n\n      Second, the district court's Rule 11 inquiry was more than\n\nsufficient to guard against the risk of co-defendant coercion. The\n\ncourt individually questioned the defendants, asking whether they\n\nwere threatened or coerced by \"anyone\" or \"anybody\" into entering\n\ntheir individual guilty pleas.          Although this alone was likely\n\nsufficient, see, e.g., Mescual-Cruz, 387 F.3d at 9 (\"anyone\" or\n\n\"anybody\"); United States v. Sanchez-Barreto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196929\"><a href=\"/opinion/196929/united-states-v-sanchez-barreto/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (\"anyone\"), the court inquired further. It specifically\n\nnamed    each   co-defendant    and   asked   whether    any    of   them   had\n\nthreatened or coerced Ortiz-Torres or Cosme-Piri into pleading\n\nguilty, thereby probing whether the increased likelihood of co-\n\ndefendant coercion in the package-plea context had affected either\n\nof their decisions to plead guilty.\n\n        In light of these additional safeguards, the district court\n\nwas     entitled   to   rely   upon   Cosme-Piri's      and    Ortiz-Torres's\n\nrepresentations, made under oath, that they were neither coerced\n\nnor threatened into making their pleas.              See United States v.\n\nMarrero-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197543\"><a href=\"/opinion/197543/united-states-v-marrero-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349 (1st Cir. 1997).                   The only\n\nindication of the contrary comes from Cosme-Piri's and Ortiz-\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fTorres's general allegations of coercion on appeal, which are\n\ninsufficient, absent record support, to invalidate their guilty\n\npleas.       See Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d at 23.

However, also like all but one of his\n\nco-defendants,   Renovales-Vélez    entered   into   a   plea   agreement,\n\npursuant to which he pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute at least 150 kilograms of cocaine, in return\n\nfor the government's recommendation of 252 months' imprisonment.\n\nThe parties further agreed that if Renovales-Vélez's presentence\n\ninvestigation revealed convictions for offenses that took place\n\nduring the time period of the conspiracy, they would not be counted\n\nin determining his criminal history category.\n\n     Ultimately, Renovales-Vélez's presentence report listed four\n\nprior drug-related convictions in the Superior Court of Puerto\n\nRico: on December 21, 1994, Renovales-Vélez was arrested for\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute for which he was\n\nsentenced to three years' imprisonment; on January 25, 1995, he was\n\narrested and charged with the second and third offenses, possession\n\nof marijuana and heroin with the intent to distribute, for which he\n\nwas sentenced to a total of six years' imprisonment; and on\n\nFebruary 23, 1995, he was arrested and charged with possession with\n\nthe intent to distribute cocaine, for which he was sentenced to two\n\nyears' imprisonment.3   Although he received a sentence of eleven-\n\n\n\n     3\n      The sentences for all four convictions were imposed on May\n13, 1996 and ordered to run consecutively.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fyears' imprisonment on the four offenses, Renovales-Vélez had\n\nserved only 35 months of that sentence before being transferred to\n\nfederal custody to face the instant charges.\n\n     Since his prior drug offenses occurred during the period of\n\nthe charged cocaine trafficking conspiracy, the presentence report\n\nrecommended that they be treated as overt acts, resulting in zero\n\ncriminal history points. Consistent with the recommendation of the\n\npresentence report and the agreement of the parties, the district\n\ncourt assessed Renovales-Vélez zero criminal history points for his\n\nprior convictions, leaving him with a criminal history category of\n\nI.   Recognizing that Renovales-Vélez had been incarcerated due to\n\nthese prior convictions during a significant portion of the charged\n\nconspiracy, the district court found him to be less culpable than\n\nhis co-defendants, and accordingly, sentenced him to 238 months'\n\nimprisonment, rather than the 252-month sentence provided for in\n\nthe plea agreement.4\n\n     On appeal Renovales-Vélez argues that the district court was\n\nrequired      under   Guideline   §5G1.3(b)(2002)   to   run   his   federal\n\n\n\n      4\n          The sentencing court stated:\n\n     And the Court, because this defendant spent a\n     considerable amount of time in jail during the\n     conspiracy, and his participation is less than the other\n     gentlemen who have been also sentenced by this Court,\n     therefore, sentences him within the guideline but to a\n     lower amount than recommended in the plea . . . .\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fsentence concurrently with the undischarged portion of his state\n\nterm of imprisonment.

To\n\ndecide whether the district court erred in imposing his sentence,\n\nwe must determine whether his state offenses were \"fully taken into\n\naccount\"      in    determining     his   offense   level.   See   Guideline   §\n\n5G1.3(b)(2002).5       If they were, then Guideline § 5G1.3(b) required\n\nthe   court    to    impose   the    federal     term   concurrently   with   the\n\nundischarged state term, which would have reduced the federal\n\nsentence by approximately 97 months—the difference between the\n\nentire eleven-year state term and the 35 months Renovales-Vélez had\n\nserved on it before being transferred to federal custody.                     See\n\nUnited States v.

(n.2) (2002).\n\n\n      5\n          At the time of sentencing, Guideline § 5G1.3 provided:\n\n      (b) If . . . the undischarged term of imprisonment\n      resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into\n      account in the determination of the offense level for the\n      instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense\n      shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged\n      term of imprisonment.\n\n      (c) (Policy Statement) In any other case involving an\n      undischarged term of imprisonment, the sentence for the\n      instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently,\n      partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior\n      undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable\n      punishment for the instant offense.\n\n                                          -11-\n\f     Renovales-Vélez argues that because his state court offenses\n\nwere treated as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, they\n\nwere treated as relevant conduct under Guideline § 1B1.3, and\n\ntherefore \"fully taken into account\" under Guideline § 5G1.3(b).\n\nBecause   Guideline   §    5G1.3   \"is   directed   at   the   prevention   of\n\nduplicative sentencing for any particular conduct,\" we held in\n\nCaraballo that \"only relevant conduct that has resulted in-or that\n\ncould have resulted in-a change in the instant offense's            'offense\n\nlevel' is 'fully taken into account' under § 5G1.3(b).\"                     Id.\n\n(emphasis in original).      However, we also reasoned that mandatory\n\nconcurrent sentencing would be inappropriate where the defendant's\n\nundischarged prison term was for multiple offenses, but only some\n\nof those offenses were \"fully taken into account\" in determining\n\nthe instant offenses's offense level, since in such a situation the\n\ninstant offense may involve conduct unrelated to the conduct\n\nunderlying the undischarged term. Id. at 28. Accordingly, we held\n\nthat \"[w]hen some of the conduct underlying an undischarged term\n\nimpacted the offense level, but other aspects of that conduct did\n\nnot,\" the district court is free, under § 5G1.3(c), to choose\n\nwholly concurrent, partially concurrent, or wholly consecutive\n\nsentencing.   Id. at 29.\n\n     In the instant case, we face precisely this kind of \"multiple\n\noffense\" situation.       Renovales-Vélez's undischarged term of state\n\nimprisonment was the result of four separate offenses.                  Even\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fassuming that, in reaching its drug quantity determination and\n\ncorresponding offense level, the district court took into account\n\nhis two prior cocaine offenses,6 it could not have taken into\n\naccount   offenses   for   possession       of   marijuana   with    intent   to\n\ndistribute   and   possession   of    heroin,     since   these     convictions\n\npunished conduct unrelated to that punished by the instant cocaine\n\ntrafficking conviction.     Thus, as in Caraballo, Renovales-Vélez's\n\nundischarged state term was the result of multiple offenses, some\n\nof which may have been taken into account in setting his offense\n\nlevel for the federal conviction, while the rest clearly were not.\n\n200 F.3d at 27-28.    \"In short, because not all of the conduct from\n\nwhich [Renovales-Vélez's Puerto Rico] term resulted influenced his\n\nultimate offense level, not all of it was 'fully taken into\n\naccount' under § 5G1.3(b). The court below thus correctly chose to\n\napply § 5G1.3(c) instead.\"      Id. at 29.\n\n     Thus proceeding under subsection (c), the district court\n\n\n\n     6\n      The record does not conclusively demonstrate that the\ndistrict court took into account the unspecified quantities of\ncocaine involved in Renovales-Vélez's prior cocaine offenses in\ndetermining that he was responsible for at least 150 kilograms of\ncocaine and assessing the corresponding offense level of 38. See\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 (2002).    Indeed, the district court stated at\nsentencing that it was specifically relying on Renovales-Vélez's\nadmission in his plea that he was guilty of conspiring to possess\nwith intent to distribute \"at least 150 kilograms of cocaine\" and\nhis specific stipulation to an offense level of 38 in his plea\nagreement. However, because we conclude that even if his prior\ncocaine offenses were taken into account, Renovales-Vélez\nnonetheless is not entitled to wholly concurrent sentencing, we\nneed not resolve this question.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fenjoyed the discretion to impose a wholly concurrent, partially\n\nconcurrent, or wholly consecutive sentence, so long as the end\n\nresult was reasonable.

Under this framework,\nRenovales-Vélez would likewise not be entitled to concurrent\nsentencing because he fails to demonstrate that his prior cocaine-\nrelated offenses were \"the basis for an increase\" in the drug\nquantity determination underlying the offense level for the instant\ncocaine trafficking offense.\n\n\n     8\n      According to the stipulated facts in the plea agreement, each\nmonth for the duration of the conspiracy the organization sold at\nleast five kilograms of cocaine, one kilogram of heroin, more than\nfifty grams of cocaine base, and approximately five pounds of\n\n                                  -15-\n\fdrug quantity, the parties agreed that the applicable sentencing\n\nrange was from 235 to 293 months' imprisonment, and the government\n\nagreed to recommend a sentence of 252 months.          At the change of\n\nplea hearing, Cosme-Piri acknowledged these stipulations and stated\n\nthat he understood the terms of the plea agreement.\n\n     At sentencing, counsel for Cosme-Piri objected to the offense-\n\nlevel computation in the presentence investigation report.              He\n\nrequested   that   the   district     court   lower   the    drug-quantity\n\ncalculation because Cosme-Piri had participated in the conspiracy\n\nfor a shorter period of time than other co-conspirators whose plea\n\nagreements provided for lesser drug quantities.             The government\n\nresponded that Cosme-Piri had specifically stipulated in his plea\n\nagreement to the amount of cocaine for which he personally was\n\nresponsible and this amount was not tied to the length of his\n\ninvolvement in the conspiracy.\n\n     The court rejected Cosme-Piri's request and sentenced him to\n\n252 months' imprisonment, as provided in the plea agreement.           The\n\ncourt explained that other co-defendants had received drug-quantity\n\nreductions in return for their stipulation to leadership role\n\nenhancements, and not because their involvement in the conspiracy\n\nwas any less than that originally contemplated in their plea\n\n\nmarijuana.   Notwithstanding these conspiracy-wide amounts, the\nparties agreed that Cosme-Piri would be held responsible for \"not\nless than one hundred fifty kilograms of cocaine\" and that \"such\namount should be the proper drug quantity to be considered\" for\nsentencing purposes.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fagreements.

While the mere existence of this mandatory minimum may\n\nprovide sufficient \"constructive notice\" that a five-year term\n\nwould apply, see Tulloch, 380 F.3d at 11-14, the five-year term was\n\nalso included in the plea agreement, explained to Cosme-Piri and\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\faccepted by him at the change of plea hearing, and reiterated in\n\nthe presentence investigation report.\n\n       At no point did Cosme-Piri object to the length of the\n\nsupervised release term.        When the district court stated that it\n\nwas imposing a three-year term, in contravention of the statutory\n\nminimum, the plea agreement, and the presentence investigation\n\nreport, it became incumbent upon Cosme-Piri to request further\n\nclarification, which he did not do.          See Tulloch, 380 F.3d at 14\n\nn.7.        Indeed, the need for clarification was especially acute in\n\nthis case, since the district court's oral pronouncement of a\n\nthree-year term at sentencing hearing was immediately preceded by\n\nits reference to a five-year term.12        In this context, the district\n\ncourt's isolated reference to a three-year term appears to have\n\nbeen    an     inadvertent   mistake.      Although   this   reference   was\n\nerroneous, the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming\n\nevidence that Cosme-Piri had notice that a five-year term would\n\napply. See Vega-Ortiz, 425 F.3d at 21-23.\n\n\n       12\n            The district court stated:\n\n            Based on a total offense level of 38, and criminal\n       history category one, the guideline imprisonment range in\n       this particular case is from 235 to 293 months, with a\n       fine range of twenty-five thousand to four million, plus\n       a supervised release term of not more than five years.\n\n            The Court will follow the plea agreement as\n       stipulated by the parties and sentence the defendant\n       accordingly.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n                                    -21-\n\f     Cosme-Piri's       second   challenge     to   the   term   of   supervised\n\nrelease likewise fails.          Both at sentencing and in its written\n\njudgment, the district court stated that Cosme-Piri's term of\n\nsupervised release would be subject to the following condition:\n\n     The defendant . . . shall submit to a drug test within\n     fifteen (15) days of release on supervised release, and\n     thereafter when so requested by the U.S. Probation\n     Officer.\n\nCosme-Piri     argues    that    this     condition   improperly      delegates\n\nauthority to the probation officer to determine the frequency and\n\nquantity of drug testing.\n\n     In United States v.

Initially, we recognize, as did the district court, that\n\nOrtiz-Torres's request for a three-level reduction contradicts his\n\nstipulation     to   a   two-level   reduction    in   his   plea   agreement.\n\nHowever, like the district court, we conclude that even in the\n\nabsence of this stipulation, Ortiz-Torres was not entitled to a\n\nthree-level reduction because his guilty plea was untimely.\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f      A defendant qualifies for a two-level reduction for acceptance\n\nof   responsibility    under   Guideline   §   3E1.1(a)   if   he   \"clearly\n\ndemonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\"                A\n\ndefendant may receive an additional level reduction by, inter alia,\n\n\"timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of\n\nguilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for\n\ntrial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their\n\nresources efficiently.\" U.S.S.G, § 3E1.1(b)(2) (2002).

To earn a three-level reduction, a defendant\n\nmust give notice of his intent to plead guilty \"at a sufficiently\n\nearly point in the process so that the government may avoid\n\npreparing for trial,\" which will usually be \"particularly early in\n\nthe case.\"   U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, cmt. n.6 (2002).

Mattei-Albizu\n\n       Unlike his co-defendants, Mattei-Albizu was not a party to the\n\npackage plea agreement.            Instead, he entered a straight plea of\n\nguilty to conspiring to sell five kilograms or more of cocaine, as\n\nalleged in the indictment, an offense that carried a statutory\n\nminimum sentence of ten years.                   See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)\n\n(2000).       He also admitted to participating in the conspiracy from\n\n1997 until his September 2001 arrest.\n\n       The government stated at the change of plea hearing that if\n\nthe    case     had   gone   to   trial,    it    would   have   proven   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt that Mattei-Albizu conspired to distribute in\n\nexcess of 150 kilograms of cocaine and that he possessed a firearm\n\nin connection to the charged drug trafficking offense.                     Mattei-\n\nAlbizu requested and received an evidentiary hearing to contest\n\nthese sentencing factors. At the hearing, the government presented\n\n\n\n       14\n            As the district court explained:\n\n       If the Court were to grant you three points that would\n       mean that everyone would wait until the jury is selected.\n       And the law is clear that three points are granted only\n       if it is timely. And a plea entered after the jury has\n       been selected is definitely not timely.\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fthe testimony of two witnesses.

Based on a total offense level of 38 and a\n\ncriminal    history    category   of   IV,   the   applicable   guideline\n\nimprisonment range was 324 to 405 months.          See Guideline § 2D1.1.\n\n(2002).    The district court sentenced Mattei-Albizu to 324 months'\n\nimprisonment, the bottom of the guidelines range.\n\n     Mattei-Albizu contends that the drug-quantity determination\n\nand firearm enhancement were unwarranted and that the district\n\ncourt's criminal history calculation was in error.

Firearm enhancement\n\n      Mattei-Albizu challenges the two-level enhancement he received\n\nfor possession of a dangerous weapon during the commission of a\n\ndrug trafficking offense on the ground that the government failed\n\nto   establish   that   it   was   reasonably   foreseeable     to   him   that\n\nfirearms would be possessed in furtherance of the conspiracy.               See\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1) (2002).           He argues that the government\n\nfailed to prove that he was involved in any of the murders alleged\n\nto have been committed by members of the La Plena drug trafficking\n\norganization and that the district court found at sentencing that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to link him to the murders.                  He\n\nclaims that without such proof the district court could not impose\n\nthe two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon.\n\n      Mattei-Albizu's argument would gain greater traction if the\n\ngovernment had stuck to its initial position: seeking a dangerous\n\nweapon enhancement based on proof that he was involved in a drug-\n\nrelated murder committed in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.\n\nHowever,   it    abandoned    that     theory   and   instead    sought     the\n\nenhancement under Guideline § 2D1.1(b)(1) by proving that \"it was\n\nreasonably foreseeable that a co-conspirator would possess a gun in\n\nfurtherance of the criminal activity.\" United States v.

Agent\n\nIglesias-Moreno testified that members of the La Plena organization\n\ncarried a variety of weapons and handguns, with sellers carrying\n\nweapons for \"keeping everything under control\" at the drug point,\n\nand that he had seen weapons seized by police from members of the\n\norganization.   Unindicted co-conspirator Camacho-Aponte testified\n\nthat he and Mattei-Albizu were drug sellers, that sellers were\n\nalways armed at the drug point, and that he personally saw Mattei-\n\nAlbizu carrying weapons on several occasions when the two went out\n\n\"hunting\" for members of rival drug gangs in order to kill them.\n\nFrom this testimony, the district court could have concluded that\n\nit was reasonably foreseeable to Mattei-Albizu that a dangerous\n\nweapon would be possessed in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n     Pointing to Camacho-Aponte's criminal record, his hope of\n\nobtaining a more lenient sentence in cases pending against him in\n\nstate court, and his desire to deter federal authorities from\n\nfiling charges against him for his admitted participation in a\n\n\n                               -28-\n\fdrug-related murder, Mattei-Albizu argues that Camacho-Aponte's\n\ntestimony should have been completely disregarded as unreliable or,\n\nat the very least, considered with caution.                 It is for the\n\nsentencing court to assess the credibility of the witness, and it\n\nis the for the appellate court to defer to that assessment unless\n\nit is clearly erroneous.

As an admitted participant in a drug\n\ntrafficking     conspiracy,    Mattei-Albizu     is    responsible   under\n\nGuideline § 1B1.3 for drugs he himself sold, transported, or\n\nnegotiated, as well as for drug quantities attributable to others\n\nthat are reasonably foreseeable to him in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.

The district court's finding as to the amount of drugs\n\nreasonably foreseeable to Mattei-Albizu need only be supported by\n\na preponderance of the evidence and need not be exact so long as\n\nthe approximation represents a reasoned estimate. United States v.\n\nSantos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200851\"><a href=\"/opinion/200851/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (1st Cir. 2004).            We will set aside a\n\ndrug-quantity calculation only if clearly erroneous; if there are\n\ntwo reasonable views of the record, the district court's choice\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fbetween the two cannot be considered clearly erroneous.                  Id.\n\n     Mattei-Albizu       argues    that     the     testimony    at    sentencing\n\nregarding the conspiracy-wide drug-quantity was too inconsistent,\n\nand hence, too unreliable, to support an individualized drug-\n\nquantity finding.        Specifically, he points to the wide variance\n\nbetween the conspiracy-wide amounts testified to by Agent Iglesias-\n\nMoreno and co-conspirator Camacho-Aponte. Though the two witnesses\n\nprovided differing quantities, both testified to amounts greater\n\nthan the amount the district court attributed to Mattei-Albizu.\n\n     Based   on   drug    seizures    by     other    agents    and   information\n\nprovided by Camacho-Aponte, Agent Iglesias-Moreno testified that\n\napproximately two kilos each of heroin, cocaine and crack were sold\n\nout of the La Plena drug point each week.                      From this, Agent\n\nIglesias-Moreno estimated that from 1997 until 2001, the period in\n\nwhich Mattei-Albizu admitted to participating in the conspiracy, at\n\nleast five hundred kilos of cocaine were distributed at La Plena.\n\nHowever, Camacho-Aponte testified that he, like Mattei-Albizu and\n\nother sellers at La Plena, sold one kilogram each of heroin,\n\ncocaine, and crack every eight days.              The government concedes that\n\nan extrapolation of Camacho-Aponte's testimony yields a total of\n\napproximately     45   kilograms     of    each    narcotic    per    year,    which\n\nmultiplied by the four to five years Mattei-Albizu admitted to\n\nbeing a member of the conspiracy, yields an amount between 180 and\n\n225 kilograms of each narcotic, a significantly lower total than\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\fthe \"at least 500 kilograms\" testified to by Agent Iglesias-Moreno.\n\n     The district court recognized that the drug quantity testified\n\nto by Agent Iglesias was more than double that testified to by\n\nCamacho-Aponte     at   the     evidentiary    hearing.         However,   it\n\nspecifically   credited       Camacho-Aponte's    testimony     and   adopted\n\nCamacho-Aponte's drug-quantity estimate in finding that Mattei-\n\nAlbizu was responsible for at least 150 kilograms of cocaine for an\n\noffense level of 38.      See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c) (2002).             Because\n\nCamacho-Aponte's    testimony     directly    supports   this   finding,   we\n\ncannot conclude that the district court's choice between two\n\nplausible views of the record was clearly erroneous.16           See Santos,\n\n357 F.3d at 141. Indeed, the district court's explicit recognition\n\nthat it was taking a cautious, \"conservative approach\" in adopting\n\nthe lower of the two estimates, sufficiently insulates this finding\n\nfrom clear error attack.       See United States v. Sklar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n113-14 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n     3.

Mattei-\n\n\n\n     16\n      Again, Mattei-Albizu seeks to impeach the testimony of\nCamacho-Aponte on appeal, arguing that his bad acts and conflict of\ninterest made him an incredible and unreliable witness. Again, we\ndefer to the credibility assessments made by the sentencing court.\nSee United States v. Brewster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194846\"><a href=\"/opinion/194846/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 55 (1st Cir. 1993). For\nthe reasons stated with respect to the firearm enhancement, we\nconclude that the district court's decision to credit Aponte's\ntestimony was not clearly erroneous.\n\n                                    -32-\n\fAlbizu claims that this was error because both prior offenses were\n\n\"relevant conduct\" to the instant conspiracy, and therefore neither\n\nshould have been counted in calculating his criminal history\n\ncategory.    See   U.S.S.G.   §§    4A1.2,   1B1.3   (2002).   By   his\n\ncalculation, if the district court had properly excluded both prior\n\noffenses, his criminal history category would have been I, or if\n\nthe district court had counted one offense, but not the other, his\n\ncriminal history category would have been III; in any event, he\n\nargues that his criminal history category should have been lower\n\nthan the one he received.\n\n     Mattei-Albizu was convicted for possessing narcotics in 1993\n\nand 1994, and sentenced for both offenses in 1995.       In connection\n\nwith the instant conspiracy prosecution, the government filed an\n\ninformative motion designating the 1993 and 1994 offenses as overt\n\nacts in furtherance of the conspiracy.          At his plea hearing,\n\nMattei-Albizu admitted to being a member of the charged conspiracy\n\nfrom 1997 to 2001. Because Mattei-Albizu did not admit to being a\n\nmember of the conspiracy during the time he committed his prior\n\noffenses, the presentence report recommended a criminal history\n\ncategory of IV to take into account the two prior offenses, rather\n\nthan treating them as relevant conduct to the charged conspiracy.\n\n     Before presenting its evidence at sentencing, the government\n\ninformed the district court that it would not dispute Mattei-\n\nAlbizu's stipulation that his participation in the conspiracy began\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fin 1997.   However, in so doing, it took the position that the 1993\n\nand 1994 offenses could no longer be considered as overt acts in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy, and should therefore be counted\n\ntowards his criminal history category.           Mattei-Albizu disputed the\n\ngovernment's contention that the prior offenses were outside the\n\nscope of the conspiracy, citing the government's informative motion\n\nin which it had specifically designated them as overt acts.                     In\n\nresponse, the government conceded that if the case had proceeded to\n\ntrial it would indeed have sought to prove that Mattei-Albizu was\n\ninvolved   in   the   conspiracy   as   early     as     1994   and   would   have\n\npresented the second offense as an overt act in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.     However, the government reminded the court that the\n\ncase was not going to trial because of Mattei-Albizu's guilty plea,\n\nwhich included the stipulation that he joined the conspiracy in\n\n1997.\n\n     In attempting to sort out the parties' arguments, the district\n\ncourt explained that the parties had to choose between treating the\n\nprior offenses as overt acts or for criminal history purposes. The\n\ndistrict court chose the latter, adopting the recommendation of the\n\npresentence report and assessing Mattei-Albizu six criminal history\n\npoints for the two prior offenses, as well as an additional two\n\npoints because he committed the instant offense within two years\n\nafter his release from imprisonment on the prior offenses.                    See\n\nU.S.S.G.   §    4A1.1(e)   (2002).          In   light    of    Mattei-Albizu's\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fstipulation that he was only a member of the conspiracy from 1997\n\nonward, we conclude that district court correctly counted the prior\n\noffenses for criminal history purposes.                    There was no error in\n\nholding Mattei-Albizu to the facts to which he stipulated.\n\n\n\nIII.

However, the mere assertion that the\n\ndistrict court would have imposed a more favorable sentence is\n\ninsufficient.      McLean, 409 F.3d at 505.         Instead, we require the\n\nappellant to present \"specific facts\" to justify a Booker remand.\n\nKornegay, 410 F.3d at 100.\n\n     A.    Torres-Santiago\n\n     Pursuant to a plea agreement, Torres-Santiago stipulated to\n\nbeing responsible for between 50 and 150 kilograms of cocaine for\n\na base offense level of 36.     See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(2) (2002).          He\n\nfurther stipulated to a two-level enhancement for possession of a\n\nfirearm in relation to the charged crime, a four-level enhancement\n\nfor his leadership role, and a two-level reduction for acceptance\n\nof responsibility.      U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(1), 3B1.1(a), 3E1.1(a)\n\n(2002).    With a criminal history category of I, the applicable\n\nguidelines range would have been between 292 to 365 months; the\n\ndistrict   court    sentenced   him    to    336   months'   imprisonment   in\n\naccordance with the plea agreement.\n\n     Torres-Santiago argues that consideration of the sentencing\n\nfactors of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) would have resulted in a more\n\n                                      -37-\n\flenient sentence under an advisory guideline regime.

See Kornegay,\n\n410 F.3d at 100 (requiring \"specific facts\" to justify Booker\n\nremand, not merely recitation of sentencing factors).       Moreover,\n\nthe district court's comments at sentencing suggest that Torres-\n\nSantiago would be far more likely to receive a harsher sentence,\n\nnot a more lenient one, on remand.19    See United States v.

Finding no prejudice, we affirm\n\nthe sentence imposed by the district court.\n\n     B.   Cosme-Piri\n\n     Pursuant to a plea agreement with the government, Cosme-Piri\n\nstipulated that he was responsible for \"not less than one hundred\n\nfifty kilograms of cocaine\" and that \"such amount should be the\n\n\n     19\n      Before sentencing Torres-Santiago to 336 months' imprisonment\npursuant to the plea agreement, the district court stated:\n\n          Now, I'm going to respect that [plea] agreement, but\n     I want you all to know that I barely accept it . . .\n     because this gentleman has a few, and I mean a few\n     murders pending in the state court.\n\n          You know very well that we're doing him a favor by\n     sentencing him today because I would very well, say,\n     let's wait until we see what happens with those murders,\n     and when he comes back, if he's ever found in one, he's\n     serving life. But that was the agreement and I'm going\n     to respect it. But I want him to know that I have the\n     option today to postpone until all criminal cases are\n     finished in the local court.

He\n\nalso stipulated to a two-level enhancement for possession of a\n\nfirearm and a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(1), 3E1.1(a) (2002).           The parties agreed that\n\nthe applicable sentencing range under the guidelines was from 235\n\nto 293 months' imprisonment; the district court sentenced him to\n\n252 months as provided in the plea agreement.\n\n     Like Torres-Santiago, Cosme-Piri argues that consideration of\n\nthe § 3553(a) factors would have led to a more lenient sentence\n\nunder an advisory guidelines regime.             However, also like Torres-\n\nSantiago, Cosme-Piri puts forth no facts that he would offer on\n\nremand to justify a more lenient sentence, save for those arguments\n\nalready    considered     and   rejected    by    the    district   court    at\n\nsentencing.      Although the district court was aware that it was not\n\nrequired    to    honor   the   252-month        sentencing    recommendation\n\nstipulated to in the plea agreement, it did so nonetheless, even in\n\nthe face of Cosme-Piri's claim that he was less culpable than his\n\nco-defendants due to his shorter participation in the conspiracy.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that the district court would weigh the\n\nduration   of    Cosme-Piri's   participation       in   the   conspiracy   any\n\ndifferently under an advisory guidelines regime.\n\n     C.    Ortiz-Torres\n\n     Pursuant to a plea agreement, Ortiz-Torres stipulated that he\n\nwas responsible for at least 150 kilograms of cocaine.                He also\n\n\n                                    -39-\n\fstipulated to a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm\n\nand    a     two-level     reduction    for   acceptance   of    responsibility.\n\nU.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(1), 3E1.1(a) (2002).                  The plea agreement\n\nprovided that the applicable guidelines range was between 235 and\n\n293 months' imprisonment.               However, Ortiz-Torres's presentence\n\nreport recommended a two-level leadership role enhancement that he\n\nhad not admitted to in the plea agreement, which would have\n\nresulted in a guidelines sentencing range of 292 to 365 months,\n\nwell    above     the    252-month     sentence   stipulated    to   in    the   plea\n\nagreement.\n\n       At sentencing, this discrepancy was brought to the attention\n\nof the district court. In order to accommodate the leadership role\n\nenhancement        while     still     honoring    the   252-month        sentencing\n\nrecommendation, the court recommended that the parties amend the\n\nplea agreement by reducing the drug quantity from 150 kilograms to\n\nbetween 50 and 150 kilograms of cocaine.20 The parties followed the\n\ndistrict court's recommendation and amended the plea agreement\n\naccordingly.         Accepting the amended plea, the district court\n\nsentenced Ortiz-Torres to the 252 months to which the parties had\n\nagreed.\n\n\n       20\n            Specifically, the court stated:\n\n       This is what he agreed to, so why don't we briefly amend\n       the plea, decrease the drugs, we remain with the amount\n       [of] leadership that was found and it is a just solution\n       to all. I am willing to approve it in that fashion.\n\n\n                                         -40-\n\f      Ortiz-Torres points to nothing in the record suggesting a\n\nreasonable probability that he would fare any better under an\n\nadvisory guidelines regime.            Indeed, he would be hard-pressed to\n\nmake such a showing in light of the district court's stated desire\n\nto honor the agreed to 252-month sentence, even in the face of a\n\ncontrary,    and    significantly        higher,     recommendation         in    the\n\npresentence investigation report.            The district court's statements\n\nthat it was \"going out of [its] way\" to honor the 252-month\n\nrecommendation suggests a reasonable probability that Ortiz-Torres\n\nwould receive an identical sentence on remand.                    Because Ortiz-\n\nTorres shows nothing to the contrary, he fails to establish that he\n\nwas   prejudiced    by   the    sentencing      court's    enforcement      of    his\n\nbargain.\n\n      D.    Renovales-Vélez\n\n      In his plea agreement, Renovales-Vélez admitted responsibility\n\nfor at least 150 kilograms of cocaine for a base offense level of\n\n38.   U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(1).          He further stipulated to a two-level\n\nenhancement for possession of a firearm and a two-level reduction\n\nfor   acceptance    of   responsibility.           U.S.S.G.     §§    2D1.1(b)(1),\n\n3E1.1(a) (2002).     Assuming a criminal history category of I, which\n\nthe   presentence    report     ultimately      recommended,     the    applicable\n\nguidelines   sentencing        range   was     between    235   and   293   months'\n\nimprisonment.      The government agreed to a sentence of 252 months'\n\nimprisonment.         Recognizing        that     Renovales-Vélez       had      been\n\n\n                                        -41-\n\fincarcerated during a significant portion of the conspiracy, the\n\ndistrict     court   found   him    to     be    less   culpable    than   his     co-\n\ndefendants,     and,    notwithstanding          the    government's    objection,\n\nsentenced him to 238 months' imprisonment—fourteen months less than\n\nthe 252-month term the parties had stipulated to in the plea\n\nagreement and three months above the bottom of the applicable\n\nguidelines range.\n\n       To establish a reasonable probability of a more lenient\n\nsentence on remand, Renovales-Vélez relies solely on the fact that\n\nhis sentence was fourteen months lower than the sentence the\n\ngovernment agreed to in the plea agreement.                     Although he argues\n\nthat this is evidence the district court would go even lower under\n\nan advisory guidelines regime, it could just as easily indicate\n\nthat   the   district   court      would    exercise      its    discretion   in    an\n\nidentical manner on remand.         See Sahlin, 399 F.3d at 33 (finding no\n\npossible claim of prejudice where defendant receives sentence lower\n\nthan that stipulated to in a plea agreement).                      Renovales-Vélez\n\npoints to no additional facts he would present to the district\n\ncourt to convince it that it should go lower than the plea\n\nagreement than it already did.                  See McLean, 409 F.3d at 505.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the sentence he received was near the\n\nbottom of the applicable guidelines range is insufficient, standing\n\nalone, to establish prejudice.                  Kornegay, 410 F.3d at 99-100.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Renovales-Vélez fails to show he was\n\n\n                                         -42-\n\fprejudiced by the court's mandatory application of the sentencing\n\nguidelines.\n\n      E.   Mattei Albizu\n\n      Mattei-Albizu entered a straight plea of guilty to conspiring\n\nto sell five kilograms or more of cocaine, as alleged in the\n\nindictment, which carried a statutory minimum sentence of ten years\n\nand a maximum of life imprisonment.            See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1).     At\n\nthe change of plea hearing the government stated that if the case\n\nhad gone to trial it would have proven beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Mattei-Albizu conspired to distribute in excess of five\n\nkilograms of cocaine and that he possessed a firearm in relation to\n\nthe drug trafficking offense charged.\n\n      Following an evidentiary hearing on the drug-quantity and\n\nfirearm-possession sentencing factors, the district court imposed\n\na two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon during\n\nthe   commission   of       a    drug   trafficking     offense.   U.S.S.G.    §\n\n2D1.1(b)(1) (2002).         The court further determined that Mattei-\n\nAlbizu was responsible for in excess of 150 kilograms of cocaine\n\nfor a base offense level of 38, U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(b)(1) (2002),\n\nand   granted   him     a       two-level   reduction    for   acceptance     of\n\nresponsibility,       U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a) (2002).           Based on a total\n\noffense level of 38 and a criminal history category of IV, the\n\napplicable guideline imprisonment range was 324 to 405 months. The\n\ndistrict court sentenced Mattei-Albizu to 324 months' imprisonment.\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\f     Mattei-Albizu contends that the disparity between his 324-\n\nmonth sentence and the 108-month sentence received by one of his\n\ncoconspirators, Jorge Lagase,21 requires a remand so that he may be\n\nresentenced in accordance with his \"real conduct.\" As the district\n\ncourt recognized, Lagase and Mattei-Albizu were not similarly\n\nsituated; thus, there is no reason for their sentences to be\n\nsimilar.   Lagase entered into a plea agreement much earlier in the\n\nprosecution of the present conspiracy and, unlike Mattei-Albizu,\n\ndid not request an evidentiary hearing to contest all the facts\n\nunderlying the applicable sentencing factors.        Stripped of its\n\nsentencing   disparity   patina,   Mattei-Albizu's   Booker   claim   is\n\nnothing more than a challenge to the district court's drug-quantity\n\ndetermination, a challenge which we have already rejected. Because\n\nhe fails to show prejudice as a result of the district court's\n\nmandatory application of the sentencing guidelines, we reject his\n\nBooker claim as well.\n\n\n\n\n     21\n      Despite admitting to a supervisory role in the La Plena drug\ntrafficking organization, Lagase was held accountable for a lesser\nquantity of cocaine:    between 3.5 and 5 kilograms compared to\nMattei-Albizu's in excess of 150 kilograms. In addition, unlike\nMattei-Albizu, Lagase did not receive a two-level enhancement for\npossession of a dangerous weapon. Accordingly, Lagase received a\nsignificantly lower sentence than did Mattei-Albizu: 108 months'\nimprisonment as compared to 324 months.\n\n                                   -44-\n\fIV.   Conclusion\n\n      The convictions and sentences imposed by the district court\n\nare affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -45-\n\f</pre>",
