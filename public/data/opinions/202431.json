Herman Henry and Ambessa Hagos\n\nBerhe1 each petition for review of Board of Immigration Appeals'\n\ndecisions ordering their removal. We have written a single opinion\n\ndealing with those separate petitions because they both question\n\nwhether     a    state     misdemeanor      drug   offense      can    constitute        an\n\n\"aggravated       felony\"    for    the   purposes       of   the   Immigration       and\n\nNationality Act (INA).            See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).             Petitioners\n\nface   removal      from    the    United    States      on   the     basis    of   their\n\nrespective       state   misdemeanor        convictions       for   possession      of    a\n\ncontrolled substance.             The Board denied their applications for\n\ndiscretionary relief from removal on account of their aggravated\n\nfelony convictions.          The petitioners argue, inter alia, that their\n\nrespective state convictions should not be considered \"aggravated\n\nfelonies\" because Massachusetts, the convicting authority in both\n\ncases, classified the crimes as misdemeanors.\n\n                We reject the petitioners' contentions that we may only\n\nlook   to   state     law    in    such   cases    and   reaffirm       that    a   state\n\nmisdemeanor drug offense can amount to an \"aggravated felony\" if\n\nthat offense would have been a felony had it been charged under the\n\nfederal drug laws.           Because Henry's offense -- possession with\n\nintent to distribute -- would have been a felony had it been\n\n\n\n1\n Although we have indicated this petitioner's name consistent with\nthe administrative record, his brief states that his proper name is\n\"Ambessa Berhe Hagos.\" Whichever is correct, we shall refer to him\nin this opinion simply as \"Berhe.\"\n\n                                          -3-\n\fcharged under federal law, we deny his petition.                       The record of\n\nBerhe's state conviction, however, reveals that he was convicted\n\nmerely for simple possession, a misdemeanor under federal law. For\n\nthat reason, among others, we vacate the Board's order and remand\n\nBerhe's case for further proceedings.\n\n                We    begin   our   discussion      by   outlining      the    relevant\n\nprocedural and factual background of the respective petitions.\n\n                                           I.\n\nA.    Henry's petition\n\n                Henry is a Jamaican national who was admitted to the\n\nUnited States as a permanent resident in 1984.                  In 2001, he pleaded\n\nguilty in Massachusetts state court to possession of marijuana with\n\nintent to distribute in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, §\n\n32C(a), a misdemeanor under Massachusetts law.                       Two years later,\n\nHenry traveled abroad and was denied re-admission upon his return\n\nto   the    United      States.      The   Department      of   Homeland       Security\n\n(DHS)charged Henry with being removable because of his 2001 drug\n\nconviction.            See    INA    §   212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II),           8     U.S.C.   §\n\n1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (declaring inadmissible \"any alien convicted\n\nof\" violating a law \"relating to a controlled substance\"); INA §\n\n212(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(C)(i) (declaring inadmissible\n\nany alien \"the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe . .\n\n.    is    or   has    been   an    illicit      trafficker     in    any   controlled\n\nsubstance\").\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f          At a hearing before an immigration judge, Henry admitted\n\nthe factual allegations charged by DHS and conceded removability on\n\nthe ground that he had violated a law relating to controlled\n\nsubstances.   He denied, however, that he was removable as an\n\n\"illicit trafficker\" in controlled substances.    He also filed an\n\napplication for cancellation of removal, arguing that his removal\n\nwould result in exceptional hardship to his family living in the\n\nUnited States, who were all either citizens or lawful permanent\n\nresidents.    See INA § 240A(a), 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3).       The\n\nimmigration judge found Henry removable as charged.    Although the\n\njudge deemed Henry eligible for cancellation of removal, she denied\n\nHenry's application as a matter of discretion.   Both Henry and DHS\n\nappealed to the Board.\n\n          DHS challenged the immigration judge's legal conclusion\n\nthat Henry was eligible for cancellation of removal.   According to\n\nDHS, Henry was ineligible for such relief because he had been\n\nconvicted of an \"aggravated felony.\"      See id. (providing the\n\nAttorney General with discretion to cancel the removal of any alien\n\nwho \"has not been convicted of any aggravated felony\"); id. §\n\n1101(a)(43)(B) (defining \"aggravated felony\").\n\n          The Board sustained DHS's appeal.      It observed that,\n\nunder this court's precedent, a state drug offense qualifies as an\n\n\"aggravated felony\" if it is punishable under one of the federal\n\ndrug enforcement statutes, including the Controlled Substances Act\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f(CSA), and is a felony.    See Amaral v. INS, 977 F.2d 33, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).     The Board found that possession of marijuana with\n\nintent to distribute is punishable under the CSA by a maximum of\n\nfive years' imprisonment, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D), and\n\nwould be classified as a felony under federal law, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3559(a) (any offense punishable by more than one year in prison is\n\na felony).    Because Henry's Massachusetts offense would have been\n\npunishable as a felony under federal law, the Board concluded that\n\nit was an \"aggravated felony\" under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(B). The\n\nBoard therefore found Henry ineligible for cancellation of removal\n\nand ordered him removed to Jamaica.\n\nB.   Berhe's petition\n\n           Berhe was born in 1978 in a city in Ethopia, which is now\n\na part of Eritrea.      His birth mother gave him up for adoption\n\nduring the Ethiopian civil war and his adoptive parents thereafter\n\ntook him to Sudan.   Four years later, in 1987, he and his adoptive\n\nparents were admitted to the United States as refugees.    In 1988,\n\nBerhe's status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident.     Since\n\nhis admission to the United States, Berhe has never returned to\n\nEritrea.     Nor has he had any contact with any surviving family\n\nmembers there.\n\n           In 1996, Berhe was convicted in a Massachusetts municipal\n\ncourt for simple possession of crack cocaine under Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 94C, § 34, and for assault and battery of a police officer, and\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fwas sentenced to six months' probation. In 2003, he pleaded guilty\n\nto simple possession of crack cocaine in Massachusetts state\n\ndistrict court, and received a six-month suspended sentence.                In\n\nprosecuting the 2003 offense, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts did\n\nnot charge Berhe with a prior conviction because it did not seek a\n\nrecidivism-based sentence enhancement.            See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n278,   §   11A   (providing   that   if   the   government   seeks   enhanced\n\npenalties because of a prior conviction, the defendant \"shall be\n\nentitled to a trial by jury of the issue of conviction of a prior\n\noffense\").       Both the 1996 conviction and the 2003 conviction were\n\nmisdemeanors under Massachusetts law. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 274,\n\n§ 1 (\"A crime punishable by death or imprisonment in the state\n\nprison is a felony.      All other crimes are misdemeanors.\").\n\n            In 2004, DHS initiated removal proceedings against Berhe,\n\ncharging that he was removable because of his 2003 conviction for\n\nsimple possession of crack cocaine.         See INA § 237(a)(2)(B)(i), 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (providing that any alien convicted of\n\nviolating a law \"relating to a controlled substance . . . is\n\ndeportable\").         Berhe   conceded     removability,     but     submitted\n\napplications seeking cancellation of removal, asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\nBerhe's asylum application asserted that he would be persecuted on\n\naccount of his religion were he returned to Eritrea.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f          DHS    subsequently   filed    a   supplemental   charge    of\n\nremovability contending that Berhe's 2003 conviction was for an\n\n\"aggravated felony,\" see id. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (\"Any alien who\n\nis convicted of an aggravated felony . . . is deportable.\").         DHS\n\nargued that because Berhe had a prior drug conviction, his 2003\n\nmisdemeanor simple possession conviction was an \"aggravated felony\"\n\nunder the INA.   See id. § 1101(a)(43)(B).    As a result, DHS argued,\n\nBerhe was statutorily ineligible for the discretionary relief of\n\nasylum or cancellation of removal.      See id. §§ 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii),\n\n1158(b)(2)(B)(i), 1229b(a)(3).   DHS also argued that an aggravated\n\nfelony is presumptively a \"particularly serious crime,\" which\n\nrendered Berhe ineligible for withholding of removal.        See id. §\n\n1231(b)(3)(B)(ii).\n\n          Following a hearing, an immigration judge found Berhe\n\nremovable on the basis of the original controlled substance charge,\n\nbut not on the aggravated felony charge. The judge concluded that,\n\nbecause Berhe's 2003 conviction was classified by Massachusetts law\n\nas a misdemeanor, it could not be considered an aggravated felony.\n\nThe judge therefore evaluated Berhe's claims for relief and granted\n\nhim asylum, withholding of removal, and cancellation of removal,\n\nbut denied relief under the CAT.        DHS appealed to the Board and\n\nBerhe filed a cross-appeal from the denial of his CAT claim.\n\n          The Board sustained DHS's appeal.      The Board stated that\n\nit would apply the First Circuit's approach for determining whether\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthe state conviction is an aggravated felony. The Board found that\n\nBerhe's 2003 offense was punishable under federal law as a felony\n\nbecause his prior drug possession offense converted his subsequent\n\npossession conviction into a felony.                  Because Berhe had been\n\nconvicted of an aggravated felony, the Board found him ineligible\n\nfor asylum or cancellation of removal and therefore did not reach\n\nthe   merits   of   those     claims.         The   Board   also   reversed   the\n\nimmigration judge's grant of withholding of removal on the ground\n\nthat Berhe had not shown \"a clear probability of persecution on\n\naccount of any protected ground,\" and dismissed Berhe's cross-\n\nappeal as untimely.         The Board ordered Berhe removed to Eritrea.\n\n                                        II.\n\n            Henry     and    Berhe   separately       challenge    the   Board's\n\ninterpretation of \"aggravated felony.\" They contend that the Board\n\nerred by treating their state misdemeanor convictions as aggravated\n\nfelonies under the INA.        Berhe additionally challenges the Board's\n\nmerits-based determination overturning the immigration judge's\n\ndecision granting him withholding of removal and contends that the\n\nBoard's refusal to consider his CAT claim as untimely was erroneous\n\nas a matter of law.         We begin with their common challenge to the\n\ndefinition of \"aggravated felony.\"\n\nA.    Aggravated Felony\n\n            Because    this     issue   concerns      the   interpretation    of\n\nstatutory provisions, viz., 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) and 18 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f924(c)(2), our review is de novo.             Enwonwu v. Gonazales, 438 F.3d\n\n22, 34-35 & n.12 (1st Cir. 2006).             Although we ordinarily accord\n\ndeference to the Board's reasonable interpretation of a silent or\n\nambiguous      provision   of    the   INA,    and   the    Board's     choice   of\n\nmethodology for resolving a given issue arising under the INA may\n\nbe regarded as an interpretation, we do not accord such deference\n\nin an \"aggravated felony\" case because, as we describe below, see\n\ninfra at 13, the BIA has taken a passive stance with regard to the\n\ninterpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).                Conteh v. Gonzales, No.\n\n05-1282, --- F.3d ---, 2006 WL 2406942, at *4 n.3 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            The INA establishes a comprehensive list of offenses that\n\nqualify   as    aggravated      felonies.      See   8    U.S.C.   §   1101(a)(43)\n\n(providing 21 subcategories of aggravated felony offenses, many of\n\nwhich cross-reference to other U.S. Code provisions).                  Included in\n\nthis list is \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as\n\ndefined in section 802 of Title 21), including a drug trafficking\n\ncrime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18). . . .                 whether in\n\nviolation of State or Federal law.\" Id. § 1101(a)(43)(B) (emphasis\n\nadded).     \"Drug trafficking crime,\" in turn, means \"any felony\n\npunishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et\n\nseq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C.\n\n951 et seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C.\n\nApp. 1901 et seq.).\"       18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f              The Board has interpreted § 1101(a)(43)(B) to provide two\n\npaths for arriving at an aggravated felony finding.                         The first\n\nroute   is     based     on   the   \"illicit       trafficking    in   a    controlled\n\nsubstance\" language, and is not relevant to these cases.                              See\n\nGerbier v. Holmes, 280 F.3d 297, 313 (3d Cir. 2002) (noting that\n\nunder the \"illicit trafficking route\" the state offense \"must be a\n\nfelony under the law of the convicting sovereign\" and \"must contain\n\na trafficking element\").                 The second route is premised on the\n\nlanguage     \"drug      trafficking       crime\"   as   defined   in   18     U.S.C.    §\n\n924(c)(2).      The Board concluded in Matter of Davis, 20 I&N Dec. 536\n\n(BIA 1992), that in terms of the \"drug trafficking crime\" route,\n\nany   state     drug     offense,        whether   classified     as   a    felony     or\n\nmisdemeanor in that state, is an aggravated felony if the same\n\nconduct would have been punishable as a felony if charged under one\n\nof the three federal statutes enumerated in § 924(c)(2).                         Id. at\n\n543; see also Gerbier, 280 F.3d at 306.                      This methodology is\n\nsometimes       referred      to    as    the   \"hypothetical     federal        felony\"\n\napproach.      See Gerbier, 280 F.3d at 306.\n\n              The Board later clarified that the term \"any felony\" in\n\n§ 924(c)(2) refers to the definition of felony in 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3559(a),       which     provides    catchall       classifications        for   crimes\n\ncodified in Title 18.            In re L-G-, 21 I&N Dec. 89, 94 (BIA 1995);\n\n18    U.S.C.     §     3559(a)     (classifying      any   offense     that      is   not\n\nspecifically classified in the substantive section defining the\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\foffense).    Under that provision, a \"felony\" is any offense where\n\nthe maximum term of imprisonment authorized is more than one year.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3559(a).      Thus, the Board ruled that a state drug\n\noffense could constitute an aggravated felony, in terms of the\n\n\"drug trafficking crime\" route, only if it is punishable by more\n\nthan one year of imprisonment under one of the three federal drug\n\nstatutes enumerated in § 924(c)(2).     In re L-G-, 21 I&N Dec. at 96.\n\nIn other words, under the Board's strict \"hypothetical federal\n\nfelony\" approach, the phrase \"drug trafficking crime\" meant any\n\nconviction punishable by more than one year of imprisonment under\n\none of the federal drug laws.\n\n            This approach has received mixed reviews from the circuit\n\ncourts.     In the civil immigration context, several circuits have\n\nadopted the Board's hypothetical federal felony approach.       E.g.,\n\nGonzales-Gomes v. Achim, 441 F.3d 532, 534-36 (7th Cir. 2006);\n\nUnited States v. Palacios-Suarez, 418 F.3d 692, 698-700 (6th Cir.\n\n2005); Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, 382 F.3d 905, 912-18 (9th\n\nCir. 2004); Gerbier, 280 F.3d at 308-12; Aguirre v. INS, 79 F.3d\n\n315, 317-18 (2d Cir. 1996).     Under this approach, the underlying\n\nstate classification of the offense is irrelevant.       The circuits\n\nthat have adopted this approach emphasize that focusing solely on\n\nfederal law properly accounts for the need to apply the nation's\n\nimmigration laws uniformly, and that an approach that allows the\n\nvagaries of state law to influence the determination would defeat\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fthis purpose.    See, e.g., Achim, 441 F.3d at 535; Gerbier, 280 F.3d\n\nat 311-12.\n\n            At   least   two   circuits   have   taken   a   more   flexible\n\napproach.    These circuits hold that a state conviction constitutes\n\nan \"aggravated felony\" if it (1) is punishable under one of the\n\nfederal drug enforcement statutes, and (2) is a hypothetical\n\nfederal felony or is a felony under the law of the convicting\n\nstate.   E.g., Lopez v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 934, 936-37 (8th Cir.\n\n2005), cert. granted, 126 S. Ct. 1651 (2006); United States v.\n\nHernandez-Avalos, 251 F.3d 505, 507-08 (5th Cir. 2001). This \"dual\n\napproach\" derives from circuit decisions interpreting the meaning\n\nof \"aggravated felony\" in the criminal sentencing context.2\n\n            In light of the split in circuit authority, the Board\n\nretreated from strictly applying the hypothetical federal felony\n\n\n2\n The United States Sentencing Guidelines provide a sentence\nenhancement for aliens who, after having been previously deported\nfollowing a conviction for an \"aggravated felony,\" unlawfully\nreturn to or remain in the United States.          See U.S.S.G. §\n2L1.2(b)(1)(C) (2005).      The Guidelines in turn define an\n\"aggravated felony\" by reference to the definition in the INA. See\nid. § 2L1.2 cmt. n.3 (2005). The majority of circuits that have\nconfronted the \"aggravated felony\" question in this context have\nutilized the dual approach, finding that a felony drug conviction\nunder state law can amount to a \"drug trafficking crime\" regardless\nof how the crime would be classified under analogous federal law.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, 412 F.3d 572, 574\n(5th Cir. 2005); United States v. Ramirez, 344 F.3d 247, 251, 253-\n54 (2d Cir. 2003); United States v. Wilson, 316 F.3d 506, 512-13\n(4th Cir. 2003); United States v. Ibarra-Galindo, 206 F.3d 1337,\n1339-40 (9th Cir. 2000); United States v. Briones-Mata, 116 F.3d\n308, 309 (8th Cir. 1997). But see Palacios-Suarez, 418 F.3d at 697\n-700 (adopting the hypothetical federal felony approach for both\nimmigration and sentencing cases).\n\n                                   -13-\n\fapproach in all cases, in favor of applying the approach of the\n\ncircuit in which the case before it originated.                   See In re Yanez-\n\nGarcia, 23 I&N Dec. 390, 396-98 (BIA 2002).                 In those circuits that\n\nhave not definitively ruled on the issue, the Board follows the\n\nposition   taken   by    the     majority      of   the     circuits   in   criminal\n\nsentencing cases--the dual approach.                Id.\n\n           In the present cases, the Board interpreted our precedent\n\nas applying the dual approach.           Accordingly, the Board found that\n\nthe   petitioners'      state    drug   offenses          would   constitute   \"drug\n\ntrafficking crimes\" if they were (1) punishable under one of the\n\nthree statutes enumerated in § 924(c)(2), and (2) punishable as a\n\nfelony under either federal or state law.                  See Amaral v. INS, 977\n\nF.2d 33, 36-37 (1st Cir. 1992) (finding that petitioner had been\n\nconvicted of an aggravated felony because his state drug offense\n\nwould be a felony under federal law); United States v. Restrepo-\n\nAguilar, 74 F.3d 361, 364-67 (1st Cir. 1996) (finding that the\n\ndefendant was an aggravated felon because his state offense was a\n\nfelony under state law and it violated the CSA).                   The Board found\n\nAmaral to control in both cases.\n\n           In Amaral, the Board found that the petitioner was an\n\naggravated felon, and therefore deportable and ineligible for\n\ndiscretionary relief, because of three state court convictions for\n\npossession of cocaine.          See 977 F.2d at 34.          On review, we did not\n\nresolve the merits of the Board's decision because we lacked\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fjurisdiction.        Id. at 37.     Our jurisdictional ruling, however,\n\nrequired us to consider whether the petitioner was an aggravated\n\nfelon under the INA.      Id. at 35 (noting that if the petitioner was\n\nan aggravated felon, his petition for review was untimely).3                 In\n\nthat   case,    as    here,   the   question    was    whether   any   of   the\n\npetitioner's state offenses was a \"felony\" under § 924(c)(2).\n\nBecause of § 924(c)(2)'s cross-reference to the CSA, we consulted\n\nthe CSA's definition of \"felony\" as \"any Federal or State offense\n\nclassified by applicable Federal or State Law as a felony.\"             Id. at\n\n36 (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 802(13)).              Although we noted that the\n\npetitioner's offenses were felonies under state law, we undertook\n\na federal analysis of the petitioner's crimes.              See id. at 36 &\n\nn.3.   We concluded that, although a simple possession offense is\n\nordinarily a misdemeanor under the CSA, see 21 U.S.C. § 844(a),\n\n\"one prior conviction turns possession into a felony since the\n\nmaximum penalty increases to over a year.\"            Amaral, 977 F.2d at 34.\n\nThus, we ruled that, \"under [a] literal application of §§ 844(a)\n\nand 3559(a),\" the subsequent possession conviction amounted to a\n\nfelony under federal law.         Id.\n\n\n\n\n3\n Under the INA at that time, aggrieved aliens were generally\nallowed 90 days to file a petition to review a final order of\ndeportation, but aggravated felons were given only 30 days.      8\nU.S.C. § 1105a(a)(1) (repealed 1996). Under the current version of\nthe INA, all aliens must file their petitions \"not later than 30\ndays after the date of the final order of removal.\" 8 U.S.C. §\n1252(b)(1).\n\n                                        -15-\n\f          Applying    Amaral,       the    Board   found    that    Henry's\n\nMassachusetts conviction, possession of marijuana with intent to\n\ndistribute, is punishable under the CSA by a maximum of five years'\n\nimprisonment,   see   21   U.S.C.    §    841(a)(1),   (b)(1)(D),   and    is\n\ntherefore a felony under federal law, see 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a).            The\n\nBoard found that Berhe's 2003 conviction for simple possession,\n\nalthough ordinarily punishable as a misdemeanor under federal law,\n\nwould be converted to a felony because of his previous possession\n\nconviction.   See Amaral, 977 F.2d at 36; 21 U.S.C. § 844(a).         Thus,\n\nthe Board concluded that both Henry and Berhe had been convicted\n\nfor \"drug trafficking crimes\" as defined in § 924(c)(2).\n\n          Petitioners argue that, because their respective state\n\ndrug offenses were not classified as felonies by the convicting\n\nauthority, they should not be considered aggravated felonies.4\n\nThey contend that our holding in Restrepo-Aguilar mandates that the\n\nlaw of the prosecuting jurisdiction controls for purposes of\n\ndetermining whether an offense is a felony or misdemeanor.             They\n\n\n\n4\n Henry also argues that his underlying state offense -- possession\nof a controlled substance with intent to manufacture, distribute,\ndispense or cultivate, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, § 32C(a) -- is\nnot sufficiently analogous to any federal offense to be deemed\n\"punishable under\" one of the federal drug enforcement statutes.\nHe argues that the Massachusetts statute to which he pleaded guilty\nis broader in scope than the closest federal analogue. Henry's\nargument is a nonstarter. Assuming arguendo that the Massachusetts\nstatute is broader, the particular conduct to which Henry pleaded\nguilty, possession of a controlled substance with intent to\ndistribute, is clearly punishable under the CSA. See 21 U.S.C. §\n841(a)(1).\n\n                                    -16-\n\fpoint out that in Restrepo-Aguilar, we found that a state felony\n\nconviction     was   a   \"felony\"    for     purposes     of     §   924(c)(2)\n\nnotwithstanding that it would have been a misdemeanor under federal\n\nlaw.   See     Restrepo-Aguilar,    74     F.3d   at   364-65.       Thus,   the\n\npetitioners argue, we discarded the approach in Amaral (which they\n\ncharacterize as dicta) in favor of an approach that looks to the\n\nprosecuting jurisdiction to determine the classification of an\n\noffense.     They contend that the word \"applicable\" in § 802(13)'s\n\ndefinition of \"felony\" requires us to consult the law actually\n\napplied by the convicting authority.\n\n           The petitioners misread our precedent.           First, Amaral's\n\nruling was not dicta.      In Amaral, we were required to determine\n\nwhether the petitioner had been convicted of an \"aggravated felony\"\n\nas defined in the INA, and in doing so, we employed a method that\n\nlooked to the offense's hypothetical status under federal law. See\n\nid. at 36.      Though we might have grounded our decision on the\n\nstate's classification of the offense, we did not do so.               See id.\n\nCf. United States v. Johnson, 256 F.3d 895, 914 (9th Cir. 2001) (en\n\nbanc) (noting that when a federal appellate court \"confronts an\n\nissue germane to the eventual resolution of the case, and resolves\n\nit after reasoned consideration in a published opinion, that ruling\n\nbecomes the law of the circuit, regardless of whether doing so is\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fnecessary in some strict logical sense\").5     Moreover, subsequent\n\nrulings of this court have followed the Amaral approach. Less than\n\ntwo years after Amaral, we applied precisely the same analysis in\n\na sentencing case.   See United States v. Forbes, 16 F.3d 1294, 1301\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).      We found that the defendant's first state\n\nconviction for possession of a controlled substance would have\n\nconverted his second state possession conviction into a felony\n\nunder federal law.   See id. (citing 21 U.S.C. § 844(a); 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3559(a)).   Although, as in Amaral, the underlying offenses were\n\nalso felonies under state law, our application of the aggravated\n\nfelony enhancement was predicated on our finding that the state\n\noffense was punishable as a felony under federal law.       See id.\n\nForbes also suggests that a felony classification under either\n\nfederal or state law will suffice to meet § 924(c)(2)'s \"any\n\nfelony\" requirement. See id.; see also United States v. Cuevas, 75\n\nF.3d 778, 783 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that the defendant's state\n\ndrug offense \"undoubtedly qualifies as a felony\" because it is\n\npunishable as a felony under federal law).\n\n\n\n\n5\n It is of little import that we did not resolve the merits of the\nBoard's aggravated felony determination in Amaral. To be sure, the\n\"aggravated felony\" question arose in a jurisdictional inquiry.\nSee 977 F.2d at 35. But the question presented, and the statutory\nlanguage at issue, were precisely the same as that considered here.\nOur holding that the petitioner had been convicted of an\n\"aggravated felony\" was expressly premised on a finding that the\noffense was punishable as a felony under the CSA. See id. at 36.\n\n                                -18-\n\f            Second, Restrepo-Aguilar did not overrule or undermine\n\nAmaral.    The defendant in Restrepo-Aguilar appealed the district\n\ncourt's application of the aggravated felon sentence enhancement.\n\nSee   74   F.3d   at    363   (citing    U.S.S.G.   §    2L1.2(b)(2)    (1994)).\n\nAlthough we recognized that the definition of \"aggravated felony\"\n\nin U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2 was essentially the same as the definition in\n\nthe INA, we declined to adopt the Board's precedent which, at the\n\ntime, applied the strict hypothetical federal felony approach. See\n\nid.   366-67.      We   noted   that    the    Board's   rationale     was   based\n\nsignificantly on \"policy concerns relating to the consequences\n\nflowing from a deportation decision or a decision on an application\n\nfor asylum, without regard to any of the policies that inform the\n\nmeaning of 'aggravated felony' in the context of the statutory\n\nprior offense enhancement or its implementation in the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.\"      Restrepo-Aguilar, 74 F.3d at 366.         Viewing Amaral as\n\nenduring precedent, we were also careful to distinguish it based on\n\nthe differing contexts.         Id. at 366 n.6.\n\n            More importantly, however, we noted that our approach in\n\nRestrepo-Aguilar was entirely consistent with Amaral and Forbes.\n\nSee id.    We observed that our cases interpreted the phrase \"drug\n\ntrafficking crime\" in § 924(c)(2) to encompass \"two separate\n\nelements: (1) that the offense be punishable under the Controlled\n\nSubstances Act (or one of the other two statutes identified); and\n\n(2) that the offense be a felony.\"             Id. at 364 (citing Forbes, 16\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fF.3d at 1301; Amaral 977 F.2d at 36).    We further observed that §\n\n924(c)(2)'s definition of \"drug trafficking crime,\" \"by its terms\n\nincludes 'any felony' that is criminalized under the CSA.\"      Id.\n\nThus, we found that the definition \"does not limit its application\n\nto offenses that would be classified as felonies\" under federal\n\nlaw.   Id. (emphasis supplied).    Moreover, we stressed that the\n\nCSA's definition of \"felony\" provided further support for the idea\n\nthat a felony designation under either federal or state law would\n\nbe sufficient.   See id. (\"[T]he CSA itself defines a felony as 'any\n\nFederal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State\n\nlaw as a felony.'\") (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 802(13)).   It is clear we\n\nread \"applicable\" to mean, not the law actually applied, but,\n\nconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the word, the law \"capable\n\nof being applied.\"     Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 56\n\n(10th ed. 2001).   Thus, we held that a state drug conviction may\n\nconstitute an aggravated felony if it was classified as a felony\n\nunder state law (even if it would have been a misdemeanor under\n\nfederal law), but we did not suggest that a state offense could\n\nconstitute an aggravated felony only if it was classified as a\n\nfelony under state law.   See Restrepo-Aguilar, 74 F.3d at 364-66.\n\n          Accordingly, we conclude that the Board was correct to\n\nemploy the hypothetical federal felony methodology outlined in\n\nAmaral.   For the purposes of determining whether a state drug\n\noffense is an \"aggravated felony\" under the INA, our circuit\n\n\n                                -20-\n\fprecedent permits an analysis that considers whether the underlying\n\noffense would have been punishable as a felony under federal law.\n\nAs discussed above, we are not alone.   While there is disagreement\n\nconcerning whether it is permissible to consult state law in making\n\nthe aggravated felony determination, as far as we can tell, all the\n\ncircuits to have considered the issue agree that a state drug\n\noffense that would be punishable as a felony under the CSA is a\n\n\"drug trafficking crime\" under § 924(c)(2).     See supra at 11-12.\n\nTo our knowledge, no circuit has endorsed the approach urged here\n\n-- requiring that the underlying offense be a felony under state\n\nlaw.\n\nB.   Henry's Case\n\n           Applying Amaral's hypothetical federal felony approach,\n\nthe Board's determination that Henry is an aggravated felon is\n\nclearly correct.       Henry's state conviction for possession of\n\nmarijuana with intent to distribute, which would be punishable\n\nunder the CSA by a maximum of five years' imprisonment, see 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D), is a felony under federal law, see\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3559(a).    The Board therefore properly determined that\n\nHenry is ineligible for cancellation of removal.     See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229b(a)(3).   We next consider Berhe's alternative arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fC.   Berhe's Arguments\n\n            1. Sufficiency of the evidence supporting the aggravated\n            felony finding\n\n            Berhe argues that, even applying the hypothetical federal\n\nfelony approach, his 2003 state drug possession conviction is not\n\na felony under federal law because the 1996 conviction was neither\n\ncharged nor proven during the 2003 proceeding. He notes that under\n\nfederal and Massachusetts law, a defendant must be charged with a\n\nprior conviction before the government can seek a recidivism-based\n\nsentencing enhancement.    See 21 U.S.C. § 851; Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n278, § 11A; see also Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 42, 44\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (holding that federal courts “lack[] authority to\n\nimpose the statutory enhancement” where the government has not\n\ncomplied with the “strictly enforced” § 851 charging procedures).\n\nBerhe acknowledges that both the state and the federal government\n\n(had   it   brought   charges   against   him)   could   have   sought   a\n\nrecidivism-based sentence enhancement which, if successful, would\n\nhave resulted in a felony conviction under federal law.             But,\n\nbecause he was not so charged, and instead pleaded guilty only to\n\nsimple possession of a controlled substance (which is only a\n\nmisdemeanor under federal law because it is punishable by no more\n\nthan one year in prison, see 21 U.S.C. § 844(a)), the government\n\nfailed to establish that he was convicted of a hypothetical federal\n\nfelony.\n\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\f           We agree.   Because Berhe’s 1996 conviction is not a part\n\nof the record of the 2003 conviction, the government did not\n\nestablish that Berhe was convicted of a hypothetical federal\n\nfelony.   As recently articulated, this circuit applies a \"modified\n\ncategorical approach\" for determining whether an alien has been\n\nconvicted of an aggravated felony.      Conteh v. Gonzales, No. 05-\n\n1282, --- F.3d ---, 2006 WL 2406942, at *6-7 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nUnder this approach, \"the government bears the burden of proving,\n\nby clear and convincing evidence derived solely from the record of\n\nthe prior proceeding, that (i) the alien was convicted of a crime\n\nand (ii) that crime involved every element\" of one of the offenses\n\nenumerated in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).   Id. at *7.   When the statute\n\non which the underlying conviction rests necessarily involves all\n\nof the elements enumerated in one of the INA's definitions of\n\naggravated felony, \"proof of the fact of conviction suffices to\n\ndischarge the government's burden.\"      Id.   Where, however, the\n\nunderlying statute sweeps more broadly (i.e., encompasses crimes\n\nthat are not necessarily aggravated felonies under the INA), \"the\n\ngovernment . . . must demonstrate, by reference only to facts that\n\ncan be mined from the record of conviction, that the putative\n\npredicate offense constitutes a crime designated as an aggravated\n\nfelony in the INA.\"    Id. (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f575, 602 (1990); In re Pichardo-Sufren, 21 I&N Dec. 330, 335-36\n\n(BIA 1996)).6\n\n           As   noted     above,     the   underlying   state     statute   here\n\nencompasses crimes that ordinarily would not constitute felonies\n\nunder either state or federal law.              Compare Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n94C, § 34, with 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) (both setting a maximum term of\n\nimprisonment of one year for \"knowingly or intentionally . . .\n\npossess[ing] a controlled substance\").            Therefore, we must look to\n\nthe record of conviction of the alleged aggravated felony to\n\ndetermine whether the government met its burden of proving that\n\nBerhe had a prior conviction for a drug offense.                See 21 U.S.C. §\n\n844(a)   (noting   that    if   an    offense    for   simple    possession   is\n\ncommitted after a prior conviction for a drug offense has become\n\nfinal, the maximum penalty increases to two years' imprisonment).\n\nThe record of Berhe's 2003 conviction in state district court --\n\nthe criminal complaint alleging misdemeanor possession of crack\n\ncocaine and the official criminal docket indicating Berhe's plea of\n\nguilty to that charge -- contains no reference to Berhe's 1996\n\nconviction.     Both the criminal complaint and the docket clearly\n\n\n\n6\n In Conteh, we outlined the contours of the \"record of conviction.\"\nWe held that the alien's testimony at his removal hearing, where he\nadmitted to facts relevant to the aggravated felony determination,\nwas not a part of the underlying record of conviction and therefore\ncould not be considered in determining whether the conviction was\nfor an aggravated felony. Conteh, 2006 WL 2406942 at *9-10; see\nid. at *9 (\"[T]he record of conviction cannot encompass after-the-\nfact statements made in a separate and subsequent proceeding.\").\n\n                                      -24-\n\findicate that Berhe was charged and convicted of the misdemeanor\n\ncrime   (under   both    Massachusetts        and   federal   law)   of   simple\n\npossession of a controlled substance punishable by no more than one\n\nyear in prison.7\n\n           Because      the   record    of    conviction   here   contains   no\n\nreference to Berhe's prior conviction, or to any other factor that\n\nwould hypothetically convert his 2003 state misdemeanor conviction\n\ninto a felony under federal law, the Board erred by concluding that\n\nhis 2003 conviction was an \"aggravated felony\" under 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(43).     The Board therefore also erred in concluding that\n\nBerhe is ineligible for asylum and cancellation of removal. Hence,\n\nwe must remand so that it may consider the merits of those claims.\n\nSee INS v. Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 16 (2002) (noting that a court of\n\nappeals should ordinarily \"remand a case to an agency for decision\n\nof a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands\").\n\n           2.    Withholding of removal\n\n           Berhe also argues that the Board erred in reversing the\n\nimmigration judge's decision granting him withholding of removal.\n\n\n\n7\n Amaral does not control our consideration of this issue. Although\nit appears that the Board in Amaral found the existence of prior\nconvictions based on the petitioner's admissions in removal\nproceedings, 977 F.2d at 34, it is not clear whether the petitioner\nsimply testified to the fact of these prior convictions or\nstipulated to their existence and their validity. See Conteh, 2006\nWL 2406942 at *9 n.5. In any event, it does not appear that this\nissue was litigated in Amaral. Whatever the basis of our finding\nthat the petitioner had prior convictions in that case, Conteh now\nlimits our examination to the record of conviction.\n\n                                       -25-\n\fHe contends that the Board did not base its decision on substantial\n\nevidence     and     failed       to   explain    sufficiently   why    it   chose    to\n\ndisregard the immigration judge's conclusions.                   At oral argument,\n\nand in a supplemental post-argument filing, the government argues\n\nthat the Real ID Act of 2005 strips us of jurisdiction to review\n\nBerhe's      claim    for     withholding        of   removal.    See   8    U.S.C.    §\n\n1252(a)(2)(C) (divesting jurisdiction to review \"any final order of\n\nremoval against an alien who is removable by reason of having\n\ncommitted a criminal offense\" in violation of a law relating to\n\ncontrolled substances). Because Berhe was found removable based on\n\na controlled substance offense, the government argues, this court\n\nmay review only \"questions of law\" and \"constitutional claims.\"\n\nId. § 1252(a)(2)(D) (preserving our jurisdiction for such claims).\n\nThe government contends that Berhe's withholding of removal claim\n\ndoes   not    present       any    legal   or    constitutional    issues.      Berhe\n\ncounters that the adequacy of the Board's reasoning is a legal\n\nquestion that we may review.                Berhe is correct.       See Enwonwu v.\n\nGonzales, 438 F.3d 22, 35 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n              During removal proceedings, Berhe, appearing pro se,\n\nasserted that he feared religious persecution on the basis of his\n\nstatus (or imputed status) as a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nThe immigration judge found \"no evidence that this would be held\n\nagainst him\" in Eritrea, but granted Berhe's application for\n\nwithholding of removal on another ground.                    The judge found that\n\n\n                                           -26-\n\fdocumentary    evidence   (presumably     the   State      Department   country\n\nreports) established that conditions in Eritrea are \"generally\n\nbad,\" that the ruling regime is \"quite brutal,\" and that \"people\n\nwho   are   deemed   sympathetic   in   any     way   to    critics     [of   the\n\ngovernment] are detained and subjected to severe mistreatment.\"\n\nThus, crediting Berhe's testimony that he \"came to the United\n\nStates as a refugee and has continued to seek asylum even after\n\nbecoming removable,\" the judge found that, upon return to Eritrea,\n\nhe would likely be targeted for persecution \"as a suspected critic\n\nof the Eritrean government.\"\n\n            On appeal, the Board found that \"there is no basis to\n\nfind that it is more likely than not that the respondent would be\n\nsubjected to persecution based upon the religion of his adoptive\n\nparents.\"    Nowhere, however, did the Board engage the immigration\n\njudge's rationale for granting Berhe's application for withholding\n\nof removal.8\n\n\n8\n In noting that there was no allegation of past persecution, the\nBoard did call into question Berhe's refugee status on his\nadmission to the United States, noting the lack of \"information .\n. . explain[ing] the basis for this admission.\" But regardless of\nthe reason for Berhe's refugee status, the record is uncontradicted\nthat Berhe was admitted as a refugee.     In fact, at the removal\nhearing, the government proffered documents, relating to Berhe's\napproved application for adjustment to lawful permanent resident\nstatus, that establish that he was admitted as a refugee at New\nYork City in 1987.\n     We note that the Board also misstated Berhe's claim for\nrelief. On our review of the record, we see no allegation that he\nfeared persecution because his adoptive parents were Jehovah's\nWitnesses. Rather, he claims that it was his birth mother who was\na Jehovah's Witness.\n\n                                   -27-\n\f           We   agree   with   Berhe,   therefore,   that   this   case   is\n\ncontrolled by Enwonwu.      See 438 F.3d at 35 (holding that, where the\n\nBoard's reversal of an immigration judge's grant of relief under\n\nthe CAT only addressed one of the two findings made by the judge in\n\nsupport of its decision, the Board's opinion was \"insufficiently\n\nreasoned as a matter of law\").      Although we have previously noted\n\nthat the Board \"need not spell out every last detail of its\n\nreasoning where the logical underpinnings are clear from the\n\nrecord,\"   there   is   a    heightened   obligation    \"to    offer   more\n\nexplanation when the record suggests strong arguments for the\n\npetitioner that the [Board] has not considered.\"              Id. (quoting\n\nSulaiman v. Gonzales, 429 F.3d 347, 350 (1st Cir. 2005)).          We agree\n\nwith Berhe that there was adequate support in the record for the\n\nimmigration judge's finding, and that it was therefore an error of\n\nlaw for the Board to reverse without addressing that finding.             The\n\nproper course, therefore, is to remand to the Board for further\n\nconsideration of Berhe's claim for withholding of removal.                See\n\nid.; see also Ventura, 537 U.S. at 16-17.\n\n           3.   Convention Against Torture\n\n           Finally, Berhe argues that the Board erred in refusing to\n\nconsider his claim for relief under the CAT.         The Board held that\n\nBerhe had waived his CAT claim by failing to inform the immigration\n\njudge of his intention to appeal.       See Matter of Shih, 20 I&N Dec.\n\n697, 698-99 (BIA 1993).        The Board further noted that Berhe's\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fNotice of Appeal, which was filed six months after the immigration\n\njudge's decision, was untimely.      See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.38(b).         In his\n\npetition, Berhe contends, and the government concedes, that the\n\nimmigration judge failed to advise Berhe of his right to appeal the\n\ndecision   to   deny   him   protection   under    the   CAT.     He   argues,\n\ntherefore, that he could not have knowingly and intelligently\n\nwaived his right to appeal.       We agree.\n\n           The regulations governing immigration proceedings require\n\nthat \"[a] party affected by a decision of an immigration judge\n\nwhich may be appealed to the Board . . . shall be given notice of\n\nthe opportunity for filing an appeal.\"        Id. § 1003.3.      Cf. 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229a(c)(5) (requiring the immigration judge to \"inform the alien\n\nof the right to appeal\" from an order of removal).              The Board has\n\npreviously recognized that any waiver of the right to appeal must\n\nbe made \"knowingly and intelligently.\"            In re Rodriguez-Diaz, 22\n\nI&N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); see also Shih, 20 I&N Dec. at 698-\n\n99 (finding waiver where the alien was specifically informed of the\n\nconsequences of his waiver).\n\n           In this case, the immigration judge both failed to inform\n\nBerhe of his right to appeal and affirmatively suggested that Berhe\n\nhad no reason to appeal.      At the close of proceedings, after having\n\nasked DHS's attorney whether she wished to appeal, the immigration\n\njudge told Berhe: \"I've granted your applications for relief.             Did\n\nyou understand all of that?\"          Further assuring Berhe of the\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fcompleteness of his victory, the judge stated: \"If the Government\n\ndoes not actually file an appeal, you will be released.\"                     No\n\nreference was made to any right of cross-appeal or to the peril\n\nthat Berhe's inaction could result in his waiving the CAT claim.\n\nNor was any subsequent notice sent to Berhe informing him of his\n\nright to appeal.\n\n              In these circumstances, the Board erred by ruling that\n\nBerhe \"knowingly and intelligently\" waived his right to appeal the\n\nrejection of his CAT claim.            The equities weigh especially in\n\nBerhe's favor, given that he was not represented by counsel.               See\n\nRodriguez-Diaz, 22 I&N Dec. at 1323 (stressing that \"in cases\n\ninvolving unrepresented aliens, more detailed explanations [of the\n\nalien's right to appeal] are often needed\").              Nor should Berhe be\n\nfaulted for the late filing of his Notice of Appeal.              The Board's\n\nbar against hearing untimely appeals is inapplicable in these\n\ncircumstances.       See Zhong Guang Sun v. United States Dep't of\n\nJustice, 421 F.3d 105, 108-09 (2d Cir. 2005) (collecting cases\n\nrecognizing that the Board's bar has an exception for unique or\n\nextraordinary circumstances beyond the alien's control); Vlaicu v.\n\nINS, 998 F.2d 758, 760 (9th Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (holding that\n\nthe Board \"may have jurisdiction to hear an otherwise untimely\n\nappeal\" in \"unique circumstances,\" such as when the appellant \"was\n\nmisled   by    the   words   or   conduct    of   the   [immigration]   court\")\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).           And the government should not\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\fbe allowed to benefit from the immigration court's failure to\n\nfollow its own regulations.   Nelson v.

We believe that\n\nsuch a remand is the proper course here.\n\n                               III.\n\n          For the reasons stated, Henry's petition for review is\n\ndenied, and Berhe's petition is granted.     The Board's order of\n\nremoval in Berhe's case is vacated, and the case is remanded to the\n\nBoard for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -31-\n\f",

We have written a single opinion dealing with those separate petitions because they both question whether a state misdemeanor drug offense can constitute an \"aggravated felony\" for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43). Petitioners face removal from the United States on the basis of their respective state misdemeanor convictions for possession of a controlled substance. The Board denied their applications for discretionary relief from removal on account of their aggravated felony convictions. The petitioners argue, inter alia, that their respective state convictions should not be considered \"aggravated felonies\" because Massachusetts, the convicting authority in both cases, classified the crimes as misdemeanors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the petitioners' contentions that we may only look to state law in such cases and reaffirm that a state misdemeanor drug offense can amount to an \"aggravated felony\" if that offense would have been a felony had it been charged under the federal drug laws. Because Henry's offense&#8212;possession with intent to distribute&#8212;would have been a felony had it been charged under federal law, we deny his petition. The record of Berhe's state conviction, however, reveals that he was convicted merely for simple possession, a misdemeanor under federal law. For that reason, among others, we vacate the Board's order and remand Berhe's case for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our discussion by outlining the relevant procedural and factual background of the respective petitions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>A. Henry's petition</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry is a Jamaican national who was admitted to the United States as a permanent resident in 1984. In 2001, he pleaded guilty in Massachusetts state court to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 32C(a), a misdemeanor under Massachusetts law. Two years later, Henry traveled abroad and was denied re-admission upon his return to the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)charged Henry with being removable because of his 2001 drug conviction. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (declaring inadmissible \"any alien convicted of\" violating a law \"relating to a controlled substance\"); INA &#167; 212(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2)(C)(i) (declaring inadmissible any alien \"the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe . . . is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing before an immigration judge, Henry admitted the factual allegations charged by DHS and conceded removability on the ground that he had violated a law relating to controlled substances. He denied, however, that he was removable as an \"illicit trafficker\" in controlled substances. He also filed an application for cancellation of removal, arguing that his removal would result in exceptional hardship to his family living in the United States, who were all either citizens or lawful permanent residents. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 240A(a), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(a)(3). The immigration judge found Henry removable as charged. Although the judge deemed Henry eligible for cancellation of removal, she denied Henry's application as a matter of discretion. Both Henry and DHS appealed to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DHS challenged the immigration judge's legal conclusion that Henry was eligible for cancellation of removal. According to DHS, Henry was ineligible for such relief because he had been convicted of an \"aggravated felony.\" <i>See id.</i> (providing the Attorney General with discretion to cancel the removal of any alien who \"has not been convicted of any aggravated felony\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B) (defining \"aggravated felony\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board sustained DHS's appeal. It observed that, under this court's precedent, a state drug offense qualifies as an \"aggravated felony\" if it is punishable under one of the federal drug enforcement statutes, including the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), and is a felony. <i>See Amaral v. INS,</i> 977 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir. 1992). The Board found that possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is punishable under the CSA by a maximum of five years' imprisonment, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D), and would be classified as a felony under federal law, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a) (any offense punishable by more than one year in prison is a felony). Because Henry's Massachusetts offense would have been punishable as a felony under federal law, the Board concluded that it was an \"aggravated felony\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B). The Board therefore found Henry ineligible for cancellation of removal and ordered him removed to Jamaica.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Berhe's petition</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berhe was born in 1978 in a city in Ethiopia, which is now a part of Eritrea. His birth mother gave him up for adoption during the Ethiopian civil war and his adoptive parents thereafter took him to Sudan. Four years later, in 1987, he and his adoptive parents were admitted to the United States as refugees. In 1988, Berhe's status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident. Since his admission to the United States, Berhe has never returned to Eritrea. Nor has he had any contact with any surviving family members there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Berhe was convicted in a Massachusetts municipal court for simple possession of crack cocaine under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 34, and for assault and battery of a police officer, and was sentenced to six months' probation. In 2003, he pleaded guilty to simple possession of crack cocaine in Massachusetts state district court, and received a six-month suspended sentence. In prosecuting the 2003 offense, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts did not charge Berhe with a prior conviction because it did not seek a recidivism-based sentence enhancement. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &#167; 11A (providing that if the government seeks enhanced penalties because of a prior conviction, the defendant \"shall be entitled to a trial by jury of the issue of conviction of a prior offense\"). Both the 1996 conviction and the 2003 conviction were misdemeanors under Massachusetts law. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 274, &#167; 1 (\"A crime punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison is a felony. All other crimes are misdemeanors.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2004, DHS initiated removal proceedings against Berhe, charging that he was removable because of his 2003 conviction for simple possession of crack cocaine. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 237(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (providing that any alien convicted of violating a law \"relating to a controlled substance ... is deportable\"). Berhe conceded removability, but submitted applications seeking cancellation of removal, asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Berhe's asylum application asserted that he would be persecuted on account of his religion were he returned to Eritrea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DHS subsequently filed a supplemental charge of removability contending that Berhe's 2003 conviction was for an \"aggravated felony,\" <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (\"Any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony . . . is deportable.\"). DHS argued that because Berhe had a prior drug conviction, his 2003 misdemeanor simple possession conviction was an \"aggravated felony\" under the INA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B). As a result, DHS argued, Berhe was statutorily ineligible for the discretionary relief of asylum or cancellation of removal. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), 1158(b)(2)(B)(i), 1229b(a)(3). DHS also argued that an aggravated felony is presumptively a \"particularly serious crime,\" which rendered Berhe ineligible for withholding of removal. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, an immigration judge found Berhe removable on the basis of the original controlled substance charge, but not on the aggravated felony charge. The judge concluded that, because Berhe's 2003 conviction was classified by Massachusetts law as a misdemeanor, it could not be considered an aggravated felony. The judge therefore evaluated Berhe's claims for relief and granted him asylum, withholding of removal, and cancellation of removal, but denied relief under the CAT. DHS appealed to the Board and Berhe filed a cross-appeal from the denial of his CAT claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board sustained DHS's appeal. The Board stated that it would apply the First Circuit's approach for determining whether the state conviction is an aggravated felony. The Board found that Berhe's 2003 offense was punishable under federal law as a felony because his prior drug possession offense converted his subsequent possession conviction into a felony. Because Berhe had been convicted of an aggravated felony, the Board found him ineligible for asylum or cancellation of removal and therefore did not reach the merits of those claims. The Board also reversed the immigration judge's grant of withholding of removal on the ground that Berhe had not shown \"a clear probability of persecution on account of any protected ground,\" and dismissed Berhe's cross-appeal as untimely. The Board ordered Berhe removed to Eritrea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry and Berhe separately challenge the Board's interpretation of \"aggravated felony.\" They contend that the Board erred by treating their state misdemeanor convictions as aggravated felonies under the INA. Berhe additionally challenges the Board's merits-based determination overturning the immigration judge's decision granting him withholding of removal and contends that the Board's refusal to consider his CAT claim as untimely was erroneous as a matter of law.

Included in this list is \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), <i>including a drug trafficking crime</i> (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18) .... whether in violation of State or Federal law.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B) (emphasis added). \"Drug trafficking crime,\" in turn, means \"<i>any felony</i> punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C.App.1901 et seq.).\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board has interpreted &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B) to provide two paths for arriving at an aggravated felony finding. The first route is based on the \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance\" language, and is not relevant to these cases. <i>See Gerbier v. Holmes,</i> 280 F.3d 297, 313 (3d Cir.2002) (noting that under the \"illicit trafficking route\" the state offense \"must be a felony under the law of the convicting sovereign\" and \"must contain a trafficking element\"). The second route is premised on the language \"drug trafficking crime\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(2). The Board concluded in <i>Matter of Davis,</i> 20 I &amp; N Dec. 536, 1992 WL 443920 (BIA 1992), that in terms of the \"drug trafficking crime\" route, any state drug offense, whether classified as a felony or misdemeanor in that state, is an aggravated felony if the same conduct would have been punishable as a felony if charged under one of the three federal statutes enumerated in &#167; 924(c)(2). <i>Id.</i> at 543; <i>see also Gerbier,</i> 280 F.3d at 306. This methodology is sometimes referred to as the \"hypothetical federal felony\" approach. <i>See Gerbier,</i> 280 F.3d at 306.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board later clarified that the term \"any felony\" in &#167; 924(c)(2) refers to the definition of felony in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a), which provides catchall classifications for crimes codified in Title 18. <i>In re L-G-,</i> 21 I &amp; N Dec. 89, 94 (BIA 1995); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a) (classifying any offense that is not specifically classified in the substantive section defining the offense). Under that provision, a \"felony\" is any offense where the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is more than one year. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a). Thus, the Board ruled that a state drug offense could constitute an aggravated felony, in terms of the \"drug trafficking crime\" route, <i>only</i> if it is punishable by more than one year of imprisonment under one of the three federal drug statutes enumerated in &#167; 924(c)(2). <i>In re L-G-,</i> 21 I &amp; N Dec. at 96. In other words, under the Board's strict \"hypothetical federal felony\" approach, the phrase \"drug trafficking crime\" meant any conviction punishable by more than one year of imprisonment under one of the federal drug laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach has received mixed reviews from the circuit courts. In the civil immigration context, several circuits have adopted the Board's hypothetical federal felony approach. <i>E.g., Gonzales-Gomez v. Achim,</i> 441 F.3d 532, 534-36 (7th Cir. 2006); <i>United States v. Palacios-Suarez,</i> 418 F.3d 692, 698-700 (6th Cir.2005); <i>Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft,</i> 382 F.3d 905, 912-18 (9th Cir.2004); <i>Gerbier,</i> 280 F.3d at 308-12; <i>Aguirre v. INS,</i> 79 F.3d 315, 317-18 (2d Cir.1996). Under this approach, the underlying state classification of the offense is irrelevant. The circuits that have adopted this approach emphasize that focusing solely on federal law properly accounts for the need to apply the nation's immigration laws uniformly, and that an approach that allows the vagaries of state law to influence the determination would defeat this purpose. <i>See, e.g., Achim,</i> 441 F.3d at 535; <i>Gerbier,</i> 280 F.3d at 311-12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least two circuits have taken a more flexible approach. These circuits hold that a state conviction constitutes an \"aggravated felony\" if it (1) is punishable under one of the federal drug enforcement statutes, and (2) is a hypothetical federal felony <i>or</i> is a felony under the law of the convicting state. <i>E.g., Lopez v. Gonzales,</i> 417 F.3d 934, 936-37 (8th Cir.2005), <i>cert. granted,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 1651, 164 L.Ed.2d 395 (2006); <i>United States v. Hernandez-Avalos,</i> 251 F.3d 505, 507-08 (5th Cir.2001). This \"dual approach\" derives from circuit decisions interpreting the meaning of \"aggravated felony\" in the criminal sentencing context.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the split in circuit authority, the Board retreated from strictly applying the hypothetical federal felony approach in all cases, in favor of applying the approach of the circuit in which the case before it originated. <i>See In re Yanez-Garcia,</i> 23 I &amp; N Dec. 390, 396-98, 2002 WL 993589 (BIA 2002). In those circuits that have not definitively ruled on the issue, the Board follows the position taken by the majority of the circuits in criminal sentencing cases&#8212;the dual approach. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present cases, the Board interpreted our precedent as applying the dual approach. Accordingly, the Board found that the petitioners' state drug offenses would constitute \"drug trafficking crimes\" if they were (1) punishable under one of the three statutes enumerated in &#167; 924(c)(2), and (2) punishable as a felony under either federal <i>or</i> state law. <i>See Amaral v. INS,</i> 977 F.2d 33, 36-37 (1st Cir.1992) (finding that petitioner had been convicted of an aggravated felony because his state drug offense would be a felony under federal law); <i>United States v. Restrepo-Aguilar,</i> 74 F.3d 361, 364-67 (1st Cir.1996) (finding that the defendant was an aggravated felon because his state offense was a felony under state law and it violated the CSA). The Board found <i>Amaral</i> to control in both cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Amaral,</i> the Board found that the petitioner was an aggravated felon, and therefore deportable and ineligible for discretionary relief, because of three state court convictions for possession of cocaine. <i>See</i> 977 F.2d at 34. On review, we did not resolve the merits of the Board's decision because we lacked jurisdiction. <i>Id.</i> at 37. Our jurisdictional ruling, however, required us to consider whether the petitioner was an aggravated felon under the INA. <i>Id.</i> at 35 (noting that if the petitioner was an aggravated felon, his petition for review was untimely).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In that case, as here, the question was whether any of the petitioner's state offenses was a \"felony\" under &#167; 924(c)(2). Because of &#167; 924(c)(2)'s cross-reference to the CSA, we consulted the CSA's definition of \"felony\" as \"any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State Law as a felony.\" <i>Id.</i> at 36 (quoting 21 U.S.C. &#167; 802(13)). Although we noted that the petitioner's offenses were felonies under state law, we undertook a federal analysis of the petitioner's crimes. <i>See id.</i> at 36 &amp; n. 3. We concluded that, although a simple possession offense is ordinarily a misdemeanor under the CSA, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a), \"one prior conviction turns possession into a felony since the maximum penalty increases to over a year.\" <i>Amaral,</i> 977 F.2d at 34. Thus, we ruled that, \"under [a] literal application of &#167;&#167; 844(a) and 3559(a),\" the subsequent possession conviction amounted to a felony under federal law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying <i>Amaral,</i> the Board found that Henry's Massachusetts conviction, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, is punishable under the CSA by a maximum of five years' imprisonment, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D), and is therefore a felony under federal law, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a). The Board found that Berhe's 2003 conviction for simple possession, although ordinarily punishable as a misdemeanor under federal law, would be converted to a felony because of his previous possession conviction. <i>See Amaral,</i> 977 F.2d at 36; 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a). Thus, the Board concluded that both Henry and Berhe had been convicted for \"drug trafficking crimes\" as defined in &#167; 924(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners argue that, because their respective state drug offenses were not classified as <i>felonies</i> by the convicting authority, they should not be considered <i>aggravated felonies.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> They contend that our holding in <i>Restrepo-Aguilar</i> mandates that the law of the prosecuting jurisdiction controls for purposes of determining whether an offense is a felony or misdemeanor. They point out that in <i>Restrepo-Aguilar,</i> we found that a state felony conviction was a \"felony\" for purposes of &#167; 924(c)(2) notwithstanding that it would have been a misdemeanor under federal law. <i>See Restrepo-Aguilar,</i> 74 F.3d at 364-65. Thus, the petitioners argue, we discarded the approach in <i>Amaral</i> (which they characterize as dicta) in favor of an approach that looks to the prosecuting jurisdiction to determine the classification of an offense. They contend that the word \"applicable\" in &#167; 802(13)'s definition of \"felony\" requires us to consult the law <i>actually applied</i> by the convicting authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners misread our precedent. First, <i>Amaral's</i> ruling was not dicta. In <i>Amaral,</i> we were required to determine whether the petitioner had been convicted of an \"aggravated felony\" as defined in the INA, and in doing so, we employed a method that looked to the offense's hypothetical status under federal law. <i>See id.</i> at 36. Though we might have grounded our decision on the state's classification of the offense, we did not do so. <i>See id. Cf. United States v. Johnson,</i> 256 F.3d 895, 914 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (noting that when a federal appellate court \"confronts an issue germane to the eventual resolution of the case, and resolves it after reasoned consideration in a published opinion, that ruling becomes the law of the circuit, regardless of whether doing so is necessary in some strict logical sense\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Moreover, subsequent rulings of this court have followed the <i>Amaral</i> approach. Less than two years after <i>Amaral,</i> we applied precisely the same analysis in a sentencing case. <i>See United States v. Forbes,</i> 16 F.3d 1294, 1301 (1st Cir.1994). We found that the defendant's first state conviction for possession of a controlled substance would have converted his second state possession conviction into a felony under federal law. <i>See id.</i> (citing 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a)). Although, as in <i>Amaral,</i> the underlying offenses were also felonies under state law, our application of the aggravated felony enhancement was predicated on our finding that the state offense was punishable as a felony under federal law. <i>See id. Forbes</i> also suggests that a felony classification under <i>either</i> federal <i>or</i> state law will suffice to meet &#167; 924(c)(2)'s \"any felony\" requirement. <i>See id.; see also United States v. Cuevas,</i> 75 F.3d 778, 783 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that the defendant's state drug offense \"undoubtedly qualifies as a felony\" because it is punishable as a felony under federal law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, <i>Restrepo-Aguilar</i> did not overrule or undermine <i>Amaral.</i> The defendant in <i>Restrepo-Aguilar</i> appealed the district court's application of the aggravated felon sentence enhancement. <i>See</i> 74 F.3d at 363 (citing U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2) (1994)). Although we recognized that the definition of \"aggravated felony\" in U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2 was essentially the same as the definition in the INA, we declined to adopt the Board's precedent which, at the time, applied the strict hypothetical federal felony approach. <i>See id.</i> at 366-67. We noted that the Board's rationale was based significantly on \"policy concerns relating to the consequences flowing from a deportation decision or a decision on an application for asylum, without regard to any of the policies that inform the meaning of `aggravated felony' in the context of the statutory prior offense enhancement or its implementation in the Sentencing Guidelines.\" <i>Restrepo-Aguilar,</i> 74 F.3d at 366. Viewing <i>Amaral</i> as enduring precedent, we were also careful to distinguish it based on the differing contexts. <i>Id.</i> at 366 n. 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, however, we noted that our approach in <i>Restrepo-Aguilar</i> was entirely consistent with <i>Amaral</i> and <i>Forbes. See id.</i> We observed that our cases interpreted the phrase \"drug trafficking crime\" in &#167; 924(c)(2) to encompass \"two <i>separate</i> elements: (1) that the offense be punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (or one of the other two statutes identified); and (2) that the offense be a felony.\" <i>Id.</i> at 364 (citing <i>Forbes,</i> 16 F.3d at 1301; <i>Amaral</i> 977 F.2d at 36). We further observed that &#167; 924(c)(2)'s definition of \"drug trafficking crime,\" \"by its terms includes `<i>any</i> felony' that is criminalized under the CSA.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, we found that the definition \"does not <i>limit</i> its application to offenses that would be classified as felonies\" under federal law. <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). Moreover, we stressed that the CSA's definition of \"felony\" provided further support for the idea that a felony designation under <i>either</i> federal <i>or</i> state law would be sufficient. <i>See id.</i> (\"[T]he CSA itself defines a felony as `any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.'\") (quoting 21 U.S.C. &#167; 802(13)). It is clear we read \"applicable\" to mean, not the law <i>actually applied,</i> but, consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word, the law \"<i>capable of being applied.</i>\" <i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</i> 56 (10th ed.2001). Thus, we held that a state drug conviction may constitute an aggravated felony if it was classified as a felony under state law (even if it would have been a misdemeanor under federal law), but we did not suggest that a state offense could constitute an aggravated felony <i>only if</i> it was classified as a felony under state law. <i>See Restrepo-Aguilar,</i> 74 F.3d at 364-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Board was correct to employ the hypothetical federal felony methodology outlined in <i>Amaral.</i> For the purposes of determining whether a state drug offense is an \"aggravated felony\" under the INA, our circuit precedent permits an analysis that considers whether the underlying offense would have been punishable as a felony under federal law. As discussed above, we are not alone. While there is disagreement concerning whether it is permissible to consult state law in making the aggravated felony determination, as far as we can tell, all the circuits to have considered the issue agree that a state drug offense that would be punishable as a felony under the CSA is a \"drug trafficking crime\" under &#167; 924(c)(2). <i>See supra</i> at 11-12. To our knowledge, no circuit has endorsed the approach urged here&#8212;requiring that the underlying offense be a felony under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Henry's Case</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying <i>Amaral's</i> hypothetical federal felony approach, the Board's determination that Henry is an aggravated felon is clearly correct. Henry's state conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, which would be punishable under the CSA by a maximum of five years' imprisonment, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D), is a felony under federal law, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a). The Board therefore properly determined that Henry is ineligible for cancellation of removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(a)(3). We next consider Berhe's alternative arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C. Berhe's Arguments</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>1. Sufficiency of the evidence supporting the aggravated felony finding</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berhe argues that, even applying the hypothetical federal felony approach, his 2003 state drug possession conviction is not a felony under federal law because the 1996 conviction was neither charged nor proven during the 2003 proceeding. He notes that under federal and Massachusetts law, a defendant must be charged with a prior conviction before the government can seek a recidivism-based sentencing enhancement. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851; Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &#167; 11A; <i>see also Prou v. United States,</i> 199 F.3d 37, 42, 44 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that federal courts \"lack[ ] authority to impose the statutory enhancement\" where the government has not complied with the \"strictly enforced\" &#167; 851 charging procedures). Berhe acknowledges that both the state and the federal government (had it brought charges against him) could have sought a recidivism-based sentence enhancement which, if successful, would have resulted in a felony conviction under federal law. But, because he was not so charged, and instead pleaded guilty only to simple possession of a controlled substance (which is only a misdemeanor under federal law because it is punishable by no more than one year in prison, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a)), the government failed to establish that he was convicted of a hypothetical federal felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree. Because Berhe's 1996 conviction is not a part of the record of the 2003 conviction, the government did not establish that Berhe was convicted of a hypothetical federal felony. As recently articulated, this circuit applies a \"modified categorical approach\" for determining whether an alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony. <i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 45, 55-56 (1st Cir.2006). Under this approach, \"the government bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence derived solely from the record of the prior proceeding, that (i) the alien was convicted of a crime and (ii) that crime involved every element\" of one of the offenses enumerated in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43). <i>Id.</i> at 56. When the statute on which the underlying conviction rests necessarily involves all of the elements enumerated in one of the INA's definitions of aggravated felony, \"proof of the fact of conviction suffices to discharge the government's burden.\" <i>Id.</i> Where, however, the underlying statute sweeps more broadly (i.e., encompasses crimes that are not necessarily aggravated felonies under the INA), \"the government ... must demonstrate, by reference only to facts that can be mined from the record of conviction, that the putative predicate offense constitutes a crime designated as an aggravated felony in the INA.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <i>In re Pichardo-Sufren,</i> 21 I &amp; N Dec. 330, 335-36, 1996 WL 230227 (BIA 1996)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the underlying state statute here encompasses crimes that ordinarily would not constitute felonies under either state or federal law. <i>Compare</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 34, <i>with</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a) (both setting a maximum term of imprisonment of one year for \"knowingly or intentionally ... possess[ing] a controlled substance\"). Therefore, we must look to the record of conviction of the alleged aggravated felony to determine whether the government met its burden of proving that Berhe had a prior conviction for a drug offense. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a) (noting that if an offense for simple possession is committed after a prior conviction for a drug offense has become final, the maximum penalty increases to two years' imprisonment). The record of Berhe's 2003 conviction in state district court&#8212;the criminal complaint alleging misdemeanor possession of crack cocaine and the official criminal docket indicating Berhe's plea of guilty to that charge&#8212;contains no reference to Berhe's 1996 conviction. Both the criminal complaint and the docket clearly indicate that Berhe was charged and convicted of the misdemeanor crime (under both Massachusetts and federal law) of simple possession of a controlled substance punishable by no more than one year in prison.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the record of conviction here contains no reference to Berhe's prior conviction, or to any other factor that would hypothetically convert his 2003 state misdemeanor conviction into a felony under federal law, the Board erred by concluding that his 2003 conviction was an \"aggravated felony\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43). The Board therefore also erred in concluding that Berhe is ineligible for asylum and cancellation of removal. Hence, we must remand so that it may consider the merits of those claims. <i>See INS v. Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (noting that a court of appeals should ordinarily \"remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>2. Withholding of removal</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berhe also argues that the Board erred in reversing the immigration judge's decision granting him withholding of removal. He contends that the Board did not base its decision on substantial evidence and failed to explain sufficiently why it chose to disregard the immigration judge's conclusions. At oral argument, and in a supplemental post-argument filing, the government argues that the Real ID Act of 2005 strips us of jurisdiction to review Berhe's claim for withholding of removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(C) (divesting jurisdiction to review \"any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense\" in violation of a law relating to controlled substances). Because Berhe was found removable based on a controlled substance offense, the government argues, this court may review only \"questions of law\" and \"constitutional claims.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D) (preserving our jurisdiction for such claims). The government contends that Berhe's withholding of removal claim does not present any legal or constitutional issues. Berhe counters that the adequacy of the Board's reasoning is a legal question that we may review. Berhe is correct. <i>See Enwonwu v. Gonzales,</i> 438 F.3d 22, 35 (1st Cir.2006)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During removal proceedings, Berhe, appearing pro se, asserted that he feared religious persecution on the basis of his status (or imputed status) as a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The immigration judge found \"no evidence that this would be held against him\" in Eritrea, but granted Berhe's application for withholding of removal on another ground. The judge found that documentary evidence (presumably the State Department country reports) established that conditions in Eritrea are \"generally bad,\" that the ruling regime is \"quite brutal,\" and that \"people who are deemed sympathetic in any way to critics [of the government] are detained and subjected to severe mistreatment.\" Thus, crediting Berhe's testimony that he \"came to the United States as a refugee and has continued to seek asylum even after becoming removable,\" the judge found that, upon return to Eritrea, he would likely be targeted for persecution \"as a suspected critic of the Eritrean government.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Board found that \"there is no basis to find that it is more likely than not that the respondent would be subjected to persecution based upon the religion of his adoptive parents.\" Nowhere, however, did the Board engage the immigration judge's rationale for granting Berhe's application for withholding of removal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Berhe, therefore, that this case is controlled by <i>Enwonwu. See</i> 438 F.3d at 35 (holding that, where the Board's reversal of an immigration judge's grant of relief under the CAT only addressed one of the two findings made by the judge in support of its decision, the Board's opinion was \"insufficiently reasoned as a matter of law\"). Although we have previously noted that the Board \"need not spell out every last detail of its reasoning where the logical underpinnings are clear from the record,\" there is a heightened obligation \"to offer more explanation when the record suggests strong arguments for the petitioner that the [Board] has not considered.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Sulaiman v. Gonzales,</i> 429 F.3d 347, 350 (1st Cir.2005)). We agree with Berhe that there was adequate support in the record for the immigration judge's finding, and that it was therefore an error of law for the Board to reverse without addressing that finding. The proper course, therefore, is to remand to the Board for further consideration of Berhe's claim for withholding of removal. <i>See id.; see also Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. at 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>3. Convention Against Torture</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Berhe argues that the Board erred in refusing to consider his claim for relief under the CAT. The Board held that Berhe had waived his CAT claim by failing to inform the immigration judge of his intention to appeal. <i>See Matter of Shih,</i> 20 I &amp; N Dec. 697, 698-99 (BIA 1993). The Board further noted that Berhe's Notice of Appeal, which was filed six months after the immigration judge's decision, was untimely. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.38(b). In his petition, Berhe contends, and the government concedes, that the immigration judge failed to advise Berhe of his right to appeal the decision to deny him protection under the CAT. He argues, therefore, that he could not have knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations governing immigration proceedings require that \"[a] party affected by a decision of an immigration judge which may be appealed to the Board ... shall be given notice of the opportunity for filing an appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1003.3. <i>Cf.</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(5) (requiring the immigration judge to \"inform the alien of the right to appeal\" from an order of removal). The Board has previously recognized that any waiver of the right to appeal must be made \"knowingly and intelligently.\" <i>In re Rodriguez-Diaz,</i> 22 I &amp; N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); <i>see also Shih,</i> 20 I &amp; N Dec. at 698-99 (finding waiver where the alien was specifically informed of the consequences of his waiver).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the immigration judge both failed to inform Berhe of his right to appeal and affirmatively suggested that Berhe had no reason to appeal. At the close of proceedings, after having asked DHS's attorney whether she wished to appeal, the immigration judge told Berhe: \"I've granted your applications for relief. Did you understand all of that?\" Further assuring Berhe of the completeness of his victory, the judge stated: \"If the Government does not actually file an appeal, you will be released.\" No reference was made to any right of cross-appeal or to the peril that Berhe's inaction could result in his waiving the CAT claim. Nor was any subsequent notice sent to Berhe informing him of his right to appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, the Board erred by ruling that Berhe \"knowingly and intelligently\" waived his right to appeal the rejection of his CAT claim. The equities weigh especially in Berhe's favor, given that he was not represented by counsel. <i>See Rodriguez-Diaz,</i> 22 I &amp; N Dec. at 1323 (stressing that \"in cases involving unrepresented aliens, more detailed explanations [of the alien's right to appeal] are often needed\"). Nor should Berhe be faulted for the late filing of his Notice of Appeal. The Board's bar against hearing untimely appeals is inapplicable in these circumstances. <i>See Zhong Guang Sun v. United States Dep't of Justice,</i> 421 F.3d 105, 108-09 (2d Cir.2005) (collecting cases recognizing that the Board's bar has an exception for unique or extraordinary circumstances beyond the alien's control); <i>Vlaicu v. INS,</i> 998 F.2d 758, 760 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (holding that the Board \"may have jurisdiction to hear an otherwise untimely appeal\" in \"unique circumstances,\" such as when the appellant \"was misled by the words or conduct of the [immigration] court\") (internal quotation marks omitted). And the government should not be allowed to benefit from the immigration court's failure to follow its own regulations. <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 262 (1st Cir.2000) (\"An agency has the duty to follow its own federal regulations,\" and failure to follow those regulations \"can lead to reversal of an agency order and a new hearing\"). We believe that such a remand is the proper course here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, Henry's petition for review is <i>denied,</i> and Berhe's petition is <i>granted.</i> The Board's order of removal in Berhe's case is <i>vacated,</i> and the case is <i>remanded</i> to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although we have indicated this petitioner's name consistent with the administrative record, his brief states that his proper name is \"Ambessa Berhe Hagos.\" Whichever is correct, we shall refer to him in this opinion simply as \"Berhe.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The United States Sentencing Guidelines provide a sentence enhancement for aliens who, after having been previously deported following a conviction for an \"aggravated felony,\" unlawfully return to or remain in the United States<i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) (2005). The Guidelines in turn define an \"aggravated felony\" by reference to the definition in the INA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 2L1.2 cmt. n. 3 (2005). The majority of circuits that have confronted the \"aggravated felony\" question in this context have utilized the dual approach, finding that a felony drug conviction under state law can amount to a \"drug trafficking crime\" regardless of how the crime would be classified under analogous federal law. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos,</i> 412 F.3d 572, 574 (5th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Ramirez,</i> 344 F.3d 247, 251, 253-54 (2d Cir. 2003); <i>United States v.

Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 32C(a)&#8212;is not sufficiently analogous to any federal offense to be deemed \"punishable under\" one of the federal drug enforcement statutes. He argues that the Massachusetts statute to which he pleaded guilty is broader in scope than the closest federal analogue. Henry's argument is a nonstarter. Assuming arguendo that the Massachusetts statute is broader, the particular conduct to which Henry pleaded guilty, possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, is clearly punishable under the CSA. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> It is of little import that we did not resolve the merits of the Board's aggravated felony determination in<i>Amaral.</i> To be sure, the \"aggravated felony\" question arose in a jurisdictional inquiry. <i>See</i> 977 F.2d at 35. But the question presented, and the statutory language at issue, were precisely the same as that considered here. Our holding that the petitioner had been convicted of an \"aggravated felony\" was expressly premised on a finding that the offense was <i>punishable as a felony</i> under the CSA. <i>See id.</i> at 36.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In<i>Conteh,</i> we outlined the contours of the \"record of conviction.\" We held that the alien's testimony at his removal hearing, where he admitted to facts relevant to the aggravated felony determination, was not a part of the underlying record of conviction and therefore could not be considered in determining whether the conviction was for an aggravated felony. <i>Conteh,</i> 461 F.3d at 57-59; <i>see id.</i> at 58 (\"[T]he record of conviction cannot encompass after-the-fact statements made in a separate and subsequent proceeding.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> <i>Amaral</i> does not control our consideration of this issue. Although it appears that the Board in <i>Amaral</i> found the existence of prior convictions based on the petitioner's admissions in removal proceedings, 977 F.2d at 34, it is not clear whether the petitioner simply testified to the fact of these prior convictions or stipulated to their existence and their validity. <i>See Conteh,</i> 2006 WL 2406942 at 58 n. 5. In any event, it does not appear that this issue was litigated in <i>Amaral.</i> Whatever the basis of our finding that the petitioner had prior convictions in that case, <i>Conteh</i> now limits our examination to the record of conviction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In noting that there was no allegation of past persecution, the Board did call into question Berhe's refugee status on his admission to the United States, noting the lack of \"information ... explain[ing] the basis for this admission.\" But regardless of the reason for Berhe's refugee status, the record is uncontradicted that Berhe was admitted as a refugee. In fact, at the removal hearing, the government proffered documents, relating to Berhe's approved application for adjustment to lawful permanent resident status, that establish that he was admitted as a refugee at New York City in 1987</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We note that the Board also misstated Berhe's claim for relief. On our review of the record, we see no allegation that he feared persecution because his adoptive parents were Jehovah's Witnesses.

We have written a single opinion dealing with those separate petitions because they both question whether a state misdemeanor drug offense can constitute an \"aggravated felony\" for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43). Petitioners face removal from the United States on the basis of their respective state misdemeanor convictions for possession of a controlled substance. The Board denied their applications for discretionary relief from removal on account of their aggravated felony convictions. The petitioners argue, inter alia, that their respective state convictions should not be considered \"aggravated felonies\" because Massachusetts, the convicting authority in both cases, classified the crimes as misdemeanors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the petitioners' contentions that we may only look to state law in such cases and reaffirm that a state misdemeanor drug offense can amount to an \"aggravated felony\" if that offense would have been a felony had it been charged under the federal drug laws. Because Henry's offense&#8212;possession with intent to distribute&#8212;would have been a felony had it been charged under federal law, we deny his petition. The record of Berhe's state conviction, however, reveals that he was convicted merely for simple possession, a misdemeanor under federal law.

Henry's petition</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henry is a Jamaican national who was admitted to the United States as a permanent resident in 1984. In 2001, he pleaded guilty in Massachusetts state court to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 32C(a), a misdemeanor under Massachusetts law. Two years later, Henry traveled abroad and was denied re-admission upon his return to the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)charged Henry with being removable because of his 2001 drug conviction. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (declaring inadmissible \"any alien convicted of\" violating a law \"relating to a controlled substance\"); INA &#167; 212(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(2)(C)(i) (declaring inadmissible any alien \"the Attorney General knows or has reason to believe . . . is or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing before an immigration judge, Henry admitted the factual allegations charged by DHS and conceded removability on the ground that he had violated a law relating to controlled substances. He denied, however, that he was removable as an \"illicit trafficker\" in controlled substances. He also filed an application for cancellation of removal, arguing that his removal would result in exceptional hardship to his family living in the United States, who were all either citizens or lawful permanent residents. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 240A(a), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229b(a)(3). The immigration judge found Henry removable as charged. Although the judge deemed Henry eligible for cancellation of removal, she denied Henry's application as a matter of discretion. Both Henry and DHS appealed to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DHS challenged the immigration judge's legal conclusion that Henry was eligible for cancellation of removal. According to DHS, Henry was ineligible for such relief because he had been convicted of an \"aggravated felony.\" <i>See id.</i> (providing the Attorney General with discretion to cancel the removal of any alien who \"has not been convicted of any aggravated felony\"); <i>id.</i> &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B) (defining \"aggravated felony\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board sustained DHS's appeal. It observed that, under this court's precedent, a state drug offense qualifies as an \"aggravated felony\" if it is punishable under one of the federal drug enforcement statutes, including the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), and is a felony. <i>See Amaral v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592216\"><a href=\"/opinion/592216/antonio-amaral-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir. 1992). The Board found that possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is punishable under the CSA by a maximum of five years' imprisonment, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D), and would be classified as a felony under federal law, <i>see</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a) (any offense punishable by more than one year in prison is a felony). Because Henry's Massachusetts offense would have been punishable as a felony under federal law, the Board concluded that it was an \"aggravated felony\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B). The Board therefore found Henry ineligible for cancellation of removal and ordered him removed to Jamaica.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Berhe's petition</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berhe was born in 1978 in a city in Ethiopia, which is now a part of Eritrea. His birth mother gave him up for adoption during the Ethiopian civil war and his adoptive parents thereafter took him to Sudan. Four years later, in 1987, he and his adoptive parents were admitted to the United States as refugees. In 1988, Berhe's status was adjusted to lawful permanent resident. Since his admission to the United States, Berhe has never returned to Eritrea. Nor has he had any contact with any surviving family members there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1996, Berhe was convicted in a Massachusetts municipal court for simple possession of crack cocaine under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 34, and for assault and battery of a police officer, and was sentenced to six months' probation. In 2003, he pleaded guilty to simple possession of crack cocaine in Massachusetts state district court, and received a six-month suspended sentence. In prosecuting the 2003 offense, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts did not charge Berhe with a prior conviction because it did not seek a recidivism-based sentence enhancement. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 278, &#167; 11A (providing that if the government seeks enhanced penalties because of a prior conviction, the defendant \"shall be entitled to a trial by jury of the issue of conviction of a prior offense\"). Both the 1996 conviction and the 2003 conviction were misdemeanors under Massachusetts law. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 274, &#167; 1 (\"A crime punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison is a felony. All other crimes are misdemeanors.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2004, DHS initiated removal proceedings against Berhe, charging that he was removable because of his 2003 conviction for simple possession of crack cocaine. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 237(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (providing that any alien convicted of violating a law \"relating to a controlled substance ... is deportable\"). Berhe conceded removability, but submitted applications seeking cancellation of removal, asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Berhe's asylum application asserted that he would be persecuted on account of his religion were he returned to Eritrea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DHS subsequently filed a supplemental charge of removability contending that Berhe's 2003 conviction was for an \"aggravated felony,\" <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (\"Any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony . . . is deportable.\"). DHS argued that because Berhe had a prior drug conviction, his 2003 misdemeanor simple possession conviction was an \"aggravated felony\" under the INA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1101(a)(43)(B). As a result, DHS argued, Berhe was statutorily ineligible for the discretionary relief of asylum or cancellation of removal. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), 1158(b)(2)(B)(i), 1229b(a)(3). DHS also argued that an aggravated felony is presumptively a \"particularly serious crime,\" which rendered Berhe ineligible for withholding of removal. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, an immigration judge found Berhe removable on the basis of the original controlled substance charge, but not on the aggravated felony charge. The judge concluded that, because Berhe's 2003 conviction was classified by Massachusetts law as a misdemeanor, it could not be considered an aggravated felony. The judge therefore evaluated Berhe's claims for relief and granted him asylum, withholding of removal, and cancellation of removal, but denied relief under the CAT. DHS appealed to the Board and Berhe filed a cross-appeal from the denial of his CAT claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board sustained DHS's appeal. The Board stated that it would apply the First Circuit's approach for determining whether the state conviction is an aggravated felony. The Board found that Berhe's 2003 offense was punishable under federal law as a felony because his prior drug possession offense converted his subsequent possession conviction into a felony. Because Berhe had been convicted of an aggravated felony, the Board found him ineligible for asylum or cancellation of removal and therefore did not reach the merits of those claims.

The second route is premised on the language \"drug trafficking crime\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(2). The Board concluded in <i>Matter of Davis,</i> 20 I &amp; N Dec. 536, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">443920</span></span> (BIA 1992), that in terms of the \"drug trafficking crime\" route, any state drug offense, whether classified as a felony or misdemeanor in that state, is an aggravated felony if the same conduct would have been punishable as a felony if charged under one of the three federal statutes enumerated in &#167; 924(c)(2). <i>Id.</i> at 543; <i>see also Gerbier,</i> 280 F.3d at 306.

Under that provision, a \"felony\" is any offense where the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is more than one year. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a). Thus, the Board ruled that a state drug offense could constitute an aggravated felony, in terms of the \"drug trafficking crime\" route, <i>only</i> if it is punishable by more than one year of imprisonment under one of the three federal drug statutes enumerated in &#167; 924(c)(2). <i>In re L-G-,</i> 21 I &amp; N Dec. at 96. In other words, under the Board's strict \"hypothetical federal felony\" approach, the phrase \"drug trafficking crime\" meant any conviction punishable by more than one year of imprisonment under one of the federal drug laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach has received mixed reviews from the circuit courts. In the civil immigration context, several circuits have adopted the Board's hypothetical federal felony approach. <i>E.g., Gonzales-Gomez v.

Under this approach, the underlying state classification of the offense is irrelevant. The circuits that have adopted this approach emphasize that focusing solely on federal law properly accounts for the need to apply the nation's immigration laws uniformly, and that an approach that allows the vagaries of state law to influence the determination would defeat this purpose. <i>See, e.g., Achim,</i> 441 F.3d at 535; <i>Gerbier,</i> 280 F.3d at 311-12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least two circuits have taken a more flexible approach.

Although we noted that the petitioner's offenses were felonies under state law, we undertook a federal analysis of the petitioner's crimes. <i>See id.</i> at 36 &amp; n. 3. We concluded that, although a simple possession offense is ordinarily a misdemeanor under the CSA, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a), \"one prior conviction turns possession into a felony since the maximum penalty increases to over a year.\" <i>Amaral,</i> 977 F.2d at 34.

The Board found that Berhe's 2003 conviction for simple possession, although ordinarily punishable as a misdemeanor under federal law, would be converted to a felony because of his previous possession conviction. <i>See Amaral,</i> 977 F.2d at 36; 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a). Thus, the Board concluded that both Henry and Berhe had been convicted for \"drug trafficking crimes\" as defined in &#167; 924(c)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners argue that, because their respective state drug offenses were not classified as <i>felonies</i> by the convicting authority, they should not be considered <i>aggravated felonies.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> They contend that our holding in <i>Restrepo-Aguilar</i> mandates that the law of the prosecuting jurisdiction controls for purposes of determining whether an offense is a felony or misdemeanor.

Thus, the petitioners argue, we discarded the approach in <i>Amaral</i> (which they characterize as dicta) in favor of an approach that looks to the prosecuting jurisdiction to determine the classification of an offense. They contend that the word \"applicable\" in &#167; 802(13)'s definition of \"felony\" requires us to consult the law <i>actually applied</i> by the convicting authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners misread our precedent. First, <i>Amaral's</i> ruling was not dicta. In <i>Amaral,</i> we were required to determine whether the petitioner had been convicted of an \"aggravated felony\" as defined in the INA, and in doing so, we employed a method that looked to the offense's hypothetical status under federal law. <i>See id.</i> at 36. Though we might have grounded our decision on the state's classification of the offense, we did not do so. <i>See id. Cf. United States v.

Less than two years after <i>Amaral,</i> we applied precisely the same analysis in a sentencing case. <i>See United States v. Forbes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195227\"><a href=\"/opinion/195227/united-states-v-forbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span>, 1301 (1st Cir.1994). We found that the defendant's first state conviction for possession of a controlled substance would have converted his second state possession conviction into a felony under federal law. <i>See id.</i> (citing 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(a)). Although, as in <i>Amaral,</i> the underlying offenses were also felonies under state law, our application of the aggravated felony enhancement was predicated on our finding that the state offense was punishable as a felony under federal law. <i>See id. Forbes</i> also suggests that a felony classification under <i>either</i> federal <i>or</i> state law will suffice to meet &#167; 924(c)(2)'s \"any felony\" requirement. <i>See id.; see also United States v. Cuevas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196562\"><a href=\"/opinion/196562/united-states-v-cuevas/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 783 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that the defendant's state drug offense \"undoubtedly qualifies as a felony\" because it is punishable as a felony under federal law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, <i>Restrepo-Aguilar</i> did not overrule or undermine <i>Amaral.</i> The defendant in <i>Restrepo-Aguilar</i> appealed the district court's application of the aggravated felon sentence enhancement. <i>See</i> 74 F.3d at 363 (citing U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2) (1994)). Although we recognized that the definition of \"aggravated felony\" in U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2 was essentially the same as the definition in the INA, we declined to adopt the Board's precedent which, at the time, applied the strict hypothetical federal felony approach. <i>See id.</i> at 366-67. We noted that the Board's rationale was based significantly on \"policy concerns relating to the consequences flowing from a deportation decision or a decision on an application for asylum, without regard to any of the policies that inform the meaning of `aggravated felony' in the context of the statutory prior offense enhancement or its implementation in the Sentencing Guidelines.\" <i>Restrepo-Aguilar,</i> 74 F.3d at 366. Viewing <i>Amaral</i> as enduring precedent, we were also careful to distinguish it based on the differing contexts. <i>Id.</i> at 366 n. 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, however, we noted that our approach in <i>Restrepo-Aguilar</i> was entirely consistent with <i>Amaral</i> and <i>Forbes. See id.</i> We observed that our cases interpreted the phrase \"drug trafficking crime\" in &#167; 924(c)(2) to encompass \"two <i>separate</i> elements: (1) that the offense be punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (or one of the other two statutes identified); and (2) that the offense be a felony.\" <i>Id.</i> at 364 (citing <i>Forbes,</i> 16 F.3d at 1301; <i>Amaral</i> 977 F.2d at 36). We further observed that &#167; 924(c)(2)'s definition of \"drug trafficking crime,\" \"by its terms includes `<i>any</i> felony' that is criminalized under the CSA.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, we found that the definition \"does not <i>limit</i> its application to offenses that would be classified as felonies\" under federal law. <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). Moreover, we stressed that the CSA's definition of \"felony\" provided further support for the idea that a felony designation under <i>either</i> federal <i>or</i> state law would be sufficient. <i>See id.</i> (\"[T]he CSA itself defines a felony as `any Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.'\") (quoting 21 U.S.C. &#167; 802(13)). It is clear we read \"applicable\" to mean, not the law <i>actually applied,</i> but, consistent with the ordinary meaning of the word, the law \"<i>capable of being applied.</i>\" <i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</i> 56 (10th ed.2001). Thus, we held that a state drug conviction may constitute an aggravated felony if it was classified as a felony under state law (even if it would have been a misdemeanor under federal law), but we did not suggest that a state offense could constitute an aggravated felony <i>only if</i> it was classified as a felony under state law. <i>See Restrepo-Aguilar,</i> 74 F.3d at 364-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Board was correct to employ the hypothetical federal felony methodology outlined in <i>Amaral.</i> For the purposes of determining whether a state drug offense is an \"aggravated felony\" under the INA, our circuit precedent permits an analysis that considers whether the underlying offense would have been punishable as a felony under federal law. As discussed above, we are not alone. While there is disagreement concerning whether it is permissible to consult state law in making the aggravated felony determination, as far as we can tell, all the circuits to have considered the issue agree that a state drug offense that would be punishable as a felony under the CSA is a \"drug trafficking crime\" under &#167; 924(c)(2). <i>See supra</i> at 11-12.

Berhe acknowledges that both the state and the federal government (had it brought charges against him) could have sought a recidivism-based sentence enhancement which, if successful, would have resulted in a felony conviction under federal law. But, because he was not so charged, and instead pleaded guilty only to simple possession of a controlled substance (which is only a misdemeanor under federal law because it is punishable by no more than one year in prison, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a)), the government failed to establish that he was convicted of a hypothetical federal felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree. Because Berhe's 1996 conviction is not a part of the record of the 2003 conviction, the government did not establish that Berhe was convicted of a hypothetical federal felony. As recently articulated, this circuit applies a \"modified categorical approach\" for determining whether an alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony. <i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202370\"><a href=\"/opinion/202370/conteh-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 55-56 (1st Cir.2006). Under this approach, \"the government bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence derived solely from the record of the prior proceeding, that (i) the alien was convicted of a crime and (ii) that crime involved every element\" of one of the offenses enumerated in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43). <i>Id.</i> at 56. When the statute on which the underlying conviction rests necessarily involves all of the elements enumerated in one of the INA's definitions of aggravated felony, \"proof of the fact of conviction suffices to discharge the government's burden.\" <i>Id.</i> Where, however, the underlying statute sweeps more broadly (i.e., encompasses crimes that are not necessarily aggravated felonies under the INA), \"the government ... must demonstrate, by reference only to facts that can be mined from the record of conviction, that the putative predicate offense constitutes a crime designated as an aggravated felony in the INA.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Taylor v.

Gen. Laws ch. 94C, &#167; 34, <i>with</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a) (both setting a maximum term of imprisonment of one year for \"knowingly or intentionally ... possess[ing] a controlled substance\"). Therefore, we must look to the record of conviction of the alleged aggravated felony to determine whether the government met its burden of proving that Berhe had a prior conviction for a drug offense. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844(a) (noting that if an offense for simple possession is committed after a prior conviction for a drug offense has become final, the maximum penalty increases to two years' imprisonment). The record of Berhe's 2003 conviction in state district court&#8212;the criminal complaint alleging misdemeanor possession of crack cocaine and the official criminal docket indicating Berhe's plea of guilty to that charge&#8212;contains no reference to Berhe's 1996 conviction. Both the criminal complaint and the docket clearly indicate that Berhe was charged and convicted of the misdemeanor crime (under both Massachusetts and federal law) of simple possession of a controlled substance punishable by no more than one year in prison.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the record of conviction here contains no reference to Berhe's prior conviction, or to any other factor that would hypothetically convert his 2003 state misdemeanor conviction into a felony under federal law, the Board erred by concluding that his 2003 conviction was an \"aggravated felony\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43). The Board therefore also erred in concluding that Berhe is ineligible for asylum and cancellation of removal. Hence, we must remand so that it may consider the merits of those claims. <i>See INS v.

He contends that the Board did not base its decision on substantial evidence and failed to explain sufficiently why it chose to disregard the immigration judge's conclusions. At oral argument, and in a supplemental post-argument filing, the government argues that the Real ID Act of 2005 strips us of jurisdiction to review Berhe's claim for withholding of removal. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(C) (divesting jurisdiction to review \"any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense\" in violation of a law relating to controlled substances). Because Berhe was found removable based on a controlled substance offense, the government argues, this court may review only \"questions of law\" and \"constitutional claims.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1252(a)(2)(D) (preserving our jurisdiction for such claims). The government contends that Berhe's withholding of removal claim does not present any legal or constitutional issues. Berhe counters that the adequacy of the Board's reasoning is a legal question that we may review. Berhe is correct. <i>See Enwonwu v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793345\"><a href=\"/opinion/793345/frank-igwebuike-enwonwu-v-alberto-r-gonzales-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2006)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During removal proceedings, Berhe, appearing pro se, asserted that he feared religious persecution on the basis of his status (or imputed status) as a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The immigration judge found \"no evidence that this would be held against him\" in Eritrea, but granted Berhe's application for withholding of removal on another ground. The judge found that documentary evidence (presumably the State Department country reports) established that conditions in Eritrea are \"generally bad,\" that the ruling regime is \"quite brutal,\" and that \"people who are deemed sympathetic in any way to critics [of the government] are detained and subjected to severe mistreatment.\" Thus, crediting Berhe's testimony that he \"came to the United States as a refugee and has continued to seek asylum even after becoming removable,\" the judge found that, upon return to Eritrea, he would likely be targeted for persecution \"as a suspected critic of the Eritrean government.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Board found that \"there is no basis to find that it is more likely than not that the respondent would be subjected to persecution based upon the religion of his adoptive parents.\" Nowhere, however, did the Board engage the immigration judge's rationale for granting Berhe's application for withholding of removal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Berhe, therefore, that this case is controlled by <i>Enwonwu. See</i> 438 F.3d at 35 (holding that, where the Board's reversal of an immigration judge's grant of relief under the CAT only addressed one of the two findings made by the judge in support of its decision, the Board's opinion was \"insufficiently reasoned as a matter of law\"). Although we have previously noted that the Board \"need not spell out every last detail of its reasoning where the logical underpinnings are clear from the record,\" there is a heightened obligation \"to offer more explanation when the record suggests strong arguments for the petitioner that the [Board] has not considered.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Sulaiman v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201926\"><a href=\"/opinion/201926/sulaiman-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 350 (1st Cir.2005)). We agree with Berhe that there was adequate support in the record for the immigration judge's finding, and that it was therefore an error of law for the Board to reverse without addressing that finding. The proper course, therefore, is to remand to the Board for further consideration of Berhe's claim for withholding of removal. <i>See id.; see also Ventura,</i> 537 U.S. at 16-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122242\"><a href=\"/opinion/122242/ins-v-orlando-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Board held that Berhe had waived his CAT claim by failing to inform the immigration judge of his intention to appeal. <i>See Matter of Shih,</i> 20 I &amp; N Dec. 697, 698-99 (BIA 1993). The Board further noted that Berhe's Notice of Appeal, which was filed six months after the immigration judge's decision, was untimely. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.38(b). In his petition, Berhe contends, and the government concedes, that the immigration judge failed to advise Berhe of his right to appeal the decision to deny him protection under the CAT. He argues, therefore, that he could not have knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations governing immigration proceedings require that \"[a] party affected by a decision of an immigration judge which may be appealed to the Board ... shall be given notice of the opportunity for filing an appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1003.3. <i>Cf.</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(c)(5) (requiring the immigration judge to \"inform the alien of the right to appeal\" from an order of removal). The Board has previously recognized that any waiver of the right to appeal must be made \"knowingly and intelligently.\" <i>In re Rodriguez-Diaz,</i> 22 I &amp; N Dec. 1320, 1322 (BIA 2000); <i>see also Shih,</i> 20 I &amp; N Dec. at 698-99 (finding waiver where the alien was specifically informed of the consequences of his waiver).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the immigration judge both failed to inform Berhe of his right to appeal and affirmatively suggested that Berhe had no reason to appeal. At the close of proceedings, after having asked DHS's attorney whether she wished to appeal, the immigration judge told Berhe: \"I've granted your applications for relief. Did you understand all of that?\" Further assuring Berhe of the completeness of his victory, the judge stated: \"If the Government does not actually file an appeal, you will be released.\" No reference was made to any right of cross-appeal or to the peril that Berhe's inaction could result in his waiving the CAT claim. Nor was any subsequent notice sent to Berhe informing him of his right to appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances, the Board erred by ruling that Berhe \"knowingly and intelligently\" waived his right to appeal the rejection of his CAT claim. The equities weigh especially in Berhe's favor, given that he was not represented by counsel. <i>See Rodriguez-Diaz,</i> 22 I &amp; N Dec. at 1323 (stressing that \"in cases involving unrepresented aliens, more detailed explanations [of the alien's right to appeal] are often needed\"). Nor should Berhe be faulted for the late filing of his Notice of Appeal. The Board's bar against hearing untimely appeals is inapplicable in these circumstances. <i>See Zhong Guang Sun v.
