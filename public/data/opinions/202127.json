This is an appeal from a summary\n\njudgment ruling holding that Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance\n\nCompany (Mass. Mutual) is not required to pay benefits to Martin\n\nFraidowitz    for    additional     disability     coverage     that   Fraidowitz\n\npurchased pursuant to the terms of a pre-existing disability\n\npolicy.      The district court concluded that Fraidowitz made a\n\nmisrepresentation in applying for the additional coverage which\n\ndisqualified him from collecting the additional benefits.                        We\n\naffirm.\n\n            Fraidowitz      is    an   insurance    agent      who   purchased   a\n\ndisability insurance policy from Mass. Mutual in 1986.                 The policy\n\nprovided for income replacement of $3,350 per month if Fraidowitz\n\nbecame \"unable to perform the main duties of [his] occupation\" due\n\nto a medical condition.          The policy also provided Fraidowitz with\n\nthe opportunity to purchase increased benefits each year during a\n\nsixty-day option period around the anniversary date of the policy.\n\nThis   increased-benefits        option,      however,   was    subject   to   the\n\nqualification that \"if [Fraidowitz were] disabled during any option\n\nperiod [then the] option to buy additional benefits [would be]\n\npostponed    until    the   option     period    following     [his]   recovery.\"\n\nFraidowitz timely paid the premiums due on the policy.\n\n            In August 1999, Fraidowitz began experiencing symptoms of\n\ndepression. In January 2000, he sought treatment from psychiatrist\n\nRobert Swords and psychotherapist Duane Daguio at the Institute of\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fLiving Medical Group in Hartford, Connecticut.             A month later,\n\nFraidowitz filed a disability claim under the policy.             Fraidowitz\n\nprovided Mass. Mutual with the required forms and granted Mass.\n\nMutual permission to discuss his condition with his mental health\n\nproviders.\n\n           In investigating Fraidowitz's claim on behalf of Mass.\n\nMutual, psychologist Robert Dean spoke with Daguio and Swords.\n\nDaguio said that \"he [did] not think that Mr. Fraidowitz was\n\ntotally disabled;\" but rather that \"he does not want to work and\n\nwould prefer to collect money.\"       Swords indicated that he thought\n\nthat   Fraidowitz   was   \"probably   trying   to   use   [him]   to   get   a\n\ndisability.\"   He further stated that Fraidowitz was probably a\n\n\"faker\" and that he did not see any signs of an impairment that\n\nwould keep Fraidowitz from working.      In light of this information,\n\nMass. Mutual denied Fraidowitz's disability claim in May 2000.\n\nThereafter, Fraidowitz retained counsel to challenge the denial.\n\n           In July 2000, Fraidowitz sought to purchase additional\n\ncoverage during the option period while continuing to challenge the\n\ndenial of his disability claim.         These dual goals complicated\n\nFraidowitz's ability to apply for additional coverage because the\n\napplication asked whether Fraidowitz was \"currently disabled.\"               If\n\nFraidowitz answered that he was currently disabled, then he would\n\nnot be permitted to purchase additional coverage until some time\n\nafter the disability abated.      But if he answered that he was not\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdisabled, then Mass. Mutual could try to use this statement as an\n\nadmission against him in a contest over his disability claim.\n\n          Appreciating   this    difficulty,    Fraidowitz,   through\n\ncounsel, contacted Mass. Mutual for guidance on how he should\n\nanswer the \"currently disabled\" question.      Mass. Mutual responded\n\nthat he \"should complete the form as accurately and honestly as\n\npossible.\"   Armed with this advice, Fraidowitz indicated that he\n\nwas not disabled but also that his \"answer was per the denial\" of\n\nhis claim by Mass. Mutual and that his answer should not be\n\nconstrued to prejudice his right to contest further the denial of\n\nhis claim.   After Fraidowitz submitted the additional coverage\n\napplication, he received a detailed letter from Mass. Mutual\n\nexplaining that it had denied his disability claim because the\n\ninformation obtained from his mental health providers failed to\n\nsupport the claim.\n\n          In August 2000, Mass. Mutual granted Fraidowitz's request\n\nfor additional coverage, increasing his monthly benefit to $6,700.\n\nThe next month, Fraidowitz paid an added premium for the additional\n\ncoverage, which Mass. Mutual accepted.\n\n          In October 2000, Swords and Daugio wrote to Mass. Mutual\n\nto \"clarify and supplement\" their earlier comments concerning\n\nFraidowitz's disability claim.     They explained that Fraidowitz\n\nactually had been \"clinically depressed\" since February 3, 2000,\n\nand that, in their \"medical opinion,\" Fraidowitz was \"unable to\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fperform any regular duties of his occupation . . . not as a matter\n\nof his personal choice, but [because of his] his psychiatric\n\ncondition.\"\n\n              In    light   of    this     reversal,    Mass.    Mutual    reopened\n\nFraidowitz's disability claim and allowed the claim retroactively\n\nto February 3, 2000.             Mass. Mutual promptly informed Fraidowitz\n\nthat it would pay him benefits of $3,350 per month.                     Fraidowitz\n\ncomplained, however, that he was entitled to benefits of $6,700\n\nfrom   July    2000    forward      because      he   had   purchased     additional\n\ncoverage.     Mass. Mutual disagreed because, in its view, Fraidowitz\n\nhad falsely stated on the additional coverage application that he\n\nwas not disabled.\n\n              Subsequently,        Mass.    Mutual     brought    an    action   in\n\nMassachusetts Superior Court for a declaratory judgment that it was\n\nnot required to pay Fraidowitz additional benefits.                     Fraidowitz\n\nremoved the action to federal court. After discovery, the district\n\ncourt allowed Mass. Mutual's motion for summary judgment.                        See\n\nMass. Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Fraidowitz, 360 F. Supp. 2d 243 (D.\n\nMass. 2005).        The court applied Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 186,\n\nwhich permits an insurer to avoid paying on a policy which has been\n\nobtained through a false warranty that was \"made with actual intent\n\nto deceive, or . . . increased the risk of loss\" to the insurer.\n\nId. at 246.        It concluded that Fraidowitz had violated Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 175, § 186 because his assertion that he was not disabled\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fwas false, and Mass. Mutual relied on this misrepresentation to\n\ngrant Fraidowitz additional coverage.             Id. at 247.        Fraidowitz\n\ntimely appealed.\n\n             We review summary judgment rulings de novo.            See Guzman-\n\nRosario v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 397 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).      Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.          Fed. R. civ. P. 56©).       We may affirm\n\nsummary judgment on any ground supported by the record.                      See\n\nFabiano v. Hopkins, 352 F.3d 447, 452 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             Fraidowitz contends that there is a material dispute of\n\nfact as to whether he made a misrepresentation in stating that he\n\nwas not disabled, given that he disclosed that his answer was based\n\non Mass. Mutual's rejection of his claim.1           Given the completeness\n\nof   Fraidowitz's    answer,     it   is   not   obvious   that    this   was   a\n\nmisrepresentation with the meaning of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, §\n\n186.2       Nevertheless,   we    believe    that    summary      judgment   was\n\n\n        1\n      Fraidowitz also contends that the district court erred in\ndenying his motion to strike certain materials from the summary\njudgment record.   Because we do not rely on these materials in\nresolving this appeal, we do not address this argument.\n        2\n      Fraidowitz suggests that Connecticut law should apply to this\ndispute and that an incontestability clause in the disability\npolicy defeats Mass Mutual's claim. Neither of these arguments was\nraised before the district court and neither convinces us that\nplain error has occurred, so we will not consider them.         See\nGuzman-Rosario, 397 F.3d at 11; see also Smith v. KMart Corp., 177\nF.3d 19, 25-26 (1st Cir. 1999) (stating that plain error is a \"rare\nspecies in civil litigation\").\n\n                                       -6-\n\fappropriately granted because Fraidowitz failed to meet a condition\n\nprecedent    for   obtaining   additional   disability   coverage:   the\n\ncondition of not being disabled when applying for the additional\n\ncoverage.\n\n            A statement required by an insured in applying for\n\ninsurance may either be a warranty, or it may establish a condition\n\nprecedent.    See Kobico, Inc. v. Pipe, 688 N.E.2d 1004, 1006 (Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 1997).      To void a policy based on the insured making a\n\nfalse warranty, Massachusetts requires proof of an actual intent to\n\ndeceive by the insured or of an increased risk of loss to the\n\ninsurer.    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 186.    This rule does not apply\n\nto conditions precedent.       See Shaw v. Commercial Ins. Co. of N.J.,\n\n270 N.E.2d 817, 821 (Mass. 1971); see also Gen. Star Indemnity Co.\n\nv. Duffy, 191 F.3d 55, 60 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999).      If an insured fails\n\nto satisfy a condition precedent, the coverage is void regardless\n\nof whether there was proof of an intent to deceive or an increased\n\nrisk of loss.      See Krause v. Equitable Life Ins. co., 129 N.E.2d\n\n617, 619 (Mass. 1955) (stating that if \"conditions . . . were not\n\nsatisfied no contractual duty under the policy ever arose\").\n\n            Distinguishing a warranty from a condition precedent\n\npresents a question of law.       See Kobico, 688 N.E.2d at 1007; see\n\nalso Drake Fishing, Inc. v. Clarendon Am. Ins. Co., 136 F.3d 851,\n\n853 (1st Cir. 1998). Under Massachusetts law, a statement required\n\nof the insured is a condition precedent to obtaining coverage only\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fif   (1)   the   statement     relates    \"essentially   to   the   insurer's\n\nintelligent decision to issue\" the coverage, and (2) the statement\n\nis \"made a condition precedent to recovery under the policy, either\n\nby   using    the   precise    words     'condition   precedent'    or   their\n\nequivalent[.]\" Charles, Henry & Crowley Co. v. Homes Ins. Co., 212\n\nN.E.2d 240, 242 (Mass. 1965). The requirement that Fraidowitz must\n\nnot be disabled to obtain additional coverage satisfies both parts\n\nof the condition-precedent standard.\n\n             There is no question that Fraidowitz not being disabled\n\nwas essential to Mass. Mutual's \"intelligent decision\" to issue him\n\nadditional coverage.          As Fraidowitz acknowledges, Mass. Mutual\n\nwould not have issued the coverage had he stated that he was\n\ndisabled. Thus, his answer was critical to Mass. Mutual's decision\n\nto issue coverage.     See id. (stating that the first aspect of the\n\ncondition precedent test is met where the statement concerns \"a\n\nfundamental fact\" which the insurer considers in deciding to issue\n\nthe policy); Paratore v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 141\n\nN.E.2d 511, 513 (Mass. 1957) (stating that a requirement in a life\n\ninsurance policy     \"that an insured is in sound health at the date\n\nof the policy is clearly a proper subject of a condition precedent\"\n\nbecause such information is important to the insurer's decision to\n\nissue the policy).\n\n             While the policy does not use the words \"condition\n\nprecedent\" to describe the no-disability requirement, Massachusetts\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\flaw imposes no magic words requirement.           See Kobico, 688 N.E.2d at\n\n1007 (collecting Massachusetts cases in which courts have found a\n\ncondition precedent, even though the policy did not use the term\n\n\"condition precedent\").       For example, the Supreme Judicial Court\n\nhas held that a provision in a life insurance policy stating that\n\nthe policy \"shall be void\" if the insured had been hospitalized for\n\ntreatment of a serious disease within two years of the issuing date\n\nof the policy constituted a condition precedent.             Lopardi v. John\n\nHancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 194 N.E. 706, 707 (Mass. 1935).                 This\n\nwas so because the \"natural meaning\" of the phrase \"shall be void\"\n\nmade   the   coverage   contingent    on    the   insured   meeting   the    no-\n\nhospitalization requirement.         Id. at 708; see also Paratore, 141\n\nN.E.2d at 513 (concluding that a similar clause created a condition\n\nprecedent).\n\n             Fraidowitz's policy is similar to those at issue in\n\nLopardi and Paratore.       The policy states that if Fraidowitz were\n\ndisabled, then the period for purchasing additional coverage would\n\nbe \"postponed\" until the disability abated.                 In other words,\n\nFraidowitz's option to buy additional coverage was \"void\" whenever\n\nhe was disabled.      Lopardi, 194 N.E. at 707; see also Paratore, 141\n\nN.E.2d at 513.       The \"natural meaning\" of the postponement clause\n\nwas    to   make   Fraidowitz's   ability    to   buy   additional    coverage\n\nconditional on his not being disabled. Lopardi, 194 N.E.2d at 708.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            Fraidowitz did not satisfy this condition. When applying\n\nfor additional coverage in July 2000, Fraidowitz stated that he was\n\nnot disabled based on Mass. Mutual's denial of his claim.              But,\n\nbecause   of   information   subsequently    submitted   by   Fraidowitz's\n\nmental    health   providers,   Mass.   Mutual   declared     him   disabled\n\nretroactive to February 3, 2000.         Thus, in July 2000, Fraidowitz\n\nboth saw himself as disabled and was in fact disabled, making his\n\noption to buy additional coverage ineffective.\n\n            This conclusion has nothing to do with Fraidowitz's\n\nveracity in completing the additional-coverage application. As far\n\nas we can tell, Fraidowitz completed the application truthfully\n\nbased on the information available to him at the time.                   But\n\nFraidowitz's representation was wrong.        See Krause, 129 N.E.2d at\n\n618-19 (concluding that an insurance policy was ineffective where\n\nevents occurring after the coverage application was submitted\n\ncaused the insured to fail to meet a condition precedent). Because\n\nFraidowitz did not satisfy the condition of not being disabled when\n\npurchasing additional coverage, Mass. Mutual had no obligation to\n\npay him the additional benefits.\n\n            Fraidowitz has a final argument.      He contends that there\n\nis a material dispute concerning whether Mass. Mutual waived its\n\nright to enforce the condition precedent because it had all the\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\finformation necessary to know that he was disabled when it decided\n\nto issue the additional coverage.3           We disagree.\n\n           We    question    whether     waiver   could      even   apply   under\n\nMassachusetts law where the insured has failed to meet a condition\n\nprecedent.      See Kukuruza v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 176\n\nN.E. 788, 791 (Mass. 1931) (stating that the insurer's \"knowledge\n\nof   the   falsity    of    the    statements     in   the    application     for\n\nreinstatement would not establish waiver . . . of the express\n\ncondition upon which the policy was reinstated . . .\").                       But\n\nassuming arguendo that waiver is a viable theory, it does not apply\n\nhere.\n\n           For waiver to apply, there must be some evidence that\n\nMass. Mutual knew that Fraidowitz was disabled when it issued him\n\nthe additional coverage.          See Gen. Star Indemnity, 191 F.3d at 59.\n\nBefore October 2000, Mass. Mutual believed that Fraidowitz's mental\n\nhealth providers did not fully support his disability claim. While\n\nthe physician who supervised Fraidowitz's care sent Mass. Mutual a\n\nletter stating that Fraidowitz was unable to do his job, he also\n\ntold Mass. Mutual in a subsequent phone conversation, that he\n\nthought Fraidowitz might be exaggerating his symptoms.               The doctor\n\nlater clarified that Fraidowitz was disabled only per his own \"self\n\n\n     3\n      Fraidowitz refers to this argument as a claim for estoppel.\nBut estoppel requires a showing of reliance by the insured. See\nRotundi v. Arbella Mut. Ins. Co., 763 N.E.2d 563, 564-65 (Mass App.\nCt. 2002). As Fraidowitz has not attempted to make such a showing,\nwe assume that he intended to argue waiver and not estoppel.\n\n                                      -11-\n\freport.\"     Mass.     Mutual   was   entitled   to   rely   on   these\n\ncommunications.   Only in October did Fraidowitz's doctors rescind\n\ntheir earlier skepticism and fully support his claim.         We think\n\nthat before then Mass. Mutual lacked sufficient knowledge of\n\nFraidowitz's condition for the waiver doctrine to apply.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

Pipe,</i> 44 Mass.App.Ct. 103, 688 N.E.2d 1004, 1006 (1997). To void a policy based on the insured making a false warranty, Massachusetts requires proof of an actual intent to deceive by the insured or of an increased risk of loss to the insurer. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 186. This rule does not apply to conditions precedent. <i>See Shaw v. Commercial Ins. Co. of N.J.,</i> 359 Mass. 601, 270 N.E.2d 817, 821 (1971); <i>see also Gen. Star Indemnity Co. v. Duffy,</i> 191 F.3d 55, 60 n. 2 (1st Cir.1999). If an insured fails to satisfy a condition precedent, the coverage is void regardless of whether there was proof of an intent to deceive or an increased risk of loss. <i>See Krause v. Equitable Life Ins. Co.,</i> 333 Mass. 200, 129 N.E.2d 617, 619 (1955) (stating that if \"conditions . . . were not satisfied no contractual duty under the policy ever arose\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Distinguishing a warranty from a condition precedent presents a question of law. <i>See Kobico,</i> 688 N.E.2d at 1007; <i>see also Drake Fishing, Inc. v. Clarendon Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 136 F.3d 851, 853 (1st Cir.1998). Under Massachusetts law, a statement required of the insured is a condition precedent to obtaining coverage only if (1) the statement relates \"essentially to the insurer's intelligent decision to issue\" the coverage, and (2) the statement is \"made a condition precedent to recovery under the policy, either by using the precise words `condition precedent' or their equivalent[.]\" <i>Charles, Henry &amp; Crowley Co. v. Home Ins. Co.,</i> 349 Mass. 723, 212 N.E.2d 240, 242 (1965). The requirement that Fraidowitz must not be disabled to obtain additional coverage satisfies both parts of the condition-precedent standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that Fraidowitz not being disabled was essential to Mass. Mutual's \"intelligent decision\" to issue him additional coverage. As Fraidowitz acknowledges, Mass. Mutual would not have issued the coverage had he stated that he was disabled. Thus, his answer was critical to Mass. Mutual's decision to issue coverage. <i>See id.</i> (stating that the first aspect of the condition precedent test is met where the statement concerns \"a fundamental fact\" which the insurer considers in deciding to issue the policy); <i>Paratore v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 335 Mass. 632, 141 N.E.2d 511, 513 (1957) (stating that a requirement in a life insurance policy \"that an insured is in sound health at the date of the policy is clearly a proper subject of a condition precedent\" because such information is important to the insurer's decision to issue the policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the policy does not use the words \"condition precedent\" to describe the no-disability requirement, Massachusetts law imposes no magic words requirement. <i>See Kobico,</i> 688 N.E.2d at 1007 (collecting Massachusetts cases in which courts have found a condition precedent, even though the policy did not use the term \"condition precedent\"). For example, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that a provision in a life insurance policy stating that the policy \"shall be void\" if the insured had been hospitalized for treatment of a serious disease within two years of the issuing date of the policy constituted a condition precedent. <i>Lopardi v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 289 Mass. 492, 194 N.E. 706, 707 (1935). This was so because the \"natural meaning\" of the phrase \"shall be void\" made the coverage contingent on the insured meeting the no-hospitalization requirement. <i>Id.</i> at 708; <i>see also Paratore,</i> 141 N.E.2d at 513 (concluding that a similar clause created a condition precedent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fraidowitz's policy is similar to those at issue in <i>Lopardi</i> and <i>Paratore.</i> The policy states that if Fraidowitz were disabled, then the period for purchasing additional coverage would be \"postponed\" until the disability abated. In other words, Fraidowitz's option to buy additional coverage was \"void\" whenever he was disabled. <i>Lopardi,</i> 194 N.E. at 707; <i>see also Paratore,</i> 141 N.E.2d at 513. The \"natural meaning\" of the postponement clause was to make Fraidowitz's ability to buy additional coverage conditional on his not being disabled. <i>Lopardi,</i> 194 N.E. at 708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fraidowitz did not satisfy this condition. When applying for additional coverage in July 2000, Fraidowitz stated that he was not disabled based on Mass. Mutual's denial of his claim. But, because of information subsequently submitted by Fraidowitz's mental health providers, Mass. Mutual declared him disabled retroactive to February 3, 2000. Thus, in July 2000, Fraidowitz both saw himself as disabled and was in fact disabled, making his option to buy additional coverage ineffective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion has nothing to do with Fraidowitz's veracity in completing the additional-coverage application. As far as we can tell, Fraidowitz completed the application truthfully based on the information available to him at the time. But Fraidowitz's representation was wrong. <i>See Krause,</i> 129 N.E.2d at 618-19 (concluding that an insurance policy was ineffective where events occurring after the coverage application was submitted caused the insured to fail to meet a condition precedent). Because Fraidowitz did not satisfy the condition of not being disabled when purchasing additional coverage, Mass. Mutual had no obligation to pay him the additional benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fraidowitz has a final argument. He contends that there is a material dispute concerning whether Mass. Mutual waived its right to enforce the condition precedent because it had all the information necessary to know that he was disabled when it decided to issue the additional coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We question whether waiver could even apply under Massachusetts law where the insured has failed to meet a condition precedent. <i>See Kukuruza v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 276 Mass. 146, 176 N.E. 788, 791 (1931) (stating that the insurer's \"knowledge of the falsity of the statements in the application for reinstatement would not establish waiver . . . of the express condition upon which the policy was reinstated. . .\"). But assuming arguendo that waiver is a viable theory, it does not apply here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For waiver to apply, there must be some evidence that Mass. Mutual knew that Fraidowitz was disabled when it issued him the additional coverage. <i>See Gen. Star Indemnity,</i> 191 F.3d at 59. Before October 2000, Mass. Mutual believed that Fraidowitz's mental health providers did not fully support his disability claim. While the physician who supervised Fraidowitz's care sent Mass. Mutual a letter stating that Fraidowitz was unable to do his job, he also told Mass. Mutual in a subsequent phone conversation, that he thought Fraidowitz might be exaggerating his symptoms. The doctor later clarified that Fraidowitz was disabled only per his own \"self report.\" Mass. Mutual was entitled to rely on these communications. Only in October did Fraidowitz's doctors rescind their earlier skepticism and fully support his claim. We think that before then Mass. Mutual lacked sufficient knowledge of Fraidowitz's condition for the waiver doctrine to apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fraidowitz also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to strike certain materials from the summary judgment record.

The policy also provided Fraidowitz with the opportunity to purchase increased benefits each year during a sixty-day option period around the anniversary date of the policy. This increased-benefits option, however, was subject to the qualification that \"if [Fraidowitz were] disabled during any option period [then the] option to buy additional benefits [would be] postponed until the option period following [his] recovery.\" Fraidowitz timely paid the premiums due on the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1999, Fraidowitz began experiencing symptoms of depression.

Co. of N.J.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2179840\"><a href=\"/opinion/2179840/shaw-v-commercial-insurance-co-of-newark-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2179840\"><a href=\"/opinion/2179840/shaw-v-commercial-insurance-co-of-newark-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 821 (1971); <i>see also Gen.

If an insured fails to satisfy a condition precedent, the coverage is void regardless of whether there was proof of an intent to deceive or an increased risk of loss. <i>See Krause v.

Clarendon Am. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197810\"><a href=\"/opinion/197810/drake-fishing-inc-v-clarendon-american/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span>, 853 (1st Cir.1998). Under Massachusetts law, a statement required of the insured is a condition precedent to obtaining coverage only if (1) the statement relates \"essentially to the insurer's intelligent decision to issue\" the coverage, and (2) the statement is \"made a condition precedent to recovery under the policy, either by using the precise words `condition precedent' or their equivalent[.]\" <i>Charles, Henry &amp; Crowley Co. v. Home Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2044850\"><a href=\"/opinion/2044850/charles-henry-crowley-co-inc-v-home-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2044850\"><a href=\"/opinion/2044850/charles-henry-crowley-co-inc-v-home-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 242 (1965). The requirement that Fraidowitz must not be disabled to obtain additional coverage satisfies both parts of the condition-precedent standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that Fraidowitz not being disabled was essential to Mass. Mutual's \"intelligent decision\" to issue him additional coverage. As Fraidowitz acknowledges, Mass. Mutual would not have issued the coverage had he stated that he was disabled. Thus, his answer was critical to Mass. Mutual's decision to issue coverage. <i>See id.</i> (stating that the first aspect of the condition precedent test is met where the statement concerns \"a fundamental fact\" which the insurer considers in deciding to issue the policy); <i>Paratore v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120249/paratore-v-john-hancock-mutual-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2120249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2120249/paratore-v-john-hancock-mutual-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 513 (1957) (stating that a requirement in a life insurance policy \"that an insured is in sound health at the date of the policy is clearly a proper subject of a condition precedent\" because such information is important to the insurer's decision to issue the policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the policy does not use the words \"condition precedent\" to describe the no-disability requirement, Massachusetts law imposes no magic words requirement. <i>See Kobico,</i> 688 N.E.2d at 1007 (collecting Massachusetts cases in which courts have found a condition precedent, even though the policy did not use the term \"condition precedent\"). For example, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that a provision in a life insurance policy stating that the policy \"shall be void\" if the insured had been hospitalized for treatment of a serious disease within two years of the issuing date of the policy constituted a condition precedent. <i>Lopardi v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></span>, 707 (1935). This was so because the \"natural meaning\" of the phrase \"shall be void\" made the coverage contingent on the insured meeting the no-hospitalization requirement. <i>Id.</i> at 708; <i>see also Paratore,</i> 141 N.E.2d at 513 (concluding that a similar clause created a condition precedent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fraidowitz's policy is similar to those at issue in <i>Lopardi</i> and <i>Paratore.</i> The policy states that if Fraidowitz were disabled, then the period for purchasing additional coverage would be \"postponed\" until the disability abated. In other words, Fraidowitz's option to buy additional coverage was \"void\" whenever he was disabled. <i>Lopardi,</i> 194 N.E. at 707; <i>see also Paratore,</i> 141 N.E.2d at 513. The \"natural meaning\" of the postponement clause was to make Fraidowitz's ability to buy additional coverage conditional on his not being disabled. <i>Lopardi,</i> 194 N.E. at 708.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fraidowitz did not satisfy this condition. When applying for additional coverage in July 2000, Fraidowitz stated that he was not disabled based on Mass. Mutual's denial of his claim. But, because of information subsequently submitted by Fraidowitz's mental health providers, Mass. Mutual declared him disabled retroactive to February 3, 2000. Thus, in July 2000, Fraidowitz both saw himself as disabled and was in fact disabled, making his option to buy additional coverage ineffective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion has nothing to do with Fraidowitz's veracity in completing the additional-coverage application. As far as we can tell, Fraidowitz completed the application truthfully based on the information available to him at the time. But Fraidowitz's representation was wrong. <i>See Krause,</i> 129 N.E.2d at 618-19 (concluding that an insurance policy was ineffective where events occurring after the coverage application was submitted caused the insured to fail to meet a condition precedent). Because Fraidowitz did not satisfy the condition of not being disabled when purchasing additional coverage, Mass. Mutual had no obligation to pay him the additional benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fraidowitz has a final argument. He contends that there is a material dispute concerning whether Mass. Mutual waived its right to enforce the condition precedent because it had all the information necessary to know that he was disabled when it decided to issue the additional coverage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We question whether waiver could even apply under Massachusetts law where the insured has failed to meet a condition precedent. <i>See Kukuruza v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></span>, 791 (1931) (stating that the insurer's \"knowledge of the falsity of the statements in the application for reinstatement would not establish waiver . . . of the express condition upon which the policy was reinstated. . .\"). But assuming arguendo that waiver is a viable theory, it does not apply here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For waiver to apply, there must be some evidence that Mass. Mutual knew that Fraidowitz was disabled when it issued him the additional coverage. <i>See Gen. Star Indemnity,</i> 191 F.3d at 59. Before October 2000, Mass. Mutual believed that Fraidowitz's mental health providers did not fully support his disability claim. While the physician who supervised Fraidowitz's care sent Mass. Mutual a letter stating that Fraidowitz was unable to do his job, he also told Mass. Mutual in a subsequent phone conversation, that he thought Fraidowitz might be exaggerating his symptoms. The doctor later clarified that Fraidowitz was disabled only per his own \"self report.\" Mass. Mutual was entitled to rely on these communications. Only in October did Fraidowitz's doctors rescind their earlier skepticism and fully support his claim. We think that before then Mass. Mutual lacked sufficient knowledge of Fraidowitz's condition for the waiver doctrine to apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Fraidowitz also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to strike certain materials from the summary judgment record.

Neither of these arguments was raised before the district court and neither convinces us that plain error has occurred, so we will not consider them<i>See Guzman-Rosario,</i> 397 F.3d at 11; <i>see also Smith v.
