Sullivan, United States Attorney, Lisa De Soto,\nGeneral Counsel, Robert J. Triba, Chief Counsel, Maria A. Machin,\nAssistant Regional Counsel, and Rayford A. Farquhar, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         November 5, 2002\n\f       Per Curiam.         Emery Stephens appeals from a district court\n\ndecision upholding the Commissioner's denial of social security\n\ndisability benefits under 42 U.S.C. § 423(d).                    Stephens, a fifty-\n\nfive year old man with a tenth grade education, applied for\n\nbenefits on June 25, 1996, alleging an inability to work since\n\nDecember 15, 1995 because of a fractured left ankle.\n\n       After   a    remand     from   the       Appeals      Council    in   1999,     the\n\nAdministrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") held two hearings, at the second\n\nof which a vocational expert (\"VE\") testified.                      The ALJ determined\n\nthat Stephens was \"status post left ankle fracture,\" and had \"a\n\nhistory of alcohol abuse, and borderline intellectual functioning.\"\n\nApplying the sequential analysis set forth in 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520,\n\nsee also Goodermote v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 690\n\nF.2d 5, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1982), the ALJ found that Stephens suffered\n\nfrom   a   severe        impairment   that       was   not    deemed     presumptively\n\ndisabling because it did not meet or equal any impairment found in\n\nthe Listings        of    Impairments,      20   C.F.R.      Part    404,    Subpart   P,\n\nAppendix 1.        The ALJ also determined that, although Stephens had\n\ncertain exertional limitations, he had the residual functional\n\ncapacity (\"RFC\") to return to his \"past relevant work as a janitor,\n\nnews salesperson and car washer,\" and was therefore not disabled.\n\n       Although the ALJ clearly indicated that his ruling was made at\n\nStep Four of the sequential evaluation, he also                        engaged in some\n\nStep Five analysis, further concluding that Stephens had the RFC to\n\n\n                                            2\n\fperform   other    work   identified    by   the   VE,   which   included   the\n\npositions     of   custodian,   hotel      maintenance    person,   packager,\n\nassembler, security guard, counter clerk, surveillance systems\n\nmonitor, cashier and self-service gas station attendant.\n\n     We may set aside a denial of benefits only if it is not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence or if it is based on legal error.\n\nSeavey v. Barnhart, 276 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2001).           \"We must uphold\n\nthe [Commissioner's] findings . . . if a reasonable mind, reviewing\n\nthe evidence in the record as a whole, could accept it as adequate\n\nto support h[er] conclusion.\"          Rodriguez v. Secretary of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., 647 F.2d 218, 222 (1st Cir. 1981); accord Irlanda\n\nOrtiz v. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 955 F.2d 765, 769 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n     Stephens first contends that the ALJ erred in defining his\n\npast relevant work and in concluding that he had the RFC to return\n\nto it.    We agree with Stephens on these two points.            Since the ALJ\n\nconcluded that Stephens' post-onset, temporary work as a car wash\n\nattendant and newspaper seller was too sporadic to qualify as\n\n\"substantial gainful activity,\" see 20 C.F.R. § 404.1575(a), those\n\njobs did not meet the definition of \"past relevant work.\"              See 20\n\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a).      Thus, the ALJ's Step Four analysis should\n\nhave been limited to consideration of whether Stephens had the RFC\n\nto perform his past work as a janitor.               On that question, we\n\nconclude that the ALJ's findings were insufficient to substantiate\n\n\n                                       3\n\fhis determination that Stephens could return to his past work.\n\n       In considering Stephens' RFC, the ALJ concluded that Stephens'\n\nability to stand or walk was limited so that he could not \"be on\n\nhis feet most of the day.\"      However, the only evidence concerning\n\nthe standing or walking requirements of Stephens' past relevant job\n\nconsisted of Stephens' own statements that he was required to be on\n\nhis feet all day; the VE did not discuss, and the ALJ made no\n\nfindings concerning, the specific standing or walking requirements\n\nfor either Stephens' job as he actually performed it or for other\n\nsimilar jobs existing in the economy.             See Social Security Ruling\n\n82-62 (PPS-80), Titles II and XVI: A Disability Claimant's Capacity\n\nto Do Past Relevant Work, In General (S.S.A. 1982), available in\n\n1982 WL 31386; Social Security 82-61 (PPS-72), Titles II and XVI:\n\nPast   Relevant    Work--The   Particular        Job   or   the   Occupation   as\n\nGenerally Performed (S.S.A. 1982), available in 1982 WL 31387.\n\nMoreover, the light-to-medium exertional range, within which the\n\nALJ    concluded   Stephens'   past       work    fell,     generally   requires\n\n\"standing or walking, off and on, for a total of approximately 6\n\nhours of an 8-hour workday,\" Social Security Ruling 83-10 (PPS-\n\n101), Titles II and XVI: Determining Capability to Do Other Work--\n\nThe Medical-Vocational Rules of Appendix 2 (S.S.A. 1983), available\n\nin 1983 WL 31251; see 20 § C.F.R. 404.1567; thus, the ALJ's failure\n\nto distinguish either Stephens' particular job or his job as it is\n\ngenerally performed from this norm make it impossible to conclude\n\n\n                                      4\n\fthat substantial evidence supported the finding that Stephens had\n\nthe   RFC   to    return   to   his   past   work   despite   his   exertional\n\nlimitations.       See Pinto v. Massanari, 249 F.3d 840, 844-45 (9th\n\nCir. 2001); Evans v. Shalala, 21 F.3d 832, 834-35 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\n\n\n      Having concluded that the ALJ's Step Four determination was\n\nnot adequately substantiated, we next consider whether, if the ALJ\n\nhad proceeded to the fifth and final step of the sequential\n\nevaluation, a finding of not disabled would have been compelled in\n\nany event.       See Seavey, 276 F.3d at 11; Ward v. Commissioner of\n\nSocial Security, 211 F.3d 652, 656 (1st Cir. 2000).                  Stephens\n\nargues that, at Step Five, the ALJ would have been required to\n\napply     the   Medical-Vocational     guidelines,    20   C.F.R.   Part   404,\n\nSubpart P, Appendix 2 (\"the Grids\"), and that the applicable Rule\n\nwould have directed a determination of \"disabled.\"             See id., Table\n\n2, Rule 202.01.      However, this argument assumes that Stephens' RFC\n\nwas limited to light work; if he had the RFC to perform medium\n\nwork, the applicable Grid rule would result in a finding of \"not\n\ndisabled.\"       See id., Table 3, Rule 203.11.        If the ALJ's finding\n\nthat Stephens was capable of some medium work is sustainable,\n\nStephens' RFC would fall between two exertional ranges, thereby\n\nrendering the Grids inconclusive.1            See Thomas v. Barnhart, 278\n\n\n      1\n      We note that the ALJ suggested this case would have been\n\"remov[ed] . . . from the [G]rids\" because of Stephens'\nnonexertional impairments; although we agree with the ALJ's\n\n                                        5\n\fF.3d 947, 960 (9th Cir. 2002); Social Security Ruling 83-12 (PPS-\n\n103), Titles II and XVI: Capability to Do Other Work--The Medical-\n\nVocational   Rules   as    a     Framework   for   Evaluating   Exertional\n\nLimitations Within a Range of Work or Between Ranges of Work\n\n(S.S.A. 1983), also available in 1983 WL 31253.\n\n     Medium work is defined as \"work [that] involves lifting no\n\nmore than 50 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of\n\nobjects weighing up to 25 pounds.         If someone can do medium work,\n\nwe determine that he or she can also do sedentary and light work.\"\n\n20 C.F.R. § 404.1567(c).         Here, the ALJ concluded, without much\n\nexplanation, that Stephens was capable of lifting up to fifty\n\npounds despite an examining physician's RFC evaluation which judged\n\nStephens capable of lifting only ten pounds frequently and twenty\n\npounds occasionally.           We do not think the ALJ's reliance on\n\nconclusory   findings     by    non-examining   Disability   Determination\n\nServices physicians, which were unsupported by any analysis or\n\nwritten findings and made well in advance of the RFC evaluation,\n\njustified his discounting of the RFC report.         See Berrios-Lopez v.\n\nSecretary of Health & Human Servs., 951 F.2d 427, 431 (1st Cir.\n\n\nconclusion, this rationale appears to be inconsistent with his\nfinding that Stephens' nonexertional impairments were \"technical\"\nand would not have any significant effect on the job base. Heggarty\nv. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 996 (1st Cir. 1991); Ortiz v. Secretary\nof Health & Human Servs., 890 F.2d 520, 524 (1st Cir. 1989)\n(\"should a nonexertional limitation be found to impose no\nsignificant restriction on the range of work a claimant is\nexertionally able to perform, reliance on the Grid remains\nappropriate\").\n\n                                      6\n\f1991).\n\n     However, from a commonsense point of view, there is sufficient\n\nevidence   in   the   record    to   provide     support    for    the   ALJ's\n\ndetermination that Stephens was capable of lifting more weight than\n\nthe RFC evaluation estimated.        In the first place, the RFC report\n\nprovides   no   explanation    for   the   low   estimation   of    Stephens'\n\ncapacity to lift and indicated that Stephens' prognosis was \"good,\"\n\nwhich suggested that Stephens' condition was expected to continue\n\nto improve.     Moreover, the medical evidence indicates that (1)\n\nStephens' ankle fracture completely healed without complication,\n\n(2) his pain was caused by weather rather than exertion, and (3)\n\nhis pain was controlled by over-the-counter medications.             Although\n\nStephens suggests that reading the evidence in this way constitutes\n\nan impermissible lay interpretation of raw medical data, see Perez\n\nv. Secretary of Health & Human Servs., 958 F.2d 445, 446 (1st Cir.\n\n1991), this prohibition does not apply where the medical evidence\n\nshows relatively little physical impairment.               Manso-Pizarro v.\n\nSecretary of Health & Human Servs., 76 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nIn such a case, \"an ALJ permissibly can render a commonsense\n\njudgment about functional capacity even without a physician's\n\nassessment.\"    Id.\n\n     To the extent Stephens challenges the ALJ's determination that\n\nStephens' complaints of disabling pain were not entirely credible,\n\nwe see no error; the ALJ's conclusion is          adequately supported by\n\n\n                                     7\n\fthe evidence cited above as well as Stephens' testimony admitting\n\nthat he lost his last permanent position due to a lay off rather\n\nthan his injury; that he worked subsequent to the alleged onset\n\ndate; and that he had a fairly active daily routine.     The ALJ cited\n\nthis evidence and made specific findings supporting his decision to\n\ndiscount Stephens' complaints.      See DaRosa v. Secretary of Health\n\n& Human Servs., 803 F.2d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 1986); Avery v. Secretary\n\nof Health & Human Servs., 797 F.2d 19, 29 (1st Cir. 1986).            In\n\nlight of this evidence, we think that the lack of affirmative\n\ncomment on Stephens' ability to lift suggests that no functional\n\nlimitation was apparent since, as a matter of commonsense, there is\n\nno obvious reason why someone with a healed ankle fracture would\n\nnot be able to lift or carry fifty pounds.\n\n      Having found that the ALJ soundly concluded that Stephens was\n\ncapable of at least some medium work, the Grids are rendered\n\ninconclusive, and we must decide whether the VE's testimony was\n\nsufficient to support a finding that Stephens was capable of\n\nperforming other work in the economy.     See Thomas, 278 F.3d at 960;\n\nSSR   83-12.   Since   the   VE's   testimony   concerning   other   jobs\n\nspecifically assumed a limitation on standing and walking, and the\n\nspecific occupations he identified, and which the ALJ cited in his\n\nopinion, all allowed for a significant amount of sitting and were\n\npredominantly in the light exertional range, we think that, under\n\nthe substantial evidence standard, the VE's testimony would compel\n\n\n                                    8\n\fthe conclusion that Stephens was capable of doing some work.   See\n\nThomas, 278 F.3d at 960; SSR 83-12.\n\n     Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\nSee Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                9\n\f",

See Social Security Ruling\n\n82-62 (PPS-80), Titles II and XVI: A Disability Claimant's Capacity\n\nto Do Past Relevant Work, In General (S.S.A. 1982), available in\n\n1982 WL 31386; Social Security 82-61 (PPS-72), Titles II and XVI:\n\nPast   Relevant    Work--The   Particular        Job   or   the   Occupation   as\n\nGenerally Performed (S.S.A. 1982), available in 1982 WL 31387.\n\nMoreover, the light-to-medium exertional range, within which the\n\nALJ    concluded   Stephens'   past       work    fell,     generally   requires\n\n\"standing or walking, off and on, for a total of approximately 6\n\nhours of an 8-hour workday,\" Social Security Ruling 83-10 (PPS-\n\n101), Titles II and XVI: Determining Capability to Do Other Work--\n\nThe Medical-Vocational Rules of Appendix 2 (S.S.A. 1983), available\n\nin 1983 WL 31251; see 20 § C.F.R. 404.1567; thus, the ALJ's failure\n\nto distinguish either Stephens' particular job or his job as it is\n\ngenerally performed from this norm make it impossible to conclude\n\n\n                                      4\n\fthat substantial evidence supported the finding that Stephens had\n\nthe   RFC   to    return   to   his   past   work   despite   his   exertional\n\nlimitations.

However, this argument assumes that Stephens' RFC\n\nwas limited to light work; if he had the RFC to perform medium\n\nwork, the applicable Grid rule would result in a finding of \"not\n\ndisabled.\"       See id., Table 3, Rule 203.11.        If the ALJ's finding\n\nthat Stephens was capable of some medium work is sustainable,\n\nStephens' RFC would fall between two exertional ranges, thereby\n\nrendering the Grids inconclusive.1            See Thomas v.

In the first place, the RFC report\n\nprovides   no   explanation    for   the   low   estimation   of    Stephens'\n\ncapacity to lift and indicated that Stephens' prognosis was \"good,\"\n\nwhich suggested that Stephens' condition was expected to continue\n\nto improve.     Moreover, the medical evidence indicates that (1)\n\nStephens' ankle fracture completely healed without complication,\n\n(2) his pain was caused by weather rather than exertion, and (3)\n\nhis pain was controlled by over-the-counter medications.

In\n\nlight of this evidence, we think that the lack of affirmative\n\ncomment on Stephens' ability to lift suggests that no functional\n\nlimitation was apparent since, as a matter of commonsense, there is\n\nno obvious reason why someone with a healed ankle fracture would\n\nnot be able to lift or carry fifty pounds.\n\n      Having found that the ALJ soundly concluded that Stephens was\n\ncapable of at least some medium work, the Grids are rendered\n\ninconclusive, and we must decide whether the VE's testimony was\n\nsufficient to support a finding that Stephens was capable of\n\nperforming other work in the economy.     See Thomas, 278 F.3d at 960;\n\nSSR   83-12.   Since   the   VE's   testimony   concerning   other   jobs\n\nspecifically assumed a limitation on standing and walking, and the\n\nspecific occupations he identified, and which the ALJ cited in his\n\nopinion, all allowed for a significant amount of sitting and were\n\npredominantly in the light exertional range, we think that, under\n\nthe substantial evidence standard, the VE's testimony would compel\n\n\n                                    8\n\fthe conclusion that Stephens was capable of doing some work.
