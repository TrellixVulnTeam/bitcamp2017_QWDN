Dennis Saylor IV, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Sean J. Gallagher for appellant.\n     Joseph L. Tehan, Jr. with whom Jackie Cowin and Kopelman and\nPaige, P.C. were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        December 16, 2008\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.       Timothy LaFrenier appeals from the\n\nentry of summary judgment on his civil rights claims against the\n\nTown of Townsend, Massachusetts and two police officers.                    The\n\nappeal raises again the familiar but erroneous claim that summary\n\njudgment may be defeated on an argument of mere disbelief of the\n\nmoving party's evidence.\n\n            The claims arose from events midday on June 15, 2001 when\n\nTownsend police found LaFrenier sitting in his car, pulled over by\n\nthe side of the road.         He was admittedly disoriented, confused,\n\nunresponsive, and uncooperative.         It turned out the cause of this\n\nwas that LaFrenier was sick and on medications, but this was not\n\nknown until after the key events which led to this case.             A request\n\nfrom   a   responding    officer,     defendant    Mary   Anne   Kinirey,    to\n\nLaFrenier to step out of the car resulted in LaFrenier's struggling\n\nwith two officers, Kinirey and Daniel Morrison.             This in turn led\n\nto criminal charges against him of assault and battery on two\n\npolice     officers,    resisting     arrest,     and   disorderly   conduct.\n\nUltimately    the   charges    were   either    dismissed   or   resulted    in\n\nLaFrenier's acquittal in March 2002.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          More than two years later, LaFrenier brought suit in\n\nfederal court asserting federal and state claims1 against the\n\ndefendants.\n\n          Defendants moved for summary judgment, offering evidence\n\nof the officers' version of the events.   Plaintiff said he had no\n\nmemory of the key events and so offered no contradictory evidence.\n\nHe sought to forestall summary judgment on the basis that the\n\nofficers' accounts of the events were not believable.\n\n          The court granted judgment on the merits, extensively\n\ndiscussing the facts in its thoughtful opinion.       LaFrenier v.\n\nKinirey, 478 F. Supp. 2d 126 (D. Mass. 2007).   The court found it\n\nunnecessary to reach defendants' qualified immunity defenses.   For\n\nour purposes, we merely summarize the court's conclusions.      The\n\ncourt entered judgment on the wrongful arrest claims under both\n\nstate and federal law finding there was probable cause to make an\n\narrest for assault and battery on the officers, for resisting\n\narrest, and for disorderly conduct.\n\n\n\n     1\n          The pertinent allegations of the complaint are that (1)\nOfficers Morrison and Kinirey violated 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 by making\na false arrest, by using excessive force, by failing to provide\nmedical treatment, and by lodging and prosecuting false charges\nagainst LaFrenier; (2) all defendants violated LaFrenier's civil\nrights pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, ยง 11I by force,\nintimidation, and violence; (3) the Town of Townsend violated Mass.\nGen. Laws ch. 258, ยง 2 through its negligence; (4) Morrison and\nKinirey committed assaults and batteries against LaFrenier; (5)\nMorrison and Kinirey committed a false arrest against LaFrenier;\nand (6) Morrison and Kinirey committed abuse of process against\nLaFrenier. LaFrenier asked for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n                               -3-\n\f          On the excessive force claim, the court concluded that it\n\nwas undisputed that LaFrenier actively resisted arrest, that he\n\nattempted to flee, that he posed a risk to himself and to others,\n\nand that the force the officers used was not excessive.\n\n          On the medical treatment claim, the court concluded there\n\nwas   absolutely   no    evidence   the   officers   were    deliberately\n\nindifferent to LaFrenier's medical needs.\n\n          On the false prosecution charge against the two officers,\n\nthe court concluded there was both probable cause for the arrest\n\nand no showing of improper motive.        There was also no evidence to\n\nsupport the pendent state claims.\n\n          The appeal sounds a single key theme: that summary\n\njudgment could not be granted because LaFrenier is entitled to\n\nattack the credibility of the officers'      testimony.     As a matter of\n\nlaw this is incorrect.       The Supreme Court held in Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986), that a plaintiff may not\n\ndefeat summary judgment by merely asserting that the jury might,\n\nand legally could, disbelieve the defendant's denial.          See id. at\n\n252; see also, e.g., Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Goldstone & Sudalter,\n\nP.C., 128 F.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"A party cannot create an\n\nissue for the trier of fact 'by relying on the hope that the jury\n\nwill not trust the credibility of witnesses.'\" (quoting Dragon v.\n\nR.I. Dep't of Mental Health, Retardation & Hosps., 936 F.2d 32, 35\n\n(1st Cir. 1991)));      Moreau v. Local Union No. 247, Int'l Bhd. of\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fFiremen, 851 F.2d 516, 519 (1st Cir. 1988); Schoonejongen v.\n\nCurtiss-Wright Corp., 143 F.3d 120, 129-30 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\n          Here, LaFrenier agrees he has no affirmative evidence\n\ncontrary to the defendants' evidence.    He argues both that there\n\nare such inherent inconsistencies in the officers' testimony and\n\nthat the officers' testimony is so inherently unbelievable as to\n\nallow him to get to a jury.   This case does not present the limits\n\nof the viability of those assumptions because neither assumption is\n\nsupported by the record.\n\n          We agree with the district court that there was nothing\n\ninherently unbelievable about either officer's testimony.    For his\n\nclaim of inconsistency, LaFrenier relies on the fact that one\n\nofficer's police report did not provide a complete report of all of\n\nthe events or all of the details of plaintiff's assault on her.\n\nHowever, a review of the officer's deposition testimony and the\n\npolice report reveals that there are no inconsistencies between the\n\ntwo.   The deposition testimony adds more details to the account\n\ncontained in the police report, but nothing in those details is\n\ninconsistent.   Further, the district court took these \"omissions\"\n\ninto account and correctly concluded that nonetheless, on the\n\nversion of the undisputed facts most favorable to LaFrenier,\n\ndefendants were entitled to summary judgment.   The court did not,\n\nas LaFrenier argues, presume the truth of the officers' accounts;\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\frather it looked to whether plaintiff had put material facts in\n\ndispute.\n\n           LaFrenier's last argument is that summary judgment must\n\nbe denied based on the fact that the police officers were not\n\n\"disinterested\" witnesses.    He bases this on a reading of certain\n\nlanguage in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133\n\n(2000), which states:\n\n           [T]he court should give credence to the\n           evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as\n           that \"evidence supporting the moving party\n           that is uncontradicted and unimpeached, at\n           least to the extent that that evidence comes\n           from disinterested witnesses.\"\n\nId. at 151 (quoting 9A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure ยง 2529, at 300 (2d ed. 1995)).       LaFrenier reads Reeves as\n\nprecluding   summary   judgment    where    the   movant   relies   on   the\n\ntestimony of interested witnesses.         We have rejected that reading\n\nof Reeves in this circuit.2       See Dennis v. Osram Sylvania, Inc.,\n\n___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 5158868, at * 3 (1st Cir. Dec. 10, 2008) (\"At\n\nsummary judgment we need not exclude all interested testimony,\n\nspecifically testimony that is uncontradicted by the nonmovant.\");\n\nRonda-Perez v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria-P.R., 404 F.3d 42,\n\n45-46 (1st Cir. 2005) (refusing to accept argument that witnesses\n\n\n\n     2\n          While the court did not reach the qualified immunity\ndefense asserted by the defendants, we note that qualified immunity\nturns on assessing the situation from the point of view of an\nobjectively reasonable officer and that defendants would be\nentitled to immunity in any event.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fconnected      with   the   defendant    should   be    \"deemed    unworthy    of\n\nbelief\").      Other circuits have also rejected that reading.             See,\n\ne.g., Lauren W. ex rel. Jean W. v. DeFlaminis, 480 F.3d 259, 271-72\n\n(3d Cir. 2007); Luh v. J.M. Huber Corp., 211 F. App'x 143, 146 (4th\n\nCir. 2006); Stratienko v. Cordis Corp., 429 F.3d 592, 597-98 (6th\n\nCir. 2005).     A similar rule is applied at trial.          Quintana-Ruiz v.\n\nHyundai Motor Corp., 303 F.3d 62, 76 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"Juries . . .\n\nmay   reject    uncontradicted,    unimpeached         testimony   when   it   is\n\nimprobable, inherently contradictory, riddled with omissions, or\n\ndelivered in a manner giving rise to doubts.             There must otherwise\n\nbe some affirmative evidence in the record to put the witness's\n\ncredibility in doubt.\"        (citations omitted)).\n\n            Plaintiff's citation to Bazan v. Hidalgo County, 246 F.3d\n\n481 (5th Cir. 2001), does not help.           See id. at 491-93 (holding a\n\ngenuine dispute over material facts existed where the only evidence\n\ncame from the uncorroborated testimony of the defendant police\n\nofficer, the sole survivor of a shooting, and where the record cast\n\ndoubt on his credibility). The Fifth Circuit has applied its Bazan\n\nholding narrowly and refused to allow a nonmovant to defeat summary\n\njudgment where, as here, he or she \"points to nothing in the\n\nsummary judgment record that casts doubt on the veracity of the\n\n[witness's] version of the events.\" Aujla v. Hinds County, No. 01-\n\n60699, 2003 WL 1098839, at * 4 (5th Cir.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2007). The court found it unnecessary to reach defendants' qualified immunity defenses. For our purposes, we merely summarize the court's conclusions. The court entered judgment on the wrongful arrest claims under both state and federal law finding there was probable cause to make an arrest for assault and battery on the officers, for resisting arrest, and for disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p>On the excessive force claim, the court concluded that it was undisputed that LaFrenier actively resisted arrest, that he attempted to flee, that he posed a risk to himself and to others, and that the force the officers used was not excessive.</p>\n<p>On the medical treatment claim, the court concluded there was absolutely no evidence the officers were deliberately indifferent to LaFrenier's medical needs.</p>\n<p>On the false prosecution charge against the two officers, the court concluded there was both probable cause for the arrest and no showing of improper motive. There was also no evidence to support the pendent state claims.</p>\n<p>The appeal sounds a single key theme: that summary judgment could not be granted because LaFrenier is entitled to attack the credibility of the officers' testimony. As a matter of law this is incorrect. The Supreme Court held in <i>Anderson v.

He argues both that there are such inherent inconsistencies in the officers' testimony and that the officers' testimony is so inherently unbelievable as to allow him to get to a jury. This case does not present the limits of the viability of those assumptions because neither <span class=\"star-pagination\">*168</span> assumption is supported by the record.</p>\n<p>We agree with the district court that there was nothing inherently unbelievable about either officer's testimony. For his claim of inconsistency, LaFrenier relies on the fact that one officer's police report did not provide a complete report of all of the events or all of the details of plaintiff's assault on her. However, a review of the officer's deposition testimony and the police report reveals that there are no inconsistencies between the two. The deposition testimony adds more details to the account contained in the police report, but nothing in those details is inconsistent. Further, the district court took these \"omissions\" into account and correctly concluded that nonetheless, on the version of the undisputed facts most favorable to LaFrenier, defendants were entitled to summary judgment. The court did not, as LaFrenier argues, presume the truth of the officers' accounts; rather it looked to whether plaintiff had put material facts in dispute.</p>\n<p>LaFrenier's last argument is that summary judgment must be denied based on the fact that the police officers were not \"disinterested\" witnesses. He bases this on a reading of certain language in <i>Reeves v.
