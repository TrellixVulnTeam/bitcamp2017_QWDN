Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                       Selya, Lynch and Howard,\n                            Circuit Judges.\n\f     Tom Marcelle, with whom Lepizzera & Laprocina and Michael J.\nLepizzera, Jr. were on brief, for plaintiff.\n     Carolyn A.

Curley and\nOliverio & Marcaccio were on brief, for defendants.\n\n\n                         June 16, 2005\n\f              SELYA, Circuit Judge. These interlocutory appeals follow\n\nthe district court's denial of preliminary injunctive relief.                           We\n\nhave jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).\n\n              The    facts       are    straightforward        (although      the     legal\n\nimplications are complex).               The plaintiff, Stephen P. Laffey, is\n\nthe mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island.                         A local radio station,\n\ncorporately owned, offered Mayor Laffey the opportunity to host a\n\nweekly talk show. The mayor declined any remuneration but accepted\n\nthe free air time and began a string of weekly appearances.\n\n              The president of the Cranston City Council — a political\n\nrival of the mayor — filed a complaint with the Rhode Island State\n\nBoard of Elections (the Board).                 The complaint alleged that Mayor\n\nLaffey,    who      has    not    yet     announced     his    plans    for     the    2006\n\nelections,1 was receiving an in-kind corporate contribution from\n\nthe   radio    station       in   violation       of   the    Rhode    Island    Campaign\n\nContributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-\n\n25-10.1.         The      Board    held     a   hearing,       found    the     complaint\n\nmeritorious, and ordered the mayor to cease and desist from hosting\n\nthe talk show.\n\n              The mayor complied, but brought suit against the members\n\nof the Board (in their official capacities) in the federal district\n\n\n\n      1\n      The mayor is widely rumored to be a candidate for either\nfederal or state-wide office. Although he has not discouraged that\nspeculation, he has yet to announce or declare his candidacy for\nany particular office.\n\n                                            -3-\n\fcourt.     He claimed, inter alia, that the Board's order abridged\n\nrights secured to him by the First Amendment.    The district court,\n\nruling from the bench on May 17, 2005, refused to enjoin the\n\noperation of the Board's order.        These appeals followed.2   We\n\nconsolidated them and granted expedited review.\n\n            The briefing revealed that the Board's decision, and to\n\nsome extent the embedded constitutional issues, rested on uncertain\n\nquestions of state law — a matter to which we shall return.       At\n\noral argument on June 9, 2005, we suggested that the parties might\n\nwish to cooperate in obtaining answers to these state law questions\n\nfrom the Rhode Island Supreme Court and that, in the interim, the\n\nBoard might wish to suspend the operation of its cease and desist\n\norder.   Mayor Laffey's counsel readily agreed to this proposal and\n\nthe Board's counsel quite reasonably asked for time to allow the\n\nBoard to consider it.    We are now advised that the Board met on\n\nJune 13, 2005, and accepted the proposal.        It has stayed the\n\noperation of the cease and desist order pending resolution of the\n\npertinent state law questions.    We applaud the commitment to fair\n\nplay and the orderly administration of justice that this decision\n\nevinces.\n\n            The parties' agreement renders these appeals moot, but\n\ndoes not dissipate the underlying controversy.      See 13A Charles\n\n\n     2\n      There are two appeals. Mayor Laffey appeals from the denial\nof relief.    The Board cross-appeals from the district court's\nrefusal to dismiss the action on abstention grounds.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fAlan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 3533.2 (2d\n\ned. 1984) (\"A partial settlement moots the issues involved in the\n\nsettlement, but not those that the parties did not intend to\n\nsettle.\") (collecting cases).\n\n            The principal issue in this case — whether the state\n\ncampaign finance law, as applied to these facts, violates the First\n\nAmendment — remains unresolved.        That issue, in turn, depends to\n\nsome degree on significant and unsettled state law questions\n\nrelated to the extent of the Board's enforcement authority and the\n\nscope and meaning of Rhode Island's campaign finance statute\n\n(including, but not limited to, the meaning of terms such as\n\n\"candidate\" and \"in-kind contribution\").        The parties have agreed,\n\nand   we   concur,   that   these   questions   should   be   answered   as\n\nexpeditiously as possible by the state supreme court. See Noviello\n\nv. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 91 (1st Cir. 2005) (explaining that\n\n\"the highest court of a state is . . . the final arbiter of state-\n\nlaw questions\").     Only then can a federal court rule intelligently\n\non the constitutional claims.3\n\n            To implement the parties' agreement, we remand this case\n\nto the district court.      We note that several abstention doctrines\n\nappear to have potential relevance to the proceedings.         See, e.g.,\n\nColo. River Water Conserv. Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800\n\n\n      3\n      Indeed, such clarification may, depending on what the Rhode\nIsland Supreme Court decides, render some or all of the\nconstitutional issues moot.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f(1976); R.R. Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941); see also\n\nMaymó-Meléndez v. Alvarez-Ramírez, 364 F.3d 27 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(applying abstention principles of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37\n\n(1971), to coercive administrative proceedings).          If the district\n\ncourt determines that one or more of these doctrines apply, it may\n\nabstain from an immediate exercise of jurisdiction, stay the\n\nfederal proceeding, and allow the parties to resolve the pertinent\n\nstate law questions in the state court system.\n\n          Of course, the district court's abstention decision may\n\nbe influenced by the availability vel non of state court review.\n\nSee Pullman, 312 U.S. at 501 (suggesting that abstention is not\n\nappropriate upon a \"showing that . . . obvious methods for securing\n\na definitive ruling in the state courts cannot be pursued\").            The\n\nBoard has suggested that state court review can be achieved should\n\nthe mayor file a petition for writ of certiorari to the Rhode\n\nIsland Supreme   Court,   asking   that   tribunal   to   pass   upon   the\n\nvalidity of the Board's cease and desist order.           See Van Daam v.\n\nDiPrete, 560 A.2d 953, 954 (R.I. 1989) (per curiam).        The state law\n\nquestions embedded in this case are, in the Van Daam court's\n\nphrase, \"substantial,\" id., and such review may well be available.\n\nIn the spirit of the parties' agreement, the district court may\n\ndirect the mayor to file such a petition.\n\n          If such review is not available and other conventional\n\nroutes to the state supreme court appear for any reason to be\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fprecluded, the district court may certify the appropriate state law\n\nquestions to the Rhode Island Supreme Court.       See R.I. Sup. Ct. R.\n\nApp. P. 6.    Upon its receipt of the state supreme court's response,\n\nthe district court may proceed to adjudicate the constitutional\n\nissues unless the state supreme court's resolution of the state law\n\nquestions or a change in circumstances renders such an adjudication\n\nunnecessary.\n\n             Let us be perfectly clear. These are merely suggestions.\n\nWe have complete confidence in the district court and, in the final\n\nanalysis, it is for the district court to determine how best to\n\nproceed.     Nothing contained in this opinion is intended to cabin\n\nthe district court's discretion.\n\n             We need go no further.     The parties' agreement disposes\n\nof any live controversy related to these appeals. Consequently, we\n\ndismiss the appeals as moot and remand the case for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion and with the parties'\n\nagreement (which we deem binding upon them).       Each side shall bear\n\nits own costs.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",
