The BIA affirmed\nthat decision without opinion. Keo thereafter sought review of the\nBIA's determination in this court, claiming primarily that its\ndenial of his application was not supported by substantial\nevidence. This court affirmed the BIA decision on August 22, 2003,\nconcluding that the record did not compel a conclusion contrary to\nthat reached by the IJ. Keo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 57 (1st Cir.\n2003).\n\n     On September 19, 2003, Keo filed with this court a motion to\nstay deportation. According to the motion, Judge Ragno had been\nplaced on administrative leave on August 4, 2003, pending the\nresolution of several allegations of bias and judicial misconduct.\nGiven the apparent severity of some of these claims, we issued an\norder on September 22, 2003, directing the respondent to file a\nresponse to Keo's motion and directing Keo to supplement his motion\nwith specific examples of how Judge Ragno's alleged bias manifested\nitself in his hearing. Both parties filed their responses by the\nallotted date of September 30, 2003. Petitioner also filed a\npetition for rehearing. Mandate of this court does not issue until\nresolution of a petition for rehearing is decided. See Fed. R.\nApp. Proc. 41(d)(1).\n\n     At the request of the Court the respondent has now made two\n\ffilings in response to Keo's claims of bias. On consideration of\nall of the materials the Court has determined that Keo has not met\nhis burden under the four-part test of Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344\nF.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2003) in order to obtain a stay. Accordingly, the\nmotion for stay is denied. The petition for panel rehearing is\nalso denied.\n\n     We repeat our earlier    conclusion,   the   order   permitting\nvoluntary departure stands.\n\n                              By the Court:\n                              RICHARD CUSHING DONOVAN, Clerk\n\n\n\n                              By: /s/\n                              Mark R.
