Francisco     A. Besosa, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                     Boudin, Selya, and Stahl,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     María Soledad Ramírez-Becerra and Maria Soledad Ramirez-\nBecerra Law Office, on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Germán A.\nRieckehoff, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-\nVélez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                          December 17, 2008\n\f          Per Curiam.        Defendant pled guilty to one count of\n\nconspiring with others to possess with intent to distribute 50\n\ngrams or more of crack cocaine within a public housing project and\n\nwithin 1,000 feet of a public school, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 841(a)(1) & (b)(1)(A), 846, and 860, and was sentenced to 240\n\nmonths' imprisonment, near the bottom of the guideline range as\n\ncomputed by the district court.\n\n          On appeal, defendant argues, first, that he was not\n\nadequately   informed   of   the   consequences   of   his   guilty   plea,\n\nparticularly the maximum penalty for the offense to which he pled\n\nguilty. It is true that the district court misspoke at the change-\n\nof-plea hearing when it stated that the maximum penalty for that\n\noffense was 20 years under 21 U.S.C. § 860; in fact, the maximum\n\npenalty was life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), as\n\naccurately stated in the Presentence Report.           However, defendant\n\nnever sought below, and does not seek now, to vacate his guilty\n\nplea and go to trial.1       Rather, in the district court, his only\n\n\n     1\n      Although he stated both at the change-of-plea hearing and at\nthe sentencing hearing that he \"felt pressured\" into entering a\nstraight plea as opposed to a negotiated plea, there is nothing in\nthe record to indicate that he felt pressured to plead guilty\nrather than stand trial.\n\n     If defendant were asking this court to vacate his guilty plea,\nwe would review such an unpreserved claim only for plain error and\nwould find none since the record contains no indication, much less\na \"reasonable probability,\" that defendant would have decided to go\nto trial rather than plead guilty if he had been correctly informed\nof the maximum penalty for his offense at the time of his guilty\nplea. United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 524 U.S. 74, 83 (2004).\n\n                                    -2-\n\fhesitation about pleading guilty was based on his persistent hope\n\n(despite the repeated advice of his counsel and the prosecutor to\n\nthe contrary) that he could belatedly accept the government's prior\n\noffer of a plea agreement (which defendant had previously rejected\n\nand the government had since withdrawn), rather than enter a\n\nstraight plea.\n\n            In this court, defendant's only dispute is with the\n\nlength of the sentence imposed, which was apparently higher than he\n\nhoped to receive when he pled guilty.              That, of course, is no basis\n\nfor challenging the validity of his plea, United States v. Mercedes\n\nMercedes,   428    F.3d    355,   359   (1st       Cir.   2005),   much   less   his\n\nsentence.   \"Defendants cannot have it both ways--one way when they\n\nplead and another when they come to sentence, unless they express\n\na willingness to have the pleas set aside.\"                 Dawson v. Wainwright,\n\n440 F.2d 1259, 1262 (5th Cir. 1971).\n\n            Moreover, any defect in defendant's plea colloquy had no\n\nbearing on his ultimate sentence.                  The drug quantity used to\n\ncalculate defendant's guideline range was based not on the amount\n\nof drugs to which he pled guilty but on the evidence presented by\n\nthe   government   at     sentencing.         Defendant     pled   guilty   to   the\n\nindictment, which charged him with conspiring to possess with\n\nintent to distribute \"50 grams or more of crack cocaine\" but did\n\nnot   specify   the     precise   amount      of    drugs    involved.      Because\n\ndefendant disputed the amount of drugs found attributable to him in\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe presentence report, the government called an agent involved in\n\nthe underlying investigation to testify on that issue at the\n\nsentencing hearing.       Based on the agent's testimony, the court\n\nfound that the total amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy was\n\n3.8 kilograms.     Defendant does not challenge the factual accuracy\n\nof that calculation on appeal.\n\n            Although defendant argued below that he should be held\n\naccountable for only half of that amount (based on the agent's\n\ntestimony that defendant shared leadership of the drug point in\n\nquestion with another defendant), the court found it unnecessary to\n\nresolve that issue since the base offense level, 36, would have\n\nbeen the same whether the drug amount attributable to defendant\n\nwere 3.8 or 1.9 kilograms.        See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(2) (applying\n\nlevel 36 to at least 1.5 but less than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine\n\nbase).    Defendant acknowledged as much below and does not press\n\nthis issue on appeal either.\n\n            Defendant's only remaining argument is that the district\n\ncourt    failed   to   give   adequate   weight   to   certain    purportedly\n\nmitigating sentencing factors--namely, defendant's age (21), his\n\nlimited education (11th grade), his upbringing in a drug-infested\n\nenvironment, and his lack of a criminal record.                  However, the\n\nrecord indicates that the district court did consider those factors\n\nbut found them outweighed by the seriousness of the offense--large-\n\nscale drug trafficking in plain view of young children on a\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fbasketball court in a public housing project and near a public\n\nmiddle   school--and   the   resulting   need   for   punishment   and\n\ndeterrence.     Given the deference due to the district court's\n\nbalancing of the applicable factors, United States v. Deppe, 509\n\nF.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2007); United States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194,\n\n205 (1st Cir. 2006), particularly where, as here, the chosen\n\nsentence falls within the guideline range, Rita v. United States,\n\n127 S. Ct. 2456, 2463 (2007), we decline to second-guess its\n\nplausible reasoning or its defensible result, United States v.\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc).\n\n            Accordingly, the district court's judgment is summarily\n\naffirmed.
