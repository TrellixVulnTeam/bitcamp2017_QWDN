Kravchuk, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                   Torruella, Selya and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Donald Grey Lowry on brief for appellant.\n     Bernard J. Kubetz on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                            October 6, 2006\n\f             Per Curiam.      Plaintiff-appellant Lawrence A. Rosendahl\n\nwas injured in a collision between his motorcycle and an automobile\n\ndriven by defendant-appellee Diane M. Brangwynne on May 29, 2003.\n\nHis suit in Maine Superior Court was removed to the United States\n\nDistrict     Court   for    the   District    of    Maine   based   on   diversity\n\njurisdiction.        There, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the\n\ndefense, based on its finding that plaintiff's fault was at least\n\nequal   to    defendant's     fault   within       the   intendment   of   Maine's\n\ncomparative negligence statute.              Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 14, ยง 156.\n\nPlaintiff moved for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the\n\nverdict or, in the alternative, a new trial.                 The district court\n\ndenied his motion.         This appeal followed.\n\n             The evidence, viewed in the light most supportive of the\n\ndefense verdict, showed that, at a time immediately preceding the\n\naccident, the plaintiff was traveling down a public road behind a\n\npickup truck.     When the road widened, he moved one lane to the left\n\nof the pickup and maintained a position close to the pickup's rear\n\nleft quarter panel (in the driver's blind spot).                He continued in\n\nthis position even as he approached a parking lot entrance/exit\n\npoint on the right side of the road, at which exiting cars were\n\nqueued.      His position made him less visible to cars leaving the\n\nlot.    The plaintiff was blind in his right eye, and his left eye\n\nprovided only 48 degrees of peripheral vision on his right side.\n\nIn all events, the plaintiff's position impeded him from scanning\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fto the right even if he were to turn his head.\n\n          Meanwhile, the defendant had come to a stop in her\n\nvehicle at the threshold of the exit from the parking lot.       She\n\nlooked both ways along the road before starting to pull out, but\n\nfailed to see the plaintiff on his motorcycle.      She crossed into\n\nthe plaintiff's path; he saw her for the first time at that moment\n\nand applied his brakes.   His motorcycle collided with the side of\n\nthe defendant's car, and he flew over the top of the vehicle.    Even\n\nat the moment of impact, the defendant did not see the plaintiff or\n\nrealize that she had collided with a motorcycle.\n\n          At the time of the collision, the plaintiff held a\n\nrecently-expired temporary practice permit for his motorcycle,\n\nissued by the State of Florida.    The plaintiff had failed a road-\n\nskills licensing test in Florida.       He also had read a manual on\n\nmotorcycle riding issued by the State of Florida, which contained\n\nsubstantial material on safety precautions (including safe road\n\npositioning).\n\n          The plaintiff submits that, as a matter of law, the\n\nrecord shows that he was not negligent in any way that bore a\n\ncausal connection to the accident.      He specifically contends that\n\nan attribution of negligence to his choice of road positioning is\n\n\"unduly burdensome and inherently impracticable.\"\n\n          We understand that, as a general matter, a driver having\n\nthe legal right of way may assume that other drivers will respect\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fhis right of way until he has notice of facts to the contrary.   See\n\nMoore v. Fenton, 289 A.2d 698, 706-708 (Me. 1972).      At the same\n\ntime, however, \"the benefits of the existence of a legal right of\n\nway are conferred not absolutely but are enjoyed in relation to the\n\ncorrelative generalized doctrine that reasonable care must be\n\nexercised in particular and appropriate attendant circumstances.\"\n\nId.   In this case, the defendant was fully cognizant of the fact\n\nthat vehicles traveling along the road had the right of way and\n\nacted accordingly by stopping her car and looking both ways before\n\nproceeding.   She left her place of safety - the parking lot - only\n\nbecause she did not see the plaintiff.   While the plaintiff could\n\nproceed with a \"degree of faith\" in other drivers' respect for the\n\nrules of the road, id. at 707, he could not claim absolute faith in\n\nthe perceptual acuity of every other driver, especially when he\n\nvoluntarily positioned himself in a hard-to-observe place.       In\n\nthese circumstances, we think that he had a duty to avoid, to the\n\nextent practicable, road positioning that impaired visibility as\n\nbetween his motorcycle and vehicles entering into, or crossing, the\n\nstream of traffic.\n\n          Comparing the degrees of fault between plaintiff and\n\ndefendant in a case like this one is not easy.   The law of Maine is\n\nthat, as \"long as the causal fault of both parties is factually in\n\ndispute, it is the sole prerogative of the jury to determine the\n\ncomparative degrees of fault of each of the parties to a negligence\n\n\n                                -4-\n\faction.\"   Minott v. F. W. Cunningham & Sons, 413 A.2d 1325, 1332\n\n(Me. 1980)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   The\n\njury's determination in this regard was within the bounds of\n\nreason.\n\n           The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
