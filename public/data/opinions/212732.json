Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f             STAHL, Circuit Judge.      Nir Yacovi, the debtor in a\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, appeals a decision approving the settlement\n\nof legal claims held by his estate.      Yacovi also asserts that the\n\nbankruptcy court should have granted his motion to abandon those\n\nclaims.   We affirm.\n\n                         I. Facts & Background\n\n             On October 5, 2005, Yacovi resigned from his position\n\nwith URS Staffing Corporation and/or United Revenue Service, Inc.\n\n(collectively \"URS\") to start his own tax preparation business,\n\nIBTS, Inc., which was to provide services similar to those offered\n\nby his former employer.    Shortly thereafter, URS accused Yacovi of\n\nviolating the employment agreement he had entered into with URS,\n\nand Yacovi retained Peter Finn, an attorney at Rubin and Rudman,\n\nL.L.P. (collectively \"R & R\"), to advise him about this contractual\n\nissue.\n\n             On October 3, 2006, an arbitrator concluded that Yacovi\n\nhad in fact breached the employment agreement and awarded URS\n\n$226,000.1    Although the arbitrator did not find that Yacovi was\n\nprohibited from competing with URS, he concluded that Yacovi\n\nnonetheless violated the agreement by removing, and not timely\n\nreturning after his resignation, documents from URS (including\n\nlists of URS's clients and the fees they paid); retaining the fees\n\n\n     1\n      The agreement specified that \"for any CLIENT lost as a result\nof Employee's breach of Paragraphs 22 through 26, Employee shall\nowe . . . the greater of $2,000.00, or three times the annual gross\nincome derived from such CLIENT.\"       The arbitrator found that\nYacovi's breach caused URS to lose 113 clients.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fgenerated from some tax and financial services he provided while\n\nemployed at URS;          soliciting URS's clients and prospective clients\n\nfor his own benefit prior to resigning; and, after leaving URS,\n\nusing his knowledge of URS's clients' identities and URS's rates\n\n(that is, URS confidential information) to solicit business for\n\nIBTS.        The arbitrator also noted that Yacovi's account of some\n\nfacts lacked credibility.\n\n                  Within weeks of the arbitration decision, Yacovi filed a\n\nvoluntary petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief, and Harold B.\n\nMurphy (\"Trustee\") of Hanify & King, P.C. (\"H & K\") was appointed\n\nas the trustee.           Yacovi's petition listed R & R as holding a claim\n\nfor legal fees and URS as holding a $226,000 claim for the\n\narbitration award.           In early 2007, URS filed a complaint asserting\n\nthat        the   arbitration    award   was     non-dischargeable   in   Yacovi's\n\nbankruptcy because it was the result of fraud as a fiduciary,\n\nembezzlement, and/or larceny.              On March 13, 2008, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt granted URS's motion for summary judgment on this issue. The\n\nfollowing year, the court granted Yacovi a discharge,2 relieved the\n\nTrustee of his responsibilities, and closed the case.\n\n                  However, on May 13, 2009, exactly one month after the\n\ncase was closed, Yacovi filed a motion to reopen the bankruptcy\n\nproceedings          to   list   various    legal     claims   against    R   &   R\n\n\n        2\n      In November 2006, the Trustee filed a \"Report of No\nDistribution,\" explaining that he had \"received no property nor\npaid any money on account of the estate except exempt property, and\ndiligent inquiry having been made . . . there is no nonexempt\nproperty available for distribution to creditors.\"\n\n                                           -3-\n\f(collectively \"malpractice claims\")3 as additional assets of the\n\nestate.    Specifically, Yacovi alleged that R & R had advised him\n\nthat, because the employment agreement lacked a non-compete clause\n\ncovering his post-employment activity, he could operate IBTS and\n\nservice URS's clients.          In a complaint he sought to pursue against\n\nR & R, Yacovi contended that a lawyer with appropriate experience\n\nexercising the requisite standard of care, \"would have advised\n\n[him] . . . that any services provided to clients of [URS] would\n\nmost definitely result in expensive litigation . . . [and] that\n\nthere was a very real possibility in such litigation that there may\n\nbe   an   adverse    finding     against    him.\"      Yacovi     moved   for   the\n\nbankruptcy court to abandon the malpractice claims or, in the\n\nalternative, \"administer this asset to allow him to seek a recovery\n\nof [the arbitration award].\"\n\n               On June 24, 2009, the bankruptcy court granted Yacovi's\n\nmotion    to    reopen,   but    denied    his    motion   to   abandon   without\n\nprejudice.        Accordingly,      the   Trustee    began     investigating    the\n\nmalpractice claims and requested all relevant documents in Yacovi's\n\npossession.         The   Trustee    also       successfully    applied   to    the\n\nbankruptcy court to have H & K employed as his own counsel to,\n\namong other things, advise on the merits of the malpractice claims.\n\n               On September 29, 2009, the Trustee moved for approval of\n\na settlement he had reached with R & R.             In exchange for the estate\n\nreleasing all claims against R & R, the settlement required R & R\n\n      3\n      These claims were breach of contract/warranty, legal\nmalpractice, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fto pay $25,000 and waive any claims it may have had against the\n\nestate.   In his motion to approve, the Trustee asserted that his\n\ninvestigation of the malpractice claims consisted of the following:\n\ndiscussing the claims and defenses with Yacovi's counsel and with\n\nR & R, reviewing the arbitration opinion (which included a detailed\n\nanalysis of the employment agreement), reviewing filings in URS's\n\nstate court petition to confirm the arbitration award, reviewing\n\nYacovi's proposed complaint against R & R, and reviewing Yacovi's\n\nletter demanding relief from R & R for the purported malpractice.\n\nBased on this work, the Trustee believed that there was a \"real\n\nrisk\" that litigating the malpractice claims would be unsuccessful,\n\nand therefore concluded that the proposed settlement was in the\n\nbest interest of the estate.          The Trustee explained that the\n\narbitrator had found that the employment agreement did not prohibit\n\nYacovi from competing with URS, and therefore it would be difficult\n\nto prove that advising Yacovi about IBTS's ability to compete with\n\nURS constituted negligence or was the cause of the arbitration\n\naward.    Moreover,   the   Trustee   found   \"little   support   for   the\n\nallegation\" that R & R told Yacovi that he could solicit URS's\n\ncustomers without running afoul of the agreement.\n\n          Yacovi opposed the motion to approve, arguing that the\n\nTrustee's investigation was inadequate and consisted primarily of\n\ndiscussions with R & R.     Although acknowledging that the Trustee\n\nprocured the relevant documents, Yacovi's counsel swore in an\n\naffidavit that he was never consulted by the Trustee about the\n\nmerits of the malpractice claims.       Yacovi's counsel also expressed\n\n                                  -5-\n\fhis willingness to pursue the claims on a contingency basis with a\n\npercentage allocated to the estate, which was an offer he had\n\npreviously proposed in conversations with the Trustee.\n\n          At the conclusion of a hearing held on October 14, 2009,\n\nthe bankruptcy court granted the motion to approve, explaining its\n\ndecision with only a few sentences:\n\n          It's always a tough call when you've got a\n          disputed piece of litigation that the Trustee\n          thinks is not worth pursuing and somebody else\n          thinks is worth pursuing.       My obligation\n          generally speaking is to rely on the expertise\n          of the Trustee. In this particular matter I\n          have no reason to doubt the amount of due\n          diligence Mr. Murphy performed in evaluating\n          the claim. I am going to grant the motion.\n\nThe district court subsequently affirmed.      See In re Yacovi, No.\n\n09-11988, 2010 WL 2106171, at *3 (D. Mass. May 24, 2010).\n\n                          II. Discussion\n\nA.        The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in\n          Approving the Settlement\n\n          \"Bankruptcy   court   orders   endorsing   settlements   are\n\nreviewed for manifest abuse of discretion.\"4    Hicks, Muse & Co. v.\n\n\n     4\n      There may be a question as to whether Yacovi has standing to\npursue this appeal. See Spenlinhauer v. O'Donnell, 261 F.3d 113,\n117-20 (1st Cir. 2001) (discussing bankruptcy code's limitations on\na debtor's appellate standing).      Because neither party briefed\nthis issue and we can dispose of Yacovi's appeal on the merits, we\ndo not address the standing question. Greenwood ex rel. Estate of\nGreenwood v. N.H. Pub. Utils. Comm'n, 527 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.\n2008) (\"This court has consistently interpreted [Steel Co. v.\nCitizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83 (1998)] as applying in its\nstrict form only to issues going to Article III requirements. . .\n. [W]here any concerns over jurisdiction are a matter of statutory\ninterpretation and not an Article III issue, we may bypass the\njurisdictional inquiry.\" (internal citation omitted)).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fBrandt (In re Healthco Int'l, Inc.), 136 F.3d 45, 50 n.5 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).   In deciding whether to approve a settlement pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019, \"The bankruptcy court\n\nessentially is expected to assess and balance the value of the\n\nclaims being compromised against the value of the compromise\n\nproposal.\"   Id. at 50 (internal marks omitted) (quoting Jeffrey v.\n\nDesmond, 70 F.3d 183, 185 (1st Cir. 1995)).       The factors the\n\nbankruptcy court should consider include:\n\n          (i) the probability of success in the\n          litigation   being   compromised;   (ii)   the\n          difficulties, if any, to be encountered in the\n          matter of collection; (iii) the complexity of\n          the litigation involved, and the expense,\n          inconvenience and delay attending it; and,\n          (iv) the paramount interest of the creditors\n          and a proper deference to their reasonable\n          views in the premise.\n\nJeffrey, 70 F.3d at 185; accord Ars Brook, L.L.C. v. Jalbert (In re\n\nServisense.com, Inc.), 382 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          In addition, \"[T]he trustee's judgment is to be accorded\n\nsome deference.\"   In re Healthco Int'l, Inc., 136 F.3d at 50 n.5\n\n(internal marks omitted) (quoting Hill v. Burdick (In re Moorhead\n\nCorp.), 208 B.R. 87, 89 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1997)).           Moreover,\n\n\"'compromises are favored in bankruptcy.'\"   In re Servisense.com,\n\nInc., 382 F.3d at 71 (quoting LeBlanc v. Salem (In re Mailman Steam\n\nCarpet Cleaning Corp.), 212 F.3d 632, 635 (1st Cir. 2000)).      In\n\nshort, \"'The responsibility of the bankruptcy judge, and ours on\n\nreview, is . . . to . . . see whether the settlement falls below\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fthe lowest point in the range of reasonableness.'\"         Id. at 71-72\n\n(quoting In re Healthco Int'l, Inc., 136 F.3d at 51).\n\n          We conclude that the settlement in this case fell within\n\nthe \"range of reasonableness\" and the bankruptcy court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in approving it. To be sure, $25,000 amounted\n\nto only a fraction of the damages5 that Yacovi alleges resulted\n\nfrom what he claims was R & R's malpractice.          Nonetheless, the\n\nsettlement   constituted    a   \"definitive,   concrete   and   immediate\n\nbenefit[]\" that the Trustee reasonably concluded outweighed the\n\nuncertainty and delay of litigation.       See In re Healthco Int'l,\n\nInc., 136 F.3d at 50.      The Trustee was appropriately apprehensive\n\nabout litigating the malpractice claims in light of (1) the fact\n\nthat the arbitrator did not find that the employment agreement\n\nprohibited Yacovi from competing with URS, (2) the arbitrator's\n\njudgment that Yacovi's account of some relevant facts lacked\n\ncredibility, and (3) the dearth of evidence that R & R actually\n\nadvised Yacovi that he could solicit URS's clients without any\n\nlegal repercussions. Although the Trustee made this decision using\n\ncounsel from his own law firm, there is no indication that H & K\n\noffered deficient advice or otherwise undermined the Trustee's\n\nability to analyze the malpractice claims.\n\n          We are mindful of our instruction that a court approving\n\na settlement must set forth its rationale \"in sufficient detail\n\n\n     5\n      Yacovi asserts that the damages include the arbitration\naward, which has a present value, with interest, in excess of\n$300,000.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f[such] that a reviewing court [can] distinguish it from 'mere\n\nboilerplate approval' of the trustee's suggestions.\"             In re Boston\n\n& Providence R.R. Corp., 673 F.2d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1982) (quoting\n\nProtective Comm. for Indep. Stockholders of TMT Trailer Ferry, Inc.\n\nv. Anderson, 390 U.S. 414, 434 (1968)); see also Jeremiah v.\n\nRichardson,   148    F.3d   17,   23    (1st    Cir.   1998)   (\"The     court's\n\nconsideration . . . should demonstrate whether the compromise is\n\nfair and equitable, and whether the claim the debtor is giving up\n\nis outweighed by the advantage to the debtor's estate.\").                In this\n\ncase, the bankruptcy court offered only four sentences to explain\n\nits decision.   Providing a more detailed statement would have been\n\npreferable, and under different circumstances a somewhat succinct\n\nexplanation might prevent affirmance.           However, where, as here, an\n\nexperienced trustee conducts an adequate investigation of the\n\nclaims and offers a satisfactory explanation for his settlement\n\ndecision, the record supports the reasonableness of that decision,\n\nand the bankruptcy court receives briefing on the motion and holds\n\na hearing, a cursory explanation, in and of itself, does not rise\n\nto the level of an abuse of discretion.6                Cf. In re Boston &\n\nProvidence    R.R.   Corp.,   673      F.2d    at   12-13   (remanding    where\n\n\n\n     6\n      This is not to say that a bankruptcy court's failure to\nindependently judge a settlement can be saved by a particularly\npersuasive explanation or thorough investigation by the trustee.\nTo the contrary, we remind bankruptcy courts that they are required\nto independently analyze and judge all proposed settlements before\ngranting approval pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019. See Jeremiah,\n148 F.3d at 23 (noting \"the requirement that the court's judgment\nbe independent\").\n\n                                       -9-\n\f\"trustee's petition and supporting affidavit gave only the most\n\ncursory   description    and   conclusory    evaluation\"   and   the   lower\n\ncourt's \"findings and order do not demonstrate an independent\n\nevaluation\").     Indeed, in the very case this court relied on in\n\nissuing its caution against \"boilerplate approval\" of settlements,\n\nthe Supreme Court acknowledged:\n\n            If . . . the record contained adequate facts\n            to support the decision of the trial court to\n            approve the proposed compromises, a reviewing\n            court would be properly reluctant to attack\n            that action solely because the court failed\n            adequately to set forth its reasons or the\n            evidence on which they were based.        The\n            deficiency in this case, however, is not a\n            merely formal one.\n\nAnderson, 390 U.S. at 437.\n\nB.          Yacovi Waived His Challenge to the Denial of the Motion\n            to Abandon\n\n            In addition to his objection to the settlement, Yacovi\n\ncontends that \"equity demands that the malpractice claims be\n\nabandoned.\"\n\n            On June 24, 2009, the bankruptcy court denied, without\n\nprejudice, Yacovi's motion to abandon. Over three months later, on\n\nSeptember 29, the Trustee filed a motion to approve the settlement.\n\nYacovi filed an opposition brief to this motion, which included two\n\nsentences     again   requesting   that     the   malpractice    claims   be\n\nabandoned.7    After a hearing on October 14, 2009, the bankruptcy\n\n     7\n      These sentences read: \"[A]bandonment of the malpractice claim\nis the only fair, equitable result and is in the best interest of\nthe estate. THEREFORE, Debtor asks that the Motion be denied and\nthat given the Trustee's lack of any interest in seriously pursuing\n\n                                   -10-\n\fcourt granted the Trustee's motion to approve.        The next day,\n\nOctober 15, Yacovi filed a notice of appeal, pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8002(a), characterizing his appeal to\n\nthe district court as \"from the Order entered in this Action on 14\n\nOctober 2009 granting the Motion filed by the Trustee to Approve\n\nSettlement.\"    Also on October 15, Yacovi filed a Statement of\n\nIssues and Designation of Record on Appeal (\"Statement of Issues on\n\nAppeal\").    See Fed. R. Bankr. Pro. 8006.    This filing failed to\n\nmention abandonment and framed the appellate issue solely as\n\n\"[w]hether the Court erred in granting the Motion filed by the\n\nTrustee to Approve [S]ettlement.\"      On appeal, the district court\n\ndeclined to address Yacovi's abandonment argument, saying the\n\nfollowing:\n\n            As set forth in the Debtor's Statement of\n            Issues, the only question on appeal is whether\n            the Bankruptcy Court erred in allowing the\n            Trustee's Motion to Approve . . . . To the\n            extent that the Debtor also seeks to reargue\n            his Motion to Abandon the Malpractice Claim,\n            that issue is not properly before this court.\n            On June 24, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court denied\n            the Debtor's Motion to Abandon . . . . The\n            Debtor did not appeal that Order, and the time\n            to appeal it has since passed.\n\nIn re Yacovi, 2010 WL 2106171, *3.\n\n\nthe malpractice claim that it be abandoned.\"\n\n     Yacovi contends that this passage constituted a cross-motion\nto abandon, and therefore the October 14 settlement approval also\n\"acted as a denial of [that] cross-motion.\" Even if we accept this\ncharacterization of Yacovi's opposition brief, however, it would\nnot explain his failure to mention abandonment in his Statement of\nIssues on Appeal and it would not materially impact our analysis of\nthe waiver question. See infra.\n\n                                -11-\n\f           There is a circuit split about whether the failure to\n\nlist an issue in the statement of issues on appeal pursuant to\n\nBankruptcy Rule 8006 results in a waiver of that issue.

Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme\nCourt of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f             STAHL, Circuit Judge.      Nir Yacovi, the debtor in a\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, appeals a decision approving the settlement\n\nof legal claims held by his estate.      Yacovi also asserts that the\n\nbankruptcy court should have granted his motion to abandon those\n\nclaims.   We affirm.\n\n                         I. Facts & Background\n\n             On October 5, 2005, Yacovi resigned from his position\n\nwith URS Staffing Corporation and/or United Revenue Service, Inc.\n\n(collectively \"URS\") to start his own tax preparation business,\n\nIBTS, Inc., which was to provide services similar to those offered\n\nby his former employer.    Shortly thereafter, URS accused Yacovi of\n\nviolating the employment agreement he had entered into with URS,\n\nand Yacovi retained Peter Finn, an attorney at Rubin and Rudman,\n\nL.L.P. (collectively \"R & R\"), to advise him about this contractual\n\nissue.\n\n             On October 3, 2006, an arbitrator concluded that Yacovi\n\nhad in fact breached the employment agreement and awarded URS\n\n$226,000.1    Although the arbitrator did not find that Yacovi was\n\nprohibited from competing with URS, he concluded that Yacovi\n\nnonetheless violated the agreement by removing, and not timely\n\nreturning after his resignation, documents from URS (including\n\nlists of URS's clients and the fees they paid); retaining the fees\n\n\n     1\n      The agreement specified that \"for any CLIENT lost as a result\nof Employee's breach of Paragraphs 22 through 26, Employee shall\nowe . . . the greater of $2,000.00, or three times the annual gross\nincome derived from such CLIENT.\"       The arbitrator found that\nYacovi's breach caused URS to lose 113 clients.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fgenerated from some tax and financial services he provided while\n\nemployed at URS;          soliciting URS's clients and prospective clients\n\nfor his own benefit prior to resigning; and, after leaving URS,\n\nusing his knowledge of URS's clients' identities and URS's rates\n\n(that is, URS confidential information) to solicit business for\n\nIBTS.        The arbitrator also noted that Yacovi's account of some\n\nfacts lacked credibility.\n\n                  Within weeks of the arbitration decision, Yacovi filed a\n\nvoluntary petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief, and Harold B.\n\nMurphy (\"Trustee\") of Hanify & King, P.C. (\"H & K\") was appointed\n\nas the trustee.           Yacovi's petition listed R & R as holding a claim\n\nfor legal fees and URS as holding a $226,000 claim for the\n\narbitration award.           In early 2007, URS filed a complaint asserting\n\nthat        the   arbitration    award   was     non-dischargeable   in   Yacovi's\n\nbankruptcy because it was the result of fraud as a fiduciary,\n\nembezzlement, and/or larceny.              On March 13, 2008, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt granted URS's motion for summary judgment on this issue. The\n\nfollowing year, the court granted Yacovi a discharge,2 relieved the\n\nTrustee of his responsibilities, and closed the case.\n\n                  However, on May 13, 2009, exactly one month after the\n\ncase was closed, Yacovi filed a motion to reopen the bankruptcy\n\nproceedings          to   list   various    legal     claims   against    R   &   R\n\n\n        2\n      In November 2006, the Trustee filed a \"Report of No\nDistribution,\" explaining that he had \"received no property nor\npaid any money on account of the estate except exempt property, and\ndiligent inquiry having been made . . . there is no nonexempt\nproperty available for distribution to creditors.\"\n\n                                           -3-\n\f(collectively \"malpractice claims\")3 as additional assets of the\n\nestate.    Specifically, Yacovi alleged that R & R had advised him\n\nthat, because the employment agreement lacked a non-compete clause\n\ncovering his post-employment activity, he could operate IBTS and\n\nservice URS's clients.          In a complaint he sought to pursue against\n\nR & R, Yacovi contended that a lawyer with appropriate experience\n\nexercising the requisite standard of care, \"would have advised\n\n[him] . . . that any services provided to clients of [URS] would\n\nmost definitely result in expensive litigation . . . [and] that\n\nthere was a very real possibility in such litigation that there may\n\nbe   an   adverse    finding     against    him.\"      Yacovi     moved   for   the\n\nbankruptcy court to abandon the malpractice claims or, in the\n\nalternative, \"administer this asset to allow him to seek a recovery\n\nof [the arbitration award].\"\n\n               On June 24, 2009, the bankruptcy court granted Yacovi's\n\nmotion    to    reopen,   but    denied    his    motion   to   abandon   without\n\nprejudice.        Accordingly,      the   Trustee    began     investigating    the\n\nmalpractice claims and requested all relevant documents in Yacovi's\n\npossession.         The   Trustee    also       successfully    applied   to    the\n\nbankruptcy court to have H & K employed as his own counsel to,\n\namong other things, advise on the merits of the malpractice claims.\n\n               On September 29, 2009, the Trustee moved for approval of\n\na settlement he had reached with R & R.             In exchange for the estate\n\nreleasing all claims against R & R, the settlement required R & R\n\n      3\n      These claims were breach of contract/warranty, legal\nmalpractice, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fto pay $25,000 and waive any claims it may have had against the\n\nestate.   In his motion to approve, the Trustee asserted that his\n\ninvestigation of the malpractice claims consisted of the following:\n\ndiscussing the claims and defenses with Yacovi's counsel and with\n\nR & R, reviewing the arbitration opinion (which included a detailed\n\nanalysis of the employment agreement), reviewing filings in URS's\n\nstate court petition to confirm the arbitration award, reviewing\n\nYacovi's proposed complaint against R & R, and reviewing Yacovi's\n\nletter demanding relief from R & R for the purported malpractice.\n\nBased on this work, the Trustee believed that there was a \"real\n\nrisk\" that litigating the malpractice claims would be unsuccessful,\n\nand therefore concluded that the proposed settlement was in the\n\nbest interest of the estate.          The Trustee explained that the\n\narbitrator had found that the employment agreement did not prohibit\n\nYacovi from competing with URS, and therefore it would be difficult\n\nto prove that advising Yacovi about IBTS's ability to compete with\n\nURS constituted negligence or was the cause of the arbitration\n\naward.    Moreover,   the   Trustee   found   \"little   support   for   the\n\nallegation\" that R & R told Yacovi that he could solicit URS's\n\ncustomers without running afoul of the agreement.\n\n          Yacovi opposed the motion to approve, arguing that the\n\nTrustee's investigation was inadequate and consisted primarily of\n\ndiscussions with R & R.     Although acknowledging that the Trustee\n\nprocured the relevant documents, Yacovi's counsel swore in an\n\naffidavit that he was never consulted by the Trustee about the\n\nmerits of the malpractice claims.       Yacovi's counsel also expressed\n\n                                  -5-\n\fhis willingness to pursue the claims on a contingency basis with a\n\npercentage allocated to the estate, which was an offer he had\n\npreviously proposed in conversations with the Trustee.\n\n          At the conclusion of a hearing held on October 14, 2009,\n\nthe bankruptcy court granted the motion to approve, explaining its\n\ndecision with only a few sentences:\n\n          It's always a tough call when you've got a\n          disputed piece of litigation that the Trustee\n          thinks is not worth pursuing and somebody else\n          thinks is worth pursuing.       My obligation\n          generally speaking is to rely on the expertise\n          of the Trustee. In this particular matter I\n          have no reason to doubt the amount of due\n          diligence Mr. Murphy performed in evaluating\n          the claim. I am going to grant the motion.\n\nThe district court subsequently affirmed.

To be sure, $25,000 amounted\n\nto only a fraction of the damages5 that Yacovi alleges resulted\n\nfrom what he claims was R & R's malpractice.          Nonetheless, the\n\nsettlement   constituted    a   \"definitive,   concrete   and   immediate\n\nbenefit[]\" that the Trustee reasonably concluded outweighed the\n\nuncertainty and delay of litigation.       See In re Healthco Int'l,\n\nInc., 136 F.3d at 50.      The Trustee was appropriately apprehensive\n\nabout litigating the malpractice claims in light of (1) the fact\n\nthat the arbitrator did not find that the employment agreement\n\nprohibited Yacovi from competing with URS, (2) the arbitrator's\n\njudgment that Yacovi's account of some relevant facts lacked\n\ncredibility, and (3) the dearth of evidence that R & R actually\n\nadvised Yacovi that he could solicit URS's clients without any\n\nlegal repercussions.

In this\n\ncase, the bankruptcy court offered only four sentences to explain\n\nits decision.   Providing a more detailed statement would have been\n\npreferable, and under different circumstances a somewhat succinct\n\nexplanation might prevent affirmance.           However, where, as here, an\n\nexperienced trustee conducts an adequate investigation of the\n\nclaims and offers a satisfactory explanation for his settlement\n\ndecision, the record supports the reasonableness of that decision,\n\nand the bankruptcy court receives briefing on the motion and holds\n\na hearing, a cursory explanation, in and of itself, does not rise\n\nto the level of an abuse of discretion.6                Cf.

Over three months later, on\n\nSeptember 29, the Trustee filed a motion to approve the settlement.\n\nYacovi filed an opposition brief to this motion, which included two\n\nsentences     again   requesting   that     the   malpractice    claims   be\n\nabandoned.7    After a hearing on October 14, 2009, the bankruptcy\n\n     7\n      These sentences read: \"[A]bandonment of the malpractice claim\nis the only fair, equitable result and is in the best interest of\nthe estate. THEREFORE, Debtor asks that the Motion be denied and\nthat given the Trustee's lack of any interest in seriously pursuing\n\n                                   -10-\n\fcourt granted the Trustee's motion to approve.        The next day,\n\nOctober 15, Yacovi filed a notice of appeal, pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8002(a), characterizing his appeal to\n\nthe district court as \"from the Order entered in this Action on 14\n\nOctober 2009 granting the Motion filed by the Trustee to Approve\n\nSettlement.\"    Also on October 15, Yacovi filed a Statement of\n\nIssues and Designation of Record on Appeal (\"Statement of Issues on\n\nAppeal\").    See Fed. R. Bankr. Pro. 8006.    This filing failed to\n\nmention abandonment and framed the appellate issue solely as\n\n\"[w]hether the Court erred in granting the Motion filed by the\n\nTrustee to Approve [S]ettlement.\"      On appeal, the district court\n\ndeclined to address Yacovi's abandonment argument, saying the\n\nfollowing:\n\n            As set forth in the Debtor's Statement of\n            Issues, the only question on appeal is whether\n            the Bankruptcy Court erred in allowing the\n            Trustee's Motion to Approve . . . . To the\n            extent that the Debtor also seeks to reargue\n            his Motion to Abandon the Malpractice Claim,\n            that issue is not properly before this court.\n            On June 24, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court denied\n            the Debtor's Motion to Abandon . . . . The\n            Debtor did not appeal that Order, and the time\n            to appeal it has since passed.\n\nIn re Yacovi, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2106171</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3.\n\n\nthe malpractice claim that it be abandoned.\"\n\n     Yacovi contends that this passage constituted a cross-motion\nto abandon, and therefore the October 14 settlement approval also\n\"acted as a denial of [that] cross-motion.\" Even if we accept this\ncharacterization of Yacovi's opposition brief, however, it would\nnot explain his failure to mention abandonment in his Statement of\nIssues on Appeal and it would not materially impact our analysis of\nthe waiver question. See infra.\n\n                                -11-\n\f           There is a circuit split about whether the failure to\n\nlist an issue in the statement of issues on appeal pursuant to\n\nBankruptcy Rule 8006 results in a waiver of that issue.

In his\n\nbriefing to this court, Yacovi has presented neither adequate\n\nargument nor any citation to caselaw or even to a learned treatise.\n\nAs a result, he has waived the issue in this court.\n\n                               III.
