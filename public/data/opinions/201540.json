R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-2203\n\n                     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                           JASON BOURGEOIS,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n         [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Michael J. Iacopino and Brennan Caron Lenehan & Iacopino on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Thomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, and Peter E.\nPapps, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             April 18, 2005\n\f          Per Curiam.      Defendant, Jason Bourgeois, appeals from a\n\ncriminal sentence imposed before the United States Supreme Court's\n\nrecent decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738.          Booker\n\nrendered the United States Sentencing Guidelines advisory rather\n\nthan mandatory.     Id. at 764-65.          Bourgeois argued below that\n\nBlakely v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), effectively rendered\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines unconstitutional as a whole. Pre-Booker,\n\nthe   district    court    found     that   the     Guidelines   were   not\n\nunconstitutional as applied to Bourgeios, who had stipulated to the\n\nrelevant facts in his plea agreement, and therefore sentenced him\n\nunder the Guidelines.      Bourgeois appealed.       While the appeal was\n\npending, Booker was decided, and we invited supplemental briefing\n\nas to whether Bourgeios preserved a claim of Booker error below\n\nand, if so, whether that error was harmless.\n\n          The parties agree, correctly, that by challenging the\n\nconstitutionality     of   the    Guidelines   in   the   district   court,\n\nBourgeios preserved a claim of Booker error, i.e., that he was\n\nsentenced under a mandatory Guidelines system.            See United States\n\nv. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).          Thus, the only\n\nissue presented by this appeal is whether the preserved Booker\n\nerror was harmless.    On that issue, the government has the burden\n\nof showing harmlessness.         Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24\n\n(1967); United States v. Ventura-Cruel, 356 F.3d 55, 64 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).   To make such a showing in the sentencing context, the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fgovernment must show, at a bare minimum, \"'that the error did not\n\naffect the district court's selection of the sentence imposed.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Labastida-Segura, 396 F.3d 1140, 1143 (10th Cir.\n\n2005) (quoting    Williams   v.   United   States,    503   U.S.   193,   203\n\n(1992)).\n\n           The precise standard of proof depends on whether the\n\nerror was a constitutional one, whose harmlessness must be proved\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.         Chapman, 386 U.S. at 24.            Here,\n\nhowever, even assuming, without deciding, that the error was not of\n\nconstitutional dimension (since Bourgeois' sentence was based on\n\nthe   parties'   factual   stipulations    rather    than   on   judge-found\n\nfacts), the government has not met even the lesser standard of\n\ndemonstrating the absence of any \"grave doubt\" as to whether the\n\nerror was harmless. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 764-\n\n65 (1946); see also United States v. Haidley, 400 F.3d 642, 645 (8th\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n           It is often some indication that a preserved Booker error\n\nwas not harmless when, as now, the district court sentenced the\n\ndefendant at the very bottom of the applicable Guidelines range.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Lea, 400 F.3d 1115, 1116 (8th Cir.\n\n2005); Haidley, 400 F.3d at 645; United States v. Hazelwood, 398\n\nF.3d 792, 801 (6th Cir. 2005); Labastida-Segura, 396 F.3d at 1143.\n\nIn this case, there are additional indications that \"it is at least\n\npossible,\" Hazelwood, 398 F.3d at 801, that the district court\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fwould impose a lesser sentence under a non-mandatory Guidelines\n\nregime.    At the sentencing hearing, Bourgeios' counsel made an\n\nextensive proffer of the witnesses he would call if the court were\n\nnot bound by the Guidelines.       Those witnesses, he represented,\n\nwould have testified that Bourgeois was cooperative during his\n\npretrial supervision, that he is a hard and dependable worker, and\n\nthat he overcame a severe substance abuse problem.          Based on that\n\nproffer, the district court acknowledged that Bourgeois \"worked\n\nhard and . . . [did] all the things [he] should do as a reasonable\n\ncitizen\" but expressly disavowed any reliance on those factors,\n\nwhich were not relevant under the Guidelines but may be relevant\n\nunder post-Booker standards.     See Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 81.\n\nThe government offers no indications to the contrary.         Under these\n\ncircumstances, we are reluctant to say that the error was harmless.\n\n           Accordingly, the sentence is vacated and the case is\n\nremanded   for   resentencing   under    the   standards   articulated   in\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. at 764-65.           We intimate no view as to the\n\nappropriate sentence to be imposed.\n\n           The conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and\n\nthe matter is remanded for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
