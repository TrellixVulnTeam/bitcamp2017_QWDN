Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Boudin, Stahl, and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Allison J. Koury was on brief, for appellant.\n     Jack W. Pirozzolo, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         November 5, 2008\n\f            STAHL, Circuit Judge.          Defendant-Appellant Tyson Ford\n\nappeals his conviction under the felon-in-possession statute, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1).     His main complaint is that the district court\n\nerred in denying his motion to suppress a firearm found on his\n\nperson because it was obtained during an unconstitutional search\n\nand seizure.    Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n            We relate the facts \"'as the trial court found them,\n\nconsistent with record support.'\"           United States v. Ruidíaz, 529\n\nF.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Lee, 317 F.3d\n\n26, 30 (1st Cir. 2003)).         On September 8, 2005, Officers Daran\n\nEdwards and Daniel Griffin (\"the Officers\") of the Boston Police\n\nDepartment (\"BPD\") were on a routine patrol in a high-crime area of\n\nDorchester, Massachusetts.       The Officers were in uniform and in a\n\nmarked police cruiser.      They regularly patrolled the Dorchester\n\narea and were familiar with many of the area's residents.                       At\n\napproximately 3:00 p.m., the Officers observed Ford, who they did\n\nnot recognize, walking alone down Harvard Street. Ford looked over\n\nhis shoulder, observed the cruiser and then lowered his head, began\n\nwalking   rapidly,   and   turned   right       onto      Gleason   Street.    The\n\nOfficers followed Ford the wrong way up Gleason Street for a short\n\ndistance,     ostensibly   to    conduct        a    Field    Intelligence     and\n\nObservation    Report   (FIO),    used     by       BPD   police    officers   for\n\nintelligence collection.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f            Upon coming abreast of Ford, Officer Griffin leaned out\n\nof the passenger side window and asked him, \"Can I speak to you for\n\na minute?\"    Ford stopped walking, took his identification out of\n\nhis front pocket, and voluntarily handed it to Officer Griffin. He\n\ntold the Officers he had no outstanding warrants and was not on\n\nprobation.    While Officer Edwards ran a search for warrants using\n\nthe BPD database, Officer Griffin continued to ask Ford questions\n\nlike \"where do you live?\" and \"where are you headed?\"        Officer\n\nGriffin observed that Ford appeared annoyed, nervous, and hostile\n\nat times and that he was breathing rapidly, stuttered his words,\n\nand his hands shook.     Officer Griffin asked Ford whether he had\n\nanything on him that the Officers needed to know about.         Ford\n\nanswered in the negative.\n\n            Roughly 45 seconds after taking Ford's driver's license,\n\nOfficer Griffin exited the cruiser to complete the FIO.    Following\n\nBPD protocol, Officer Edwards also exited, walked behind the\n\ncruiser, and approached Ford from the same direction as Officer\n\nGriffin.    Neither Officer unholstered his weapon.   Ford raised his\n\nhands into the air and said, \"Come on man, what's this all about?\"\n\nOfficer Griffin asked whether Ford had any weapons on his person.\n\nFord responded, \"Yeah, I got a gun in my pocket, but it don't\n\nfire.\"     The Officers then placed Ford in handcuffs, and Officer\n\nGriffin frisked him, discovering and seizing a Grendel, Inc., P-12\n\n.380 semi-automatic handgun from the pocket of Ford's pants.     The\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fOfficers arrested Ford, the entire encounter lasting approximately\n\ntwo to three minutes from interception to arrest.             Before placing\n\nFord in handcuffs, neither Officer had touched Ford, drawn his\n\nweapon, or told Ford he was not free to leave nor had the Officers\n\nactivated the police cruiser's siren or flashing lights.\n\n           On November 1, 2005, a single-count complaint charged\n\nFord as a felon-in-possession of a handgun in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1).    On March 3, 2006, Ford moved to suppress the\n\nevidence seized in the warrantless search of his person, contending\n\nhe was seized at the time the Officers exited the vehicle in\n\nviolation of his Fourth Amendment rights.          On July 20, 2006, the\n\ndistrict   court   denied   the   motion   and   issued   a    well-reasoned\n\nrescript, finding that the Officers had not seized Ford prior to\n\nhis incriminating statement.       See United States v. Ford, 440 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 16 (D. Mass. 2006).\n\n           On October 4, 2006, Ford entered a conditional plea of\n\nguilty, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2), reserving his right to\n\nappeal the denial of his suppression motion.        On October 11, 2006,\n\nthe district court sentenced Ford to a term of imprisonment of 15\n\nyears under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924 (e)(1).\n\nFord now appeals the denial to suppress the handgun and his\n\nconviction.1\n\n\n\n     1\n       Ford dropped his appeal of the sentence enhancement under\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f                                II. Discussion\n\nA. The Motion to Suppress\n\n            This appeal primarily concerns the boundary delineating\n\ncasual encounters with police, as when officers question persons in\n\npublic    places,     from     seizures     requiring   probable    cause    or\n\narticulable suspicion. See United States v. Young, 105 F.3d 1, 5-6\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).      Ford challenges the lower court's denial of his\n\nmotion to suppress in which he argued the Officers seized him\n\nbefore    possessing    the     requisite    reasonable   suspicion.        The\n\nGovernment concedes, and we accept for the purposes of this review,\n\nthat the Officers lacked the reasonable suspicion required for a\n\nseizure and that, if a seizure occurred, the handgun found on\n\nFord's person \"must be suppressed as tainted fruit.\"               See Florida\n\nv. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 433-34 (1991).\n\n            \"Our review of a district court's denial of a suppression\n\nmotion is bifurcated.\"         United States v. Cardoza, 129 F.3d 6, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 1997).      We review the court's factual findings for clear\n\nerror     and   its    legal    conclusions     (including   constitutional\n\ndeterminations) de novo.         Ruidíaz, 529 F.3d at 28.          Clear error\n\n\"'exists only if, after considering all of the evidence, we are\n\nleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n\nmade.'\"    Young, 105 F.3d at 5 (quoting United States v. McCarthy,\n\n77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir. 1996)).            This deference \"reflects our\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fawareness that the trial judge . . . sits in the best position to\n\ndetermine what actually happened.\"          Id.\n\n           The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the\n\npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\n\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\"\n\nU.S.   Const.,   amend.   IV.      The    primary    purpose   of     the   Fourth\n\nAmendment is \"'to prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by\n\nenforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of\n\nindividuals.'\"      I.N.S.    v.   Delgado,    466    U.S.    210,    215   (1984)\n\n(quoting United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 554\n\n(1976)).\n\n           Not every interaction between a police officer and a\n\ncitizen    constitutes    a     seizure     triggering       Fourth    Amendment\n\nprotections.     Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434; Cardoza, 129 F.3d at 14;\n\nYoung, 105 F.3d at 5.         While per se rules are inappropriate in\n\ndetermining when a seizure occurs for Fourth Amendment purposes,\n\nUnited States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194, 201 (2002) (citing Bostick,\n\n501 U.S. at 439), we have observed that encounters \"between law\n\nenforcement officials and citizens generally fall[] within three\n\ntiers of Fourth Amendment analysis, depending on the level of\n\npolice intrusion into a person's privacy.\"             Young, 105 F.3d at 5.\n\nBecause there are no bright-line distinctions between the tiers, we\n\nlook to the totality of the circumstances to determine where a\n\npolice encounter falls.         Drayton, 536 U.S. at 207; Michigan v.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fChesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 572 (1988); United States v. Smith, 423\n\nF.3d 25, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2005); Cardoza, 129 F.3d at 15.                 See also\n\nBostick, 501 U.S. at 439-40 (rejecting per se rule for seizure in\n\nfavor of totality inquiry).\n\n            The lowest tier, which does not implicate the Fourth\n\nAmendment, involves minimally intrusive interactions such as when\n\npolice officers approach individuals on the street or in public\n\nplaces to ask questions.         Young, 105 F.3d at 5-6; Bostick, 501 U.S.\n\nat   434.     See   Drayton,     536   U.S.   at   201    (observing    that   law\n\nenforcement     agents     may     question      and     ask    a    citizen   for\n\nidentification      even   when    they   have     no   basis   to   suspect   the\n\nindividual so long as they \"do not induce cooperation by coercive\n\nmeans\").      If the encounter amounts to more than a minimally\n\nintrusive interaction, a seizure occurs, either a de facto arrest\n\nrequiring probable cause or an investigative (or Terry) stop\n\nnecessitating reasonable suspicion.           Young, 105 F.3d at 6.\n\n            The Supreme Court has adopted the standard set forth by\n\nJustice Stewart's plurality opinion in United States v. Mendenhall,\n\n446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980), that \"a person has been 'seized' within\n\nthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fhave believed that he was not free to leave.\"2                    See Drayton, 536\n\nU.S. at 202; California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621, 627-28 (1991)\n\n(compiling cases).            To constitute seizure, this Circuit requires\n\none's       liberty    be   restrained     by    either    physical     force   or   an\n\nassertion of authority.           Id. at 626; United States v. Sealey, 30\n\nF.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1994); see Smith, 423 F.3d at 28 (finding\n\nseizure can occur without physical restraint if compliance is\n\ncoerced and not voluntary).\n\n               Under    the    objective    totality       of    the    circumstances\n\nstandard, we look not to \"whether the citizen perceived that he was\n\nbeing ordered to restrict his movement, but whether the officer's\n\nwords and actions would have conveyed that to a reasonable person.\"\n\nHodari D., 499 U.S. at 628; Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 574 (noting\n\nobjective standard does not vary with mind of each individual).\n\nThus, there is less reason to inquire into a defendant's subjective\n\nmindset       when     considering   whether       there    is    a    submission    to\n\nauthority, see Cardoza, 129 F.3d at 14 n.4, particularly as all\n\npersons feel \"some degree of compulsion\" and \"discomfort\" when\n\napproached by police officers.             Smith, 423 F.3d at 28.3\n\n\n        2\n       The Court has explained the reasonable person test presumes\nan innocent person. Bostick, 501 U.S. at 438; Smith, 423 F.3d at\n31, n.5.\n     3\n       Both the Supreme Court and this Circuit have observed that\nexchanges do not lose their consensual nature simply because people\ngenerally answer police officers' questions. Drayton, 536 U.S. at\n205 (citing Delgado, 466 U.S. at 216); Cardoza, 129 F.3d at 16\n(agreeing with defendant that \"few people . . . would ever feel\n\n                                           -8-\n\f             Employing this objective test, the inquiry before us\n\ntoday is not whether the Officers could approach and question Ford,\n\nbut, instead \"whether they did so in a manner that would have\n\ncommunicated to a reasonable person that he was not free to refuse\n\nto answer and walk away.\"       Smith, 423 F.3d at 29.        To elucidate\n\nthis test, the Supreme Court has provided circumstances that may\n\nindicate a seizure including \"the threatening presence of several\n\nofficers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical\n\ntouching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or\n\ntone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer's request\n\nmight be compelled.\"    Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554.      \"[T]his list of\n\nfactors is not exhaustive and no single factor is dispositive in\n\nany case.\"    Smith, 423 F.3d at 29.      See Chesternut, 486 U.S. at 575\n\n(considering also non-use of patrol car's siren or flashers);\n\nUnited States v. McKoy, 428 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2005) (adding\n\nneighborhood as \"only one factor that must be looked at alongside\n\nall the other circumstances\").\n\n             To evaluate the circumstances leading to Ford's arrest,\n\nour   case    law   provides   guidance    for   discerning    the   Fourth\n\nAmendment's parameters.        In Cardoza, police officers drove the\n\n\n\nfree to walk away from any police question\"). See id. (\"The 'free\nto walk away' test . . . must be read in conjunction with the\nCourt's frequent admonitions that 'a seizure does not occur simply\nbecause a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few\nquestions'\") (quoting Bostick, 501 U.S. at 434, and Terry v. Ohio,\n392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16 (1968)).\n\n                                   -9-\n\fwrong   way    on    a   one-way   street   to   ask   the   defendant   pointed\n\nquestions including \"Why are you out at this time of night?\"                 129\n\nF.3d at 15.        We found no seizure, noting the police had not used\n\nthe cruiser's siren or lights, had stopped at the curb before\n\ncalling out to the defendant, and did not exit the car until they\n\nobserved the defendant's ammunition round.                   Id. at 16.      Cf.\n\nChesternut, 486 U.S. at 575 (no seizure where police did not\n\nactivate siren or lights, did not order defendant to halt, drew no\n\nweapons, and did not block defendant's course).\n\n              In    Smith,   the   police   officers    framed    general,   non-\n\nthreatening questions to ask why the defendant was sitting on the\n\nwall of a stranger's house and did not command the defendant to\n\nremain on his walled perch.             423 F.3d at 30.          Even after the\n\nofficers exited their vehicle to conduct an FIO and approached the\n\ndefendant from both sides, we found no seizure because the officers\n\nnever summoned Smith to the cruiser, did not employ the car's siren\n\nor lights, and did not expose their weapons or touch Smith.                  Id.\n\nAdditionally, because Smith attempted to flee from the officers\n\nafter he disclosed that he had an outstanding warrant, we noted his\n\naction indicated he had not submitted to an assertion of authority.\n\nId. at 31.\n\n              Applying this precedent to the instant case, we decline\n\nto hold that the Officers seized Ford before he disclosed that he\n\nwas in possession of a firearm.             See Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 555\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f(rejecting proposition that making statements contrary to one's\n\nself-interest necessarily indicates involuntary submission).                The\n\nOfficers, like those in Cardoza, drove a short distance the wrong\n\nway on Gleason Street for the purpose of asking Ford questions but\n\nactivated neither the cruiser's siren or flashing lights.                Their\n\nquestions were largely general and non-threatening, like those in\n\nSmith. Throughout the brief encounter, until Ford's incriminating\n\nstatement, the Officers did not draw their guns or touch Ford.\n\n            At the onset of the interaction, Ford approached the\n\ncruiser and provided his driver's license voluntarily.               While the\n\nOfficers retained the license during the two- to three-minute\n\nexchange,    they   did   not    otherwise    restrict      Ford's   movement.\n\nContrast Smith, 423 F.3d at 27, 30 (finding no seizure where\n\nofficers approached the defendant from both sides, telephone pole\n\nwas directly in front of defendant, and wall directly behind).               As\n\nin Smith, where we found no seizure, the Officers exited the\n\ncruiser to complete the FIO.\n\n            Ford relies on the Supreme Court's Florida v. Royer\n\ndecision where two detectives retained the defendant's driver's\n\nlicense and airplane ticket while commanding him to accompany them\n\nto a private room because they believed he fit the drug courier\n\nprofile.     460 U.S. 491, 493-94 (1983).             The Court held these\n\nactions    constituted    an    illegal    seizure,   id.    at   501-02,   and\n\ndistinguished Mendenhall in part because the government agents\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fthere immediately returned the driver's license and airplane ticket\n\nbefore continuing the encounter.   Id. at 503 n.9.\n\n           Ford argues Royer indicates that the retention of his\n\ndriver's license during the encounter is compelling evidence of a\n\nseizure.    We think the concerns of the airport cases, where\n\ncitizens need documentation to move from place to place, differ\n\nfrom the instant case where Ford was on foot on a public street.\n\nSee Drayton, 536 U.S. at 204 (noting that if the encounter had\n\noccurred on the street rather than on a bus, \"[i]t is beyond\n\nquestion that . . . it would be constitutional\").    Moreover, Ford\n\nproduced his license voluntarily, not at the request of one of the\n\nOfficers, and was not removed from the street to a confined space\n\nwhile the Officers ran the background check.\n\n           While the retention of Ford's license is an important\n\nfactor in our analysis, we decline to elevate it above other\n\nconsiderations.   See United States v. Weaver, 282 F.3d 302, 313\n\n(4th Cir. 2002) (refusing to adopt D.C. Circuit's per se rule\n\nregarding license retention).\n\n           Ford also asserts that a seizure can be evidenced by his\n\nraising his hands into the air after the Officers exited the\n\ncruiser. But one can draw different inferences from this gesture;\n\nwhile it could reflect submission, raised hands also can be a\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fsymbol of protest.          On the cold record before us,4 we cannot\n\nrecreate the actual gesture demonstrated to the district court.\n\nInstead, this type of inquiry recommends our deferential review of\n\nthe lower court's factual findings.5\n\n                 Evaluating the totality of circumstances, we hold that\n\nFord       was   not   seized   for   purposes   of   the   Fourth   Amendment\n\nprotections when he told the Officers he possessed a handgun.\n\nAssessments of this type \"are highly fact-specific and must be\n\nperformed on a case-by-case basis.\"           United States v. Taylor, 511\n\nF.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 2007).              We acknowledge this method of\n\nanalysis does not produce a crystalline landscape in our Fourth\n\nAmendment jurisprudence.          But it reflects most realistically the\n\ncontextual nature of these encounters. See Chesternut, 486 U.S. at\n\n\n\n       4\n       At the suppression hearing, Officer Edwards demonstrated the\nexact manner in which Ford raised his hands and later explained\nthat Ford \"raised his hands in the air.\" Officer Griffin similarly\ntestified twice that Ford \"raised his hands.\"         Ford did not\ntestify. We note that this record does not support the suggestion\ninitially posited by Ford that he raised his hands above his head.\n       5\n       Ford also suggests that the Officer's failure to inform him\nof his right to refuse to answer questions and to leave rendered\nthe encounter nonconsensual. While it is true that such statements\ngenerally make an encounter consensual, Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at\n558-59, the Supreme Court has explained that a seizure\ndetermination \"is not affected by the fact that the respondent was\nnot expressly told by the agents that she was free to decline to\ncooperate with their inquiry, for the voluntariness of her\nresponses does not depend upon her having been so informed.\" Id.\nat 555. See also Drayton, 536 U.S. at 206 (\"The [Supreme] Court\nhas rejected in specific terms the suggestion that police officers\nmust always inform citizens of their right to refuse when seeking\npermission to conduct a warrantless consent search.\").\n\n                                       -13-\n\f573 (\"The test is necessarily imprecise, because it is designed to\n\nassess the coercive effect of police conduct, taken as a whole,\n\nrather than to focus on particular details of that conduct in\n\nisolation.\").\n\nB. Other Issues\n\n          Ford contests his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1),\n\nasserting that the handgun on his person did not fall under the\n\nstatutory definition of \"firearm\" because it was inoperable.         The\n\nGovernment argues that Ford waived this argument by entering a\n\nconditional plea of guilty, reserving only his objection to the\n\nsuppression order.   Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2).       Regardless of the\n\nstandard of review we employ, Ford's claim is without merit.\n\n          \"The term 'firearm' means (A) any weapon . . . which will\n\nor is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile\n\nby action of an explosion.”     18 U.S.C. at § 921(a)(2).        We have\n\nrecognized that, in order to convict, \"the gun must be real, but it\n\n'need not be prove[d] to be loaded or operable.'\"       United States v.\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v.\n\nKirvan, 997 F.2d 963, 966 (1st Cir. 1993)).     See also United States\n\nv. Alston, 112 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 1997).           No one, including\n\nFord, suggests the handgun he carried was not real or that it was\n\nnot designed to expel a projectile.      Ford's argument thus fails.\n\n          Finally,   Ford's   argument   that   his   prior   convictions\n\nshould be treated as an element of the enhanced offense, and thus\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fproven by the Government beyond reasonable doubt, is foreclosed by\n\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998), and our\n\nCircuit's subsequent case law.\n\n                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial of Ford's motion to suppress and Ford's conviction under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f",

Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before BOUDIN, STAHL, and HOWARD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Defendant-Appellant Tyson Ford appeals his conviction under the felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). His main complaint is that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress a firearm found on his person because it was obtained during an unconstitutional search and seizure. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>We relate the facts \"`as the trial court found them, consistent with record support.'\" <i>United States v. Ruidiaz,</i> 529 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2008) (<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. Lee,</i> 317 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 2003)). On September 8, 2005, Officers Daran Edwards and Daniel Griffin (\"the Officers\") of the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") were on a routine patrol in a high-crime area of Dorchester, Massachusetts. The Officers were in uniform and in a marked police cruiser. They regularly patrolled the Dorchester area and were familiar with many of the area's residents. At approximately 3:00 p.m., the Officers observed Ford, who they did not recognize, walking alone down Harvard Street. Ford looked over his shoulder, observed the cruiser and then lowered his head, began walking rapidly, and turned right onto Gleason Street. The Officers followed Ford the wrong way up Gleason Street for a short distance, ostensibly to conduct a Field Intelligence and Observation Report (FIO), used by BPD police officers for intelligence collection.</p>\n<p>Upon coming abreast of Ford, Officer Griffin leaned out of the passenger side window and asked him, \"Can I speak to you for a minute?\" Ford stopped walking, took his identification out of his front pocket, and voluntarily handed it to Officer Griffin. He told the Officers he had no outstanding warrants and was not on probation. While Officer Edwards ran a search for warrants using the BPD database, Officer Griffin continued to ask Ford questions like \"where do you live?\" and \"where are you headed?\" Officer Griffin observed that Ford appeared annoyed, nervous, and hostile at times and that he was breathing rapidly, stuttered his words, and his hands shook. Officer Griffin asked Ford whether he had anything on him that the Officers needed to know about. Ford answered in the negative.</p>\n<p>Roughly 45 seconds after taking Ford's driver's license, Officer Griffin exited the cruiser to complete the FIO. Following <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> BPD protocol, Officer Edwards also exited, walked behind the cruiser, and approached Ford from the same direction as Officer Griffin. Neither Officer unholstered his weapon. Ford raised his hands into the air and said, \"Come on man, what's this all about?\" Officer Griffin asked whether Ford had any weapons on his person. Ford responded, \"Yeah, I got a gun in my pocket, but it don't fire.\" The Officers then placed Ford in handcuffs, and Officer Griffin frisked him, discovering and seizing a Grendel, Inc., P-12 .380 semi-automatic handgun from the pocket of Ford's pants. The Officers arrested Ford, the entire encounter lasting approximately two to three minutes from interception to arrest. Before placing Ford in handcuffs, neither Officer had touched Ford, drawn his weapon, or told Ford he was not free to leave nor had the Officers activated the police cruiser's siren or flashing lights.</p>\n<p>On November 1, 2005, a single-count complaint charged Ford as a felon-in-possession of a handgun in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). On March 3, 2006, Ford moved to suppress the evidence seized in the warrantless search of his person, contending he was seized at the time the Officers exited the vehicle in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. On July 20, 2006, the district court denied the motion and issued a well-reasoned rescript, finding that the Officers had not seized Ford prior to his incriminating statement. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ford,</i> 440 F.Supp.2d 16 (D.Mass.2006).</p>\n<p>On October 4, 2006, Ford entered a conditional plea of guilty, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), reserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion. On October 11, 2006, the district court sentenced Ford to a term of imprisonment of 15 years under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Ford now appeals the denial to suppress the handgun and his conviction.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>This appeal primarily concerns the boundary delineating casual encounters with police, as when officers question persons in public places, from seizures requiring probable cause or articulable suspicion. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Young,</i> 105 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1997). Ford challenges the lower court's denial of his motion to suppress in which he argued the Officers seized him before possessing the requisite reasonable suspicion. The Government concedes, and we accept for the purposes of this review, that the Officers lacked the reasonable suspicion required for a seizure and that, if a seizure occurred, the handgun found on Ford's person \"must be suppressed as tainted fruit.\" <i>See </i><i>Florida v. Bostick,</i> 501 U.S. 429, 433-34, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991).</p>\n<p>\"Our review of a district court's denial of a suppression motion is bifurcated.\" <i>United States v. Cardoza,</i> 129 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir.1997). We review the court's factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions (including constitutional determinations) de novo. <i>Ruidiaz,</i> 529 F.3d at 28. Clear error \"`exists only if, after considering all of the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.'\" <i>Young,</i> 105 F.3d at 5 (<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. McCarthy,</i> 77 F.3d 522, 529 (1st Cir.1996)). This deference \"reflects our awareness that the trial judge ... sits in the best position to determine what actually happened.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. Const., amend. IV. The primary purpose of the Fourth Amendment is \"`to prevent arbitrary and oppressive interference by enforcement officials with the privacy and personal security of individuals.'\" <i>I.N.S. v. Delgado,</i> 466 U.S. 210, 215, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984) (<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,</i> 428 U.S. 543, 554, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976)).</p>\n<p>Not every interaction between a police officer and a citizen constitutes a seizure triggering Fourth Amendment protections. <i>Bostick,</i> 501 U.S. at 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382; <i>Cardoza,</i> 129 F.3d at 14; <i>Young,</i> 105 F.3d at 5. While per se rules are inappropriate in determining when a seizure occurs for Fourth Amendment purposes, <i>United States v. Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. 194, 201, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002) (<i>citing </i><i>Bostick,</i> 501 U.S. at 439, 111 S.Ct. 2382), we have observed that encounters \"between law enforcement officials and citizens generally fall[] within three tiers of Fourth Amendment analysis, depending on the level of police intrusion into a person's privacy.\" <i>Young,</i> 105 F.3d at 5. Because there are no bright-line distinctions between the tiers, we look to the totality of the circumstances to determine where a police encounter falls. <i>Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. at 207, 122 S.Ct. 2105; <i>Michigan v. Chesternut,</i> 486 U.S. 567, 572, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 100 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988); <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 423 F.3d 25, 29-30 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Cardoza,</i> 129 F.3d at 15. <i>See also </i><i>Bostick,</i> 501 U.S. at 439-40, 111 S.Ct. 2382 (rejecting per se rule for seizure in favor of totality inquiry).</p>\n<p>The lowest tier, which does not implicate the Fourth Amendment, involves minimally intrusive interactions such as when police officers approach individuals on the street or in public places to ask questions. <i>Young,</i> 105 F.3d at 5-6; <i>Bostick,</i> 501 U.S. at 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382. <i>See </i><i>Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. at 201, 122 S.Ct. 2105 (observing that law enforcement agents may question and ask a citizen for identification even when they have no basis to suspect the individual so long as they \"do not induce cooperation by coercive means\"). If the encounter amounts to more than a minimally intrusive interaction, a seizure occurs, either a <i>de facto</i> arrest requiring probable cause or an investigative (or <i>Terry</i>) stop necessitating reasonable suspicion. <i>Young,</i> 105 F.3d at 6.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has adopted the standard set forth by Justice Stewart's plurality opinion in <i>United States v. Mendenhall,</i> 446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980), that \"a person has been `seized' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\"<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. at 202, 122 S.Ct. 2105; <i>California v. Hodari D.,</i> 499 U.S. 621, 627-28, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991) (compiling cases). To constitute seizure, this Circuit requires one's liberty be restrained by either physical force or an assertion of authority. <i>Id.</i> at 626, 111 S.Ct. 1547; <i>United States v. Sealey,</i> 30 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir.1994); <i>see </i><i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 28 (finding seizure can occur without physical restraint if compliance is coerced and not voluntary).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> Under the objective totality of the circumstances standard, we look not to \"whether the citizen perceived that he was being ordered to restrict his movement, but whether the officer's words and actions would have conveyed that to a reasonable person.\" <i>Hodari D.,</i> 499 U.S. at 628, 111 S.Ct. 1547; <i>Chesternut,</i> 486 U.S. at 574, 108 S.Ct. 1975 (noting objective standard does not vary with mind of each individual). Thus, there is less reason to inquire into a defendant's subjective mindset when considering whether there is a submission to authority, <i>see </i><i>Cardoza,</i> 129 F.3d at 14 n. 4, particularly as all persons feel \"some degree of compulsion\" and \"discomfort\" when approached by police officers. <i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 28.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Employing this objective test, the inquiry before us today is not whether the Officers could approach and question Ford, but, instead \"whether they did so in a manner that would have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not free to refuse to answer and walk away.\" <i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 29. To elucidate this test, the Supreme Court has provided circumstances that may indicate a seizure including \"the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer's request might be compelled.\" <i>Mendenhall,</i> 446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870. \"[T]his list of factors is not exhaustive and no single factor is dispositive in any case.\" <i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 29. <i>See </i><i>Chesternut,</i> 486 U.S. at 575, 108 S.Ct. 1975 (considering also non-use of patrol car's siren or flashers); <i>United States v. McKoy,</i> 428 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir.2005) (adding neighborhood as \"only one factor that must be looked at alongside all the other circumstances\").</p>\n<p>To evaluate the circumstances leading to Ford's arrest, our case law provides guidance for discerning the Fourth Amendment's parameters. In <i>Cardoza,</i> police officers drove the wrong way on a one-way street to ask the defendant pointed questions including \"Why are you out at this time of night?\" 129 F.3d at 15. We found no seizure, noting the police had not used the cruiser's siren or lights, had stopped at the curb before calling out to the defendant, and did not exit the car until they observed the defendant's ammunition round. <i>Id.</i> at 16. <i>Cf. </i><i>Chesternut,</i> 486 U.S. at 575, 108 S.Ct. 1975 (no seizure where police did not activate siren or lights, did not order defendant to halt, drew no weapons, and did not block defendant's course).</p>\n<p>In <i>Smith,</i> the police officers framed general, non-threatening questions to ask why the defendant was sitting on the wall of a stranger's house and did not command the defendant to remain on his walled perch. 423 F.3d at 30. Even after the officers exited their vehicle to conduct an FIO and approached the defendant from both sides, we found no seizure because the officers never summoned Smith to the cruiser, did not employ the car's siren or lights, and did not expose their weapons or touch Smith. <i>Id.</i> Additionally, because Smith <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> attempted to flee from the officers after he disclosed that he had an outstanding warrant, we noted his action indicated he had not submitted to an assertion of authority. <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n<p>Applying this precedent to the instant case, we decline to hold that the Officers seized Ford before he disclosed that he was in possession of a firearm. <i>See </i><i>Mendenhall,</i> 446 U.S. at 555, 100 S.Ct. 1870 (rejecting proposition that making statements contrary to one's self-interest necessarily indicates involuntary submission). The Officers, like those in <i>Cardoza,</i> drove a short distance the wrong way on Gleason Street for the purpose of asking Ford questions but activated neither the cruiser's siren or flashing lights. Their questions were largely general and non-threatening, like those in <i>Smith.</i> Throughout the brief encounter, until Ford's incriminating statement, the Officers did not draw their guns or touch Ford.</p>\n<p>At the onset of the interaction, Ford approached the cruiser and provided his driver's license voluntarily. While the Officers retained the license during the two-to three-minute exchange, they did not otherwise restrict Ford's movement. <i>Contrast </i><i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 27, 30 (finding no seizure where officers approached the defendant from both sides, telephone pole was directly in front of defendant, and wall directly behind). As in <i>Smith,</i> where we found no seizure, the Officers exited the cruiser to complete the FIO.</p>\n<p>Ford relies on the Supreme Court's <i>Florida v. Royer</i> decision where two detectives retained the defendant's driver's license and airplane ticket while commanding him to accompany them to a private room because they believed he fit the drug courier profile. 460 U.S. 491, 493-94, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983). The Court held these actions constituted an illegal seizure, <i>id.</i> at 501-02, 103 S.Ct. 1319, and distinguished <i>Mendenhall</i> in part because the government agents there immediately returned the driver's license and airplane ticket before continuing the encounter. <i>Id.</i> at 503 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 1319.</p>\n<p>Ford argues <i>Royer</i> indicates that the retention of his driver's license during the encounter is compelling evidence of a seizure. We think the concerns of the airport cases, where citizens need documentation to move from place to place, differ from the instant case where Ford was on foot on a public street. <i>See </i><i>Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. at 204, 122 S.Ct. 2105 (noting that if the encounter had occurred on the street rather than on a bus, \"[i]t is beyond question that ... it would be constitutional\"). Moreover, Ford produced his license voluntarily, not at the request of one of the Officers, and was not removed from the street to a confined space while the Officers ran the background check.</p>\n<p>While the retention of Ford's license is an important factor in our analysis, we decline to elevate it above other considerations. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Weaver,</i> 282 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002) (refusing to adopt D.C. Circuit's per se rule regarding license retention).</p>\n<p>Ford also asserts that a seizure can be evidenced by his raising his hands into the air after the Officers exited the cruiser. But one can draw different inferences from this gesture; while it could reflect submission, raised hands also can be a symbol of protest. On the cold record before us,<sup>[4]</sup> we cannot recreate the actual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> gesture demonstrated to the district court. Instead, this type of inquiry recommends our deferential review of the lower court's factual findings.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Evaluating the totality of circumstances, we hold that Ford was not seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment protections when he told the Officers he possessed a handgun. Assessments of this type \"are highly fact-specific and must be performed on a case-by-case basis.\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 511 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir.2007). We acknowledge this method of analysis does not produce a crystalline landscape in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. But it reflects most realistically the contextual nature of these encounters. <i>See </i><i>Chesternut,</i> 486 U.S. at 573, 108 S.Ct. 1975 (\"The test is necessarily imprecise, because it is designed to assess the coercive effect of police conduct, taken as a whole, rather than to focus on particular details of that conduct in isolation.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Other Issues</h2>\n<p>Ford contests his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), asserting that the handgun on his person did not fall under the statutory definition of \"firearm\" because it was inoperable. The Government argues that Ford waived this argument by entering a conditional plea of guilty, reserving only his objection to the suppression order. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2). Regardless of the standard of review we employ, Ford's claim is without merit.</p>\n<p>\"The term `firearm' means (A) any weapon ... which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by action of an explosion.\" 18 U.S.C. at § 921(a)(2). We have recognized that, in order to convict, \"the gun must be real, but it `need not be prove[d] to be loaded or operable.'\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 975 (1st Cir.1995) (<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. Kirvan,</i> 997 F.2d 963, 966 (1st Cir.1993)). <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Alston,</i> 112 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 1997). No one, including Ford, suggests the handgun he carried was not real or that it was not designed to expel a projectile. Ford's argument thus fails.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ford's argument that his prior convictions should be treated as an element of the enhanced offense, and thus proven by the Government beyond reasonable doubt, is foreclosed by <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and our Circuit's subsequent case law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Ford's motion to suppress and Ford's conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Ford dropped his appeal of the sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court has explained the reasonable person test presumes an innocent person. <i>Bostick,</i> 501 U.S. at 438, 111 S.Ct. 2382; <i>Smith,</i> 423 F.3d at 31, n. 5.</p>\n<p>[3]  Both the Supreme Court and this Circuit have observed that exchanges do not lose their consensual nature simply because people generally answer police officers' questions. <i>Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. at 205, 122 S.Ct. 2105 (<i>citing </i><i>Delgado,</i> 466 U.S. at 216, 104 S.Ct. 1758); <i>Cardoza,</i> 129 F.3d at 16 (agreeing with defendant that \"few people . . . would ever feel free to walk away from any police question\"). <i>See id.</i> (\"The `free to walk away' test . . . must be read in conjunction with the Court's frequent admonitions that `a seizure does not occur simply because a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few questions'\") (<i>quoting </i><i>Bostick,</i> 501 U.S. at 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, and <i>Terry v.

On September 8, 2005, Officers Daran Edwards and Daniel Griffin (\"the Officers\") of the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") were on a routine patrol in a high-crime area of Dorchester, Massachusetts. The Officers were in uniform and in a marked police cruiser. They regularly patrolled the Dorchester area and were familiar with many of the area's residents. At approximately 3:00 p.m., the Officers observed Ford, who they did not recognize, walking alone down Harvard Street. Ford looked over his shoulder, observed the cruiser and then lowered his head, began walking rapidly, and turned right onto Gleason Street. The Officers followed Ford the wrong way up Gleason Street for a short distance, ostensibly to conduct a Field Intelligence and Observation Report (FIO), used by BPD police officers for intelligence collection.</p>\n<p>Upon coming abreast of Ford, Officer Griffin leaned out of the passenger side window and asked him, \"Can I speak to you for a minute?\" Ford stopped walking, took his identification out of his front pocket, and voluntarily handed it to Officer Griffin. He told the Officers he had no outstanding warrants and was not on probation. While Officer Edwards ran a search for warrants using the BPD database, Officer Griffin continued to ask Ford questions like \"where do you live?\" and \"where are you headed?\" Officer Griffin observed that Ford appeared annoyed, nervous, and hostile at times and that he was breathing rapidly, stuttered his words, and his hands shook. Officer Griffin asked Ford whether he had anything on him that the Officers needed to know about. Ford answered in the negative.</p>\n<p>Roughly 45 seconds after taking Ford's driver's license, Officer Griffin exited the cruiser to complete the FIO. Following <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> BPD protocol, Officer Edwards also exited, walked behind the cruiser, and approached Ford from the same direction as Officer Griffin. Neither Officer unholstered his weapon. Ford raised his hands into the air and said, \"Come on man, what's this all about?\" Officer Griffin asked whether Ford had any weapons on his person. Ford responded, \"Yeah, I got a gun in my pocket, but it don't fire.\" The Officers then placed Ford in handcuffs, and Officer Griffin frisked him, discovering and seizing a Grendel, Inc., P-12 .380 semi-automatic handgun from the pocket of Ford's pants. The Officers arrested Ford, the entire encounter lasting approximately two to three minutes from interception to arrest. Before placing Ford in handcuffs, neither Officer had touched Ford, drawn his weapon, or told Ford he was not free to leave nor had the Officers activated the police cruiser's siren or flashing lights.</p>\n<p>On November 1, 2005, a single-count complaint charged Ford as a felon-in-possession of a handgun in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). On March 3, 2006, Ford moved to suppress the evidence seized in the warrantless search of his person, contending he was seized at the time the Officers exited the vehicle in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. On July 20, 2006, the district court denied the motion and issued a well-reasoned rescript, finding that the Officers had not seized Ford prior to his incriminating statement. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Ford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2562393\"><a href=\"/opinion/2562393/united-states-v-ford/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2006).</p>\n<p>On October 4, 2006, Ford entered a conditional plea of guilty, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), reserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion. On October 11, 2006, the district court sentenced Ford to a term of imprisonment of 15 years under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Ford now appeals the denial to suppress the handgun and his conviction.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Motion to Suppress</h2>\n<p>This appeal primarily concerns the boundary delineating casual encounters with police, as when officers question persons in public places, from seizures requiring probable cause or articulable suspicion. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Ford challenges the lower court's denial of his motion to suppress in which he argued the Officers seized him before possessing the requisite reasonable suspicion. The Government concedes, and we accept for the purposes of this review, that the Officers lacked the reasonable suspicion required for a seizure and that, if a seizure occurred, the handgun found on Ford's person \"must be suppressed as tainted fruit.\" <i>See </i><i>Florida v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span> (1983). The Court held these actions constituted an illegal seizure, <i>id.</i> at 501-02, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110890\"><a href=\"/opinion/110890/florida-v-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span>, and distinguished <i>Mendenhall</i> in part because the government agents there immediately returned the driver's license and airplane ticket before continuing the encounter. <i>Id.</i> at 503 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110890\"><a href=\"/opinion/110890/florida-v-royer/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Ford argues <i>Royer</i> indicates that the retention of his driver's license during the encounter is compelling evidence of a seizure. We think the concerns of the airport cases, where citizens need documentation to move from place to place, differ from the instant case where Ford was on foot on a public street. <i>See </i><i>Drayton,</i> 536 U.S. at 204, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121153\"><a href=\"/opinion/121153/united-states-v-drayton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2105</span></a></span> (noting that if the encounter had occurred on the street rather than on a bus, \"[i]t is beyond question that ... it would be constitutional\"). Moreover, Ford produced his license voluntarily, not at the request of one of the Officers, and was not removed from the street to a confined space while the Officers ran the background check.</p>\n<p>While the retention of Ford's license is an important factor in our analysis, we decline to elevate it above other considerations. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Weaver,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776764\"><a href=\"/opinion/776764/united-states-v-otis-lee-weaver-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 313 (4th Cir.2002) (refusing to adopt D.C. Circuit's per se rule regarding license retention).</p>\n<p>Ford also asserts that a seizure can be evidenced by his raising his hands into the air after the Officers exited the cruiser. But one can draw different inferences from this gesture; while it could reflect submission, raised hands also can be a symbol of protest. On the cold record before us,<sup>[4]</sup> we cannot recreate the actual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> gesture demonstrated to the district court. Instead, this type of inquiry recommends our deferential review of the lower court's factual findings.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Evaluating the totality of circumstances, we hold that Ford was not seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment protections when he told the Officers he possessed a handgun. Assessments of this type \"are highly fact-specific and must be performed on a case-by-case basis.\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203087\"><a href=\"/opinion/203087/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.2007). We acknowledge this method of analysis does not produce a crystalline landscape in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. But it reflects most realistically the contextual nature of these encounters. <i>See </i><i>Chesternut,</i> 486 U.S. at 573, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112095\"><a href=\"/opinion/112095/michigan-v-chesternut/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1975</span></a></span> (\"The test is necessarily imprecise, because it is designed to assess the coercive effect of police conduct, taken as a whole, rather than to focus on particular details of that conduct in isolation.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Other Issues</h2>\n<p>Ford contests his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), asserting that the handgun on his person did not fall under the statutory definition of \"firearm\" because it was inoperable. The Government argues that Ford waived this argument by entering a conditional plea of guilty, reserving only his objection to the suppression order. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2). Regardless of the standard of review we employ, Ford's claim is without merit.</p>\n<p>\"The term `firearm' means (A) any weapon ... which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by action of an explosion.\" 18 U.S.C. at § 921(a)(2). We have recognized that, in order to convict, \"the gun must be real, but it `need not be prove[d] to be loaded or operable.'\" <i>United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 975 (1st Cir.1995) (<i>quoting </i><i>United States v. Kirvan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610801\"><a href=\"/opinion/610801/united-states-v-paul-j-kirvan-united-states-v-paul-j-kirvan/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span>, 966 (1st Cir.1993)). <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Alston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197342\"><a href=\"/opinion/197342/united-states-v-alston/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir. 1997). No one, including Ford, suggests the handgun he carried was not real or that it was not designed to expel a projectile. Ford's argument thus fails.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ford's argument that his prior convictions should be treated as an element of the enhanced offense, and thus proven by the Government beyond reasonable doubt, is foreclosed by <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Ford's motion to suppress and Ford's conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Ford dropped his appeal of the sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court has explained the reasonable person test presumes an innocent person. <i>Bostick,</i> 501 U.S. at 438, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112631\"><a href=\"/opinion/112631/florida-v-bostick/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We note that this record does not support the suggestion initially posited by Ford that he raised his hands above his head.</p>\n<p>[5]  Ford also suggests that the Officer's failure to inform him of his right to refuse to answer questions and to leave rendered the encounter nonconsensual. While it is true that such statements generally make an encounter consensual, <i>Mendenhall,</i> 446 U.S. at 558-59, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110264\"><a href=\"/opinion/110264/united-states-v-mendenhall/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
