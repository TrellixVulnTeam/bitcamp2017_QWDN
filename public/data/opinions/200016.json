Joseph L.

Furman, Jr., for appellant.\n\n     Gael Mahony, with whom John D. Lawrence and Hill & Barlow,\nP.C. were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                            July 1, 2002\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.         Georgette Tiller appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of her motion for relief from judgment\n\nunder Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.                      The\n\nmotion alleged several grounds for relief, among them discovery\n\nmisconduct and fraud.        The district court denied the motion and\n\nlater   rejected   Tiller's     request      for   reconsideration.       Tiller\n\nchallenges both decisions.       We affirm.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           We described the facts of the underlying dispute in a\n\nprevious appeal, and do not repeat them in detail here.               See Tiller\n\nv. Baghdady, 244 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 2001) (Tiller I).              It suffices to\nsay that the parties disagreed as to the significance of a $31,000\ntransaction between Tiller and her brother, Sami Baghdady.                     The\n\n$31,000 represents the price of stock Tiller owned in a company\nnamed Teledyne,     Inc.      Tiller    alleged     that   Baghdady     sold   her\nTeledyne shares without her consent and used the proceeds to\n\nfinance his investment in a real estate project known as the Cedar\nCrest Apartments.       Although she admitted at trial that she gave\nBaghdady   a   Power    of   Attorney    authorizing       him   to   manage   her\ninvestments, Tiller maintained that she told him not to sell the\n\nTeledyne shares:       \"You don't touch these.       These are untouchables.\n\nThese are long-term investment for my old age.\"                  Thus, when she\n\nlearned of the sale in the summer of 1971, she was furious and\n\ndemanded that Baghdady repurchase the Teledyne shares.                  Baghdady\n\ntold her that he could not afford to buy back the stock because he\n\nhad used the $31,000 to purchase the property for the Cedar Crest\n\n                                       -2-\n\fdevelopment.     Tiller claimed that Baghdady promised her that he\n\nwould treat the money as an equity investment, making her a partner\n\nin the Cedar Crest Apartments.             When he later reneged on that\npromise,   she   sued,   alleging    (among    other   things)   intentional\n\nmisrepresentation.\n\n           Baghdady told a different story.            He denied promising\nTiller a partnership interest in the Cedar Crest apartments.\n\nInstead, Baghdady testified that Tiller sold the Teledyne stock\n\nherself.     Once the transaction was complete, she loaned him the\n\n$31,000, to be repaid at 10% simple interest, or roughly $250 per\n\nmonth.   In support of that claim, Baghdady produced a hand-written\n\nnote dated August 4, 1971, in which he pledged to repay a $31,000\n\n\"debt\" to Tiller.    Another note, dated the previous day, set out\nthe   parties'   agreement   as     to   interest.     Moreover,    Baghdady\n\nintroduced a series of monthly checks in the amount of $250, marked\n\n\"Int.\" or \"Interest,\" -- and a final check for $31,000, marked \"For\npayment of loan dated August 4, 1971\" -- all of which had been\n\ncashed by Tiller.\n\n           At trial, Tiller called her sister, Violette Haddad, as\n\na witness.     Haddad testified that Baghdady had sold her Teledyne\n\nstock as well, and that he had attempted to make amends                   by\n\npromising her a partnership interest in the Cedar Crest Apartments.\n\nHaddad maintained that Baghdady had no authority to sell her stock.\n\nOn cross-examination, however, defense counsel confronted her with\n\na Power of Attorney, which -- like that executed by Tiller --\n\nauthorized Baghdady to sell Haddad's Teledyne shares. The Power of\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fAttorney was signed by Haddad and Baghdady, witnessed by Tiller,\n\nand   notarized   by   Baghdady's   secretary,   Mary   Cooper.     Haddad\n\nconfirmed that her signature appeared on the Power of Attorney,\nalthough she claimed not to remember signing the document.\n\n            Defense counsel also showed Haddad a hand-written letter\n\ndated April 18, 1977, in which Haddad represented that she had\nauthorized Baghdady to sell her Teledyne shares and that she had\n\nreceived the proceeds of the stock sale except for $15,000, which\n\nshe allowed Baghdady to keep as a loan.          The note was signed by\n\nHaddad and, again, witnessed by Tiller.      Haddad confirmed that the\n\nsignature on the note was hers.\n\n            Defense counsel sought to admit both documents into\n\nevidence.    Tiller's attorney objected that the Power of Attorney\nwas cumulative.    The district court disagreed, stating:         \"There is\n\nnothing cumulative. This is impeaching evidence.\" The 1977 letter\n\nwas admitted without objection, and defense counsel continued\nquestioning Haddad. After a few minutes, he attempted to introduce\n\ninto evidence a check from Baghdady to Haddad's son Nicholas.          The\n\ncheck had been endorsed by Nicholas, and bore the notation \"final\n\npayment\" on both the front and back. Tiller's attorney objected on\n\nthe ground that the check, like the Haddad Power of Attorney and\n\nthe 1977 letter previously introduced, was not \"provided under any\n\ndiscovery in this case.\"      Defense counsel explained that he was\n\n\"responding to information that has just come into the case\" --\n\npresumably, Haddad's testimony that Baghdady had sold her Teledyne\n\nshares without permission, and used the money to invest in the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fCedar    Crest    development.    The     district   court   overruled   the\n\nobjection.1\n\n            Tiller took the stand after Haddad.       Notwithstanding her\nsisterâ€™s testimony to the contrary, Tiller maintained that Haddad's\n\nsignatures on the Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter were\n\nforgeries.2      She also stated repeatedly that her own signatures, as\nwitness to both documents, had been forged.\n\n            At the conclusion of the case, the court submitted\n\nTiller's claim of intentional misrepresentation to the jury.             The\n\nfirst question on the jury form asked the jurors to determine\n\nwhether Tiller had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\n\n     1\n         The entire colloquy reads as follows:\n          MR. TARIOT [counsel for Tiller]: May we approach,\n     your Honor?\n          . . . .\n          THE COURT: No. Do you have an objection?\n          MR. TARIOT: Only in the nature of the fact this is,\n     granted, impeachment evidence, but this was not, nor was\n     [sic] the prior two documents [the Haddad Power of\n     Attorney and the 1977 letter], previously provided under\n     any discovery in this case.\n          MR. MAHONEY [counsel for Baghdady]: I don't think,\n     your Honor, the evidence that Mr. Tariot has identified\n     was identified, or which he has been putting in through\n     the witness was identified in the pre-trial proceedings\n     either. I am responding to information that has just\n     come into the case.\n          THE COURT: Come into the case? I will overrule the\n     objection.\n          MR. TARIOT: Yes, Judge.\n     2\n       Tiller made similar claims regarding the notations on the\nchecks from Baghdady, testifying that Baghdady must have added\nnotations such as \"int.\" or \"interest\" and \"for payment of loan\ndated August 4, 1971\" after Tiller cashed the checks.        She\nmaintained that claim in the face of microfiche records from the\nbank showing that the notations appeared on the checks when they\nwere cashed.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fBaghdady misrepresented to her that she was his partner in the\n\nCedar Crest development.     The jury answered in the negative, and\n\nthe court entered judgment for Baghdady on December 21, 1999.\n          Tiller appealed.    She did not raise any issues regarding\n\nthe production or admission of the Haddad Power of Attorney or the\n\n1977 letter.    Instead, she challenged the district court's refusal\nto admit certain evidence supportive of her claim.    We agreed that\n\nthe court erred in excluding the evidence.    See Tiller I, 244 F.3d\n\nat 14. We concluded, however, that \"the overwhelming weight of the\n\nevidence . . . support[ed] Baghdady's version of this dispute.\"\n\nId. at 15.     Accordingly, we held that the district court's error\n\nwas harmless.    Id.\n\n          While her appeal was pending in Tiller I, Tiller engaged\nthe services of two handwriting experts.   The experts examined the\n\nsisters' signatures on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977\n\nletter.   Both experts concluded, subject to certain reservations,\nthat it was \"probable\" that both women's signatures had been\n\nforged.\n\n           On September 12, 2000 (while her Tiller I appeal was\n\nstill pending), Tiller filed a motion in the district court seeking\n\nrelief from the judgment under Rule 60(b).    The crux of the motion\n\nwas that the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter were\n\nimproperly withheld during discovery and, when produced at trial,\n\ncontained forged signatures.      More specifically, Tiller sought\n\nrelief under Rule 60(b)(1) on the ground that she had suffered\n\nunfair \"surprise\" when Baghdady introduced the two documents at\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ftrial. She also requested relief under Rule 60(b)(2) on the ground\n\nthat the reports of the two handwriting experts constituted \"newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.\"          Finally, Tiller sought relief under Rule\n60(b)(3)    on     the   grounds    that   the       documents   were   forged   and\n\ntherefore constituted \"fraud,\" and that Baghdady's failure to\n\nproduce the documents during discovery was \"misconduct.\"                    Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 60(b)(3) (authorizing relief from final judgment for\n\nreasons of \"fraud . . . , misrepresentation, or other misconduct of\n\nan adverse party\").\n\n            The district court denied the motion by margin order, and\n\nlater     denied    Tiller's     request       for    reconsideration.       Tiller\n\nappealed, challenging only the district court's judgments with\n\nrespect to relief under Rule 60(b)(3).3\n\n                                         II.\n\n            In order to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(3), Tiller had\nto present the district court with \"clear and convincing evidence\"\nthat the     claimed     fraud     or   misconduct      occurred.       Anderson v.\n\nCryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 926 (1st Cir. 1988).                 Next, she had to\nshow that the misconduct or fraud \"substantially interfered with\n[her] ability fully and fairly to prepare for, and proceed at,\n\ntrial.\"     Id.    In other words, the misconduct or fraud \"must have\nbeen harmful -- it must have affected [Tiller's] substantial\n\n\n\n     3\n       Tiller argues on appeal that she is also entitled to relief\nunder Rule 60(b)(6).     That argument was not presented to the\ndistrict court, and we do not consider it. Teamsters, Chauffeurs,\nWarehousemen & Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp.\nCo., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n                                         -7-\n\frights.\"     Id. at 924 (internal alterations and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            On appeal, Tiller faces an additional hurdle. \"When Rule\n60(b) is in play, we ordinarily defer to the trial judge's more\n\nintimate knowledge of the case.\"        Id. at 923.   We will upset the\n\ndistrict court's    judgment   only   if   it   represents   an   abuse   of\ndiscretion.    \"Under this standard, we reverse only if it plainly\n\nappears that the court below committed a meaningful error in\n\njudgment.\"    Id.\n\nA.   Discovery Misconduct\n\n            We turn first to Tiller's claim that Baghdady wrongfully\n\nwithheld the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter, in\nviolation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the district\ncourt's discovery orders.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a).         Baghdady\n\nmaintains that the documents in question were never requested\nduring discovery and that, in any event, Tiller forfeited her claim\nof discovery misconduct by failing to object properly to the\n\nadmission of the evidence at trial, and by choosing not to raise\nthe issue on appeal in Tiller I.\n\n            Our cases make clear that the appropriate course for\n\nparties who uncover discovery violations is \"not to seek reversal\nafter an unfavorable verdict,\" but to request a continuance \"at the\ntime the surprise occurs,\" United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v.\n\nBaker Material Handling Corp., 62 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f(internal quotation marks omitted),4 or to seek exclusion of the\nnewly presented evidence under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c), see Klonoski\n\nv. Mahlab, 156 F.3d 255, 271 (1st Cir. 1998) (explaining that \"the\nappropriate sanction when a party fails to provide certain evidence\n\nto the opposing party as required in the discovery rules is\n\npreclusion of that evidence from the trial\"). Here, Tiller allowed\nthe Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter to be introduced\n\ninto evidence without objection.     Later, when defense counsel\n\nsought to introduce the check from Baghdady to Nicholas Haddad,\n\nTiller argued that the check \"was not, nor was [sic] the prior two\n\ndocuments [the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter],\n\npreviously provided under any discovery.\"   Tiller did not ask that\n\nthe latter documents be excluded as a sanction for discovery\nmisconduct.   Nor is it clear that such a request would have been\n\nproper, given that the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter\n\nalready had been admitted.\n          We do not have to determine whether Tiller's belated and\n\nsomewhat vague objection was sufficient to preserve her claim of\n\ndiscovery misconduct for appeal, however, because Tiller failed\n\n     4\n        Although requesting a continuance may often be an\nappropriate response to surprises at trial, a continuance can be\nproblematic when the requesting party needs to engage the services\nof an expert witness in order to respond to the surprise. That\nengagement can take time, and courts are understandably reluctant\nto countenance lengthy delays in jury trials.       It is unclear\nwhether delay would have been a problem in this case, as Tiller\nalready had retained a handwriting expert to examine documents\nBaghdady produced during discovery. Nevertheless, we do not have\nto decide whether a continuance would have been appropriate here.\nAs explained in the text, we conclude that Tiller forfeited her\nclaim of discovery misconduct by failing to raise it in her first\nappeal.\n\n                               -9-\n\fentirely to pursue that claim in Tiller I.             Indeed, she did not so\n\nmuch as mention the issue of discovery misconduct in her first\n\nappeal.      We   have   held   that    Rule   60(b)   cannot   be   used   as   a\n\"substitute for a timely appeal under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Federal\n\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\"            Ojeda-Toro v. Rivera-Mendez, 853\n\nF.2d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 1988).           Tiller has offered no reason why she\nneeded to wait nearly nine months after the entry of judgment\n\nbefore raising her claim of discovery misconduct. We conclude that\n\nshe forfeited that claim by failing to present it on direct\n\nappeal.5     Accordingly, we express no view as to whether Baghdady's\n\nfailure to produce the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter\n\nduring discovery     violated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or\n\nthe district court's orders.\n\nB.   Fraud\n\n             We turn, then, to Tiller's claim that Baghdady forged the\nsignatures on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter.\nBaghdady maintains that Tiller forfeited that claim as well.\n\nTiller, he points out, \"knew\" in her mind that the documents were\nforged from the moment they were introduced. Nevertheless, she did\nnot present her claims of fraud to the district court at that time,\n\nbeyond her own assertion of forged signatures. Rather than seeking\n\n\n     5\n       We note that Tiller seems to have conceded the point in her\nreply brief: \"The Appellee's Brief asserts that '[h]aving failed\nto seek relief for the alleged discovery misconduct at trial and in\nthe first appeal, Ms. Tiller is barred by waiver and res judicata\nfrom making that claim now.' . . . Mr. Baghdady is correct. . . .\nThe 'relief' sought by Ms. Tiller in this appeal, however, is for\nthe perpetration of a fraud. The discovery misconduct . . . simply\nfacilitated the fraud.\"\n\n                                        -10-\n\fa continuance, a mistrial, or the exclusion of the purportedly\n\nfraudulent evidence, Tiller made a \"conscious decision\" to go\n\nforward on the perceived strength of her own testimony that the\ndocuments were forged.        Parrilla-Lopez v. United States, 841 F.2d\n\n16, 19 (1st Cir. 1988).         In such circumstances, Baghdady argues,\n\nTiller should not be permitted to upset the judgment under Rule\n60(b)(3).         See Ojeda-Toro, 853 F.3d at 29 (\"[A] party may not\n\nprevail on a Rule 60(b)(3) motion on the basis of fraud where he or\n\nshe   .   .   .    has   knowledge   of   inaccuracies   in   an   opponent's\n\nrepresentations at the time of the alleged misconduct.\").\n\n              We need not decide whether Tiller forfeited her fraud\n\nclaim because it is clear that she does not qualify for relief\n\nunder Rule 60(b)(3).         As noted, in order to prevail under that\nprovision, Tiller was required to establish fraud6 by clear and\n\nconvincing evidence.        She has not met that burden.\n\n              Tiller's motion relied on the reports of two handwriting\nexperts, both of whom examined the Haddad Power of Attorney and the\n\n1977 letter.         The first expert, Pauline Patchis, completed her\n\n\n      6\n       Although we have not had cause to delineate the precise\nboundaries of the term \"fraud\" in Rule 60(b)(3), we have observed\nthat it need not rise to the level of \"fraud upon the court,\" as\nrequired to maintain an independent action under the savings clause\nof Rule 60(b), see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (\"This rule does not limit\nthe power of a court to . . . set aside a judgment for fraud upon\nthe court.\"). Reintjes Co., Inc. v. Riley Stoker Corp., 71 F.3d\n44, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1995) (concluding that allegations of \"ordinary\nfraud\" such as perjury may be raised in a timely-filed motion for\nrelief under Rule 60(b)(3), but are insufficient to support an\nindependent action for fraud on the court). It seems clear -- and\nBaghdady does not argue to the contrary -- that intentionally\npresenting forged documents would constitute \"fraud\" within the\nmeaning of Rule 60(b)(3).\n\n                                      -11-\n\freport in January 2000, shortly after the conclusion of the trial.\n\nPatchis   evaluated     Haddad's    signatures     on       copies   of    the    two\n\nchallenged    documents,    comparing      them   to    a    copy    of   Haddad's\nsignature    on   her   passport,   dated   June   1992.         Based     on    that\n\nexamination, Patchis offered her \"preliminary\" opinion that the two\n\nHaddad signatures \"were not, in all probability, authored by the\n'known' writer\" of the signature on the 1992 passport.                    \"In order\n\nto be more conclusive,\" however, she stressed the need for original\n\ndocuments, \"along with additional 'known' signatures attributed to\n\nViolette Haddad, preferable [sic] in the 1970 time frame.\"\n\n            The second expert, Charles Shure, issued his report eight\n\nmonths later.      Shure was asked to examine the signatures of both\n\nHaddad and Tiller on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977\nletter.     He, too, based his evaluation on copies of the women's\n\nsignatures.       With respect to the 1977 letter, Shure offered his\n\n\"professional opinion,[7] subject to applicable limitations imposed\nby copy viewing plus the number and date of available [signatures\n\nfor comparison], that it is:\n\n             1.   Probable that the questioned 'Violette\n             Haddad' signature was written by another\n             person.\n             2.   At least more likely than not that the\n             questioned signature 'Georgette Tiller' was\n             written by another person.\"\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       Shure inserted an asterisk before the word \"opinion\" each\ntime it appeared on his report. It is unclear, however, what those\nnotations were intended to mean.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fShure's opinion was the same for the Haddad Power of Attorney,\n\nexcept that he concluded that it was only \"[m]ore likely than not\"\n\nthat Haddad's signature had been forged on that document.\n          Shure \"reserve[d] the right to re-evaluate any or all of\n\nthe above opinion components pending [an] examination of additional\n\nand/or better (up to including original) evidence should such\nbecome available to [him].\"    He added that \"[i]mplementation of\n\nthis procedure, if possible, is particularly recommended for the\n\nquestioned document[s].\"\n\n          As they stand, the expert reports do not establish clear\n\nand convincing evidence of forgery.    Both experts expressed only a\n\npreliminary opinion that it was \"probable\" that the signatures on\n\nthe Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter were forged.   Both\nmade clear that they could not render conclusive findings on the\n\nmaterials Tiller provided them.       Both requested access to the\n\noriginal documents, and stressed the need for original signatures\n-- or at least more copies -- to use as samples.   Patchis made that\n\nrequest in January 2000.   Tiller ignored it.   Instead, purportedly\n\n\"to remove doubt before expending the time of the lower court,\"\n\nTiller consulted Shure to obtain a second opinion.     Yet, despite\n\nhaving been advised by Patchis of the need for originals, or at\n\nleast copies from the same time frame as the signatures under\n\nreview, Tiller failed to give Shure even an original of her own\n\nsignature.   Nor does it appear that she provided him with samples\n\nof a sufficient \"number,\" or from an ideal \"date,\" despite the fact\n\nthat her own signature can be found more than fifty times in the\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fexhibits the parties submitted at trial -- including on several\n\nchecks from the 1970s.\n\n           Moreover, the experts' tentative conclusions are flatly\ncontradicted by the testimony of Tiller's own witness.             At trial,\n\nHaddad stated unequivocally that the signature on the Power of\n\nAttorney and the 1977 letter was hers.          In an effort to avoid the\nweight of that testimony, Tiller argues that Haddad meant only that\n\nher name had been written on both documents, not that she had in\n\nfact signed them. However, Haddad's testimony makes clear that she\n\nunderstands the difference between a name and a signature.            During\n\ncross-examination,      defense   counsel     asked    Haddad   whether   her\n\nsignature appeared on the 1977 letter. Haddad answered, \"[t]hat is\n\nmy signature, yes.\"       Defense counsel then asked, \"[a]nd is that\nyour sister, Georgette's, signature?\"           Haddad answered, \"I don't\n\nknow.    You will ask her. . . . I don't know it is her signature.\"\n\n            Perhaps recognizing that her own showing is insufficient\nto merit relief under Rule 60(b)(3), Tiller argues that we should\n\npresume fraud because Baghdady did not hire handwriting experts to\n\nrefute the charge of forgery, and because neither he nor Cooper\n\n(who notarized the Haddad Power of Attorney) submitted an affidavit\n\nstating that the disputed signatures were authentic. That argument\n\nignores that Tiller, not Baghdady, bears the burden of proof of\n\nproving fraud.     In light of the inconclusive nature of Tiller's\n\nexpert reports, it is hardly surprising that Baghdady opted to\n\nforego the expense of retaining his own handwriting expert.               Nor\n\nwas he    under   any   obligation   to     buttress   his   opposition   with\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\faffidavits.   Both Baghdady and Cooper denied the charges of fraud\n\nat trial, under oath.\n\n           Given our conclusion that Tiller failed to prove fraud by\nclear and convincing evidence, we need not consider whether the\n\nalleged   wrong   \"substantially     interfered\"    with   her   ability    to\n\nprepare for and proceed at trial.           Anderson, 862 F.2d at 926.      We\nhold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying Tiller's Rule 60(b)(3) motion.\n\n                                     III.\n\n           Tiller   argues    that    the    district   court    abused    its\ndiscretion in refusing to reconsider its judgment in light of our\n\ndecision in Tiller I.        The district court denied Tiller's Rule\n60(b) motion on March 19, 2001.         We decided Tiller I three days\n\nlater.    On April 20, 2001, Tiller moved the district court to\n\nreconsider its denial of her Rule 60(b) motion, invoking our\nopinion in Tiller I as an additional ground for relief.8                   The\ndistrict court rejected that motion as well, again by margin order.\n\n           Requests for reconsideration are committed to the sound\ndiscretion of the district court. \"An appellate court ought not to\noverturn a trial court's denial of a motion for reconsideration\n\nunless a miscarriage of justice is in prospect or the record\notherwise reveals a manifest abuse of discretion.\"          Ruiz Rivera v.\n\n\n\n     8\n       The motion to reconsider made no mention of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n60(b)(6) (authorizing relief from judgment for any reason not\nlisted in subsections (1) through (5)), and we reject Tiller's\nsuggestion that we should treat it as a motion under that\nprovision.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fRiley, 209 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2000).   We find no abuse here,\n\nmanifest or otherwise.   As we explained above, Tiller was not\n\nentitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(3) because she failed to\nestablish fraud by clear and convincing evidence.    Nothing in\n\nTiller I suggests otherwise.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

The motion alleged several grounds for relief, among them discovery misconduct and fraud. The district court denied the motion and later rejected Tiller's request for reconsideration. Tiller challenges both decisions. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We described the facts of the underlying dispute in a previous appeal, and do not repeat them in detail here. <i>See Tiller v. Baghdady,</i> 244 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.2001) (<i>Tiller I</i>). It suffices to say that the parties disagreed as to the significance of a $31,000 transaction between Tiller and her brother, Sami Baghdady. The $31,000 represents the price of stock Tiller owned in a company named Teledyne, Inc. Tiller alleged that Baghdady sold her Teledyne shares without her consent and used the proceeds to finance his investment in a real estate project known as the Cedar Crest Apartments. Although she admitted at trial that she gave Baghdady a Power of Attorney authorizing him to manage her investments, Tiller maintained that she told him not to sell the Teledyne shares: \"You don't touch these. These are untouchables. These are long-term investment for my old age.\" Thus, when she learned of the sale in the summer of 1971, she was furious and demanded that Baghdady repurchase the Teledyne shares. Baghdady told her that he could not afford to buy back the stock because he had used the $31,000 to purchase the property for the Cedar Crest development. Tiller claimed that Baghdady promised her that he would treat the money as an equity investment, making her a partner in the Cedar Crest Apartments. When he later reneged on that promise, she sued, alleging (among other things) intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baghdady told a different story. He denied promising Tiller a partnership interest in the Cedar Crest apartments. Instead, Baghdady testified that Tiller sold the Teledyne stock herself. Once the transaction was complete, she loaned him the $31,000, to be repaid at 10% simple interest, or roughly $250 per month. In support of that claim, Baghdady produced a hand-written note dated August 4, 1971, in which he pledged to repay a $31,000 \"debt\" to Tiller. Another note, dated the previous day, set out the parties' agreement as to interest. Moreover, Baghdady introduced a series of monthly checks in the amount of $250, marked \"Int.\" or \"Interest,\" &#8212; and a final check for $31,000, marked \"For payment of loan dated August 4, 1971\" &#8212; all of which had been cashed by Tiller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Tiller called her sister, Violette Haddad, as a witness. Haddad testified that Baghdady had sold her Teledyne stock as well, and that he had attempted to make amends by promising her a partnership interest in the Cedar Crest Apartments. Haddad maintained that Baghdady had no authority to sell her stock. On cross-examination, however, defense counsel confronted her with a Power of Attorney, which &#8212; like that executed by Tiller &#8212; authorized Baghdady to sell Haddad's Teledyne shares. The Power of Attorney was signed by Haddad and Baghdady, witnessed by Tiller, and notarized by Baghdady's secretary, Mary Cooper. Haddad confirmed that her signature appeared on the Power of Attorney, although she claimed not to remember signing the document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel also showed Haddad a hand-written letter dated April 18, 1977, in which Haddad represented that she had authorized Baghdady to sell her Teledyne shares and that she had received the proceeds of the stock sale except for $15,000, which she allowed Baghdady to keep as a loan. The note was signed by Haddad and, again, witnessed by Tiller. Haddad confirmed that the signature on the note was hers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel sought to admit both documents into evidence. Tiller's attorney objected that the Power of Attorney was cumulative. The district court disagreed, stating: \"There is nothing cumulative. This is impeaching evidence.\" The 1977 letter was admitted without objection, and defense counsel continued questioning Haddad. After a few minutes, he attempted to introduce into evidence a check from Baghdady to Haddad's son Nicholas. The check had been endorsed by Nicholas, and bore the notation \"final payment\" on both the front and back. Tiller's attorney objected on the ground that the check, like the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter previously introduced, was not \"provided under any discovery in this case.\" Defense counsel explained that he was \"responding to information that has just come into the case\" &#8212; presumably, Haddad's testimony that Baghdady had sold her Teledyne shares without permission, and used the money to invest in the Cedar Crest development. The district court overruled the objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tiller took the stand after Haddad. Notwithstanding her sister's testimony to the contrary, Tiller maintained that Haddad's signatures on the Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter were forgeries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> She also stated repeatedly that her own signatures, as witness to both documents, had been forged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the case, the court submitted Tiller's claim of intentional misrepresentation to the jury. The first question on the jury form asked the jurors to determine whether Tiller had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Baghdady misrepresented to her that she was his partner in the Cedar Crest development. The jury answered in the negative, and the court entered judgment for Baghdady on December 21, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tiller appealed. She did not raise any issues regarding the production or admission of the Haddad Power of Attorney or the 1977 letter. Instead, she challenged the district court's refusal to admit certain evidence supportive of her claim. We agreed that the court erred in excluding the evidence. <i>See Tiller I,</i> 244 F.3d at 14. We concluded, however, that \"the overwhelming weight of the evidence ... support[ed] Baghdady's version of this dispute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15. Accordingly, we held that the district court's error was harmless. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While her appeal was pending in <i>Tiller I,</i> Tiller engaged the services of two handwriting experts. The experts examined the sisters' signatures on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter. Both experts concluded, subject to certain reservations, that it was \"probable\" that both women's signatures had been forged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2000 (while her <i>Tiller I</i> appeal was still pending), Tiller filed a motion in the district court seeking relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b). The crux of the motion was that the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter were improperly withheld during discovery and, when produced at trial, contained forged signatures. More specifically, Tiller sought relief under Rule 60(b)(1) on the ground that she had suffered unfair \"surprise\" when Baghdady introduced the two documents at trial. She also requested relief under Rule 60(b)(2) on the ground that the reports of the two handwriting experts constituted \"newly discovered evidence.\" Finally, Tiller sought relief under Rule 60(b)(3) on the grounds that the documents were forged and therefore constituted \"fraud,\" and that Baghdady's failure to produce the documents during discovery was \"misconduct.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) (authorizing relief from final judgment for reasons of \"fraud ..., misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion by margin order, and later denied Tiller's request for reconsideration. Tiller appealed, challenging only the district court's judgments with respect to relief under Rule 60(b)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(3), Tiller had to present the district court with \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the claimed fraud or misconduct occurred. <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,</i> 862 F.2d 910, 926 (1st Cir.1988). Next, she had to show that the misconduct or fraud \"substantially interfered with [her] ability fully and fairly to prepare for, and proceed at, trial.\" <i>Id.</i> In other words, the misconduct or fraud \"must have been harmful &#8212; it must have affected [Tiller's] substantial rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 924 (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Tiller faces an additional hurdle. \"When Rule 60(b) is in play, we ordinarily defer to the trial judge's more intimate knowledge of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 923. We will upset the district court's judgment only if it represents an abuse of discretion. \"Under this standard, we reverse only if it plainly appears that the court below committed a meaningful error in judgment.\" <i>Id.</i> A. <i>Discovery Misconduct</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to Tiller's claim that Baghdady wrongfully withheld the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter, in violation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the district court's discovery orders. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a). Baghdady maintains that the documents in question were never requested during discovery and that, in any event, Tiller forfeited her claim of discovery misconduct by failing to object properly to the admission of the evidence at trial, and by choosing not to raise the issue on appeal in <i>Tiller I.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our cases make clear that the appropriate course for parties who uncover discovery violations is \"not to seek reversal after an unfavorable verdict,\" but to request a continuance \"at the time the surprise occurs,\" <i>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Baker Material Handling Corp.,</i> 62 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> or to seek exclusion of the newly presented evidence under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(c), <i>see Klonoski v. Mahlab,</i> 156 F.3d 255, 271 (1st Cir.1998) (explaining that \"the appropriate sanction when a party fails to provide certain evidence to the opposing party as required in the discovery rules is preclusion of that evidence from the trial\"). Here, Tiller allowed the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter to be introduced into evidence without objection. Later, when defense counsel sought to introduce the check from Baghdady to Nicholas Haddad, Tiller argued that the check \"was not, nor was [sic] the prior two documents [the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter], previously provided under any discovery.\" Tiller did not ask that the latter documents be excluded as a sanction for discovery misconduct. Nor is it clear that such a request would have been proper, given that the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter already had been admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not have to determine whether Tiller's belated and somewhat vague objection was sufficient to preserve her claim of discovery misconduct for appeal, however, because Tiller failed entirely to pursue that claim in <i>Tiller I.</i> Indeed, she did not so much as mention the issue of discovery misconduct in her first appeal. We have held that Rule 60(b) cannot be used as a \"substitute for a timely appeal under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.\" <i>Ojeda-Toro v. Rivera-Mendez,</i> 853 F.2d 25, 28 (1st Cir.1988). Tiller has offered no reason why she needed to wait nearly nine months after the entry of judgment before raising her claim of discovery misconduct. We conclude that she forfeited that claim by failing to present it on direct appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Accordingly, we express no view as to whether Baghdady's failure to produce the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter during discovery violated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or the district court's orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Fraud</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to Tiller's claim that Baghdady forged the signatures on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter. Baghdady maintains that Tiller forfeited that claim as well. Tiller, he points out, \"knew\" in her mind that the documents were forged from the moment they were introduced. Nevertheless, she did not present her claims of fraud to the district court at that time, beyond her own assertion of forged signatures. Rather than seeking a continuance, a mistrial, or the exclusion of the purportedly fraudulent evidence, Tiller made a \"conscious decision\" to go forward on the perceived strength of her own testimony that the documents were forged. <i>Parrilla-Lopez v. United States,</i> 841 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1988). In such circumstances, Baghdady argues, Tiller should not be permitted to upset the judgment under Rule 60(b)(3). <i>See Ojeda-Toro,</i> 853 F.2d at 29 (\"[A] party may not prevail on a Rule 60(b)(3) motion on the basis of fraud where he or she ... has knowledge of inaccuracies in an opponent's representations at the time of the alleged misconduct.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether Tiller forfeited her fraud claim because it is clear that she does not qualify for relief under Rule 60(b)(3). As noted, in order to prevail under that provision, Tiller was required to establish fraud<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> by clear and convincing evidence. She has not met that burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tiller's motion relied on the reports of two handwriting experts, both of whom examined the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter. The first expert, Pauline Patchis, completed her report in January 2000, shortly after the conclusion of the trial. Patchis evaluated Haddad's signatures on copies of the two challenged documents, comparing them to a copy of Haddad's signature on her passport, dated June 1992. Based on that examination, Patchis offered her \"preliminary\" opinion that the two Haddad signatures \"were not, in all probability, authored by the `known' writer\" of the signature on the 1992 passport. \"In order to be more conclusive,\" however, she stressed the need for original documents, \"along with additional `known' signatures attributed to Violette Haddad, preferable [sic] in the 1970 time frame.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second expert, Charles Shure, issued his report eight months later. Shure was asked to examine the signatures of both Haddad and Tiller on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter. He, too, based his evaluation on copies of the women's signatures. With respect to the 1977 letter, Shure offered his \"professional opinion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> subject to applicable limitations imposed by copy viewing plus the number and date of available [signatures for comparison], that it is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Probable that the questioned `Violette Haddad' signature was written by another person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. At least more likely than not that the questioned signature `Georgette Tiller' was written by another person.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shure's opinion was the same for the Haddad Power of Attorney, except that he concluded that it was only \"[m]ore likely than not\" that Haddad's signature had been forged on that document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shure \"reserve[d] the right to re-evaluate any or all of the above opinion components pending [an] examination of additional and/or better (up to including original) evidence should such become available to [him].\" He added that \"[i]mplementation of this procedure, if possible, is particularly recommended for the questioned document[s].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As they stand, the expert reports do not establish clear and convincing evidence of forgery. Both experts expressed only a preliminary opinion that it was \"probable\" that the signatures on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter were forged. Both made clear that they could not render conclusive findings on the materials Tiller provided them. Both requested access to the original documents, and stressed the need for original signatures &#8212; or at least more copies &#8212; to use as samples. Patchis made that request in January 2000. Tiller ignored it. Instead, purportedly \"to remove doubt before expending the time of the lower court,\" Tiller consulted Shure to obtain a second opinion. Yet, despite having been advised by Patchis of the need for originals, or at least copies from the same time frame as the signatures under review, Tiller failed to give Shure even an original of her own signature. Nor does it appear that she provided him with samples of a sufficient \"number,\" or from an ideal \"date,\" despite the fact that her own signature can be found more than fifty times in the exhibits the parties submitted at trial &#8212; including on several checks from the 1970s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the experts' tentative conclusions are flatly contradicted by the testimony of Tiller's own witness. At trial, Haddad stated unequivocally that the signature on the Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter was hers. In an effort to avoid the weight of that testimony, Tiller argues that Haddad meant only that her <i>name</i> had been written on both documents, not that she had in fact signed them. However, Haddad's testimony makes clear that she understands the difference between a name and a signature. During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Haddad whether her signature appeared on the 1977 letter. Haddad answered, \"[t]hat is my signature, yes.\" Defense counsel then asked, \"[a]nd is that your sister, Georgette's, signature?\" Haddad answered, \"I don't know. You will ask her.... I don't know it is her signature.\" Perhaps recognizing that her own showing is insufficient to merit relief under Rule 60(b)(3), Tiller argues that we should <i>presume</i> fraud because Baghdady did not hire handwriting experts to refute the charge of forgery, and because neither he nor Cooper (who notarized the Haddad Power of Attorney) submitted an affidavit stating that the disputed signatures were authentic. That argument ignores that Tiller, not Baghdady, bears the burden of proof of proving fraud. In light of the inconclusive nature of Tiller's expert reports, it is hardly surprising that Baghdady opted to forego the expense of retaining his own handwriting expert. Nor was he under any obligation to buttress his opposition with affidavits. Both Baghdady and Cooper denied the charges of fraud at trial, under oath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our conclusion that Tiller failed to prove fraud by clear and convincing evidence, we need not consider whether the alleged wrong \"substantially interfered\" with her ability to prepare for and proceed at trial. <i>Anderson,</i> 862 F.2d at 926.

Baghdady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199324\"><a href=\"/opinion/199324/tiller-v-baghdady/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001) (<i>Tiller I</i>). It suffices to say that the parties disagreed as to the significance of a $31,000 transaction between Tiller and her brother, Sami Baghdady. The $31,000 represents the price of stock Tiller owned in a company named Teledyne, Inc. Tiller alleged that Baghdady sold her Teledyne shares without her consent and used the proceeds to finance his investment in a real estate project known as the Cedar Crest Apartments. Although she admitted at trial that she gave Baghdady a Power of Attorney authorizing him to manage her investments, Tiller maintained that she told him not to sell the Teledyne shares: \"You don't touch these. These are untouchables. These are long-term investment for my old age.\" Thus, when she learned of the sale in the summer of 1971, she was furious and demanded that Baghdady repurchase the Teledyne shares. Baghdady told her that he could not afford to buy back the stock because he had used the $31,000 to purchase the property for the Cedar Crest development. Tiller claimed that Baghdady promised her that he would treat the money as an equity investment, making her a partner in the Cedar Crest Apartments. When he later reneged on that promise, she sued, alleging (among other things) intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baghdady told a different story. He denied promising Tiller a partnership interest in the Cedar Crest apartments. Instead, Baghdady testified that Tiller sold the Teledyne stock herself. Once the transaction was complete, she loaned him the $31,000, to be repaid at 10% simple interest, or roughly $250 per month. In support of that claim, Baghdady produced a hand-written note dated August 4, 1971, in which he pledged to repay a $31,000 \"debt\" to Tiller. Another note, dated the previous day, set out the parties' agreement as to interest. Moreover, Baghdady introduced a series of monthly checks in the amount of $250, marked \"Int.\" or \"Interest,\" &#8212; and a final check for $31,000, marked \"For payment of loan dated August 4, 1971\" &#8212; all of which had been cashed by Tiller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Tiller called her sister, Violette Haddad, as a witness. Haddad testified that Baghdady had sold her Teledyne stock as well, and that he had attempted to make amends by promising her a partnership interest in the Cedar Crest Apartments. Haddad maintained that Baghdady had no authority to sell her stock. On cross-examination, however, defense counsel confronted her with a Power of Attorney, which &#8212; like that executed by Tiller &#8212; authorized Baghdady to sell Haddad's Teledyne shares. The Power of Attorney was signed by Haddad and Baghdady, witnessed by Tiller, and notarized by Baghdady's secretary, Mary Cooper. Haddad confirmed that her signature appeared on the Power of Attorney, although she claimed not to remember signing the document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel also showed Haddad a hand-written letter dated April 18, 1977, in which Haddad represented that she had authorized Baghdady to sell her Teledyne shares and that she had received the proceeds of the stock sale except for $15,000, which she allowed Baghdady to keep as a loan. The note was signed by Haddad and, again, witnessed by Tiller. Haddad confirmed that the signature on the note was hers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel sought to admit both documents into evidence. Tiller's attorney objected that the Power of Attorney was cumulative. The district court disagreed, stating: \"There is nothing cumulative. This is impeaching evidence.\" The 1977 letter was admitted without objection, and defense counsel continued questioning Haddad. After a few minutes, he attempted to introduce into evidence a check from Baghdady to Haddad's son Nicholas. The check had been endorsed by Nicholas, and bore the notation \"final payment\" on both the front and back. Tiller's attorney objected on the ground that the check, like the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter previously introduced, was not \"provided under any discovery in this case.\" Defense counsel explained that he was \"responding to information that has just come into the case\" &#8212; presumably, Haddad's testimony that Baghdady had sold her Teledyne shares without permission, and used the money to invest in the Cedar Crest development. The district court overruled the objection.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tiller took the stand after Haddad. Notwithstanding her sister's testimony to the contrary, Tiller maintained that Haddad's signatures on the Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter were forgeries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> She also stated repeatedly that her own signatures, as witness to both documents, had been forged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the case, the court submitted Tiller's claim of intentional misrepresentation to the jury. The first question on the jury form asked the jurors to determine whether Tiller had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Baghdady misrepresented to her that she was his partner in the Cedar Crest development. The jury answered in the negative, and the court entered judgment for Baghdady on December 21, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tiller appealed. She did not raise any issues regarding the production or admission of the Haddad Power of Attorney or the 1977 letter. Instead, she challenged the district court's refusal to admit certain evidence supportive of her claim. We agreed that the court erred in excluding the evidence. <i>See Tiller I,</i> 244 F.3d at 14. We concluded, however, that \"the overwhelming weight of the evidence ... support[ed] Baghdady's version of this dispute.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15. Accordingly, we held that the district court's error was harmless. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While her appeal was pending in <i>Tiller I,</i> Tiller engaged the services of two handwriting experts. The experts examined the sisters' signatures on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter. Both experts concluded, subject to certain reservations, that it was \"probable\" that both women's signatures had been forged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2000 (while her <i>Tiller I</i> appeal was still pending), Tiller filed a motion in the district court seeking relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b). The crux of the motion was that the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter were improperly withheld during discovery and, when produced at trial, contained forged signatures. More specifically, Tiller sought relief under Rule 60(b)(1) on the ground that she had suffered unfair \"surprise\" when Baghdady introduced the two documents at trial. She also requested relief under Rule 60(b)(2) on the ground that the reports of the two handwriting experts constituted \"newly discovered evidence.\" Finally, Tiller sought relief under Rule 60(b)(3) on the grounds that the documents were forged and therefore constituted \"fraud,\" and that Baghdady's failure to produce the documents during discovery was \"misconduct.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3) (authorizing relief from final judgment for reasons of \"fraud ..., misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied the motion by margin order, and later denied Tiller's request for reconsideration. Tiller appealed, challenging only the district court's judgments with respect to relief under Rule 60(b)(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(3), Tiller had to present the district court with \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the claimed fraud or misconduct occurred. <i>Anderson v.

Next, she had to show that the misconduct or fraud \"substantially interfered with [her] ability fully and fairly to prepare for, and proceed at, trial.\" <i>Id.</i> In other words, the misconduct or fraud \"must have been harmful &#8212; it must have affected [Tiller's] substantial rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 924 (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Tiller faces an additional hurdle. \"When Rule 60(b) is in play, we ordinarily defer to the trial judge's more intimate knowledge of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 923.

Baghdady maintains that the documents in question were never requested during discovery and that, in any event, Tiller forfeited her claim of discovery misconduct by failing to object properly to the admission of the evidence at trial, and by choosing not to raise the issue on appeal in <i>Tiller I.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our cases make clear that the appropriate course for parties who uncover discovery violations is \"not to seek reversal after an unfavorable verdict,\" but to request a continuance \"at the time the surprise occurs,\" <i>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v.

Here, Tiller allowed the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter to be introduced into evidence without objection. Later, when defense counsel sought to introduce the check from Baghdady to Nicholas Haddad, Tiller argued that the check \"was not, nor was [sic] the prior two documents [the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter], previously provided under any discovery.\" Tiller did not ask that the latter documents be excluded as a sanction for discovery misconduct. Nor is it clear that such a request would have been proper, given that the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter already had been admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not have to determine whether Tiller's belated and somewhat vague objection was sufficient to preserve her claim of discovery misconduct for appeal, however, because Tiller failed entirely to pursue that claim in <i>Tiller I.</i> Indeed, she did not so much as mention the issue of discovery misconduct in her first appeal. We have held that Rule 60(b) cannot be used as a \"substitute for a timely appeal under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.\" <i>Ojeda-Toro v.

Tiller has offered no reason why she needed to wait nearly nine months after the entry of judgment before raising her claim of discovery misconduct. We conclude that she forfeited that claim by failing to present it on direct appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Accordingly, we express no view as to whether Baghdady's failure to produce the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter during discovery violated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or the district court's orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Fraud</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to Tiller's claim that Baghdady forged the signatures on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter. Baghdady maintains that Tiller forfeited that claim as well. Tiller, he points out, \"knew\" in her mind that the documents were forged from the moment they were introduced. Nevertheless, she did not present her claims of fraud to the district court at that time, beyond her own assertion of forged signatures. Rather than seeking a continuance, a mistrial, or the exclusion of the purportedly fraudulent evidence, Tiller made a \"conscious decision\" to go forward on the perceived strength of her own testimony that the documents were forged. <i>Parrilla-Lopez v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502480\"><a href=\"/opinion/502480/juan-parrilla-lopez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19 (1st Cir. 1988). In such circumstances, Baghdady argues, Tiller should not be permitted to upset the judgment under Rule 60(b)(3). <i>See Ojeda-Toro,</i> 853 F.2d at 29 (\"[A] party may not prevail on a Rule 60(b)(3) motion on the basis of fraud where he or she ... has knowledge of inaccuracies in an opponent's representations at the time of the alleged misconduct.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether Tiller forfeited her fraud claim because it is clear that she does not qualify for relief under Rule 60(b)(3). As noted, in order to prevail under that provision, Tiller was required to establish fraud<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> by clear and convincing evidence. She has not met that burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tiller's motion relied on the reports of two handwriting experts, both of whom examined the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter. The first expert, Pauline Patchis, completed her report in January 2000, shortly after the conclusion of the trial. Patchis evaluated Haddad's signatures on copies of the two challenged documents, comparing them to a copy of Haddad's signature on her passport, dated June 1992. Based on that examination, Patchis offered her \"preliminary\" opinion that the two Haddad signatures \"were not, in all probability, authored by the `known' writer\" of the signature on the 1992 passport. \"In order to be more conclusive,\" however, she stressed the need for original documents, \"along with additional `known' signatures attributed to Violette Haddad, preferable [sic] in the 1970 time frame.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second expert, Charles Shure, issued his report eight months later. Shure was asked to examine the signatures of both Haddad and Tiller on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter. He, too, based his evaluation on copies of the women's signatures. With respect to the 1977 letter, Shure offered his \"professional opinion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> subject to applicable limitations imposed by copy viewing plus the number and date of available [signatures for comparison], that it is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Probable that the questioned `Violette Haddad' signature was written by another person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. At least more likely than not that the questioned signature `Georgette Tiller' was written by another person.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shure's opinion was the same for the Haddad Power of Attorney, except that he concluded that it was only \"[m]ore likely than not\" that Haddad's signature had been forged on that document.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shure \"reserve[d] the right to re-evaluate any or all of the above opinion components pending [an] examination of additional and/or better (up to including original) evidence should such become available to [him].\" He added that \"[i]mplementation of this procedure, if possible, is particularly recommended for the questioned document[s].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As they stand, the expert reports do not establish clear and convincing evidence of forgery. Both experts expressed only a preliminary opinion that it was \"probable\" that the signatures on the Haddad Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter were forged. Both made clear that they could not render conclusive findings on the materials Tiller provided them. Both requested access to the original documents, and stressed the need for original signatures &#8212; or at least more copies &#8212; to use as samples. Patchis made that request in January 2000. Tiller ignored it. Instead, purportedly \"to remove doubt before expending the time of the lower court,\" Tiller consulted Shure to obtain a second opinion. Yet, despite having been advised by Patchis of the need for originals, or at least copies from the same time frame as the signatures under review, Tiller failed to give Shure even an original of her own signature. Nor does it appear that she provided him with samples of a sufficient \"number,\" or from an ideal \"date,\" despite the fact that her own signature can be found more than fifty times in the exhibits the parties submitted at trial &#8212; including on several checks from the 1970s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the experts' tentative conclusions are flatly contradicted by the testimony of Tiller's own witness. At trial, Haddad stated unequivocally that the signature on the Power of Attorney and the 1977 letter was hers. In an effort to avoid the weight of that testimony, Tiller argues that Haddad meant only that her <i>name</i> had been written on both documents, not that she had in fact signed them. However, Haddad's testimony makes clear that she understands the difference between a name and a signature. During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Haddad whether her signature appeared on the 1977 letter. Haddad answered, \"[t]hat is my signature, yes.\" Defense counsel then asked, \"[a]nd is that your sister, Georgette's, signature?\" Haddad answered, \"I don't know. You will ask her.... I don't know it is her signature.\" Perhaps recognizing that her own showing is insufficient to merit relief under Rule 60(b)(3), Tiller argues that we should <i>presume</i> fraud because Baghdady did not hire handwriting experts to refute the charge of forgery, and because neither he nor Cooper (who notarized the Haddad Power of Attorney) submitted an affidavit stating that the disputed signatures were authentic. That argument ignores that Tiller, not Baghdady, bears the burden of proof of proving fraud. In light of the inconclusive nature of Tiller's expert reports, it is hardly surprising that Baghdady opted to forego the expense of retaining his own handwriting expert. Nor was he under any obligation to buttress his opposition with affidavits. Both Baghdady and Cooper denied the charges of fraud at trial, under oath.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given our conclusion that Tiller failed to prove fraud by clear and convincing evidence, we need not consider whether the alleged wrong \"substantially interfered\" with her ability to prepare for and proceed at trial. <i>Anderson,</i> 862 F.2d at 926.

That engagement can take time, and courts are understandably reluctant to countenance lengthy delays in jury trials. It is unclear whether delay would have been a problem in this case, as Tiller already had retained a handwriting expert to examine documents Baghdady produced during discovery. Nevertheless, we do not have to decide whether a continuance would have been appropriate here.
