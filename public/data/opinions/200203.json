Petitioner-appellant Anthony\n\nGomes appeals from the district court's denial of his petition for\n\nhabeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, by which he sought review of\n\nan order of deportation.           He contends that he is entitled to\n\ndiscretionary relief pursuant to former section 212(c) of the\n\nImmigration   and    Nationality       Act    (INA),   8   U.S.C.   §   1182(c)\n\n(1995)(repealed), despite the fact that he served more than five\n\nyears of a sentence for an aggravated felony.               We disagree, and\n\naffirm the district court.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n     Gomes is a native and citizen of Trinidad.            He was admitted to\n\nthe United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1972.                    On\n\nAugust 22, 1992, he was convicted by a Massachusetts superior court\n\njury of four counts of rape, and was sentenced to six to twenty\n\nyears' imprisonment.     Gomes apparently began serving this sentence\n\nimmediately, and was released from prison on May 9, 2001.\n\n     On November 30, 1994, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService   issued    an   Order    to   Show    Cause   charging     Gomes   with\n\ndeportability as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.                 See\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). On January 30, 1996, Gomes filed an\n\napplication for a waiver of deportability under former section\n\n212(c) of the INA.1\n\n\n     1\n      While Gomes's application was pending before an immigration\njudge, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (April 24,\n\n                                       2\n\f      On October 23, 1996, the immigration judge held that Gomes was\n\nineligible for former section 212(c) relief pursuant to AEDPA, and,\n\nin   the   alternative,   denied   his   application   as   a   matter   of\n\ndiscretion.    On October 31, 1997, the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(BIA) affirmed the order on the first ground and did not consider\n\nthe alternative basis for denial of relief.        Gomes sought habeas\n\nrelief in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts.    The district court denied his petition on April 9,\n\n2002, holding that Gomes was ineligible for former section 212(c)\n\nrelief because he had served a term of imprisonment for more than\n\nfive years on his felony conviction.\n\n                            II. DISCUSSION\n\n      On appeal, Gomes challenges the district court's rulings of\n\nlaw, which we review de novo.      Costa v. INS, 233 F.3d 31, 33 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n      Former INA section 212(c) provided:\n\n      Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who\n      temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an\n      order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful\n      unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may\n      be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General .\n      . . .\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(c).   While the statutory language specified aliens\n\n\n\n1996).   Section 440(d) of AEDPA amended INA section 212(c) by\ndisqualifying aliens who committed an aggravated felony from\nobtaining former section 212(c) waivers. This amendment does not\napply to Gomes's petition. Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 133-34\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                    3\n\fattempting to reenter the country, we have uniformly interpreted\n\nformer section 212(c) to give aliens in deportation proceedings, as\n\nwell    as   exclusion    proceedings,   the   right   to   apply   for   a\n\ndiscretionary waiver.       Barreiro v. INS, 989 F.2d 62, 63 (1st Cir.\n\n1993); see also, e.g., Attwood v. Ashcroft, 260 F.3d 1, 2 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n       The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-\n\n649, 104 Stat. 4978 (IMMACT), amended former section 212(c) to\n\npreclude an alien who has \"been convicted of an aggravated felony\n\nand has served a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years\" from\n\nseeking a section 212(c) waiver.         Id. § 511(a).      The amendment\n\napplied \"to admissions occurring after the date of the enactment of\n\nthis Act.\"      Id. § 511(b).      The enactment date of IMMACT was\n\nNovember 29, 1990.       Pub L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978.\n\n       On January 30, 1996, Gomes filed an application for a waiver\n\nof deportability under former section 212(c).          The BIA issued its\n\nfinal decision in Gomes's case on October 31, 1997.         By this date,\n\nGomes had served more than five years in prison.            Under IMMACT,\n\ntherefore, he was ineligible for former section 212(c) relief.\n\n       Against this, Gomes offers two arguments.       First, he suggests\n\nthat he is entitled to relief because he had served less than five\n\nyears of his sentence at the time he filed his former section\n\n212(c) application and went before the immigration judge.           We join\n\nthe Second Circuit, however, in holding that the relevant date is\n\n\n                                     4\n\fwhen the BIA issued its decision.           Buitrago-Cuesta v. INS, 7 F.3d\n\n291, 296 (2d Cir. 1993) (\"Just as we credit aliens for time spent\n\nin the country while an appeal is pending before the BIA so that\n\nthey are eligible for § 212(c) relief, we will also consider the\n\ntime aliens spend in prison during the course of a hearing for\n\npurposes of rendering them ineligible for § 212(c) relief.\").\n\nGomes does not dispute that he had served more than five years by\n\nthat time.2\n\n     Second, Gomes questions settled interpretation of the term\n\n\"admissions\" as used in section 511(b).                 He contends that because\n\nhe entered the United States in 1972, nearly two decades before the\n\neffective date of IMMACT, the five-year rule set forth in the\n\nIMMACT amendments does not apply to his case.                 The statutory term\n\n\"admission[]\" does not refer to an alien's initial entry; rather,\n\nquite    confusingly,   it   refers    to    the    alien's      effort   to    seek\n\nadmission through his petition for relief from exclusion under §\n\n212(c).    A.G. Order No. 1531-91, 56 Fed. Reg. 50033 (Oct. 3, 1991)\n\n(\"[T]he    term   'admissions'   [as       used    in    §   511(b)]   covers    all\n\n\n\n     2\n      Gomes also contends generally that IMMACT section 511(a)\nshould not apply retroactively to his conviction.       All of the\ncircuit courts that have considered this argument have rejected it,\nincluding ours. Barreiro, 989 F.2d at 63; see also Scheidemann v.\nINS, 83 F.3d 1517, 1523 (3d Cir. 1996); Samaniego-Meraz v. INS, 53\nF.3d 254, 255 (9th Cir. 1995); Asencio v. INS, 37 F.3d 614, 616-17\n(11th Cir. 1994); Campos v. INS, 16 F.3d 118, 122 (6th Cir. 1994);\nDe Osorio v. INS, 10 F.3d 1034, 1043 (4th Cir. 1993); Buitrago-\nCuesta, 7 F.3d at 296. In any event, Gomes's conviction took place\nin 1992, after IMMACT's enactment date.\n\n                                       5\n\fapplications under the Act for section 212(c) relief, whether\n\nactually made upon application for admission into the United States\n\nor made only after entry.\"); see also Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 114;\n\nBarreiro, 989 F.2d at 63; De Osorio v. INS, 10 F.3d 1034 (4th Cir.\n\n1993).3   Gomes applied for former section 212(c) relief on January\n\n30,   1996,   well   after   the   1990   enactment   date   of   IMMACT.\n\nAccordingly, his admission, for purposes of IMMACT, occurred after\n\nthe effective date set forth in § 511(b), and he is ineligible for\n\nformer section 212(c) relief.4\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n      Although we did not comment specifically on the Attorney\nGeneral's interpretation of § 511(b), we stated in White v. INS\nthat \"[t]he amendment applies to applications for discretionary\nrelief filed after November 20, 1991.\" 17 F.3d 475, 477 n.3 (1st\nCir. 1994) (citing De Osorio, 10 F.3d at 1034).     (In White, we\nmisstated the enactment date of IMMACT; the actual enactment date\nwas November 29, 1990. Pub L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978. The\ndiscrepancy is immaterial to this case.)\n      4\n      Because we conclude that Gomes is ineligible for relief under\nformer section 212(c), the other arguments presented in his brief\nare moot.\n\n                                    6\n\f",

He contends that he is entitled to discretionary relief pursuant to former section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c) (1995)(repealed), despite the fact that he served more than five years of a sentence for an aggravated felony. We disagree, and affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gomes is a native and citizen of Trinidad. He was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 1972. On August 22, 1992, he was convicted by a Massachusetts superior court jury of four counts of rape, and was sentenced to six to twenty years' imprisonment. Gomes apparently began serving this sentence immediately, and was released from prison on May 9, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 30, 1994, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued an Order to Show Cause charging Gomes with deportability as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). On January 30, 1996, Gomes filed an application for a waiver of deportability under former section 212(c) of the INA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 23, 1996, the immigration judge held that Gomes was ineligible for former section 212(c) relief pursuant to AEDPA, and, in the alternative, denied his application as a matter of discretion. On October 31, 1997, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the order on the first ground and did not consider the alternative basis for denial of relief. Gomes sought habeas relief in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The district court denied his petition on April 9, 2002, holding that Gomes was ineligible for former section 212(c) relief because he had served a term of imprisonment for more than five years on his felony conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>DISCUSSION</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Gomes challenges the district court's rulings of law, which we review de novo. <i>Costa v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199160\"><a href=\"/opinion/199160/costa-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Former INA section 212(c) provided:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(c). While the statutory language specified aliens attempting to reenter the country, we have uniformly interpreted former section 212(c) to give aliens in deportation proceedings, as well as exclusion proceedings, the right to apply for a discretionary waiver. <i>Barreiro v.

No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978 (IMMACT), amended former section 212(c) to preclude an alien who has \"been convicted of an aggravated felony and has served a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years\" from seeking a section 212(c) waiver. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 511(a). The amendment applied \"to admissions occurring after the date of the enactment of this Act.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 511(b). The enactment date of IMMACT was November 29, 1990. Pub L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 1996, Gomes filed an application for a waiver of deportability under former section 212(c). The BIA issued its final decision in Gomes's case on October 31, 1997. By this date, Gomes had served more than five years in prison. Under IMMACT, therefore, he was ineligible for former section 212(c) relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this, Gomes offers two arguments. First, he suggests that he is entitled to relief because he had served less than five years of his sentence at the time he filed his former section 212(c) application and went before the immigration judge. We join the Second Circuit, however, in holding that the relevant date is when the BIA issued its decision. <i>Buitrago-Cuesta v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655293\"><a href=\"/opinion/655293/jorge-luis-buitrago-cuesta-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 296 (2d Cir.1993) (\"Just as we credit aliens for time spent in the country while an appeal is pending before the BIA so that they are eligible for &#167; 212(c) relief, we will also consider the time aliens spend in prison during the course of a hearing for purposes of rendering them ineligible for &#167; 212(c) relief.\"). Gomes does not dispute that he had served more than five years by that time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Gomes questions settled interpretation of the term \"admissions\" as used in section 511(b). He contends that because he entered the United States in 1972, nearly two decades before the effective date of IMMACT, the five-year rule set forth in the IMMACT amendments does not apply to his case. The statutory term \"admission[ ]\" does not refer to an alien's initial entry; rather, quite confusingly, it refers to the alien's effort to seek admission through his petition for relief from exclusion under &#167; 212(c). A.G. Order No. 1531-91, 56 Fed.Reg. 50033 (Oct. 3, 1991) (\"[T]he term `admissions' [as used in &#167; 511(b)] covers all applications under the Act for section 212(c) relief, whether actually made upon application for admission into the United States or made only after entry.\"); <i>see also Goncalves,</i> 144 F.3d at 114; <i>Barreiro,</i> 989 F.2d at 63; <i>De Osorio v.

Accordingly, his admission, for purposes of IMMACT, occurred after the effective date set forth in &#167; 511(b), and he is ineligible for former section 212(c) relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While Gomes's application was pending before an immigration judge, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L.

Section 440(d) of AEDPA amended INA section 212(c) by disqualifying aliens who committed an aggravated felony from obtaining former section 212(c) waivers.
