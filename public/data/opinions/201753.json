Webber appeals from\n\nthe   district    court    judgment     which     was    granted    to    his   former\n\nemployer, International Paper Company (“IP”), as a matter of law\n\nnotwithstanding the jury verdict which Webber obtained on his\n\nstate-law disability discrimination claim.                We affirm the district\n\ncourt judgment.\n\n                                          I\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n            We   relate    the    record       evidence,    and    all    reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom, in the light most consistent with the jury\n\nverdict.    See Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 303 F.3d 387, 393 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).      From 1983 and until his termination in 2001, Webber\n\nwas a mechanical draftsman for IP at its paper-manufacturing mill\n\nin Bucksport, Maine.       In 1986, he was promoted to the position of\n\n“engineer,” a job description which required an engineering degree,\n\nwhich Webber did not possess.              In 1989, Webber was assigned to\n\noversee a $1.3 million construction project at the mill site\n\nconsisting of a chemical storage facility.\n\n            In    1997,    Webber       injured    his     knee     while       working\n\ntemporarily as a forklift operator.               Surgery was required.           Over\n\nthe years, Webber had heard other unspecified employees say that\n\n“salaried   people    do    not   get    hurt.”         During    his    post-surgery\n\nconvalescence, Webber's then-immediate supervisor, Stephen Finley,\n\ntold Webber that his knee might heal faster if he lost twenty\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fpounds. Finley and another supervisor, Lawrence Schaub, laughed at\n\nFinley’s remark.        Webber returned to work one month later.                   In\n\n1999, he resumed his former duties as a project engineer, despite\n\nthe fact that his mobility was severely restricted, necessitating\n\nhis use of a cane.\n\n            Webber      requested   that     IP   provide    him    with     several\n\naccommodations, including permission to work from his home, reduced\n\nwork hours, special parking privileges, reassignment from a third-\n\nfloor to a first-floor office, and the installation of a “glide\n\nchair” which would permit Webber to ride from his first-floor\n\noffice to the third-floor engineering department.                  IP granted all\n\nof these requests.        Another supervisor, Steve Moser, dubbed the\n\nglide chair “the Costanza chair,” a reference to a character from\n\na popular television sitcom who used a glide chair to feign a work\n\ndisability.\n\n            In January 2001, Webber underwent total knee-replacement\n\nsurgery.      One month later, a reduction-in-force plan, called\n\n“Functional Fast,” was instituted by IP's national headquarters,\n\nwhich would result in the elimination of 3000 employees nationwide.\n\nIn May 2001, Thomas Thompson, Webber’s immediate supervisor, asked\n\nhim how long it would be before his knee healed.\n\n            In June 2001, Fred Oettinger, the Bucksport mill manager,\n\nlearned    that   the    overall    workforce     was   to   be    reduced    by   21\n\npositions, which was to include an eight-employee reduction in\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f“technical” (viz., non-manufacturing) staff (viz., from 47 to 39).\n\nIP’s national office in Memphis informed Oettinger that other IP\n\nmills of comparable size employed only six project engineers,\n\nwhereas Bucksport had ten.           Rather than eliminate four project\n\nengineers, however, Oettinger decided to cut only two positions.\n\n            Following      consultations       with    the       national   office,\n\nOettinger    eventually      selected    Webber       and    Wayne     Jacobs   for\n\ntermination.     Oettinger notified supervisors Schaub and Moser of\n\nthe decision on Friday, June 22, 2001.                Neither Schaub nor Moser\n\nvoiced objection.         On the following Monday, Thompson approached\n\nWebber and informed him:          \"you're the weakest link, you're gone.\"\n\nThereafter, Oettinger summoned Webber to a meeting, at which Webber\n\nwas notified of his termination.             Adverting to the “quality and\n\nquantity” of Webber’s work, Oettinger explained that he had based\n\nhis termination decision on the fact that Webber was the only one\n\nof the ten engineers without an engineering degree, thus was less\n\ncapable   than    the     other    engineers    of     handling      more   complex\n\nengineering projects.\n\n            In   August    2001,    Webber   submitted       a    disability-based\n\nemployment discrimination claim against IP with the Maine Human\n\nRights Commission (MHRC), received a right-to-sue letter, and\n\ncommenced the instant diversity action in federal district court,\n\nalleging that IP had violated the Maine Human Rights Act, Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. ch. 5, § 4551 et seq.             The district court denied the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fpretrial motion for summary judgment submitted by IP, as well as\n\nits pre-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law.      In due\n\ncourse, a jury returned a $3 million verdict against IP.\n\n          Thereafter, however, the district court granted IP’s\n\nrenewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and vacated the jury\n\nverdict, citing the insufficiency of Webber’s evidence as to IP’s\n\ndiscriminatory animus.    Webber v. Int’l Paper Co., 326 F. Supp. 2d\n\n160 (D. Me. 2004).   Webber appeals from the judgment.\n\n                                 II\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n          A district court judgment entered as a matter of law is\n\nsubject to de novo review, which requires that we view all the\n\nevidence, reasonable inferences, and credibility determinations in\n\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party (viz., Webber).\n\nSee Vazquez-Valentin v. Santiago-Diaz, 385 F.3d 23, 29-30 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b).   Moreover, we will affirm the ruling\n\nonly if we determine that the record, thus viewed, strongly and\n\noverwhelmingly points to but one conclusion – that no reasonable\n\njury would have reached a contrary result.    See Vazquez-Valentin,\n\n385 F.3d at 29-30.   Although the standard for setting aside a jury\n\nverdict is plainly “stringent,” plaintiff-appellant Webber – who\n\nbears the ultimate burden of proof – must have adduced more than a\n\n“mere scintilla of evidence” supporting the elements of his state-\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\flaw claim, id., and cannot prevail where the verdict necessarily\n\nrests upon evidence which is overly speculative or conjectural.\n\nSee Ricci v. Alternative Energy Inc., 211 F.3d 157, 162 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\nB.     Prima Facie Evidence\n\n            As Webber adduced no direct evidence of discriminatory\n\nintent, see Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trustees, 225\n\nF.3d    1115,    1128        (1st   Cir.    2000)    (describing       the   stringent\n\nrequirements of a “mixed-motive” case), his case was subject to the\n\nso-called McDonnell-Douglas paradigm.                    See Reeves v. Sanderson\n\nPlumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142 (2000); Fernandes v. Costa\n\nBros.    Masonry,       Inc.,       199    F.3d   572,    580   (1st    Cir.     1999).\n\nAccordingly, Webber was required to establish a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination, by adducing competent evidence that (1) he was a\n\nmember of a protected class (viz., “disabled”); (2) he satisfied\n\nhis employer’s legitimate job performance expectations; (3) his\n\nemployer terminated him; and (4) his employer did not accord\n\nsimilar treatment to persons outside the protected class.                             See\n\nThorndike v. Kmart Corp., 35 F. Supp. 2d 30, 33 (D. Me. 1999)\n\n(MHRA); accord Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co., 202 F.3d 381, 184\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).             Once the plaintiff succeeds in establishing a\n\nprima    facie       case,    his   employer      must   shoulder   the      burden    to\n\narticulate       a     legitimate,        nondiscriminatory      reason       for     the\n\nplaintiff’s termination.             See Reeves, 530 U.S. at 142.              Once the\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\femployer satisfies that minimal burden of production, the plaintiff\n\nmust bear the ultimate burden of adducing sufficient evidence from\n\nwhich a factfinder rationally might infer that the employer’s\n\narticulated reason is a pretext for discrimination, and that the\n\nreal reason for the termination was discriminatory animus. See id.\n\nIn this endeavor, “‘many veins of circumstantial evidence . . . may\n\nbe mined’ . . . [and] [t]hese include – but are by no means limited\n\nto – evidence of differential treatment, evidence of discriminatory\n\ncomments, statistical evidence, and comparative evidence.” Rathbun\n\nv. Autozone, Inc., 361 F.3d 62, 72 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n            The district court assumed arguendo that Webber had\n\nsatisfied his initial burden to establish a prima facie case,\n\nshifting to IP the burden of production, see, e.g., Hall v. Giant\n\nFood, Inc., 175 F.3d 1074, 1079 (1st Cir. 1999), and on appeal,\n\nWebber does not contend that he established a prima facie case.\n\nInstead, he urges three grounds for determining that the issue is\n\nnot properly before us.\n\n            First, Webber argues that IP waived this argument by\n\nfailing to include it in its motion for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.   But, of course, IP is not the appellant, and we may affirm a\n\ndistrict court judgment on any ground supported by the record on\n\nappeal.     See Geffon v. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f             Second, Webber maintains that he was not required to\n\nestablish       that   the    eight   engineers     retained      by    IP    were    not\n\ndisabled, because, unlike such obvious attributes as race or\n\ngender, disability (or lack thereof) is too difficult of proof. He\n\ncites no authority for such an exception to the fourth element; nor\n\nhave   we    found     any.     Prima    facie    proof    of    coemployees’        non-\n\ndisability may be somewhat more fact-intensive than proof of their\n\nrace or gender, but the burden is neither unreasonable nor onerous.\n\nWebber presumably had ample opportunity to discover this sort of\n\ninformation,       and    had   he    proffered     even    minimally         competent\n\ntestimony       that   the    retained    engineers    suffered        from    no    such\n\ndisability, IP would have had the burden to counter Webber’s\n\nassertions with contrary evidence, if any existed.                     We can discern\n\nno   sound    reason      for   excusing    a    claimant    from      adducing      such\n\nstraightforward evidence as part of his prima facie case.\n\n             Finally, Webber argues that the sufficiency vel non of\n\nhis prima facie case was relevant only during trial, and that after\n\nthe jury verdict, the question became entirely moot.                         See United\n\nStates Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715\n\n(1983).     However, Webber’s reliance on Aikens is misplaced. During\n\ntrial, the plaintiff’s failure to establish a prima facie case will\n\njustify summary disposition, since the employer would not be\n\nrequired to shoulder its burden to articulate a nondiscriminatory\n\nreason    for    the     plaintiff’s     discharge.        The   McDonnell-Douglas\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fparadigm was designed primarily as a procedural mechanism for use\n\nin cases involving no direct evidence of discrimination, in order\n\nto facilitate the orderly presentation of circumstantial evidence\n\nof discrimination. If the employer fails, however, to move for\n\nsummary disposition at this procedural juncture – viz., when\n\nplaintiff fails to state a prima facie case, and voluntarily\n\nassumes its burden of production, the inadequacy of plaintiff’s\n\nprima facie showing, standing alone, is no longer grist for the\n\nsummary judgment mill.     See, e.g., Richardson v. Leeds Police\n\nDep’t, 71 F.3d 801, 805 (1st Cir. 1995).1\n\n          Webber’s argument is flawed, however, because he assumes\n\nthat, after trial, the total absence of evidence which would have\n\ncomprised his prima facie case is irrelevant to the decision\n\nwhether plaintiff met his burden of proof at the third stage of\n\nMcDonnell-Douglas.   While the failure or weakness of a prima facie\n\nshowing will not alone constitute grounds for judgment for the\n\nemployer, it significantly weighs in the balance when we assess\n\nwhether the plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence overall from\n\nwhich a jury rationally might infer that the employer’s articulated\n\nreason constitutes a pretext for discrimination, and that the real\n\nreason for the termination was discriminatory animus.   See, e.g.,\n\n\n     1\n      This rule would not foreclose either a trial court or an\nappellate court from dismissing a plaintiff’s claim after assuming\narguendo – as the district court did in the instant case – that the\nplaintiff made an adequate prime facie showing. See, e.g., Hall,\n175 F.3d at 1079.\n\n                                -9-\n\fBarnes v. City of Cincinnati, 401 F.3d 729, 736 (6th Cir. 2005)\n\n(“Nonetheless, the evidentiary underpinnings of a plaintiff’s case\n\nare not irrelevant or insulated from our examination to aid our\n\ndetermination whether the evidence is sufficient to support a\n\nfinding of intentional discrimination.”); see also Schnabel v.\n\nAbramson, 232 F.3d 83, 89 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\n          Webber admittedly failed either to adduce evidence that\n\nthe eight retained engineers were not disabled, or that IP had\n\nterminated any other disabled employee.          Indeed, the undisputed\n\nevidence discloses that IP and Oettinger had an exemplary record of\n\ngranting accommodations to Webber and to other disabled employees.\n\nAlthough arguably one might reasonably have expected that IP would\n\ncome forward with evidence in the event that any of these retained\n\nengineers had been disabled, this is beside the point inasmuch as\n\nIP did not have to bear that burden of proof.        Webber’s attempt at\n\na prime facie showing was not merely weak.           See Zapata-Matos v.\n\nReckitt & Colman, Inc., 277 F.3d 40, 47 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting\n\nthat “strength of plaintiff’s prime facie case” must be weighed\n\nwith “slight” evidence of pretext); Ricci, 211 F.3d at 162 (noting\n\nthat plaintiff’s case cannot rest on speculation).              As Webber\n\nadduced no evidence from which the jury rationally could have\n\ndetermined   whether   the   retained    or   terminated   employees   were\n\ndisabled, he completely failed to carry his burden of proof on the\n\nfourth element of his prima facie case, which required that he\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fdemonstrate that IP either retained no employees who were disabled,\n\nor terminated other employees who were disabled.                    Given this\n\nevidentiary     gap,   we   next   turn   to   Webber’s    other   evidence    of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\nC.    The Evidence of Pretext\n\n      1.   The Circumstantial Evidence of IP’s Discriminatory Intent\n\n           Webber points to evidence that his supervisors – Schaub,\n\nMoser, and Thompson – had a history of making discriminatory\n\nremarks concerning his disability.             For instance, Schaub laughed\n\nwhen another supervisor told Webber that his knee might heal faster\n\nif he lost 20 pounds.        Then, after IP installed the glide chair,\n\nMoser referred to it as the “Costanza chair” – a reference to an\n\nepisode in the television sitcom “Seinfeld” wherein a character had\n\nused such a chair lift to fake a disability.2             Immediately prior to\n\nthe time Oettinger notified Webber of his termination, Thompson\n\ngloated:   \"You're the weakest link, you're gone.\"\n\n           Webber concedes – as he must – an utter absence of\n\nevidence (i) that Schaub, Moser, or Thompson affirmatively conveyed\n\nany   alleged   discriminatory      animus     to   Oettinger,     who   was   the\n\ndecisionmaker of record, see Cariglia v. Hertz Equip. Rental Corp.,\n\n\n\n      2\n      Additionally, we note that Webber failed to establish when\nthese remarks were made. See Gonzalez v. El Dia, Inc., 304 F.3d\n63, 69-70 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that the relevance of a\ndecisionmaker’s discriminatory remark wanes as the remark becomes\nless proximate in time to the employment decision, thus less\nclosely related to it).\n\n                                     -11-\n\f363 F.3d 77, 85 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussing lack of “infection”),\n\nor    (ii)   that        Oettinger   either      independently      harbored   or\n\ndemonstrated any discriminatory animus toward Webber.                 Therefore,\n\nany alleged animus on the part of Schaub, Moser, or Thompson is\n\nrelevant only if they participated in or influenced the decision to\n\nterminate Webber.          See Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr.,\n\nInc., 399 F.3d 52, 60 (1st Cir. 2005); Cariglia, 363 F.3d at 85;\n\nMarcano-Rivera v. Pueblo Int’l, Inc., 232 F.3d 245, 253 n.2 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).3\n\n             As Webber adduced no evidence that Thompson was involved\n\nto any extent whatsoever in Oettinger’s decisionmaking, we need not\n\ndiscuss any discriminatory remarks allegedly made by Thompson.\n\n             On    the    other   hand,    a    somewhat   closer   question   is\n\npresented by the conduct of Schaub and Moser.                 Webber notes (i)\n\nthat Oettinger consulted with Schaub and Moser three days prior to\n\nthe termination, and (ii) that Moser decided to mull the issue over\n\nduring the weekend.         IP counters that the purported animus on the\n\npart of Schaub and Moser is irrelevant since Oettinger testified\n\n(i)   that    he    was    the    only    decisionmaker    regarding    Webber’s\n\ntermination, (ii) that he simply notified Schaub and Moser of his\n\n\n\n      3\n      Webber contends that Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods.,\nInc., 530 U.S. 133 (2000), modified McDonnell-Douglas so as to\nallow jury consideration of Schaub and Moser’s “stray remarks.” To\nthe contrary, Reeves involved remarks by the decisionmaker, rather\nthan by management personnel who were in no position either to make\nor influence the employment decision. Id. at 151.\n\n                                         -12-\n\ffinal decision, and (iii) that neither Schaub nor Moser either\n\nparticipated in or contributed to the decision.               The truth is to be\n\nfound somewhere between these two characterizations, however.\n\n            Oettinger, who independently harbored no discriminatory\n\nanimus, did testify that he had made up his mind to terminate\n\nWebber prior to the meeting with Schaub and Moser, and that he\n\nconsulted Schaub and Moser to reassure himself that he had not\n\noverlooked any relevant facts.         On the other hand, Moser testified\n\nthat he thought that he could have changed Oettinger’s mind had he\n\nexpressed disagreement with Oettinger’s decision.                   Thus, Moser’s\n\ndecision to mull over the decision during the weekend could support\n\na reasonable inference that Oettinger expected such input.                     In the\n\nend, of course, Moser simply acquiesced in the Oettinger decision,\n\nand there is no evidence that Moser ever told Oettinger that Webber\n\nshould be terminated.       Be that as it may, we shall assume arguendo\n\nthat,    even   in   the   absence    of   any       such   direct,    affirmative\n\ncommunication between Oettinger and Moser, a supervisor’s silence\n\n(viz.,   his    discriminatory   failure        to    utilize    the   veto     power\n\nconferred upon him by his employer) could constitute sufficient\n\n“participation”       or   “influence”     to    warrant        imputing      Moser’s\n\npurported animus to IP.\n\n            The pivotal question thus becomes:                  whether the jury\n\ncould    rationally    infer   from    these     record      facts     that    Moser\n\nconceivably “influenced” the decision to fire Webber?                  We conclude\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fthat such an inference is excessively speculative to sustain the\n\njury verdict. The Moser testimony that he “believed” that he could\n\nhave changed Oettinger’s mind regarding the termination not only\n\nconflicts with Oettinger’s assertion that his decision was final,\n\nbut even more importantly is unsupported by any other corroborative\n\nevidence of Moser’s power to veto these decisions, either prior to\n\nor   following      Webber’s    termination.          Furthermore,         Oettinger\n\ntestified    that    he   did   not   seek    Moser’s      opinion,    but    instead\n\nintended to ascertain whether Moser was aware of any material\n\ntermination-related facts which Oettinger might have missed. Thus,\n\nhad Moser intervened, he would have had to supply facts, yet\n\nOettinger     nonetheless        would       have    remained        the     ultimate\n\ndecisionmaker.       Thus, at best the record evidence could support\n\nonly a most tenuous inference that the Moser decision not to stand\n\nup for Webber proximately caused the Webber termination.\n\n     2.     The Nondiscriminatory            Basis    IP     Proffered       for   the\n            Termination\n\n            In explicating its nondiscriminatory basis for selecting\n\nWebber for termination, IP pointed to his lack of an engineering\n\ndegree, and a consequent, relative absence of experience with\n\nsophisticated engineering projects while at IP.                  Webber argues on\n\nappeal that the trial evidence generated a jury question as to\n\nwhether     the   reason    articulated        by    IP    was   a    pretext      for\n\ndiscrimination, in that (i) his job description had required that\n\nhe possess such a degree, yet IP let him work at IP as a project\n\n                                       -14-\n\fengineer for eighteen years without a degree; (ii) IP did not\n\nestablish   that    Webber   was   incapable    of    handling    any    type   of\n\nengineering project which was, or conceivably might be, undertaken\n\nat IP; and (iii) Webber adduced evidence that he was better\n\n“qualified” than four of the retained engineers with degrees.\n\n            A plaintiff may establish pretext by demonstrating, inter\n\nalia, that the employer articulated a nondiscriminatory reason\n\nwhich had no basis in fact, did not actuate the termination, or was\n\ninsufficiently weighty to motivate such a decision. See Hopkins v.\n\nElectronic Data Sys. Corp., 196 F.3d 655, 662 (6th Cir. 1999); see\n\nalso Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46,\n\n56 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that plaintiff may prove pretext by\n\ndemonstrating      \"weaknesses,     implausibilities,       inconsistencies,\n\nincoherencies,     or   contradictions     in   the    employer's       proffered\n\nlegitimate reasons such that a fact finder could infer that the\n\nemployer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons\").\n\nWebber met none of these criteria.\n\n            As a threshold argument, Webber urges that Oettinger gave\n\nnot one, but two independent reasons for the termination: (i)\n\nWebber's lack of an engineering degree; and (ii) the quality and\n\nquantity of Webber's past work performance.            We do not agree.\n\n            The   record   discloses   that     Oettinger’s      references     to\n\n“quality and quantity” were in explanation of, not in addition to,\n\nthe engineering degree requirement.         That is to say, Oettinger did\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fnot use the term “quality” to imply that Webber’s job performance\n\nhad been deficient.     Moreover, Oettinger testified that, for that\n\nvery reason, he had not consulted Webber’s job evaluations prior to\n\ndeciding to terminate him. Instead, Oettinger stated that the lack\n\nof an engineering degree limited Webber's capacity to undertake\n\njobs of a particular “quality,” viz., more complex engineering\n\njobs, such as those involving the development and maintenance of\n\npapermaking machinery. Webber admittedly had never undertaken jobs\n\nof that nature or complexity, whereas the eight other engineers who\n\nwere retained had done so.         For instance, Moser testified that\n\nWebber   would   have   been    incapable    of   handling    30   out   of   50\n\nengineering projects, and that these projects often had $15 million\n\nbudgets.    Webber’s     most    extensive    project   had    involved       the\n\nconstruction of a chemical storage facility, and although the\n\nproject was budgeted at $1.2 million, it did not involve the\n\ndevelopment and maintenance of papermaking machinery.                Finally,\n\nWebber’s other engineering experience at IP largely consisted of\n\nthis same type of construction and interior design or restoration\n\nproject.\n\n           Moreover, Webber contests neither the legitimacy nor the\n\nnecessity of the IP decision to engage in the RIF, nor that\n\nOettinger was compelled to eliminate some engineer positions at the\n\nBucksport plant.    See Barnes v. GenCorp, Inc., 896 F.2d 1457, 1471\n\n(6th Cir. 1990).   In addition, pursuant to the “business judgment”\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\frule   an   employer   is    free   to   terminate   an   employee    for   any\n\nnondiscriminatory reason, even if its business judgment seems\n\nobjectively unwise.      Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d\n\n526, 537 (1st Cir. 1996) (“‘We may not sit as super personnel\n\ndepartments assessing the merits – or even the rationality – of\n\nemployers’    nondiscriminatory       business   decisions.’”)       (citation\n\nomitted). By the same token, an employee’s opinion of the efficacy\n\nof an employment decision, standing alone, cannot supplant the\n\nemployer’s business judgment.         Id.\n\n            Under the business judgment rule, the possession of a\n\ndegree can be a reasonable criterion for retaining one employee\n\nover another.    See, e.g., Rea v. Martin Marietta Corp., 29 F.3d\n\n1450, 1458 (10th Cir. 1994) (college degree); Barnes, 896 F.2d at\n\n1471 (chemistry degree).          Education, after all, can be a highly\n\nsignificant and concentrated form of experience, and while not an\n\ninfallible    indicium      of   competence,   affords    an   employer     some\n\nobjective assurance that an employee likely possesses the essential\n\nknowledge necessary to perform routine tasks in his field of\n\nexpertise.\n\n            Webber nonetheless contends that he generated a jury\n\nissue by showing that IP subsequently contracted away many of its\n\nmore complex engineering projects to outside engineering companies.\n\nNot only does this contention seek to second-guess Oettinger’s\n\njudgment that he should retain the eight engineers who possessed\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fdegrees, but it ignores the fact that – all things being equal – an\n\nemployer wisely retains those engineers with the latent capacity to\n\nperform the most complex tasks, inasmuch as it follows that those\n\nengineers   could   handle   all    engineering      requirements     from    the\n\nsimplest to the most complex, whereas an engineer in Webber’s\n\nposition would not be capable of handling the complete spectrum of\n\nprojects.    Although IP may have had the luxury of employing non-\n\ndegreed engineers like Webber to handle less complex projects prior\n\nto its 2001 reduction-in-force, it would be entirely reasonable and\n\nprudent to retain employees on its streamlined staff who could\n\nhandle the maximum number of projects in the future.4\n\n            Finally, Webber adduced no competent evidence that four\n\nof the eight retained engineers were “less qualified” than he.                 On\n\ncross-examination,      defense    counsel   asked    Webber   whether       four\n\nspecified   engineers    were     more   qualified    than   he,    and   Webber\n\nresponded in the affirmative.            Since defense counsel did not\n\nspecifically ask him for his opinion as to the qualifications of\n\nthe other four retained engineers, Webber suggests that the jury\n\nreasonably could have inferred that they were less qualified.                 Any\n\nsuch inference would be pure speculation, of course.               As the party\n\n\n     4\n      Given this contingency planning rationale, evidence that IP\nhas continued to do these types of less complex engineering\nprojects in house, while contracting out some of its more complex\nprojects, ultimately proves immaterial. Further, Moser testified\nthat, even when it outsourced a complex engineering project, IP\nnonetheless assigned an in-house engineer to manage and oversee the\nproject.\n\n                                     -18-\n\fwith the ultimate burden of proof, Webber was required to adduce\n\naffirmative evidence as to the alleged inferior qualifications of\n\nthese four engineers.      Even then, of course, IP persuasively may\n\nhave contended that its “business judgment” as to Webber’s and the\n\nfour engineers’ relative qualifications – rather than Webber’s\n\njudgment – was entitled to considerable deference. See Fennell, 83\n\nF.3d at 537.\n\n           The attempt to demonstrate pretext not only fails on its\n\nown merits, but is undercut by the undisputed evidence that IP\n\ngranted   Webber's   and   other   disabled   employees’   requests   for\n\nhandicap accommodations.5     Like the glide chair installation, many\n\nof these accommodations involved significant expense to IP.\n\n     3.    Additional Evidence of Discrimination\n\n           Webber tenders two other peripheral circumstances to\n\nestablish that the articulated reason for IP’s adverse employment\n\naction was a pretext.      First, Webber had heard among IP employees\n\nover the years the expression that “Salaried people do not get\n\nhurt.”    Accordingly, he contends that it is reasonable to infer\n\nthat this report represented a company policy designed to rid\n\nitself of employees who suffered a work-related disability.       We do\n\nnot agree.\n\n           Webber failed to establish the original source of this\n\n\n     5\n      Barbara Gray, an IP employee who had been diagnosed with\ncancer and walked with a cane, testified that IP had granted her\nall necessary accommodations to her disability.\n\n                                   -19-\n\fexpression, hence it would be speculative to infer that any such\n\nrumor was promulgated with either the knowledge or the approval of\n\nIP management.       See Santiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 5\n\nn.8 (1st Cir. 1998) (“The identity of the speaker often is crucial\n\nto ascertaining not only intent but any causal connection between\n\nthe remark and the alleged adverse action directed against the\n\nplaintiff.”); see also Hein v. All Am. Plywood Co., 232 F.3d 482,\n\n488   (6th    Cir.    2000)     (noting   that    evidence     of   employer’s\n\ndiscrimination “cannot be based on rumors”).                 Furthermore, the\n\nexpression is ambiguous, as it also could be construed as mere\n\nrecognition of the truism that salaried employees – or those not\n\ninvolved directly in the paper-manufacturing process and with heavy\n\nmachinery – were generally at less risk for work-related injuries.\n\nSee Fernandes, 199 F.3d at 583 (noting that “a statement that\n\nplausibly     can     be    interpreted     two   different     ways   –   one\n\ndiscriminatory and the other benign – does not directly reflect\n\nillegal animus”).          The trial record afforded the jury neither a\n\nbasis nor the context from which to ascertain which interpretation\n\nwas more plausible.\n\n             Webber notes also that IP transferred two engineers from\n\nthe engineering department to the maintenance department to prevent\n\ntheir termination under the RIF, yet failed to make a similar\n\naccommodation to Webber.          In particular, he points out that IP\n\ncould have transferred him to the open position of supplier quality\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fassurance (SQA) coordinator.             Once again, we do not find such\n\nevidence sufficiently probative of either pretext or discriminatory\n\nanimus.   The transfer of the two engineers is irrelevant, even if\n\nwe were to speculate that they were not “disabled,” because both\n\npossessed engineering degrees, and IP thus had an incentive to\n\nretain their services with the company.\n\n             By the same token, Webber concedes that an employer\n\nundertaking a RIF is not required to offer an employee a transfer\n\nto another job position, see Pages-Cahue v. Iberia Lineas Aereas de\n\nEspana, 82 F.3d 533, 538-39 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"Appellants cite no\n\nauthority    for   the    proposition     that   an   employer   conducting    a\n\nreduction in force must offer such transfers or relocations [to\n\nlesser positions] – in fact, authority exists for the proposition\n\nthat employers face no such obligation.\"); see also Jameson v.\n\nArrow Co., 75 F.3d 1528, 1532 (11th Cir. 1996) (\"We emphasize that\n\nthe   ADEA    does       not   mandate    that    employers      establish    an\n\ninterdepartmental transfer program during the course of a RIF.\");\n\nTaylor v. Canteen Corp., 69 F.3d 773, 780 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"[T]he\n\nADEA does not mandate that employers establish an interdepartmental\n\ntransfer program during the course of a RIF; an employer incurs no\n\nduty to transfer an employee to another position when it reduces\n\nits work force for economic reasons.\"), but contends that Pages-\n\nCahue is factually distinguishable because IP had a stated policy\n\nof retaining engineers (if possible) because of their value to the\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fcompany.         Webber’s     contention        mischaracterizes            the    record.\n\nOettinger testified simply that engineers were valuable to IP, and\n\ndid    not    testify    to   any   “policy”      regarding   the       retention       of\n\nengineers.       In any event, the applicability of such policy to\n\nWebber would be entirely speculative, in that it is unclear from\n\nthe context whether Oettinger was referring only to those employees\n\nin possession of engineering degrees.6\n\n                                         III\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n              Although unfortunate, the record discloses that Webber\n\nfailed to meet his burden of proof to show that the proximate cause\n\nof his termination was         IP’s discriminatory animus.              Webber failed\n\nto offer any evidence either that the employees retained in the RIF\n\nwere not disabled, or that any other terminated employees were\n\ndisabled.       Moreover, he failed to show that any supervisor who\n\nallegedly      made   discriminatory      comments     was    in    a       position   to\n\nparticipate in or influence Oettinger’s decision to terminate\n\nWebber.      Webber likewise failed to demonstrate that IP’s proffered\n\nreason for the termination – the fact that Webber was the only one\n\nof    ten    engineers   without    an   engineering     degree         –    was   either\n\npretextual or designed to mask its discriminatory intent.\n\n              Accordingly, the district court decision dismissing his\n\n\n       6\n      Shortly after Webber was terminated, IP offered to rehire him\nin the SPQ coordinator position at his previous salary, and under\nnew supervisors, but Webber declined IP’s offer.\n\n                                         -22-\n\fMHRA claim must be affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f",

L.L. Bean, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 387, 393 (1st Cir.2002). From 1983 and until his termination in 2001, Webber was a mechanical draftsman for IP at its paper-manufacturing mill in Bucksport, Maine. In 1986, he was promoted to the position of \"engineer,\" a job description which required an engineering degree, which Webber did not possess. In 1989, Webber was assigned to oversee a $1.3 million construction project at the mill site consisting of a chemical storage facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, Webber injured his knee while working temporarily as a forklift operator. Surgery was required. Over the years, Webber had heard other unspecified employees say that \"salaried people do not get hurt.\" During his post-surgery convalescence, Webber's then-immediate supervisor, Stephen Finley, told Webber that his knee might heal faster if he lost twenty pounds. Finley and another supervisor, Lawrence Schaub, laughed at Finley's remark. Webber returned to work one month later. In 1999, he resumed his former duties as a project engineer, despite the fact that his mobility was severely restricted, necessitating his use of a cane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber requested that IP provide him with several accommodations, including permission to work from his home, reduced work hours, special parking privileges, reassignment from a third-floor to a first-floor office, and the installation of a \"glide chair\" which would permit Webber to ride from his first-floor office to the third-floor engineering department. IP granted all of these requests. Another supervisor, Steve Moser, dubbed the glide chair \"the Costanza chair,\" a reference to a character from a popular television sitcom who used a glide chair to feign a work disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2001, Webber underwent total knee-replacement surgery. One month later, a reduction-in-force plan, called \"Functional Fast,\" was instituted by IP's national headquarters, which would result in the elimination of 3000 employees nationwide. In May 2001, Thomas Thompson, Webber's immediate supervisor, asked him how long it would be before his knee healed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2001, Fred Oettinger, the Bucksport mill manager, learned that the overall workforce was to be reduced by 21 positions, which was to include an eight-employee reduction in \"technical\" (<i>viz.,</i> non-manufacturing) staff (<i>viz.,</i> from 47 to 39). IP's national office in Memphis informed Oettinger that other IP mills of comparable size employed only six project engineers, whereas Bucksport had ten. Rather than eliminate four project engineers, however, Oettinger decided to cut only two positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following consultations with the national office, Oettinger eventually selected Webber and Wayne Jacobs for termination. Oettinger notified supervisors Schaub and Moser of the decision on Friday, June 22, 2001. Neither Schaub nor Moser voiced objection. On the following Monday, Thompson approached Webber and informed him: \"you're the weakest link, you're gone.\" Thereafter, Oettinger summoned Webber to a meeting, at which Webber was notified of his termination. Adverting to the \"quality and quantity\" of Webber's work, Oettinger explained that he had based his termination decision on the fact that Webber was the only one of the ten engineers without an engineering degree, thus was less capable than the other engineers of handling more complex engineering projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2001, Webber submitted a disability-based employment discrimination claim against IP with the Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC), received a right-to-sue letter, and commenced the instant diversity action in federal district court, alleging that IP had violated the Maine Human Rights Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. ch. 5, &#167; 4551 <i>et seq.</i> The district court denied the pretrial motion for summary judgment submitted by IP, as well as its pre-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law.

Although the standard for setting aside a jury verdict is plainly \"stringent,\" plaintiff-appellant Webber &#8212; who bears the ultimate burden of proof &#8212; must have adduced more than a \"mere scintilla of evidence\" supporting the elements of his state-law claim, <i>id.,</i> and cannot prevail where the verdict necessarily rests upon evidence which is overly speculative or conjectural. <i>See Ricci v. Alternative Energy Inc.,</i> 211 F.3d 157, 162 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Prima Facie Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Webber adduced no direct evidence of discriminatory intent, <i>see Chuang v. Univ. of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trustees,</i> 225 F.3d 1115, 1128 (1st Cir. 2000) (describing the stringent requirements of a \"mixed-motive\" case), his case was subject to the so-called <i>McDonnell-Douglas</i> paradigm. <i>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <i>Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc.,</i> 199 F.3d 572, 580 (1st Cir.1999). Accordingly, Webber was required to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, by adducing competent evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class (<i>viz.,</i> \"disabled\"); (2) he satisfied his employer's legitimate job performance expectations; (3) his employer terminated him; and (4) his employer did not accord similar treatment to persons outside the protected class. <i>See Thorndike v. Kmart Corp.,</i> 35 F.Supp.2d 30, 33 (D.Me.1999) (MHRA); <i>accord Cruz-Ramos v. P.R. Sun Oil Co.,</i> 202 F.3d 381, 384 (1st Cir.2000). Once the plaintiff succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, his employer must shoulder the burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff's termination. <i>See Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Once the employer satisfies that minimal burden of production, the plaintiff must bear the ultimate burden of adducing sufficient evidence from which a factfinder rationally might infer that the employer's articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination, and that the real reason for the termination was discriminatory animus. <i>See. id.</i> In this endeavor, \"`many veins of circumstantial evidence . . . may be mined' . . . [and][t]hese include &#8212; but are by no means limited to &#8212; evidence of differential treatment, evidence of discriminatory comments, statistical evidence, and comparative evidence.\" <i>Rathbun v. Autozone, Inc.,</i> 361 F.3d 62, 72 (1st Cir.2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court assumed <i>arguendo</i> that Webber had satisfied his initial burden to establish a prima facie case, shifting to IP the burden of production, <i>see, e.g., Hall v. Giant Food, Inc.,</i> 175 F.3d 1074, 1079 (D.C.Cir.1999), and on appeal, Webber does not contend that he established a prima facie case. Instead, he urges three grounds for determining that the issue is not properly before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Webber argues that IP waived this argument by failing to include it in its motion for judgment as a matter of law. But, of course, IP is not the appellant, and we may affirm a district court judgment on any ground supported by the record on appeal. <i>See Geffon v. Micrion Corp.,</i> 249 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Webber maintains that he was not required to establish that the eight engineers retained by IP were not disabled, because, unlike such obvious attributes as race or gender, disability (or lack thereof) is too difficult of proof. He cites no authority for such an exception to the fourth element; nor have we found any. Prima facie proof of coemployees' non-disability may be somewhat more fact-intensive than proof of their race or gender, but the burden is neither unreasonable nor onerous. Webber presumably had ample opportunity to discover this sort of information, and had he proffered even minimally competent testimony that the retained engineers suffered from no such disability, IP would have had the burden to counter Webber's assertions with contrary evidence, if any existed. We can discern no sound reason for excusing a claimant from adducing such straightforward evidence as part of his prima facie case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Webber argues that the sufficiency <i>vel non</i> of his prima facie case was relevant only during trial, and that after the jury verdict, the question became entirely moot. <i>See United States Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,</i> 460 U.S. 711, 715, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983). However, Webber's reliance on <i>Aikens</i> is misplaced. During trial, the plaintiff's failure to establish a prima facie case will justify summary disposition, since the employer would not be required to shoulder its burden to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff's discharge. The <i>McDonnell-Douglas</i> paradigm was designed primarily as a procedural mechanism for use in cases involving no direct evidence of discrimination, in order to facilitate the orderly presentation of circumstantial evidence of discrimination. If the employer fails, however, to move for summary disposition at this procedural juncture &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> when plaintiff fails to state a prima facie case, and voluntarily assumes its burden of production, the inadequacy of plaintiff's prima facie showing, standing alone, is no longer grist for the summary judgment mill. <i>See, e.g., Richardson v. Leeds Police Dep't,</i> 71 F.3d 801, 805 (11th Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber's argument is flawed, however, because he assumes that, after trial, the total absence of <i>evidence</i> which would have comprised his prima facie case is irrelevant to the decision whether plaintiff met his burden of proof at the <i>third</i> stage of <i>McDonnell-Douglas.</i> While the failure or weakness of a prima facie showing will not alone constitute grounds for judgment for the employer, it significantly weighs in the balance when we assess whether the plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence overall from which a jury rationally might infer that the employer's articulated reason constitutes a pretext for discrimination, and that the real reason for the termination was discriminatory animus. <i>See, e.g., Barnes v. City of Cincinnati,</i> 401 F.3d 729, 736 (6th Cir.2005) (\"Nonetheless, the evidentiary underpinnings of a plaintiff's case are not irrelevant or insulated from our examination to aid our determination whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of intentional discrimination.\"); <i>see also Schnabel v. Abramson,</i> 232 F.3d 83, 89 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber admittedly failed either to adduce evidence that the eight retained engineers were not disabled, or that IP had terminated any other disabled employee. Indeed, the undisputed evidence discloses that IP and Oettinger had an exemplary record of granting accommodations to Webber and to other disabled employees. Although arguably one might reasonably have expected that IP would come forward with evidence in the event that any of these retained engineers had been disabled, this is beside the point inasmuch as IP did not have to bear that burden of proof. Webber's attempt at a prime facie showing was not merely weak. <i>See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> 277 F.3d 40, 47 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that \"strength of plaintiff's prime facie case\" must be weighed with \"slight\" evidence of pretext); <i>Ricci,</i> 211 F.3d at 162 (noting that plaintiff's case cannot rest on speculation). As Webber adduced <i>no</i> evidence from which the jury rationally could have determined whether the retained or terminated employees were disabled, he <i>completely</i> failed to carry his burden of proof on the fourth element of his prima facie case, which required that he demonstrate that IP either retained no employees who were disabled, or terminated other employees who were disabled. Given this evidentiary gap, we next turn to Webber's other evidence of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Evidence of Pretext</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Circumstantial Evidence of IP's Discriminatory Intent</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber points to evidence that his supervisors &#8212; Schaub, Moser, and Thompson &#8212; had a history of making discriminatory remarks concerning his disability. For instance, Schaub laughed when another supervisor told Webber that his knee might heal faster if he lost 20 pounds. Then, after IP installed the glide chair, Moser referred to it as the \"Costanza chair\" &#8212; a reference to an episode in the television sitcom \"Seinfeld\" wherein a character had used such a chair lift to fake a disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Immediately prior to the time Oettinger notified Webber of his termination, Thompson gloated: \"You're the weakest link, you're gone.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber concedes &#8212; as he must &#8212; an utter absence of evidence (i) that Schaub, Moser, or Thompson affirmatively conveyed any alleged discriminatory animus to Oettinger, who was the decisionmaker of record, <i>see Cariglia v. Hertz Equip. Rental Corp.,</i> 363 F.3d 77, 85 (1st Cir.2004) (discussing lack of \"infection\"), or (ii) that Oettinger either independently harbored or demonstrated any discriminatory animus toward Webber. Therefore, any alleged animus on the part of Schaub, Moser, or Thompson is relevant only if they participated in or influenced the decision to terminate Webber. <i>See Rodriguez-Torres v. Caribbean Forms Mfr., Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 52, 60 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Cariglia,</i> 363 F.3d at 85; <i>Marcano-Rivera v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 232 F.3d 245, 253 n. 2 (1st Cir.2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Webber adduced no evidence that Thompson was involved to any extent whatsoever in Oettinger's decisionmaking, we need not discuss any discriminatory remarks allegedly made by Thompson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, a somewhat closer question is presented by the conduct of Schaub and Moser. Webber notes (i) that Oettinger consulted with Schaub and Moser three days prior to the termination, and (ii) that Moser decided to mull the issue over during the weekend. IP counters that the purported animus on the part of Schaub and Moser is irrelevant since Oettinger testified (i) that he was the only decisionmaker regarding Webber's termination, (ii) that he simply notified Schaub and Moser of his final decision, and (iii) that neither Schaub nor Moser either participated in or contributed to the decision. The truth is to be found somewhere between these two characterizations, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oettinger, who independently harbored no discriminatory animus, did testify that he had made up his mind to terminate Webber prior to the meeting with Schaub and Moser, and that he consulted Schaub and Moser to reassure himself that he had not overlooked any relevant facts. On the other hand, Moser testified that he thought that he could have changed Oettinger's mind had he expressed disagreement with Oettinger's decision. Thus, Moser's decision to mull over the decision during the weekend could support a reasonable inference that Oettinger expected such input. In the end, of course, Moser simply acquiesced in the Oettinger decision, and there is no evidence that Moser ever told Oettinger that Webber should be terminated. Be that as it may, we shall assume <i>arguendo</i> that, even in the absence of any such direct, affirmative communication between Oettinger and Moser, a supervisor's silence (<i>viz.,</i> his discriminatory failure to utilize the veto power conferred upon him by his employer) could constitute sufficient \"participation\" or \"influence\" to warrant imputing Moser's purported animus to IP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pivotal question thus becomes: whether the jury could rationally infer from these record facts that Moser conceivably \"influenced\" the decision to fire Webber? We conclude that such an inference is excessively speculative to sustain the jury verdict. The Moser testimony that he \"believed\" that he could have changed Oettinger's mind regarding the termination not only conflicts with Oettinger's assertion that his decision was final, but even more importantly is unsupported by any other corroborative evidence of Moser's power to veto these decisions, either prior to or following Webber's termination. Furthermore, Oettinger testified that he did not seek Moser's opinion, but instead intended to ascertain whether Moser was aware of any material termination-related facts which Oettinger might have missed. Thus, had Moser intervened, he would have had to supply facts, yet Oettinger nonetheless would have remained the ultimate decisionmaker. Thus, at best the record evidence could support only a most tenuous inference that the Moser decision not to stand up for Webber proximately caused the Webber termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Nondiscriminatory Basis IP Proffered for the Termination</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In explicating its nondiscriminatory basis for selecting Webber for termination, IP pointed to his lack of an engineering degree, and a consequent, relative absence of experience with sophisticated engineering projects while at IP. Webber argues on appeal that the trial evidence generated a jury question as to whether the reason articulated by IP was a pretext for discrimination, in that (i) his job description had required that he possess such a degree, yet IP let him work at IP as a project engineer for eighteen years without a degree; (ii) IP did not establish that Webber was incapable of handling any type of engineering project which was, or conceivably might be, undertaken at IP; and (iii) Webber adduced evidence that he was better \"qualified\" than four of the retained engineers with degrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff may establish pretext by demonstrating, <i>inter alia,</i> that the employer articulated a nondiscriminatory reason which had no basis in fact, did not actuate the termination, <i>or</i> was insufficiently weighty to motivate such a decision. <i>See Hopkins v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp.,</i> 196 F.3d 655, 662 (6th Cir.1999); <i>see also Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp.,</i> 217 F.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that plaintiff may prove pretext by demonstrating \"weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons such that a fact finder could infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons\"). Webber met none of these criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold argument, Webber urges that Oettinger gave not one, but two independent reasons for the termination: (i) Webber's lack of an engineering degree; and (ii) the quality and quantity of Webber's past work performance. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record discloses that Oettinger's references to \"quality and quantity\" were in explanation of, not in addition to, the engineering degree requirement. That is to say, Oettinger did not use the term \"quality\" to imply that Webber's job performance had been deficient. Moreover, Oettinger testified that, for that very reason, he had not consulted Webber's job evaluations prior to deciding to terminate him. Instead, Oettinger stated that the lack of an engineering degree limited Webber's <i>capacity</i> to undertake jobs of a particular \"quality,\" <i>viz.,</i> more complex engineering jobs, such as those involving the development and maintenance of papermaking machinery. Webber admittedly had never undertaken jobs of that nature or complexity, whereas the eight other engineers who were retained had done so. For instance, Moser testified that Webber would have been incapable of handling 30 out of 50 engineering projects, and that these projects often had $15 million budgets. Webber's most extensive project had involved the construction of a chemical storage facility, and although the project was budgeted at $1.2 million, it did not involve the development and maintenance of papermaking machinery. Finally, Webber's other engineering experience at IP largely consisted of this same type of construction and interior design or restoration project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Webber contests neither the legitimacy nor the necessity of the IP decision to engage in the RIF, nor that Oettinger was compelled to eliminate some engineer positions at the Bucksport plant. <i>See Barnes v. GenCorp, Inc.,</i> 896 F.2d 1457, 1471 (6th Cir.1990). In addition, pursuant to the \"business judgment\" rule an employer is free to terminate an employee for any nondiscriminatory reason, even if its business judgment seems objectively unwise. <i>Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd.,</i> 83 F.3d 526, 537 (1st Cir.1996) (\"`We may not sit as super personnel departments assessing the merits &#8212; or even the rationality &#8212; of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.'\") (citation omitted). By the same token, an employee's opinion of the efficacy of an employment decision, standing alone, cannot supplant the employer's business judgment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the business judgment rule, the possession of a degree can be a reasonable criterion for retaining one employee over another. <i>See, e.g., Rea v. Martin Marietta Corp.,</i> 29 F.3d 1450, 1458 (10th Cir.1994) (college degree); <i>Barnes,</i> 896 F.2d at 1471 (chemistry degree). Education, after all, can be a highly significant and concentrated form of experience, and while not an infallible indicium of competence, affords an employer some objective assurance that an employee likely possesses the essential knowledge necessary to perform routine tasks in his field of expertise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber nonetheless contends that he generated a jury issue by showing that IP subsequently contracted away many of its more complex engineering projects to outside engineering companies. Not only does this contention seek to second-guess Oettinger's judgment that he should retain the eight engineers who possessed degrees, but it ignores the fact that &#8212; all things being equal &#8212; an employer wisely retains those engineers with the latent capacity to perform the most complex tasks, inasmuch as it follows that those engineers could handle all engineering requirements from the simplest to the most complex, whereas an engineer in Webber's position would not be capable of handling the complete spectrum of projects. Although IP may have had the luxury of employing non-degreed engineers like Webber to handle less complex projects prior to its 2001 reduction-in-force, it would be entirely reasonable and prudent to retain employees on its streamlined staff who could handle the maximum number of projects in the future.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Webber adduced no competent evidence that four of the eight retained engineers were \"less qualified\" than he. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Webber whether four specified engineers were more qualified than he, and Webber responded in the affirmative. Since defense counsel did not specifically ask him for his opinion as to the qualifications of the other four retained engineers, Webber suggests that the jury reasonably could have inferred that they were less qualified. Any such inference would be pure speculation, of course. As the party with the ultimate burden of proof, Webber was required to adduce affirmative evidence as to the alleged inferior qualifications of these four engineers. Even then, of course, IP persuasively may have contended that its \"business judgment\" as to Webber's and the four engineers' relative qualifications &#8212; rather than Webber's judgment &#8212; was entitled to considerable deference. <i>See Fennell,</i> 83 F.3d at 537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attempt to demonstrate pretext not only fails on its own merits, but is undercut by the undisputed evidence that IP granted Webber's and other disabled employees' requests for handicap accommodations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Like the glide chair installation, many of these accommodations involved significant expense to IP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Additional Evidence of Discrimination</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber tenders two other peripheral circumstances to establish that the articulated reason for IP's adverse employment action was a pretext. First, Webber had heard among IP employees over the years the expression that \"Salaried people do not get hurt.\" Accordingly, he contends that it is reasonable to infer that this report represented a company policy designed to rid itself of employees who suffered a work-related disability. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber failed to establish the original source of this expression, hence it would be speculative to infer that any such rumor was promulgated with either the knowledge or the approval of IP management. <i>See Santiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc.,</i> 138 F.3d 1, 5 n. 8 (1st Cir.1998) (\"The identity of the speaker often is crucial to ascertaining not only intent but any causal connection between the remark and the alleged adverse action directed against the plaintiff.\"); <i>see also Hein v. All Am. Plywood Co.,</i> 232 F.3d 482, 488 (6th Cir.2000) (noting that evidence of employer's discrimination \"cannot be based on rumors\"). Furthermore, the expression is ambiguous, as it also could be construed as mere recognition of the truism that salaried employees &#8212; or those not involved directly in the paper-manufacturing process and with heavy machinery &#8212; were generally at less risk for work-related injuries. <i>See Fernandes,</i> 199 F.3d at 583 (noting that \"a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different ways &#8212; one discriminatory and the other benign &#8212; does not directly reflect illegal animus\"). The trial record afforded the jury neither a basis nor the context from which to ascertain which interpretation was more plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber notes also that IP transferred two engineers from the engineering department to the maintenance department to prevent their termination under the RIF, yet failed to make a similar accommodation to Webber. In particular, he points out that IP could have transferred him to the open position of supplier quality assurance (SQA) coordinator. Once again, we do not find such evidence sufficiently probative of either pretext or discriminatory animus. The transfer of the two engineers is irrelevant, even if we were to speculate that they were not \"disabled,\" because both possessed engineering degrees, and IP thus had an incentive to retain their services with the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, Webber concedes that an employer undertaking a RIF is not required to offer an employee a transfer to another job position, <i>see Pages-Cahue v. Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana,</i> 82 F.3d 533, 538-39 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Appellants cite no authority for the proposition that an employer conducting a reduction in force must offer such transfers or relocations [to lesser positions] &#8212; in fact, authority exists for the proposition that employers face no such obligation.\"); <i>see also Jameson v. Arrow Co.,</i> 75 F.3d 1528, 1532 (11th Cir.1996) (\"We emphasize that the ADEA does not mandate that employers establish an interdepartmental transfer program during the course of a RIF.\"); <i>Taylor v. Canteen Corp.,</i> 69 F.3d 773, 780 (7th Cir.1995) (\"[T]he ADEA does not mandate that employers establish an interdepartmental transfer program during the course of a RIF; an employer incurs no duty to transfer an employee to another position when it reduces its work force for economic reasons.\"), but contends that <i>Pages-Cahue</i> is factually distinguishable because IP had a stated policy of retaining engineers (if possible) because of their value to the company. Webber's contention mischaracterizes the record. Oettinger testified simply that engineers were valuable to IP, and did not testify to any \"policy\" regarding the retention of engineers. In any event, the applicability of such policy to Webber would be entirely speculative, in that it is unclear from the context whether Oettinger was referring only to those employees in possession of engineering degrees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although unfortunate, the record discloses that Webber failed to meet his burden of proof to show that the proximate cause of his termination was IP's discriminatory animus. Webber failed to offer any evidence either that the employees retained in the RIF were not disabled, or that any other terminated employees were disabled. Moreover, he failed to show that any supervisor who allegedly made discriminatory comments was in a position to participate in or influence Oettinger's decision to terminate Webber.

From 1983 and until his termination in 2001, Webber was a mechanical draftsman for IP at its paper-manufacturing mill in Bucksport, Maine. In 1986, he was promoted to the position of \"engineer,\" a job description which required an engineering degree, which Webber did not possess. In 1989, Webber was assigned to oversee a $1.3 million construction project at the mill site consisting of a chemical storage facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, Webber injured his knee while working temporarily as a forklift operator. Surgery was required. Over the years, Webber had heard other unspecified employees say that \"salaried people do not get hurt.\" During his post-surgery convalescence, Webber's then-immediate supervisor, Stephen Finley, told Webber that his knee might heal faster if he lost twenty pounds. Finley and another supervisor, Lawrence Schaub, laughed at Finley's remark. Webber returned to work one month later. In 1999, he resumed his former duties as a project engineer, despite the fact that his mobility was severely restricted, necessitating his use of a cane.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber requested that IP provide him with several accommodations, including permission to work from his home, reduced work hours, special parking privileges, reassignment from a third-floor to a first-floor office, and the installation of a \"glide chair\" which would permit Webber to ride from his first-floor office to the third-floor engineering department. IP granted all of these requests. Another supervisor, Steve Moser, dubbed the glide chair \"the Costanza chair,\" a reference to a character from a popular television sitcom who used a glide chair to feign a work disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 2001, Webber underwent total knee-replacement surgery. One month later, a reduction-in-force plan, called \"Functional Fast,\" was instituted by IP's national headquarters, which would result in the elimination of 3000 employees nationwide. In May 2001, Thomas Thompson, Webber's immediate supervisor, asked him how long it would be before his knee healed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2001, Fred Oettinger, the Bucksport mill manager, learned that the overall workforce was to be reduced by 21 positions, which was to include an eight-employee reduction in \"technical\" (<i>viz.,</i> non-manufacturing) staff (<i>viz.,</i> from 47 to 39). IP's national office in Memphis informed Oettinger that other IP mills of comparable size employed only six project engineers, whereas Bucksport had ten. Rather than eliminate four project engineers, however, Oettinger decided to cut only two positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following consultations with the national office, Oettinger eventually selected Webber and Wayne Jacobs for termination. Oettinger notified supervisors Schaub and Moser of the decision on Friday, June 22, 2001. Neither Schaub nor Moser voiced objection. On the following Monday, Thompson approached Webber and informed him: \"you're the weakest link, you're gone.\" Thereafter, Oettinger summoned Webber to a meeting, at which Webber was notified of his termination. Adverting to the \"quality and quantity\" of Webber's work, Oettinger explained that he had based his termination decision on the fact that Webber was the only one of the ten engineers without an engineering degree, thus was less capable than the other engineers of handling more complex engineering projects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 2001, Webber submitted a disability-based employment discrimination claim against IP with the Maine Human Rights Commission (MHRC), received a right-to-sue letter, and commenced the instant diversity action in federal district court, alleging that IP had violated the Maine Human Rights Act, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. ch. 5, &#167; 4551 <i>et seq.</i> The district court denied the pretrial motion for summary judgment submitted by IP, as well as its pre-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law.

Accordingly, Webber was required to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, by adducing competent evidence that (1) he was a member of a protected class (<i>viz.,</i> \"disabled\"); (2) he satisfied his employer's legitimate job performance expectations; (3) his employer terminated him; and (4) his employer did not accord similar treatment to persons outside the protected class. <i>See Thorndike v.

Once the plaintiff succeeds in establishing a prima facie case, his employer must shoulder the burden to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff's termination. <i>See Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 142, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Once the employer satisfies that minimal burden of production, the plaintiff must bear the ultimate burden of adducing sufficient evidence from which a factfinder rationally might infer that the employer's articulated reason is a pretext for discrimination, and that the real reason for the termination was discriminatory animus. <i>See. id.</i> In this endeavor, \"`many veins of circumstantial evidence . . . may be mined' . . .

But, of course, IP is not the appellant, and we may affirm a district court judgment on any ground supported by the record on appeal. <i>See Geffon v. Micrion Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199400\"><a href=\"/opinion/199400/geffon-v-micrion-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Webber maintains that he was not required to establish that the eight engineers retained by IP were not disabled, because, unlike such obvious attributes as race or gender, disability (or lack thereof) is too difficult of proof. He cites no authority for such an exception to the fourth element; nor have we found any. Prima facie proof of coemployees' non-disability may be somewhat more fact-intensive than proof of their race or gender, but the burden is neither unreasonable nor onerous. Webber presumably had ample opportunity to discover this sort of information, and had he proffered even minimally competent testimony that the retained engineers suffered from no such disability, IP would have had the burden to counter Webber's assertions with contrary evidence, if any existed. We can discern no sound reason for excusing a claimant from adducing such straightforward evidence as part of his prima facie case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Webber argues that the sufficiency <i>vel non</i> of his prima facie case was relevant only during trial, and that after the jury verdict, the question became entirely moot. <i>See United States Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110899\"><a href=\"/opinion/110899/postal-service-bd-of-governors-v-aikens/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, 715, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110899\"><a href=\"/opinion/110899/postal-service-bd-of-governors-v-aikens/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (1983). However, Webber's reliance on <i>Aikens</i> is misplaced. During trial, the plaintiff's failure to establish a prima facie case will justify summary disposition, since the employer would not be required to shoulder its burden to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the plaintiff's discharge. The <i>McDonnell-Douglas</i> paradigm was designed primarily as a procedural mechanism for use in cases involving no direct evidence of discrimination, in order to facilitate the orderly presentation of circumstantial evidence of discrimination. If the employer fails, however, to move for summary disposition at this procedural juncture &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> when plaintiff fails to state a prima facie case, and voluntarily assumes its burden of production, the inadequacy of plaintiff's prima facie showing, standing alone, is no longer grist for the summary judgment mill. <i>See, e.g., Richardson v. Leeds Police Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></span>, 805 (11th Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber's argument is flawed, however, because he assumes that, after trial, the total absence of <i>evidence</i> which would have comprised his prima facie case is irrelevant to the decision whether plaintiff met his burden of proof at the <i>third</i> stage of <i>McDonnell-Douglas.</i> While the failure or weakness of a prima facie showing will not alone constitute grounds for judgment for the employer, it significantly weighs in the balance when we assess whether the plaintiff adduced sufficient evidence overall from which a jury rationally might infer that the employer's articulated reason constitutes a pretext for discrimination, and that the real reason for the termination was discriminatory animus. <i>See, e.g., Barnes v. City of Cincinnati,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789613\"><a href=\"/opinion/789613/philecia-barnes-v-city-of-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span>, 736 (6th Cir.2005) (\"Nonetheless, the evidentiary underpinnings of a plaintiff's case are not irrelevant or insulated from our examination to aid our determination whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of intentional discrimination.\"); <i>see also Schnabel v. Abramson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771079\"><a href=\"/opinion/771079/philip-h-schnabel-v-gary-abramson-and-legal-aid-society-of-orange-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 89 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber admittedly failed either to adduce evidence that the eight retained engineers were not disabled, or that IP had terminated any other disabled employee. Indeed, the undisputed evidence discloses that IP and Oettinger had an exemplary record of granting accommodations to Webber and to other disabled employees. Although arguably one might reasonably have expected that IP would come forward with evidence in the event that any of these retained engineers had been disabled, this is beside the point inasmuch as IP did not have to bear that burden of proof. Webber's attempt at a prime facie showing was not merely weak. <i>See Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776184\"><a href=\"/opinion/776184/ram-n-zapata-matos-v-reckitt-colman-inc-fka-lf-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir.2002) (noting that \"strength of plaintiff's prime facie case\" must be weighed with \"slight\" evidence of pretext); <i>Ricci,</i> 211 F.3d at 162 (noting that plaintiff's case cannot rest on speculation). As Webber adduced <i>no</i> evidence from which the jury rationally could have determined whether the retained or terminated employees were disabled, he <i>completely</i> failed to carry his burden of proof on the fourth element of his prima facie case, which required that he demonstrate that IP either retained no employees who were disabled, or terminated other employees who were disabled. Given this evidentiary gap, we next turn to Webber's other evidence of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Evidence of Pretext</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Circumstantial Evidence of IP's Discriminatory Intent</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber points to evidence that his supervisors &#8212; Schaub, Moser, and Thompson &#8212; had a history of making discriminatory remarks concerning his disability. For instance, Schaub laughed when another supervisor told Webber that his knee might heal faster if he lost 20 pounds. Then, after IP installed the glide chair, Moser referred to it as the \"Costanza chair\" &#8212; a reference to an episode in the television sitcom \"Seinfeld\" wherein a character had used such a chair lift to fake a disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Immediately prior to the time Oettinger notified Webber of his termination, Thompson gloated: \"You're the weakest link, you're gone.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber concedes &#8212; as he must &#8212; an utter absence of evidence (i) that Schaub, Moser, or Thompson affirmatively conveyed any alleged discriminatory animus to Oettinger, who was the decisionmaker of record, <i>see Cariglia v.

Webber notes (i) that Oettinger consulted with Schaub and Moser three days prior to the termination, and (ii) that Moser decided to mull the issue over during the weekend. IP counters that the purported animus on the part of Schaub and Moser is irrelevant since Oettinger testified (i) that he was the only decisionmaker regarding Webber's termination, (ii) that he simply notified Schaub and Moser of his final decision, and (iii) that neither Schaub nor Moser either participated in or contributed to the decision. The truth is to be found somewhere between these two characterizations, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Oettinger, who independently harbored no discriminatory animus, did testify that he had made up his mind to terminate Webber prior to the meeting with Schaub and Moser, and that he consulted Schaub and Moser to reassure himself that he had not overlooked any relevant facts. On the other hand, Moser testified that he thought that he could have changed Oettinger's mind had he expressed disagreement with Oettinger's decision. Thus, Moser's decision to mull over the decision during the weekend could support a reasonable inference that Oettinger expected such input. In the end, of course, Moser simply acquiesced in the Oettinger decision, and there is no evidence that Moser ever told Oettinger that Webber should be terminated. Be that as it may, we shall assume <i>arguendo</i> that, even in the absence of any such direct, affirmative communication between Oettinger and Moser, a supervisor's silence (<i>viz.,</i> his discriminatory failure to utilize the veto power conferred upon him by his employer) could constitute sufficient \"participation\" or \"influence\" to warrant imputing Moser's purported animus to IP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pivotal question thus becomes: whether the jury could rationally infer from these record facts that Moser conceivably \"influenced\" the decision to fire Webber? We conclude that such an inference is excessively speculative to sustain the jury verdict. The Moser testimony that he \"believed\" that he could have changed Oettinger's mind regarding the termination not only conflicts with Oettinger's assertion that his decision was final, but even more importantly is unsupported by any other corroborative evidence of Moser's power to veto these decisions, either prior to or following Webber's termination. Furthermore, Oettinger testified that he did not seek Moser's opinion, but instead intended to ascertain whether Moser was aware of any material termination-related facts which Oettinger might have missed. Thus, had Moser intervened, he would have had to supply facts, yet Oettinger nonetheless would have remained the ultimate decisionmaker. Thus, at best the record evidence could support only a most tenuous inference that the Moser decision not to stand up for Webber proximately caused the Webber termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Nondiscriminatory Basis IP Proffered for the Termination</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In explicating its nondiscriminatory basis for selecting Webber for termination, IP pointed to his lack of an engineering degree, and a consequent, relative absence of experience with sophisticated engineering projects while at IP. Webber argues on appeal that the trial evidence generated a jury question as to whether the reason articulated by IP was a pretext for discrimination, in that (i) his job description had required that he possess such a degree, yet IP let him work at IP as a project engineer for eighteen years without a degree; (ii) IP did not establish that Webber was incapable of handling any type of engineering project which was, or conceivably might be, undertaken at IP; and (iii) Webber adduced evidence that he was better \"qualified\" than four of the retained engineers with degrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff may establish pretext by demonstrating, <i>inter alia,</i> that the employer articulated a nondiscriminatory reason which had no basis in fact, did not actuate the termination, <i>or</i> was insufficiently weighty to motivate such a decision. <i>See Hopkins v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766759\"><a href=\"/opinion/766759/joseph-j-hopkins-v-electronic-data-systems-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 662 (6th Cir.1999); <i>see also Santiago-Ramos v.

Webber met none of these criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a threshold argument, Webber urges that Oettinger gave not one, but two independent reasons for the termination: (i) Webber's lack of an engineering degree; and (ii) the quality and quantity of Webber's past work performance. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record discloses that Oettinger's references to \"quality and quantity\" were in explanation of, not in addition to, the engineering degree requirement. That is to say, Oettinger did not use the term \"quality\" to imply that Webber's job performance had been deficient. Moreover, Oettinger testified that, for that very reason, he had not consulted Webber's job evaluations prior to deciding to terminate him. Instead, Oettinger stated that the lack of an engineering degree limited Webber's <i>capacity</i> to undertake jobs of a particular \"quality,\" <i>viz.,</i> more complex engineering jobs, such as those involving the development and maintenance of papermaking machinery. Webber admittedly had never undertaken jobs of that nature or complexity, whereas the eight other engineers who were retained had done so. For instance, Moser testified that Webber would have been incapable of handling 30 out of 50 engineering projects, and that these projects often had $15 million budgets. Webber's most extensive project had involved the construction of a chemical storage facility, and although the project was budgeted at $1.2 million, it did not involve the development and maintenance of papermaking machinery. Finally, Webber's other engineering experience at IP largely consisted of this same type of construction and interior design or restoration project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Webber contests neither the legitimacy nor the necessity of the IP decision to engage in the RIF, nor that Oettinger was compelled to eliminate some engineer positions at the Bucksport plant. <i>See Barnes v. GenCorp, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1457</span></span>, 1471 (6th Cir.1990). In addition, pursuant to the \"business judgment\" rule an employer is free to terminate an employee for any nondiscriminatory reason, even if its business judgment seems objectively unwise. <i>Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718191\"><a href=\"/opinion/718191/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1305-34-fedrserv3d-1566-rachel-l-fennell/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 537 (1st Cir.1996) (\"`We may not sit as super personnel departments assessing the merits &#8212; or even the rationality &#8212; of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.'\") (citation omitted). By the same token, an employee's opinion of the efficacy of an employment decision, standing alone, cannot supplant the employer's business judgment. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the business judgment rule, the possession of a degree can be a reasonable criterion for retaining one employee over another. <i>See, e.g., Rea v. Martin Marietta Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674667\"><a href=\"/opinion/674667/alvin-rea-gordon-keepers-robert-reynolds-barbara-weightman-and-barbara/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></a></span>, 1458 (10th Cir.1994) (college degree); <i>Barnes,</i> 896 F.2d at 1471 (chemistry degree). Education, after all, can be a highly significant and concentrated form of experience, and while not an infallible indicium of competence, affords an employer some objective assurance that an employee likely possesses the essential knowledge necessary to perform routine tasks in his field of expertise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber nonetheless contends that he generated a jury issue by showing that IP subsequently contracted away many of its more complex engineering projects to outside engineering companies. Not only does this contention seek to second-guess Oettinger's judgment that he should retain the eight engineers who possessed degrees, but it ignores the fact that &#8212; all things being equal &#8212; an employer wisely retains those engineers with the latent capacity to perform the most complex tasks, inasmuch as it follows that those engineers could handle all engineering requirements from the simplest to the most complex, whereas an engineer in Webber's position would not be capable of handling the complete spectrum of projects. Although IP may have had the luxury of employing non-degreed engineers like Webber to handle less complex projects prior to its 2001 reduction-in-force, it would be entirely reasonable and prudent to retain employees on its streamlined staff who could handle the maximum number of projects in the future.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Webber adduced no competent evidence that four of the eight retained engineers were \"less qualified\" than he. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Webber whether four specified engineers were more qualified than he, and Webber responded in the affirmative. Since defense counsel did not specifically ask him for his opinion as to the qualifications of the other four retained engineers, Webber suggests that the jury reasonably could have inferred that they were less qualified. Any such inference would be pure speculation, of course. As the party with the ultimate burden of proof, Webber was required to adduce affirmative evidence as to the alleged inferior qualifications of these four engineers. Even then, of course, IP persuasively may have contended that its \"business judgment\" as to Webber's and the four engineers' relative qualifications &#8212; rather than Webber's judgment &#8212; was entitled to considerable deference. <i>See Fennell,</i> 83 F.3d at 537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attempt to demonstrate pretext not only fails on its own merits, but is undercut by the undisputed evidence that IP granted Webber's and other disabled employees' requests for handicap accommodations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Like the glide chair installation, many of these accommodations involved significant expense to IP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Additional Evidence of Discrimination</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber tenders two other peripheral circumstances to establish that the articulated reason for IP's adverse employment action was a pretext. First, Webber had heard among IP employees over the years the expression that \"Salaried people do not get hurt.\" Accordingly, he contends that it is reasonable to infer that this report represented a company policy designed to rid itself of employees who suffered a work-related disability. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber failed to establish the original source of this expression, hence it would be speculative to infer that any such rumor was promulgated with either the knowledge or the approval of IP management. <i>See Santiago v. Canon U.S.A., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197805\"><a href=\"/opinion/197805/santiago-etc-v-canon-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 n. 8 (1st Cir.1998) (\"The identity of the speaker often is crucial to ascertaining not only intent but any causal connection between the remark and the alleged adverse action directed against the plaintiff.\"); <i>see also Hein v. All Am. Plywood Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771112\"><a href=\"/opinion/771112/wayne-hein-v-all-america-plywood-company-incorporated-kurt-adam/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span>, 488 (6th Cir.2000) (noting that evidence of employer's discrimination \"cannot be based on rumors\"). Furthermore, the expression is ambiguous, as it also could be construed as mere recognition of the truism that salaried employees &#8212; or those not involved directly in the paper-manufacturing process and with heavy machinery &#8212; were generally at less risk for work-related injuries. <i>See Fernandes,</i> 199 F.3d at 583 (noting that \"a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different ways &#8212; one discriminatory and the other benign &#8212; does not directly reflect illegal animus\"). The trial record afforded the jury neither a basis nor the context from which to ascertain which interpretation was more plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webber notes also that IP transferred two engineers from the engineering department to the maintenance department to prevent their termination under the RIF, yet failed to make a similar accommodation to Webber. In particular, he points out that IP could have transferred him to the open position of supplier quality assurance (SQA) coordinator. Once again, we do not find such evidence sufficiently probative of either pretext or discriminatory animus. The transfer of the two engineers is irrelevant, even if we were to speculate that they were not \"disabled,\" because both possessed engineering degrees, and IP thus had an incentive to retain their services with the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, Webber concedes that an employer undertaking a RIF is not required to offer an employee a transfer to another job position, <i>see Pages-Cahue v. Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196727\"><a href=\"/opinion/196727/pages-cahue-v-iberia/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span>, 538-39 (1st Cir.1996) (\"Appellants cite no authority for the proposition that an employer conducting a reduction in force must offer such transfers or relocations [to lesser positions] &#8212; in fact, authority exists for the proposition that employers face no such obligation.\"); <i>see also Jameson v.

Webber's contention mischaracterizes the record. Oettinger testified simply that engineers were valuable to IP, and did not testify to any \"policy\" regarding the retention of engineers. In any event, the applicability of such policy to Webber would be entirely speculative, in that it is unclear from the context whether Oettinger was referring only to those employees in possession of engineering degrees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>CONCLUSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although unfortunate, the record discloses that Webber failed to meet his burden of proof to show that the proximate cause of his termination was IP's discriminatory animus. Webber failed to offer any evidence either that the employees retained in the RIF were not disabled, or that any other terminated employees were disabled. Moreover, he failed to show that any supervisor who allegedly made discriminatory comments was in a position to participate in or influence Oettinger's decision to terminate Webber. Webber likewise failed to demonstrate that IP's proffered reason for the termination &#8212; the fact that Webber was the only one of ten engineers without an engineering degree &#8212; was either pretextual or designed to mask its discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court decision dismissing his MHRA claim must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This rule would not foreclose either a trial court or an appellate court from dismissing a plaintiff's claim after assuming<i>arguendo</i>&#8212;as the district court did in the instant case&#8212;that the plaintiff made an adequate prime facie showing. <i>See, e.g., Hall,</i> 175 F.3d at 1079.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Additionally, we note that Webber failed to establish when these remarks were made<i>See Gonzalez v.
