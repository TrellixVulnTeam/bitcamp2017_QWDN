This maritime insurance case from\n\nPuerto Rico arises on interlocutory appeal from the denial of the\n\nplaintiff insurers' motion for summary judgment that payment under\n\nits policy was excused by the insured's breach of warranty.                            The\n\nprevailing view, both in federal law and state maritime insurance\n\nlaw, is that a breach of a warranty will excuse the maritime\n\ninsurer from payment regardless of any causal connection to the\n\nloss. The district court erroneously applied a different view. We\n\nreverse   the       district   court      and     direct      entry   of    judgment   for\n\nplaintiff insurers.\n\n                                            I.\n\n              As this comes to us on appeal from a motion for summary\n\njudgment, we review the district court's ruling de novo, taking the\n\nfacts    in    the    light    most       favorable      to    the    nonmovants,      the\n\ndefendants.         Rosado-Quiñones v. Toledo, 528 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2008); Littlefield v. Acadia Ins. Co., 392 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n              The    plaintiffs,      a    group    of     insurance       companies   and\n\nunderwriters including Lloyd's of London, Gothaer Versicherungen\n\nAG, Great Lakes Reinsurance (UK) PLC, and ING Insurance SA, issued\n\nan insurance policy to William Pagán-Sánchez which provided hull,\n\nmachinery, and liability coverage for his recently purchased forty-\n\nthree-foot pleasure boat, the Gabriella.                      The effective dates of\n\nthe policy were from January 31, 2003 to January 31, 2004.                             The\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fpolicy was embodied in a twelve-page insuring agreement which\n\nincludes     a    three-page     section   entitled     \"General   Conditions     &\n\nWarranties.\"\n\n              On July 19, 2003, as the Gabriella was traveling to\n\nCulebra, an island off of Puerto Rico, an exhaust hose came loose\n\nand the Gabriella began taking on water through the boat's exhaust\n\nsystem.      Attempts to pump out the water were unsuccessful, and the\n\nGabriella flooded and sank. The insured later submitted a claim to\n\nthe plaintiffs for $175,000 for the loss of the boat and $100,000\n\nfor the costs incurred during salvage operations.\n\n              The    insurers      began        an   investigation       into   the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the accident.               The investigation found,\n\ninter alia, 1) that the loss of the Gabriella was caused by wear\n\nand tear, gradual deterioration, and lack of maintenance; and 2)\n\nthat   the    vessel's    fire    extinguishing       equipment    had    not   been\n\ninspected or certified within the preceding year, and that the\n\nautomatic        engine   room     fire    extinguisher     system       had    been\n\ndisconnected prior to the loss.            There was no finding, and it has\n\nnever been asserted by the insurers, that the condition of the fire\n\nextinguishing equipment had any relation whatsoever to the sinking\n\nof the boat.        However, the insurers do assert that the lack of\n\nmaintenance of the fire extinguishing equipment violated an express\n\nwarranty of the insurance contract providing that \"such [fire\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fextinguishing] equipment is properly installed and is maintained in\n\ngood working order.\"\n\n            The plaintiff insurers then sought a declaratory judgment\n\nin federal district court in Puerto Rico that the breach by the\n\ninsured    of   the   fire    extinguisher    warranty1    in     the      insurance\n\ncontract precluded payment of the insured's claim.                The defendants\n\ndenied all the allegations and counterclaimed under the insurance\n\ncontract for the amount of their original insurance claim.\n\n            Plaintiff insurers moved for summary judgment.                      The\n\nmotion was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended that\n\nsummary judgment be denied and that triable issues of material fact\n\nexisted.    In an unpublished order, the district court adopted in\n\npart the magistrate judge's recommendations and denied the motion\n\nfor   summary    judgment.       Plaintiffs    then    filed      a   motion    for\n\nreconsideration which was also denied in another unpublished order.\n\nWe describe below the portions of the district court's reasoning\n\nthat are pertinent to our analysis.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            Appellate        jurisdiction     exists      under       28     U.S.C.\n\n§ 1292(a)(3), which provides this court with jurisdiction over\n\ninterlocutory appeals in admiralty cases of orders determining the\n\nrights and liabilities of the parties.\n\n\n      1\n          The plaintiff insurers also alleged that the insured was\nin breach of other warranties -- all unrelated to the loss itself\n-- but none of those allegations are raised on appeal.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f           Our review of the district court's summary judgment\n\nruling is de novo.   Littlefield, 392 F.3d at 6.    As framed by the\n\nparties and the district court, two key issues must be addressed\n\nfor summary judgment purposes.     The first issue is whether the\n\ncontested maritime insurance warranty clause is ambiguous.       The\n\nsecond is whether, if the clause is not ambiguous and has been\n\nbreached by the insured, the breach excuses the insurer from\n\npayment.\n\nA.         Ambiguity of the Fire Extinguisher Warranty Clause\n\n           The district court erroneously held the fire extinguisher\n\nwarranty clause was ambiguous.2        Subsection 9 of the policy is\n\nentitled \"General Conditions and Warranties.\"     Subsection 9(l) of\n\nthe policy provides:\n\n           If the scheduled vessel is fitted with fire\n           extinguishing equipment, then it is warranted\n           that such equipment is properly installed and\n           is maintained in good working order.      This\n           includes the weighing of tanks once a year and\n           recharging as necessary.\n\nThis clause follows after subsection 9(k), which provides:\n\n           It is warranted that covered persons must at\n           all times comply with relevant Statutes, Laws,\n           by-laws   and  US   Coast   Guard  and   other\n\n\n     2\n          The district court initially found it unnecessary to\ndecide whether the fire extinguisher warranty clause was ambiguous\nbecause it held that even if the insured were in breach of the\nclause, that breach would have no effect on the insured's ability\nto recover under the policy. But in its denial of the insurers'\nmotion for reconsideration, the court changed its position and\nruled that the clause was a warranty clause, not a representation,\nand that it was ambiguous.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f            regulations,   governing        the   use     of     the\n            scheduled vessel.\n\nIt is clear that subsection 9(l) is a warranty provision.                   The\n\nclause plainly states that it is a warranty and it is located in\n\nthe section of the policy where warranties are set forth.\n\n            The contract interpretation question of whether there is\n\nan ambiguity in the warranty clause is one for the court.                  See\n\nLittlefield, 392 F.3d at 6 (\"Whether there is any ambiguity in\n\n[provisions of a maritime insurance contract] is a question of law\n\nfor the court to determine.\"); see also Tropeano v. Dorman, 441\n\nF.3d 69, 75 (1st Cir. 2006) (\"The question of whether a contract is\n\nambiguous is one for the courts.\"); 2 L.R. Russ & T.F. Segalla,\n\nCouch on Insurance § 21:13 (3d ed. 2008) (\"Whether or not a\n\ncontract of insurance is ambiguous is a question of law for the\n\ncourt . . . .\").   It is a question we review de novo.            Littlefield,\n\n392 F.3d at 6; Crowe v. Bolduc, 365 F.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nThere is no ambiguity in the warranty clause at issue here.\n\n            The first sentence of subsection 9(l) is a warranty from\n\nthe insured that if the vessel is fitted with fire extinguishing\n\nequipment, as the vessel here was, such equipment is properly\n\ninstalled   and   maintained    in   good   working     order.     The   second\n\nsentence    provides   the     further     definition    that    such    proper\n\ninstallation and maintenance includes \"the weighing of tanks once\n\na year and recharging as necessary.\" This is a promissory warranty\n\non the part of the insured.          See 6 Couch on Insurance, supra, §\n\n                                     -7-\n\f81:14 (promissory warranty is \"one by which the insured stipulates\n\nthat something shall be done or omitted after the policy takes\n\neffect and during its continuance\"); see also Commercial Union Ins.\n\nCo. v. Flagship Marine Servs., Inc., 190 F.3d 26, 31 (2d Cir. 1999)\n\n(defining warranty as \"a promise 'by which the assured undertakes\n\nthat some particular thing shall or shall not be done, or that some\n\ncondition shall be fulfilled'\" (quoting L.J. Buglass,                Marine\n\nInsurance & General Average in the United States 27 (2d ed.\n\n1981))).\n\n            The date that the parties entered into the insurance\n\ncontract does not matter.      The insured warrants upon entering into\n\nthe policy that the tanks have been weighed once a year and, if\n\nnecessary, recharged, as part of the insured's warranty of proper\n\nmaintenance of fire extinguishing equipment.         That this is a clear\n\nobligation is reinforced by the introductory clause in the contract\n\nthat states: \"We will provide the insurance coverage described in\n\nthis insuring agreement, in return for payment to us of the premium\n\ndue   and   compliance   by   covered    persons   with   the   provisions,\n\nconditions and warranties of this insuring agreement.\"            (Emphasis\n\nadded.)\n\n            Since the warranty is clear and unambiguous, it must be\n\nenforced as written under usual insurance law.             See 2 Couch on\n\nInsurance, supra, § 21:11 (\"[I]t is a well settled rule . . . that\n\nclear and unambiguous clauses must be accepted as the expression of\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fthe   intent      of   the   parties,   and   enforced   by    the   courts   as\n\nwritten.\").\n\n             It is also undisputed that the insured failed to produce\n\nany evidence of compliance with the promissory warranty relating to\n\nthe fire extinguishers.          Thus, the insured was in breach of the\n\npromissory warranty.\n\nB.           Consequences of the Breach of Warranty\n\n             In light of the insured's breach, the question, then, is\n\nthe effect of this breach.\n\n             The district court reasoned that Puerto Rico law would\n\napply.    It acknowledged that Chapter 11 of Puerto Rico's Insurance\n\nCode,     which   covers     contract   interpretation   and    construction,\n\nexpressly excludes maritime insurance contracts from its coverage.3\n\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1101(1) (\"The applicable provisions\n\nof this chapter shall apply to insurances other than ocean marine\n\n. . . insurances . . . .\").         The court reasoned it should turn by\n\ndefault to the Puerto Rico Civil Code.              In the absence of any\n\nstatute or case law on point, the court predicted that under the\n\nPuerto Rico Civil Code the breach of a warranty clause in a\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          Chapter 11 provides that for cases within its coverage\n(that is, non-maritime insurance policies)    misrepresentations,\nomissions, concealment of acts, and incorrect statements only\nprevent coverage when, inter alia, they materially alter the risk\nassumed by the insurer. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1110. We do not\nreach the question of whether the breach would prevent coverage\nunder that provision.\n\n                                        -9-\n\fcontract of maritime insurance would not excuse payment by an\n\ninsurer unless the breach was related to the cause of the loss.\n\n          The insurers agree with the district court that \"Puerto\n\nRico law is silent on the issue\" and that \"the majority rule with\n\nrespect to warranty breaches is similar to the federal admiralty\n\nrule inasmuch as[] both treat any breach as having the effect of\n\nvoiding coverage in its entirety.\"    Op. and Order Den. Mot. for\n\nRecons., at 6.   That being so, the insurers argue, even if Puerto\n\nRico law would apply, it would apply as substantive law the\n\nmajority rule that a breach of a promissory warranty excuses the\n\ninsurer from coverage.\n\n          We turn to the relevant principles of choice of law\n\nanalysis as most recently set forth by the Supreme Court in Norfolk\n\nSouthern Railway Co. v. Kirby, 543 U.S. 14 (2004).4        Norfolk\n\nSouthern clarified the Supreme Court's earlier choice of law\n\nanalysis for maritime insurance contracts set forth in Wilburn Boat\n\nCo. v. Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., 348 U.S. 310, 314 (1955).5\n\n\n     4\n          Unfortunately, neither of the parties called this case to\nthe attention of either this court or the district court.\n     5\n          There is general agreement that maritime insurance\ncontracts fall within federal maritime jurisdiction, and as such,\nCongress and the courts have the power to fashion federal rules.\nWilburn Boat, 348 U.S. at 314. As we have noted before,\n          [b]eneath this surface agreement on general\n          principles lies an abyss of confusion.    One\n          might think that construing a maritime\n          insurance policy, in relation to damage\n          occurring on the high seas, would be a\n          paradigm case for a uniform body of federal\n\n                               -10-\n\fNorfolk Southern stated the general rule that \"[w]hen a contract is\n\na maritime one, and the dispute is not inherently local, federal\n\nlaw controls the contract interpretation.\"                 Id. at 22-23.        This\n\nlawmaking power in the federal courts stems from the Constitution's\n\ngrant of admiralty jurisdiction to federal courts.                 See id. at 23;\n\nWilburn Boat, 348 U.S. at 314; see also U.S. Const. art. III, §\n\n2, cl. 1.     This choice of law principle applies regardless of\n\nwhether     the     basis    for    federal   jurisdiction         is    admiralty\n\njurisdiction, under 28 U.S.C. § 1333(1), or diversity, under id. §\n\n1332.   See Norfolk S. Ry., 543 U.S. at 23; Pope & Talbot, Inc. v.\n\nHawn, 346 U.S. 406, 411 (1953) (\"[S]ubstantial rights . . . are not\n\nto be determined differently whether [a] case is labelled 'law\n\nside' or 'admiralty side' on a district court's docket.\").\n\n            There     is    no   dispute   this   is   a   maritime      insurance\n\ncontract.    We also agree that the prevailing view, under federal\n\nlaw and the law of most states, is that a breach of a promissory\n\nwarranty in a maritime insurance contract excuses the insurer from\n\ncoverage. See Commercial Union, 190 F.3d at 31 (\"Under the federal\n\nrule and the law of most states, warranties in maritime insurance\n\ncontracts    must    be     strictly   complied   with,     even    if   they    are\n\n\n\n          law . . . . But the tensions in Supreme Court\n          precedents are legendary . . . with regard to\n          the reach of state law in federal maritime law\n          generally . . . .\nCent. Int'l Co. v. Kemper Nat'l Ins. Cos., 202 F.3d 372, 373 (1st\nCir. 2000) (internal citations omitted).\n\n                                       -11-\n\fcollateral to the primary risk that is the subject of the contract,\n\nif the insured is to recover.\"); see also Yu v. Albany Ins. Co.,\n\n281 F.3d 803, 809 (9th Cir. 2002) (noting that \"rule that a marine\n\ninsurer can avoid liability for breach of a . . . warranty,\n\nregardless of whether that breach caused the loss[,] . . . is in\n\nplace in most states\"); 6 Couch on Insurance, supra, § 83:20 (\"In\n\nmarine insurance, there is historically no requirement that the\n\nbreach of warranty relate to the loss, so that any breach bars\n\nrecovery even though a loss would have happened had the warranty\n\nbeen carried out to the letter.\"); 2 T.J. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and\n\nMaritime Law § 19-15 (4th ed. 2008) (noting that while courts tend\n\nto differ on whether the rule is a function of state law or federal\n\nlaw, most courts agree that in a maritime insurance contract, \"[i]f\n\nthe warranty is breached, the insurer is discharged\").\n\n          Given this well-established general rule, in our view,\n\nthe question becomes whether Puerto Rico has either clearly stated\n\na contrary rule or demonstrated a strong interest in having a\n\ndifferent rule.   Only if so, would we address the question of\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fwhether this is inherently a local dispute to Puerto Rico.6     Puerto\n\nRico has done neither.\n\n          Here, the Puerto Rico legislature has expressed its\n\nintent to exclude maritime insurance contracts from its statutory\n\nprovisions   governing   the   interpretation   and   construction   of\n\ninsurance contracts.     P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1101(1).          In\n\naddition, in twelve other provisions of its Insurance Code, the\n\nPuerto Rico legislature has excluded maritime insurance contracts\n\nfrom its insurance regulation.      See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§\n\n329(4)(c), 406, 412(4), 414(6), 905(1), 1001(1)(c), 1007a, 1007b,\n\n1101(1), 1119(1)(c), 1202(1)(e), 3701(1), 3803(6).        There is no\n\nPuerto Rico statute which expressly sets forth an interpretive rule\n\nfor maritime contracts, much less an interpretive rule which\n\nexpressly states that in such maritime contracts, a breach of an\n\nexpress promised warranty by the insured does not excuse the\n\n\n\n\n     6\n          As Wilburn Boat recognized, not \"every term in every\nmaritime contract can only be controlled by some federally defined\nadmiralty rule,\" and the federal government has \"left much\nregulatory power\" in the states \"in relation to insurance companies\nand the contracts they make.\"       348 U.S. at 314-15.     And so\nsometimes terms in a maritime insurance contract so implicate local\ninterests as to lead to the application of state law to interpret\nthe contract.\n\n                                 -13-\n\finsurer from its payment obligations.7                      Moreover, there is no case\n\nlaw from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court supporting such a rule.\n\n               Nor is it clear as a matter of policy that Puerto Rico\n\nlaw would craft such a rule.                   It is true that Puerto Rico has some\n\ninterest in protecting insureds who are residents and that it has\n\nadopted      an        insurance        code   to   do    so.      But     the   Puerto   Rico\n\nlegislature has chosen rather emphatically to exclude maritime\n\ninsurance contracts from the special protections it offers its\n\ninsureds under its Insurance Code.                        That choice may well reflect\n\nPuerto Rico's desire not to impose special burdens on maritime\n\ninsurers, who are crucial to the island's commerce, and, in turn,\n\nto encourage them to do business in Puerto Rico.                             See Commercial\n\nUnion, 190 F.3d at 31-32 (\"The rule of strict compliance with\n\nwarranties in marine insurance contracts stems from the recognition\n\nthat it is peculiarly difficult for marine insurers to assess their\n\nrisk, such that insurers must rely on the representations and\n\nwarranties made by insureds regarding their vessels' condition and\n\nusage.\");          7       Couch   on    Insurance,       supra,    §     99:1   (\"The    added\n\nstrictness [of the rule for maritime insurance contracts] is, in\n\nmany       ways,       a    consequence        of   the   fact     that    marine   insurers\n\n\n\n       7\n          This is in distinct contrast with states which have\nstatutes adopting the minority rule.

This analysis has proceeded by\n\nreference to Puerto Rico law, despite an express choice of law\n\nclause in the insurance contract which states that if federal law\n\ndoes not apply, then New York law would apply.         For reasons we do\n\nnot understand, counsel for the insurers argued that New York law\n\nand Puerto Rico law were essentially equivalent and so consented to\n\nthe court analyzing the case under Puerto Rico law.           The district\n\ncourt suggested that the two laws are very different and that New\n\nYork law follows the majority rule and would strictly enforce the\n\nwarranty but Puerto Rico law would not.      In light of the concession\n\nby counsel for the insurers, the court analyzed the matter under\n\nPuerto Rico law.\n\n          We   are   not   certain   that   counsel,   as    a   matter   of\n\nlitigation strategy, may vary the express terms of a choice of law\n\nclause.   The issue has not been briefed to us.             The concession\n\ngreatly complicated this litigation.        We agree with the district\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fcourt that under New York law, the insured's breach excuses the\n\ninsurer from performance.

This fact demonstrates\n\nthat there is no unfairness to the insured here from the result.\n\nThe insured were on notice that they would face strict compliance\n\nwith the warranty.\n\n           We reverse and remand to the district court for entry of\n\nsummary judgment for the insurers.

The prevailing view, both in federal law and state maritime insurance law, is that a breach of a warranty will excuse the maritime insurer from payment regardless of any causal connection to the loss. The district court erroneously applied a different view. We reverse the district court and direct entry of judgment for plaintiff insurers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>As this comes to us on appeal from a motion for summary judgment, we review the district court's ruling de novo, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovants, the defendants. <i>Rosado-Quiñones v. Toledo,</i> 528 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Littlefield v. Acadia Ins. Co.,</i> 392 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs, a group of insurance companies and underwriters including Lloyd's of London, Gothaer Versicherungen AG, Great Lakes Reinsurance (UK) PLC, and ING Insurance SA, issued an insurance policy to William Pagán-Sánchez which provided hull, machinery, and liability coverage for his recently purchased forty-three-foot pleasure boat, the <i>Gabriella.</i> The effective dates of the policy were from January 31, 2003 to January 31, 2004. The policy was embodied in a twelve-page insuring agreement which includes a three-page section entitled \"General Conditions &amp; Warranties.\"</p>\n<p>On July 19, 2003, as the <i>Gabriella</i> was traveling to Culebra, an island off of Puerto Rico, an exhaust hose came loose and the <i>Gabriella</i> began taking on water through the boat's exhaust system. Attempts to pump out the water were unsuccessful, and the <i>Gabriella</i> flooded and sank. The insured later submitted a claim to the plaintiffs for $175,000 for the loss of the boat and $100,000 for the costs incurred during salvage operations.</p>\n<p>The insurers began an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident. The investigation found, inter alia, 1) that the loss of the <i>Gabriella</i> was caused by wear and tear, gradual deterioration, and lack of maintenance; and 2) that the vessel's fire extinguishing equipment had not been inspected or certified within the preceding year, and that the automatic engine room fire extinguisher system had been disconnected prior to the loss. There was no finding, and it has never been asserted by the insurers, that the condition of the fire extinguishing equipment had any relation whatsoever to the sinking of the boat. However, the insurers do assert that the lack of maintenance of the fire extinguishing equipment violated an express warranty of the insurance contract providing that \"such [fire extinguishing] equipment is properly installed and is maintained in good working order.\"</p>\n<p>The plaintiff insurers then sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court in Puerto Rico that the breach by the insured of the fire extinguisher warranty<sup>[1]</sup> in the insurance contract precluded payment of the insured's claim. The defendants denied all the allegations and counterclaimed under the insurance contract for the amount of their original insurance claim.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff insurers moved for summary judgment. The motion was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended that summary judgment be denied and that triable issues of material fact existed. In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> an unpublished order, the district court adopted in part the magistrate judge's recommendations and denied the motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for reconsideration which was also denied in another unpublished order. We describe below the portions of the district court's reasoning that are pertinent to our analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Appellate jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(3), which provides this court with jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals in admiralty cases of orders determining the rights and liabilities of the parties.</p>\n<p>Our review of the district court's summary judgment ruling is de novo. <i>Littlefield,</i> 392 F.3d at 6. As framed by the parties and the district court, two key issues must be addressed for summary judgment purposes. The first issue is whether the contested maritime insurance warranty clause is ambiguous. The second is whether, if the clause is not ambiguous and has been breached by the insured, the breach excuses the insurer from payment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Ambiguity of the Fire Extinguisher Warranty Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court erroneously held the fire extinguisher warranty clause was ambiguous.<sup>[2]</sup> Subsection 9 of the policy is entitled \"General Conditions and Warranties.\" Subsection 9(<i>l</i>) of the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote>If the scheduled vessel is fitted with fire extinguishing equipment, then it is warranted that such equipment is properly installed and is maintained in good working order. This includes the weighing of tanks once a year and recharging as necessary.</blockquote>\n<p>This clause follows after subsection 9(k), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>It is warranted that covered persons must at all times comply with relevant Statutes, Laws, by-laws and U.S. Coast Guard and other regulations, governing the use of the scheduled vessel.</blockquote>\n<p>It is clear that subsection 9(<i>l</i>) is a warranty provision. The clause plainly states that it is a warranty and it is located in the section of the policy where warranties are set forth.</p>\n<p>The contract interpretation question of whether there is an ambiguity in the warranty clause is one for the court. <i>See </i><i>Littlefield,</i> 392 F.3d at 6 (\"Whether there is any ambiguity in [provisions of a maritime insurance contract] is a question of law for the court to determine.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Tropeano v. Dorman,</i> 441 F.3d 69, 75 (1st Cir.2006) (\"The question of whether a contract is ambiguous is one for the courts.\"); 2 L.R. Russ &amp; T.F. Segalla, <i>Couch on Insurance</i> § 21:13 (3d ed. 2008) (\"Whether or not a contract of insurance is ambiguous is a question of law for the court. . . .\"). It is a question we review de novo. <i>Littlefield,</i> 392 F.3d at 6; <i>Crowe v. Bolduc,</i> 365 F.3d 86, 95 (1st Cir.2004). There is no ambiguity in the warranty clause at issue here.</p>\n<p>The first sentence of subsection 9(<i>l</i>) is a warranty from the insured that if the vessel is fitted with fire extinguishing equipment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> as the vessel here was, such equipment is properly installed and maintained in good working order. The second sentence provides the further definition that such proper installation and maintenance includes \"the weighing of tanks once a year and recharging as necessary.\" This is a promissory warranty on the part of the insured. <i>See</i> 6 <i>Couch on Insurance, supra,</i> § 81:14 (promissory warranty is \"one by which the insured stipulates that something shall be done or omitted after the policy takes effect and during its continuance\"); <i>see also </i><i>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Flagship Marine Servs., Inc.,</i> 190 F.3d 26, 31 (2d Cir.1999) (defining warranty as \"a promise `by which the assured undertakes that some particular thing shall or shall not be done, or that some condition shall be fulfilled'\" (quoting L.J. Buglass, <i>Marine Insurance &amp; General Average in the United States</i> 27 (2d ed.1981))).</p>\n<p>The date that the parties entered into the insurance contract does not matter. The insured warrants upon entering into the policy that the tanks have been weighed once a year and, if necessary, recharged, as part of the insured's warranty of proper maintenance of fire extinguishing equipment. That this is a clear obligation is reinforced by the introductory clause in the contract that states: \"We will provide the insurance coverage described in this insuring agreement, in return for payment to us of the premium due and <i>compliance</i> by covered persons <i>with the provisions, conditions and warranties of this insuring agreement.</i>\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>Since the warranty is clear and unambiguous, it must be enforced as written under usual insurance law. <i>See</i> 2 <i>Couch on Insurance, supra,</i> § 21:11 (\"[I]t is a well settled rule . . . that clear and unambiguous clauses must be accepted as the expression of the intent of the parties, and enforced by the courts as written.\").</p>\n<p>It is also undisputed that the insured failed to produce any evidence of compliance with the promissory warranty relating to the fire extinguishers. Thus, the insured was in breach of the promissory warranty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Consequences of the Breach of Warranty</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In light of the insured's breach, the question, then, is the effect of this breach.</p>\n<p>The district court reasoned that Puerto Rico law would apply. It acknowledged that Chapter 11 of Puerto Rico's Insurance Code, which covers contract interpretation and construction, expressly excludes maritime insurance contracts from its coverage.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1101(1) (\"The applicable provisions of this chapter shall apply to insurances other than ocean marine . . . insurances. . . .\"). The court reasoned it should turn by default to the Puerto Rico Civil Code. In the absence of any statute or case law on point, the court predicted that under the Puerto Rico Civil Code the breach of a warranty clause in a contract of maritime insurance would not excuse payment by an insurer unless the breach was related to the cause of the loss.</p>\n<p>The insurers agree with the district court that \"Puerto Rico law is silent on the issue\" and that \"the majority rule with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> respect to warranty breaches is similar to the federal admiralty rule inasmuch as[ ] both treat any breach as having the effect of voiding coverage in its entirety.\" Op. and Order Den. Mot. for Recons., at 6. That being so, the insurers argue, even if Puerto Rico law would apply, it would apply as substantive law the majority rule that a breach of a promissory warranty excuses the insurer from coverage.</p>\n<p>We turn to the relevant principles of choice of law analysis as most recently set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>Norfolk Southern Railway Co. v. Kirby,</i> 543 U.S. 14, 125 S.Ct. 385, 160 L.Ed.2d 283 (2004).<sup>[4]</sup><i>Norfolk Southern</i> clarified the Supreme Court's earlier choice of law analysis for maritime insurance contracts set forth in <i>Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Insurance Co.,</i> 348 U.S. 310, 314, 75 S.Ct. 368, 99 L.Ed. 337 (1955).<sup>[5]</sup><i>Norfolk Southern</i> stated the general rule that \"[w]hen a contract is a maritime one, and the dispute is not inherently local, federal law controls the contract interpretation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22-23, 125 S.Ct. 385. This lawmaking power in the federal courts stems from the Constitution's grant of admiralty jurisdiction to federal courts. <i>See id.</i> at 23, 125 S.Ct. 385; <i>Wilburn Boat,</i> 348 U.S. at 314, 75 S.Ct. 368; <i>see also</i> U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. This choice of law principle applies regardless of whether the basis for federal jurisdiction is admiralty jurisdiction, under 28 U.S.C. § 1333(1), or diversity, under <i>id.</i> § 1332. <i>See Norfolk S. Ry.,</i> 543 U.S. at 23, 125 S.Ct. 385; <i>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn,</i> 346 U.S. 406, 411, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953) (\"[S]ubstantial rights . . . are not to be determined differently whether [a] case is labelled `law side' or `admiralty side' on a district court's docket.\").</p>\n<p>There is no dispute this is a maritime insurance contract. We also agree that the prevailing view, under federal law and the law of most states, is that a breach of a promissory warranty in a maritime insurance contract excuses the insurer from coverage. <i>See </i><i>Commercial Union,</i> 190 F.3d at 31 (\"Under the federal rule and the law of most states, warranties in maritime insurance contracts must be strictly complied with, even if they are collateral to the primary risk that is the subject of the contract, if the insured is to recover.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Yu v. Albany Ins. Co.,</i> 281 F.3d 803, 809 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that \"rule that a marine insurer can avoid liability for breach of a . . . warranty, regardless of whether that breach caused the loss[,] . . . is in place in most states\"); 6 <i>Couch on Insurance, supra,</i> § 83:20 (\"In marine insurance, there is historically no requirement that the breach of warranty relate to the loss, so that any breach bars recovery even though a loss would have happened had the warranty been carried out to the letter.\"); 2 T.J. Schoenbaum, <i>Admiralty and Maritime Law</i> § 19-15 (4th ed.2008) (noting that while courts tend <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> to differ on whether the rule is a function of state law or federal law, most courts agree that in a maritime insurance contract, \"[i]f the warranty is breached, the insurer is discharged\").</p>\n<p>Given this well-established general rule, in our view, the question becomes whether Puerto Rico has either clearly stated a contrary rule or demonstrated a strong interest in having a different rule. Only if so, would we address the question of whether this is inherently a local dispute to Puerto Rico.<sup>[6]</sup> Puerto Rico has done neither.</p>\n<p>Here, the Puerto Rico legislature has expressed its intent to exclude maritime insurance contracts from its statutory provisions governing the interpretation and construction of insurance contracts. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1101(1). In addition, in twelve other provisions of its Insurance Code, the Puerto Rico legislature has excluded maritime insurance contracts from its insurance regulation. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 329(4)(c), 406, 412(4), 414(6), 905(1), 1001(1)(c), 1007a, 1007b, 1101(1), 1119(1)(c), 1202(1)(e), 3701(1), 3803(6). There is no Puerto Rico statute which expressly sets forth an interpretive rule for maritime contracts, much less an interpretive rule which expressly states that in such maritime contracts, a breach of an express promised warranty by the insured does not excuse the insurer from its payment obligations.<sup>[7]</sup> Moreover, there is no case law from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court supporting such a rule.</p>\n<p>Nor is it clear as a matter of policy that Puerto Rico law would craft such a rule. It is true that Puerto Rico has some interest in protecting insureds who are residents and that it has adopted an insurance code to do so. But the Puerto Rico legislature has chosen rather emphatically to exclude maritime insurance contracts from the special protections it offers its insureds under its Insurance Code. That choice may well reflect Puerto Rico's desire not to impose special burdens on maritime insurers, who are crucial to the island's commerce, and, in turn, to encourage them to do business in Puerto Rico. <i>See </i><i>Commercial Union,</i> 190 F.3d at 31-32 (\"The rule of strict compliance with warranties in marine insurance contracts stems from the recognition that it is peculiarly difficult for marine insurers to assess their risk, such that insurers must rely on the representations and warranties made by insureds regarding their vessels' condition and usage.\"); 7 <i>Couch on Insurance, supra,</i> § 99:1 (\"The added strictness [of the rule for maritime insurance contracts] is, in many ways, a consequence of the fact that marine insurers historically have been in a poorer position to ascertain for themselves the true state of affairs.\"). This interest is served by not imposing more burdensome rules on maritime insurers than are imposed in the majority of jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>Because Puerto Rico has not stated a contrary rule, we see no reason to apply anything other than the majority rule <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> here: that the insured's breach of a promissory warranty excuses the insurers from payment.</p>\n<p>We add a final note. This analysis has proceeded by reference to Puerto Rico law, despite an express choice of law clause in the insurance contract which states that if federal law does not apply, then New York law would apply. For reasons we do not understand, counsel for the insurers argued that New York law and Puerto Rico law were essentially equivalent and so consented to the court analyzing the case under Puerto Rico law. The district court suggested that the two laws are very different and that New York law follows the majority rule and would strictly enforce the warranty but Puerto Rico law would not. In light of the concession by counsel for the insurers, the court analyzed the matter under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n<p>We are not certain that counsel, as a matter of litigation strategy, may vary the express terms of a choice of law clause. The issue has not been briefed to us. The concession greatly complicated this litigation. We agree with the district court that under New York law, the insured's breach excuses the insurer from performance. <i>See </i><i>Commercial Union,</i> 190 F.3d at 32 (noting that New York law requires strict compliance with warranties in marine insurance contracts). This fact demonstrates that there is no unfairness to the insured here from the result. The insured were on notice that they would face strict compliance with the warranty.</p>\n<p>We reverse and remand to the district court for entry of summary judgment for the insurers. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The plaintiff insurers also alleged that the insured was in breach of other warranties all unrelated to the loss itselfbut none of those allegations are raised on appeal.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court initially found it unnecessary to decide whether the fire extinguisher warranty clause was ambiguous because it held that even if the insured were in breach of the clause, that breach would have no effect on the insured's ability to recover under the policy. But in its denial of the insurers' motion for reconsideration, the court changed its position and ruled that the clause was a warranty clause, not a representation, and that it was ambiguous.</p>\n<p>[3]  Chapter 11 provides that for cases within its coverage (that is, non-maritime insurance policies) misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of acts, and incorrect statements only prevent coverage when, inter alia, they materially alter the risk assumed by the insurer. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1110. We do not reach the question of whether the breach would prevent coverage under that provision.</p>\n<p>[4]  Unfortunately, neither of the parties called this case to the attention of either this court or the district court.</p>\n<p>[5]  There is general agreement that maritime insurance contracts fall within federal maritime jurisdiction, and as such, Congress and the courts have the power to fashion federal rules. <i>Wilburn Boat,</i> 348 U.S. at 314, 75 S.Ct. 368. As we have noted before,\n</p>\n<p>[b]eneath this surface agreement on general principles lies an abyss of confusion. One might think that construing a maritime insurance policy, in relation to damage occurring on the high seas, would be a paradigm case for a uniform body of federal law. . . . But the tensions in Supreme Court precedents are legendary . . . with regard to the reach of state law in federal maritime law generally. . . .</p>\n<p><i>Cent. Int'l Co. v. Kemper Nat'l Ins. Cos.,</i> 202 F.3d 372, 373 (1st Cir.2000) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[6]  As <i>Wilburn Boat</i> recognized, not \"every term in every maritime contract can only be controlled by some federally defined admiralty rule,\" and the federal government has \"left much regulatory power\" in the states \"in relation to insurance companies and the contracts they make.\" 348 U.S. at 314-15, 75 S.Ct. 368. And so sometimes terms in a maritime insurance contract so implicate local interests as to lead to the application of state law to interpret the contract.</p>\n<p>[7]  This is in distinct contrast with states which have statutes adopting the minority rule. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fla. Stat. § 627.409(2) (\"A breach . . . by the insured of any warranty . . . of any wet marine . . . insurance policy . . . does not void the policy . . . unless such breach . . . increased the hazard by any means within the control of the insured.\").</p>\n\n</div>",

However, the insurers do assert that the lack of maintenance of the fire extinguishing equipment violated an express warranty of the insurance contract providing that \"such [fire extinguishing] equipment is properly installed and is maintained in good working order.\"</p>\n<p>The plaintiff insurers then sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court in Puerto Rico that the breach by the insured of the fire extinguisher warranty<sup>[1]</sup> in the insurance contract precluded payment of the insured's claim. The defendants denied all the allegations and counterclaimed under the insurance contract for the amount of their original insurance claim.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff insurers moved for summary judgment. The motion was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended that summary judgment be denied and that triable issues of material fact existed. In <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> an unpublished order, the district court adopted in part the magistrate judge's recommendations and denied the motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for reconsideration which was also denied in another unpublished order. We describe below the portions of the district court's reasoning that are pertinent to our analysis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Appellate jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(3), which provides this court with jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals in admiralty cases of orders determining the rights and liabilities of the parties.</p>\n<p>Our review of the district court's summary judgment ruling is de novo. <i>Littlefield,</i> 392 F.3d at 6. As framed by the parties and the district court, two key issues must be addressed for summary judgment purposes. The first issue is whether the contested maritime insurance warranty clause is ambiguous. The second is whether, if the clause is not ambiguous and has been breached by the insured, the breach excuses the insurer from payment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Ambiguity of the Fire Extinguisher Warranty Clause</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court erroneously held the fire extinguisher warranty clause was ambiguous.<sup>[2]</sup> Subsection 9 of the policy is entitled \"General Conditions and Warranties.\" Subsection 9(<i>l</i>) of the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote>If the scheduled vessel is fitted with fire extinguishing equipment, then it is warranted that such equipment is properly installed and is maintained in good working order. This includes the weighing of tanks once a year and recharging as necessary.</blockquote>\n<p>This clause follows after subsection 9(k), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>It is warranted that covered persons must at all times comply with relevant Statutes, Laws, by-laws and U.S. Coast Guard and other regulations, governing the use of the scheduled vessel.</blockquote>\n<p>It is clear that subsection 9(<i>l</i>) is a warranty provision. The clause plainly states that it is a warranty and it is located in the section of the policy where warranties are set forth.</p>\n<p>The contract interpretation question of whether there is an ambiguity in the warranty clause is one for the court. <i>See </i><i>Littlefield,</i> 392 F.3d at 6 (\"Whether there is any ambiguity in [provisions of a maritime insurance contract] is a question of law for the court to determine.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Tropeano v. Dorman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202115\"><a href=\"/opinion/202115/tropeano-v-dorman/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir.2006) (\"The question of whether a contract is ambiguous is one for the courts.\"); 2 L.R. Russ &amp; T.F. Segalla, <i>Couch on Insurance</i> § 21:13 (3d ed. 2008) (\"Whether or not a contract of insurance is ambiguous is a question of law for the court. . . .\"). It is a question we review de novo. <i>Littlefield,</i> 392 F.3d at 6; <i>Crowe v. Bolduc,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200978\"><a href=\"/opinion/200978/crowe-v-bolduc/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.2004). There is no ambiguity in the warranty clause at issue here.</p>\n<p>The first sentence of subsection 9(<i>l</i>) is a warranty from the insured that if the vessel is fitted with fire extinguishing equipment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> as the vessel here was, such equipment is properly installed and maintained in good working order. The second sentence provides the further definition that such proper installation and maintenance includes \"the weighing of tanks once a year and recharging as necessary.\" This is a promissory warranty on the part of the insured. <i>See</i> 6 <i>Couch on Insurance, supra,</i> § 81:14 (promissory warranty is \"one by which the insured stipulates that something shall be done or omitted after the policy takes effect and during its continuance\"); <i>see also </i><i>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Flagship Marine Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765983\"><a href=\"/opinion/765983/commercial-union-insurance-company-plaintiff-appellant-cross-appellee-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 31 (2d Cir.1999) (defining warranty as \"a promise `by which the assured undertakes that some particular thing shall or shall not be done, or that some condition shall be fulfilled'\" (quoting L.J. Buglass, <i>Marine Insurance &amp; General Average in the United States</i> 27 (2d ed.1981))).</p>\n<p>The date that the parties entered into the insurance contract does not matter. The insured warrants upon entering into the policy that the tanks have been weighed once a year and, if necessary, recharged, as part of the insured's warranty of proper maintenance of fire extinguishing equipment. That this is a clear obligation is reinforced by the introductory clause in the contract that states: \"We will provide the insurance coverage described in this insuring agreement, in return for payment to us of the premium due and <i>compliance</i> by covered persons <i>with the provisions, conditions and warranties of this insuring agreement.</i>\" (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>Since the warranty is clear and unambiguous, it must be enforced as written under usual insurance law. <i>See</i> 2 <i>Couch on Insurance, supra,</i> § 21:11 (\"[I]t is a well settled rule . . . that clear and unambiguous clauses must be accepted as the expression of the intent of the parties, and enforced by the courts as written.\").</p>\n<p>It is also undisputed that the insured failed to produce any evidence of compliance with the promissory warranty relating to the fire extinguishers. Thus, the insured was in breach of the promissory warranty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Consequences of the Breach of Warranty</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In light of the insured's breach, the question, then, is the effect of this breach.</p>\n<p>The district court reasoned that Puerto Rico law would apply. It acknowledged that Chapter 11 of Puerto Rico's Insurance Code, which covers contract interpretation and construction, expressly excludes maritime insurance contracts from its coverage.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1101(1) (\"The applicable provisions of this chapter shall apply to insurances other than ocean marine . . . insurances. . . .\"). The court reasoned it should turn by default to the Puerto Rico Civil Code. In the absence of any statute or case law on point, the court predicted that under the Puerto Rico Civil Code the breach of a warranty clause in a contract of maritime insurance would not excuse payment by an insurer unless the breach was related to the cause of the loss.</p>\n<p>The insurers agree with the district court that \"Puerto Rico law is silent on the issue\" and that \"the majority rule with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> respect to warranty breaches is similar to the federal admiralty rule inasmuch as[ ] both treat any breach as having the effect of voiding coverage in its entirety.\" Op. and Order Den. Mot. for Recons., at 6. That being so, the insurers argue, even if Puerto Rico law would apply, it would apply as substantive law the majority rule that a breach of a promissory warranty excuses the insurer from coverage.</p>\n<p>We turn to the relevant principles of choice of law analysis as most recently set forth by the Supreme Court in <i>Norfolk Southern Railway Co. v.

We also agree that the prevailing view, under federal law and the law of most states, is that a breach of a promissory warranty in a maritime insurance contract excuses the insurer from coverage. <i>See </i><i>Commercial Union,</i> 190 F.3d at 31 (\"Under the federal rule and the law of most states, warranties in maritime insurance contracts must be strictly complied with, even if they are collateral to the primary risk that is the subject of the contract, if the insured is to recover.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Yu v. Albany Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776700\"><a href=\"/opinion/776700/jacinta-yu-yu-aas-corporation-v-albany-insurance-company-gre-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>, 809 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that \"rule that a marine insurer can avoid liability for breach of a . . . warranty, regardless of whether that breach caused the loss[,] . . . is in place in most states\"); 6 <i>Couch on Insurance, supra,</i> § 83:20 (\"In marine insurance, there is historically no requirement that the breach of warranty relate to the loss, so that any breach bars recovery even though a loss would have happened had the warranty been carried out to the letter.\"); 2 T.J. Schoenbaum, <i>Admiralty and Maritime Law</i> § 19-15 (4th ed.2008) (noting that while courts tend <span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> to differ on whether the rule is a function of state law or federal law, most courts agree that in a maritime insurance contract, \"[i]f the warranty is breached, the insurer is discharged\").</p>\n<p>Given this well-established general rule, in our view, the question becomes whether Puerto Rico has either clearly stated a contrary rule or demonstrated a strong interest in having a different rule. Only if so, would we address the question of whether this is inherently a local dispute to Puerto Rico.<sup>[6]</sup> Puerto Rico has done neither.</p>\n<p>Here, the Puerto Rico legislature has expressed its intent to exclude maritime insurance contracts from its statutory provisions governing the interpretation and construction of insurance contracts. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1101(1). In addition, in twelve other provisions of its Insurance Code, the Puerto Rico legislature has excluded maritime insurance contracts from its insurance regulation. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 329(4)(c), 406, 412(4), 414(6), 905(1), 1001(1)(c), 1007a, 1007b, 1101(1), 1119(1)(c), 1202(1)(e), 3701(1), 3803(6). There is no Puerto Rico statute which expressly sets forth an interpretive rule for maritime contracts, much less an interpretive rule which expressly states that in such maritime contracts, a breach of an express promised warranty by the insured does not excuse the insurer from its payment obligations.<sup>[7]</sup> Moreover, there is no case law from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court supporting such a rule.</p>\n<p>Nor is it clear as a matter of policy that Puerto Rico law would craft such a rule. It is true that Puerto Rico has some interest in protecting insureds who are residents and that it has adopted an insurance code to do so. But the Puerto Rico legislature has chosen rather emphatically to exclude maritime insurance contracts from the special protections it offers its insureds under its Insurance Code. That choice may well reflect Puerto Rico's desire not to impose special burdens on maritime insurers, who are crucial to the island's commerce, and, in turn, to encourage them to do business in Puerto Rico. <i>See </i><i>Commercial Union,</i> 190 F.3d at 31-32 (\"The rule of strict compliance with warranties in marine insurance contracts stems from the recognition that it is peculiarly difficult for marine insurers to assess their risk, such that insurers must rely on the representations and warranties made by insureds regarding their vessels' condition and usage.\"); 7 <i>Couch on Insurance, supra,</i> § 99:1 (\"The added strictness [of the rule for maritime insurance contracts] is, in many ways, a consequence of the fact that marine insurers historically have been in a poorer position to ascertain for themselves the true state of affairs.\"). This interest is served by not imposing more burdensome rules on maritime insurers than are imposed in the majority of jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>Because Puerto Rico has not stated a contrary rule, we see no reason to apply anything other than the majority rule <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> here: that the insured's breach of a promissory warranty excuses the insurers from payment.</p>\n<p>We add a final note. This analysis has proceeded by reference to Puerto Rico law, despite an express choice of law clause in the insurance contract which states that if federal law does not apply, then New York law would apply. For reasons we do not understand, counsel for the insurers argued that New York law and Puerto Rico law were essentially equivalent and so consented to the court analyzing the case under Puerto Rico law. The district court suggested that the two laws are very different and that New York law follows the majority rule and would strictly enforce the warranty but Puerto Rico law would not. In light of the concession by counsel for the insurers, the court analyzed the matter under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n<p>We are not certain that counsel, as a matter of litigation strategy, may vary the express terms of a choice of law clause. The issue has not been briefed to us. The concession greatly complicated this litigation. We agree with the district court that under New York law, the insured's breach excuses the insurer from performance. <i>See </i><i>Commercial Union,</i> 190 F.3d at 32 (noting that New York law requires strict compliance with warranties in marine insurance contracts). This fact demonstrates that there is no unfairness to the insured here from the result. The insured were on notice that they would face strict compliance with the warranty.</p>\n<p>We reverse and remand to the district court for entry of summary judgment for the insurers. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The plaintiff insurers also alleged that the insured was in breach of other warranties all unrelated to the loss itselfbut none of those allegations are raised on appeal.</p>\n<p>[2]  The district court initially found it unnecessary to decide whether the fire extinguisher warranty clause was ambiguous because it held that even if the insured were in breach of the clause, that breach would have no effect on the insured's ability to recover under the policy. But in its denial of the insurers' motion for reconsideration, the court changed its position and ruled that the clause was a warranty clause, not a representation, and that it was ambiguous.</p>\n<p>[3]  Chapter 11 provides that for cases within its coverage (that is, non-maritime insurance policies) misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of acts, and incorrect statements only prevent coverage when, inter alia, they materially alter the risk assumed by the insurer. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 1110. We do not reach the question of whether the breach would prevent coverage under that provision.</p>\n<p>[4]  Unfortunately, neither of the parties called this case to the attention of either this court or the district court.</p>\n<p>[5]  There is general agreement that maritime insurance contracts fall within federal maritime jurisdiction, and as such, Congress and the courts have the power to fashion federal rules. <i>Wilburn Boat,</i> 348 U.S. at 314, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105270\"><a href=\"/opinion/105270/wilburn-boat-co-v-firemans-fund-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>. As we have noted before,\n</p>\n<p>[b]eneath this surface agreement on general principles lies an abyss of confusion. One might think that construing a maritime insurance policy, in relation to damage occurring on the high seas, would be a paradigm case for a uniform body of federal law. . . . But the tensions in Supreme Court precedents are legendary . . . with regard to the reach of state law in federal maritime law generally. . . .</p>\n<p><i>Cent. Int'l Co. v. Kemper Nat'l Ins. Cos.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198778\"><a href=\"/opinion/198778/central-internationa-v-kemper-insurance-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 373 (1st Cir.2000) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>[6]  As <i>Wilburn Boat</i> recognized, not \"every term in every maritime contract can only be controlled by some federally defined admiralty rule,\" and the federal government has \"left much regulatory power\" in the states \"in relation to insurance companies and the contracts they make.\" 348 U.S. at 314-15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105270\"><a href=\"/opinion/105270/wilburn-boat-co-v-firemans-fund-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span>. And so sometimes terms in a maritime insurance contract so implicate local interests as to lead to the application of state law to interpret the contract.</p>\n<p>[7]  This is in distinct contrast with states which have statutes adopting the minority rule. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Fla. Stat. § 627.409(2) (\"A breach . . . by the insured of any warranty . . . of any wet marine . . . insurance policy . . . does not void the policy . . . unless such breach . . . increased the hazard by any means within the control of the insured.\").</p>\n\n</div>",
