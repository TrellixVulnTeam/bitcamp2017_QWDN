Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n                  Merritt* and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     George J.

Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney and Mary E.\nRogers, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                            March 25, 2009\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.              Appellant Fernando Gonzalez-\n\nRamirez (\"Gonzalez\") was convicted of conspiring to distribute and\n\naiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine.              He was sentenced\n\nto twenty years in prison.            On appeal, Gonzalez claims that the\n\ndistrict    court    erred    in     denying    his   pre-trial   motion    for   a\n\ncompetency hearing and in admitting certain evidence.                      He also\n\nasserts that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict him,\n\nand that his sentence violated his constitutional rights.                  Finding\n\nno error, we affirm the conviction and sentence.\n\n                             I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n            We review the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\njury's verdict.       United States v. Marin, 523 F.3d 24 (1st Cir.\n\n2008).     In    January     2006,     law     enforcement   authorities      were\n\ninvestigating       two    Rhode      Island     men,   Estoredarico       Bernard\n\n(\"Belige\"), and Eucraneo Severino (\"Severino\").              The investigation\n\nincluded surveillance of a liquor store that Belige owned and\n\noperated, an import/export business owned and operated by Severino,\n\nand Severino's residence.\n\n                During this time period, Gonzalez lived in Denver,\n\nColorado, where he served as a middleman for Colorado-based cocaine\n\ndealers tied to Mexican drug cartels.                   His role was to find\n\ncustomers in the northeast United States.                 Belige was one such\n\ncustomer.\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            In late January, authorities eavesdropped on a telephone\n\ncall from Gonzalez to Belige, in which Gonzalez left the message,\n\n\"Uncle.    I am Fernando. Call me back whenever you can to [a phone\n\nnumber].\"    Two days later, Belige listened to the message three\n\ntimes, and then returned the call, leaving the following message:\n\n\"Your uncle is calling you.   Call me back.\"   Gonzalez returned the\n\ncall and the two spoke for a short time.   The conversation went as\n\nfollows:\n\n            Belige1 (\"B\"): Hello.\n            Gonzalez (\"G\"): Oh, Hello, uncle, how have you been?\n            B: Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.\n            G: [Chuckles]\n            B: Where were you? Were you lost?\n            G: No, there wasn't any. [chuckles].\n            B: [chuckles]\n            G: Oh well things were calm.\n            B: Oh that's good.\n            G: Yeah.\n            B: Yeah.\n            G: So, are you working?\n            B: Yeah.\n            G: Yeah?\n            B: Yeah.\n            G: Do you want me to take a ride over?\n            B: Come over today.\n            G: [Chuckles] It's just that I'm getting it for you way\n               too high.\n            B: Oh, s--t, then you're not right.\n            G: Huh?\n            B: What . . . where are you driving?\n            G: Come again?\n            B: What's the mileage? How much are you driving?\n            G: For 19.\n\n\n1\n    The briefs refer to this individual as \"Belige.\"           The\ntranscripts of the phone conversations use \"Beligue.\" For the sake\nof consistency, we use the former spelling.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f           B: What? You are crazy (laughter)(unintelligible) is here\n              this week.\n           G: Yeah?\n           B: Huh?\n           G: And what about 18 ½?\n           B: Huh?\n           G: 18 ½.\n           B: Well - it can be done.\n           G: Yeah?\n           B: To help you out.\n           G: Yeah, well let me - let me see if I can get ready\n              right away and I'll call you in the afternoon.\n           B: What?\n           G: That I'll be ready right away and I'll call you in the\n              afternoon.\n           B: Well come over here before the other one arrives.\n           G: Yeah, yeah. If I go, I'll be arriving in two days.\n           B: Oh, around Saturday. Saturday?\n           G: Yeah.\n           B: Okay.\n           G: Alright.\n\n\n           According to Central Falls, R.I., Detective Dorian Rave2,\n\nthe above conversation was actually rife with coded language\n\nconcerning the delivery of cocaine to Belige.   For example, \"there\n\nwasn't any\" was an indication that Gonzalez had been out of contact\n\nbecause of a depleted cocaine supply; when he asked whether Belige\n\nwas \"working,\" Gonzalez was asking whether Belige was dealing\n\ndrugs; finally, the discussion of \"mileage\" -- 18 ½ and 19 -- was\n\nactually the price per kilogram in thousands of dollars.\n\n           True to his word, Gonzalez called Belige later the same\n\nday.   This shorter conversation went as follows:\n\n           B: Hello.\n\n\n2\n    Rave was assigned to work with an FBI narcotics task force.\n\n                                -4-\n\f          G: Uh what's up uncle, it's me Fernando.\n          B: Talk to me Fernando.\n          G: Oh I couldn't do that. It didn't work out for me. I\n             need you to just to - just for 19.\n          B: Oh but it doesn't work out that way.\n          G: It doesn't work out? Yeah, but he'll leave in the\n              morning and the guy has them but I wasn't able to get\n             them.\n          B: What was that?\n          G: He didn't want to-go lower.\n          B: Damn, that's rough that way. That's not much profit.\n          G: Yeah?\n          B: There's no profit there.\n          G: What did you say?\n          B: That there's not much profit there.\n          G: Yeah.\n          B: Uh.\n          G: No, well think about it-if you want and I'll look for\n             another guy to see what comes up, if you're a go call\n             me that those are there.\n          B: Well then. Uh, then when would that be here?\n          G: Yeah, he's-he would be leaving in the morning and\n              arrives Saturday in the afternoon or Sunday morning.\n          B: Uh. Well, then come over to help you out.\n          G: Yeah?\n          B: Come over to help you out.\n          G: Oh then thank you man.\n          B: Okay.\n          G: Alright.\n\n\n          Detective Rave decoded this conversation to mean that\n\nGonzalez could go no lower than the $19,000 per kilogram price\n\ndiscussed earlier in the day.    Despite the protest about the small\n\nprofit, Belige agreed after Gonzalez informed him that a courier\n\nwould leave the next morning (a Wednesday) and deliver the cocaine\n\nto Belige Saturday or Sunday.\n\n          On   the   following   Monday,   January   30,   surveillance\n\npersonnel observed Severino enter Belige's liquor store.       He left\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthe liquor store in his car, followed by a car with Colorado\n\nlicense   plates.     The   Colorado    car   went   into   a   warehouse   at\n\nSeverino's place of business.       The driver of the Colorado car --\n\nlater determined to be Gonzalez's cousin, Adelberto Gonzalez --\n\nleft about an hour later.      He was followed by federal agents to a\n\nnearby hotel.       Later that day, agents approached Severino and\n\nobtained permission to search the warehouse, where they seized a\n\nduffel bag containing 11 sealed packages of cocaine, package\n\nsealing materials, and gasoline soaked wrappings and rags, which\n\npolice theorized were used to protect the cocaine that had been\n\nhidden in the Colorado car's gas tank during transit.\n\n            After seizing the cocaine, police arrested Belige and\n\nAdalberto Gonzalez.     At the request of the police, Belige called\n\nappellant to tell him that he and appellant's cousin had been\n\narrested.       Detective    Rave      subsequently    called     appellant,\n\nidentifying himself as a police officer.         During this conversation\n\n-- which took place in Spanish -- Gonzalez acknowledged that he had\n\ndiscussed the arrest with Belige.         He admitted his status as the\n\nmiddleman for the Colorado distributors and the tasks he did for\n\nthem, as well as the fact that he had negotiated the sale to Belige\n\nand enlisted his cousin to be the drug courier.\n\n            Gonzalez was indicted on one count of conspiring to\n\ndistribute and possess with intent to distribute more than five\n\nkilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f846, and one count of aiding and abetting the distribution and\n\npossession with intent to distribute the same amount of cocaine, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2.\n\n           The jury convicted Gonzalez on both counts after a three-\n\nday trial.      He was sentenced to 240 months' imprisonment on each\n\ncount, to be served concurrently.           This timely appeal followed.\n\n                             II.   LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nA. Competency\n\n           Gonzalez first argues that he is entitled to a new trial\n\nbecause the district court wrongfully denied his request for a\n\ncompetency examination and the related request for a continuance.\n\nThe relevant facts may be sketched briefly.\n\n             On the day of jury selection, Gonzalez arrived at court\n\nin his jail-issued clothes, contrary to the advice of his attorney\n\nand the magistrate judge, who also discussed with him the potential\n\nnegative ramifications of his choice of attire.               Gonzalez said\n\nsimply that he \"just wanted to\" wear the jail clothes.                     His\n\nattorney indicated that Gonzalez was going forward to trial against\n\nhis advice -- and despite \"strong\" evidence against him -- because\n\nGonzalez feared for his family's safety from members of the drug\n\ncartel   with    whom   he   had   associated    if   he   pled   guilty   and\n\ncooperated.     A jury was selected, and trial was scheduled to begin\n\ntwo days later, February 8, 2007.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            The next day, however, defense counsel filed motions\n\nseeking a competency hearing for Gonzalez and a continuance.                  The\n\nbasis for the motions was an incident which occurred at the\n\ndetention facility where Gonzalez was being held, in which he cut\n\nhis wrists seriously enough to require transport to a hospital and\n\nsutures to repair the damage.        He was seen by a staff psychologist\n\nbefore being taken to the hospital.              Both the apparent suicide\n\nattempt and Gonzalez's prior refusal to wear civilian clothes to\n\ncourt were given as reasons to question Gonzalez's competency to\n\nstand trial.\n\n            The   district   court    held       a   brief   hearing3    on   the\n\ncompetency issue.    The judge asked defense counsel whether a pre-\n\nhearing conversation with Gonzalez demonstrated that he was unable\n\nto understand why he was in court, unable to communicate with or\n\nassist defense counsel or unable to participate in the trial.\n\nCounsel indicated that Gonzalez knew why he was in court and that\n\nhe   was   communicating,    although      \"he   might   not   be   focused    on\n\nassisting counsel.\"     The judge also asked a Deputy Marshal with\n\nknowledge of the incident for information on Gonzalez.                  He stated\n\nthat Gonzalez had told the staff psychologist during a five-minute\n\nexamination that he was not seeking to end his life, and that he\n\n\n3\n   A full-blown hearing, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a), would\ninvolve the presentation of evidence, generally including testimony\nof mental health professionals after examining the defendant. See,\ne.g., United States v. Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d 480 (1st Cir.\n1994).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fwas instead reacting to his pre-trial confinement and fears for his\n\nfamily's safety.       The Marshal also told the judge that jail\n\npersonnel with whom he had spoken had told him that Gonzalez\n\nunderstood \"what's going on,\" and had not acted in any sort of\n\ndelusional way. Finally, the judge spoke directly to Gonzalez, who\n\nsaid that he understood the roles of the judge, jury and attorneys.\n\n            The court denied both the motion to continue and the\n\nrequest for a competency examination and hearing.                    She found\n\n\"absolutely no indication . . . that this Defendant has in the past\n\nexhibited any symptoms of mental disease or defect.\"                 She added\n\nthat she found no \"indication that [Gonzalez] is now mentally\n\nincompetent,    that   is,    unable     to   understand   the   nature    and\n\nconsequences of the proceedings . . . or to assist properly in his\n\ndefense.\"    The judge also noted the stress Gonzalez was under due\n\nto the charges against him, and concluded that his apparent suicide\n\nattempt alone, without any other indicia of a mental disease or\n\ndefect, was insufficient to warrant a competency evaluation.\n\n            The court re-visited the competency issue after the\n\njury's verdict, in connection with Gonzalez's motion for new trial.\n\nAt that time, the court considered information in the Presentence\n\nReport prepared by the Probation Department.               In an interview,\n\nGonzalez denied any history of mental illness, said that his\n\nsuicide attempt was a result of his \"situation,\" and was \"out of\n\ncharacter\"   for   him.      He   also   denied   any   subsequent    suicidal\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fimpulses, noting that while he was emotionally upset about his\n\nconviction and worried about his family, he was not depressed and\n\nwould not harm himself.             In denying the new trial motion, the\n\ndistrict      court        reiterated   its    pre-trial      decision,       further\n\nsupporting the decision with the observation that Gonzalez had\n\ncommunicated with his counsel during the trial.4\n\n           A defendant's due process right to a fair trial includes\n\nthe   right    not     to     be   tried,     convicted      or   sentenced     while\n\nincompetent.      United States v. Drope, 420 U.S. 162, 172-73 (1975).\n\nPursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a), the district court must have a\n\nhearing \"if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant\n\nmay   presently       be    suffering   from    a   mental    disease   or     defect\n\nrendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable\n\nto understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to\n\nassist properly in his defense.\"              See also Dusky v. United States,\n\n362 U.S. 402 (1960).           We review the district court's decision not\n\nto hold a full competency hearing for abuse of discretion.                    We will\n\n\n\n4\n    While Gonzalez's one self-abusive incident should not be\ndiscounted, in our view neither the judge's amply supported\nfindings nor the defendant's own statements suggest the \"serious\nmental illness\" that our concurring colleague finds to be present.\n  Additionally, we do not agree that the concurrence's unadorned\ndescription of the defendant's crimes as \"nonviolent\" adequately\ncaptures the risks associated with significant drug distribution\noperations, either for the authorities who investigate them or for\nsociety at large.   See, e.g., United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d\n30,41 (1st Cir. 2001) (although large-scale drug trafficking may\nitself be nonviolent, the crime is commonly associated with\nviolence).\n\n                                        -10-\n\faffirm so long as there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to\n\nsupport the decision.       United States v. Bruck, 152 F.3d 40, 46 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n            Gonzalez points to Soldevila-Lopez, in which we reversed\n\nthe   district      court's     decision      to   deny   a    continuance     and\n\npsychological evaluation of a defendant awaiting sentencing.                    17\n\nF.3d at 490.      In that case, however, the district court had already\n\ngranted the defendant's motion for a hearing and evaluation but\n\nthen denied a subsequent request for further examination to respond\n\nto a court appointed psychologist's eleventh-hour addendum that the\n\ndefendant was malingering.            Id. at 482.     We found error in the\n\ndenial of the request for follow-up in light of the new information\n\nfrom the psychologist.        Id. at 489.      In addition, not only was the\n\ntrail of events in Soldevila-Lopez decidedly dissimilar to those\n\npresented here, but also the defendant in that case had a history\n\nof psychiatric illness and had been under medical care for his\n\ncondition, two factors not present here.\n\n            The    district    court    addressed    both     Gonzalez   and   his\n\nattorney    before    the     trial    and   again   after    the   verdict,    in\n\nconnection with his motion for new trial.             The salient details of\n\nthose inquiries have already been laid out, and in our view the\n\ntrial judge's conclusions were well-supported by the evidence\n\nbefore her.        Gonzalez had no prior history of mental health\n\nproblems.   He was able to communicate with the court before trial,\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fand he indicated his understanding of the proceedings about to\n\nbegin.    Defense counsel provided no indication that Gonzalez would\n\nbe unable to participate in his defense, and in fact the court\n\nobserved Gonzalez doing so.       The court also had the benefit of the\n\ninformation from the Marshal, the prison psychologist and the\n\nprobation department interview. Against this backdrop, we conclude\n\nthat the district court was not required to order a competency\n\nhearing and thus did not abuse its discretion in denying either the\n\nmotion for a hearing or the continuance motion that was predicated\n\non the need for an evaluation and hearing.              The court's rulings\n\nwere not an abuse of discretion.\n\nB. Evidentiary rulings\n\n            Gonzalez claims that evidence was improperly admitted\n\nagainst him.    We review the district court evidentiary rulings for\n\nabuse of discretion.      United States v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 58\n\n(1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            First,   Gonzalez    argues    that   the   eleven   packages   of\n\ncocaine    seized    at   the   warehouse,   along      with   the   packaging\n\nmaterials, were improperly admitted into evidence because there was\n\nno \"relevant connection\" between those items and Gonzalez.                This\n\nargument is, at least in part, premised on a claim that Detective\n\nRave's testimony should have been excluded because he was not\n\nsufficiently proficient in Spanish such that his translation of\n\nGonzalez's confession could be deemed accurate, and that Rave's\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fdecoding of the intercepted phone calls between Gonzalez and Belige\n\nwas inadmissible.\n\n           Turning   first     to   Detective     Rave,   we     note   that   the\n\ndistrict court conducted a voir dire, at which it was determined\n\nthat Spanish is Detective Rave's native language, he speaks it\n\nfluently and understands multiple dialects, and Spanish is spoken\n\nin his own household.      He also testified that he has served as a\n\ntranslator many times.       Gonzalez relies on the fact that Rave had\n\nno formal Spanish education since grammar school, and that he is\n\nnot certified as a translator or interpreter.             He also argues that\n\nRave's testimony is legally flawed because he waited more than two\n\nweeks to transcribe his notes of his conversation with Gonzalez.\n\n           We discern no abuse of discretion in the court's decision\n\nto allow Detective Rave's testimony.         The court was presented with\n\nconsiderable evidence of Officer Rave's fluency. Gonzalez provides\n\nno legal support for his apparent theory that only certified\n\ntranslators may provide such testimony, nor can we locate any.                  In\n\nthe end, we see this argument as one more properly directed to the\n\nweight of the evidence, not its admissibility.                 See Cummings v.\n\nStd.   Register   Co.,   256   F.3d    56,   65   (1st    Cir.    2001)   (while\n\nshortcomings in certain testimony might reduce its probative value,\n\nthey do not necessarily render it inadmissible). We therefore find\n\nno abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            Similarly, we reject Gonzalez's claim that the trial\n\njudge should have excluded Detective Rave's interpretation of the\n\ncoded   language     in    the   intercepted     phone   calls.       Citing   no\n\nauthority, Gonzalez essentially argues that the jury should have\n\nrejected Rave's understanding of ambiguous conversations.                This is\n\na classic weight versus admissibility argument that goes nowhere.\n\nThere was no abuse of discretion in admitting Rave's testimony.\n\n            Having disposed of these preliminary evidentiary claims,\n\nour conclusion as to the admissibility of the cocaine and its\n\npackaging      is   not    difficult   to     reach.     Gonzalez's    recorded\n\nconversations with Belige placed him squarely in the deal, and his\n\nconfession to Rave was all the evidence necessary to show that his\n\ncousin, acting on Gonzalez's orders, brought the cocaine to Rhode\n\nIsland, where it -- and the wrappings used to hide it during\n\ntransit   --     were     located.     Gonzalez's      rebuttal   argument     is\n\nostensibly limited to noting that nobody actually saw the cocaine\n\nunloaded from the cousin's vehicle inside the warehouse.                The jury\n\nrejected this argument, as it was free to do.             Accordingly, there\n\nwas no error in the admission of the cocaine or packaging.\n\nC. Sufficiency of the evidence\n\n            Because the entirety of Gonzalez's sufficiency argument\n\nis premised on the evidentiary claims we have already rejected, we\n\nhave little trouble concluding that, in the light most favorable to\n\nthe verdict, a rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\freasonable doubt.    United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo, 483 F.3d\n\n124, 129-30 (1st Cir. 2007).        In sum, Gonzalez was overheard\n\narranging the drug deal, the drugs were seized, and he confessed\n\nhis involvement.     The verdict was thus sufficiently supported by\n\nthe evidence.\n\nD. Sentencing\n\n           Gonzalez makes several arguments regarding his twenty-\n\nyear sentence.    First, he claims that the prosecution, by filing a\n\nsentence     enhancement   information5    on   the       eve     of   trial,\n\nunconstitutionally    burdened   his    right   to    a    jury    trial    by\n\nessentially penalizing him for choosing to go to trial.                    The\n\ninformation, which noted two prior drug felony convictions under\n\nCalifornia law, subjected Gonzalez to a mandatory minimum sentence\n\nof 20 years.    See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).   Gonzalez        supports his\n\nargument by relying on United States v. Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d 259\n\n(D. Mass. 2004), in which the district court imposed a reduced\n\nsentence in part because the government changed its position on\n\nvarious sentence enhancements after plea bargaining collapsed. Id.\n\nat 329-30.     Gonzalez, however, fails to note that to the extent\n\nrelevant here, we reversed the district court's sentencing in Green\n\nin United States v. Yeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2005).              Our\n\ncomment there is dispositive here:        \"A defendant simply has no\n\n\n5\n   Under 21 U.S.C. § 851, the government must file an information\nwith the court if it intends to seek an increase in a defendant's\nsentence based on a prior conviction.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fright to a sentence, after trial, that is as lenient as a sentence\n\nhe could have had earlier in a plea bargain.\"           Id. at 26-27.    See\n\nalso, United States v. Jenkins, 537 F. 3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 2008)\n\n(absent evidence of prosecutorial vindictiveness, there is no due\n\nprocess violation when government files § 851 information after\n\nfailure to reach plea agreement in which government would have\n\nagreed not to file information).\n\n           Next, also relying on Green, Gonzalez argues that the use\n\nof the § 851 information unconstitutionally violates the Separation\n\nof Powers Doctrine, because it places too much sentencing power in\n\nthe hands of the prosecutor. Gonzalez cites no pertinent authority\n\nfor his position, which has been explicitly rejected by at least\n\nthree other circuits.       See United States v. Watford, 468 F.3d 891,\n\n911 (6th Cir. 2006); United States v. Jensen, 425 F.3d 698, 707\n\n(9th Cir. 2005); United States v. Cespedes, 151 F. 3d 1329, 1332-34\n\n(11th Cir. 1998).      Each of these cases relied on United States v.\n\nLaBonte, 520 U.S. 751 (1997), in which the Court noted that a\n\nprosecutor's ability to affect sentencing \"is similar to the\n\ndiscretion a prosecutor exercises when he decides what, if any,\n\ncharges to bring against a criminal suspect. Such discretion is an\n\nintegral     feature   of    the   criminal   justice    system,   and    is\n\nappropriate, so long as it is not based on improper factors.\"            Id.\n\nat 761-62.    We join the three other circuits in holding no viable\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fSeparation    of    Powers   claim    is    presented     by    the   defendant's\n\nargument.\n\n            Gonzalez    next   argues      broadly    that     mandatory   minimum\n\nsentences violate his right to due process because they remove the\n\ntrial judge's sentencing discretion.            However, it is beyond cavil\n\nthat Congress has the power to set statutory minimum and maximum\n\nsentences to which courts must adhere.            Chapman v. United States,\n\n500 U.S. 453, 467 (1991).\n\n            Finally,    Gonzalez     argues    that    his     sentence    must    be\n\nreversed because his prior convictions were not proved beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.      In so doing, he argues against the continuing\n\nviability of Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224\n\n(1998).      This   argument   is    a     non-starter,      for   \"whatever      the\n\ncontinuing viability of Almendarez-Torres, we have previously held\n\nthat we are bound to follow it until it is expressly overruled.\"\n\nUnited States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 520 (1st. Cir. 2006)\n\n(en banc), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 928 (2007).\n\n            Appellant's      arguments       having     been       rejected,      his\n\nconviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n                       -Concurring Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\f            MERRITT, Circuit Judge, concurring.             I concur in the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but I agree with the District Court that the\n\nprosecution’s decision to seek a mandatory sentence of 20 years\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 851 passes all understanding. The District Court\n\nsaid: “I recognize you [AUSA] do this at the behest of your\n\nsuperiors.    But I can’t sit here today and impose this sentence\n\nwithout saying it’s wrong, and you can take that message to whoever\n\nyou think might listen.”           The Judicial Conference of the United\n\nStates for almost 20 years, and the Sentencing Commission for\n\nalmost 10 years, have pleaded with the judiciary committees of\n\nCongress to do something about the serious injustices that these\n\nlong, mandatory minimum sentences impose — to no avail.            This is a\n\n20-year sentence for a nonviolent crime by a defendant with a\n\nserious mental illness.       His incarceration will cost the American\n\ntaxpayers    in   today’s    dollars    somewhere   between    $600,000   and\n\n$1,000,000.       With      some    carefully   monitored     rehabilitation\n\ntreatment, it is possible that he could be released in just a few\n\nyears.   Like the District Judge, I think that the prosecution’s\n\npurely discretionary decision to ratchet up this sentence to 20\n\nyears is misguided and ought to be reconsidered when the judgment\n\nbecomes final.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\f",

He was sentenced to twenty years in prison. On appeal, Gonzalez claims that the district court erred in denying his pre-trial motion for a competency hearing and in admitting certain evidence. He also asserts that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict him, and that his sentence violated his constitutional rights. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</i></h2>\n<p>We review the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>United States v. Marin,</i> 523 F.3d 24 (1st Cir.2008). In January 2006, law enforcement authorities were investigating two Rhode Island men, Estoredarico Bernard (\"Belige\"), and Eucraneo Severino (\"Severino\"). The investigation included surveillance of a liquor store that Belige owned and operated, an import/export business owned and operated by Severino, and Severino's residence.</p>\n<p>During this time period, Gonzalez lived in Denver, Colorado, where he served as a middleman for Colorado-based cocaine dealers tied to Mexican drug cartels. His role was to find customers in the northeast United States. Belige was one such customer.</p>\n<p>In late January, authorities eavesdropped on a telephone call from Gonzalez to Belige, in which Gonzalez left the message, \"Uncle. I am Fernando. Call me back whenever you can to [a phone number].\" Two days later, Belige listened to the message three times, and then returned the call, leaving the following message: \"Your uncle is calling you. Call me back.\" Gonzalez returned the call and the two spoke for a short time. The conversation went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Belige<sup>[1]</sup> (\"B\"): Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Gonzalez (\"G\"): Oh, Hello, uncle, how have you been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: [Chuckles]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Where were you? Were you lost?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: No, there wasn't any. [chuckles].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: [chuckles]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Oh well things were calm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Oh that's good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: So, are you working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Do you want me to take a ride over?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Come over today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: [Chuckles] It's just that I'm getting it for you way too high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Oh, st, then you're not right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What ... where are you driving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Come again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What's the mileage? How much are you driving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> G: For 19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What? You are crazy (laughter)(unintelligible) is here this week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: And what about 18½?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: 18½.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Wellit can be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: To help you out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah, well let melet me see if I can get ready right away and I'll call you in the afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: That I'll be ready right away and I'll call you in the afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Well come over here before the other one arrives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah, yeah. If I go, I'll be arriving in two days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Oh, around Saturday. Saturday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Alright.</blockquote>\n<p>According to Central Falls, R.I., Detective Dorian Rave<sup>[2]</sup>, the above conversation was actually rife with coded language concerning the delivery of cocaine to Belige. For example, \"there wasn't any\" was an indication that Gonzalez had been out of contact because of a depleted cocaine supply; when he asked whether Belige was \"working,\" Gonzalez was asking whether Belige was dealing drugs; finally, the discussion of \"mileage\"18½ and 19was actually the price per kilogram in thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p>True to his word, Gonzalez called Belige later the same day. This shorter conversation went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>B: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Uh what's up uncle, it's me Fernando.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Talk to me Fernando.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Oh I couldn't do that. It didn't work out for me. I need you to just tojust for 19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Oh but it doesn't work out that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: It doesn't work out? Yeah, but he'll leave in the morning and the guy has them but I wasn't able to get them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: He didn't want togo lower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Damn, that's rough that way. That's not much profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: There's no profit there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: What did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: That there's not much profit there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Uh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: No, well think about it-if you want and I'll look for another guy to see what comes up, if you're a go call me that those are there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Well then. Uh, then when would that be here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah, he's-he would be leaving in the morning and arrives Saturday in the afternoon or Sunday morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Uh. Well, then come over to help you out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Come over to help you out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Oh then thank you man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Alright.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> Detective Rave decoded this conversation to mean that Gonzalez could go no lower than the $19,000 per kilogram price discussed earlier in the day. Despite the protest about the small profit, Belige agreed after Gonzalez informed him that a courier would leave the next morning (a Wednesday) and deliver the cocaine to Belige Saturday or Sunday.</p>\n<p>On the following Monday, January 30, surveillance personnel observed Severino enter Belige's liquor store. He left the liquor store in his car, followed by a car with Colorado license plates. The Colorado car went into a warehouse at Severino's place of business. The driver of the Colorado carlater determined to be Gonzalez's cousin, Adalberto Gonzalezleft about an hour later. He was followed by federal agents to a nearby hotel. Later that day, agents approached Severino and obtained permission to search the warehouse, where they seized a duffel bag containing 11 sealed packages of cocaine, package sealing materials, and gasoline soaked wrappings and rags, which police theorized were used to protect the cocaine that had been hidden in the Colorado car's gas tank during transit.</p>\n<p>After seizing the cocaine, police arrested Belige and Adalberto Gonzalez. At the request of the police, Belige called appellant to tell him that he and appellant's cousin had been arrested. Detective Rave subsequently called appellant, identifying himself as a police officer. During this conversationwhich took place in SpanishGonzalez acknowledged that he had discussed the arrest with Belige. He admitted his status as the middleman for the Colorado distributors and the tasks he did for them, as well as the fact that he had negotiated the sale to Belige and enlisted his cousin to be the drug courier.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez was indicted on one count of conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846, and one count of aiding and abetting the distribution and possession with intent to distribute the same amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.</p>\n<p>The jury convicted Gonzalez on both counts after a three-day trial. He was sentenced to 240 months' imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Competency</i></h2>\n<p>Gonzalez first argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court wrongfully denied his request for a competency examination and the related request for a continuance. The relevant facts may be sketched briefly.</p>\n<p>On the day of jury selection, Gonzalez arrived at court in his jail-issued clothes, contrary to the advice of his attorney and the magistrate judge, who also discussed with him the potential negative ramifications of his choice of attire. Gonzalez said simply that he \"just wanted to\" wear the jail clothes. His attorney indicated that Gonzalez was going forward to trial against his adviceand despite \"strong\" evidence against himbecause Gonzalez feared for his family's safety from members of the drug cartel with whom he had associated if he pled guilty and cooperated. A jury was selected, and trial was scheduled to begin two days later, February 8, 2007.</p>\n<p>The next day, however, defense counsel filed motions seeking a competency hearing for Gonzalez and a continuance. The basis for the motions was an incident which occurred at the detention facility where Gonzalez was being held, in which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> he cut his wrists seriously enough to require transport to a hospital and sutures to repair the damage. He was seen by a staff psychologist before being taken to the hospital. Both the apparent suicide attempt and Gonzalez's prior refusal to wear civilian clothes to court were given as reasons to question Gonzalez's competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p>The district court held a brief hearing<sup>[3]</sup> on the competency issue. The judge asked defense counsel whether a pre-hearing conversation with Gonzalez demonstrated that he was unable to understand why he was in court, unable to communicate with or assist defense counsel or unable to participate in the trial. Counsel indicated that Gonzalez knew why he was in court and that he was communicating, although \"he might not be focused on assisting counsel.\" The judge also asked a Deputy Marshal with knowledge of the incident for information on Gonzalez. He stated that Gonzalez had told the staff psychologist during a five-minute examination that he was not seeking to end his life, and that he was instead reacting to his pre-trial confinement and fears for his family's safety. The Marshal also told the judge that jail personnel with whom he had spoken had told him that Gonzalez understood \"what's going on,\" and had not acted in any sort of delusional way. Finally, the judge spoke directly to Gonzalez, who said that he understood the roles of the judge, jury and attorneys.</p>\n<p>The court denied both the motion to continue and the request for a competency examination and hearing. She found \"absolutely no indication ... that this Defendant has in the past exhibited any symptoms of mental disease or defect.\" She added that she found no \"indication that [Gonzalez] is now mentally incompetent, that is, unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings ... or to assist properly in his defense.\" The judge also noted the stress Gonzalez was under due to the charges against him, and concluded that his apparent suicide attempt alone, without any other indicia of a mental disease or defect, was insufficient to warrant a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p>The court re-visited the competency issue after the jury's verdict, in connection with Gonzalez's motion for new trial. At that time, the court considered information in the Presentence Report prepared by the Probation Department. In an interview, Gonzalez denied any history of mental illness, said that his suicide attempt was a result of his \"situation,\" and was \"out of character\" for him. He also denied any subsequent suicidal impulses, noting that while he was emotionally upset about his conviction and worried about his family, he was not depressed and would not harm himself. In denying the new trial motion, the district court reiterated its pre-trial decision, further supporting the decision with the observation that Gonzalez had communicated with his counsel during the trial.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> A defendant's due process right to a fair trial includes the right not to be tried, convicted or sentenced while incompetent. <i>Drope v. Missouri,</i> 420 U.S. 162, 172-73, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a), the district court must have a hearing \"if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\" <i>See also </i><i>Dusky v. United States,</i> 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960). We review the district court's decision not to hold a full competency hearing for abuse of discretion. We will affirm so long as there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the decision. <i>United States v. Bruck,</i> 152 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>Gonzalez points to <i>Soldevila-Lopez,</i> in which we reversed the district court's decision to deny a continuance and psychological evaluation of a defendant awaiting sentencing. 17 F.3d at 490. In that case, however, the district court had already granted the defendant's motion for a hearing and evaluation but then denied a subsequent request for further examination to respond to a court appointed psychologist's eleventh-hour addendum that the defendant was malingering. <i>Id.</i> at 482. We found error in the denial of the request for follow-up in light of the new information from the psychologist. <i>Id.</i> at 489. In addition, not only was the trail of events in <i>Soldevila-Lopez</i> decidedly dissimilar to those presented here, but also the defendant in that case had a history of psychiatric illness and had been under medical care for his condition, two factors not present here.</p>\n<p>The district court addressed both Gonzalez and his attorney before the trial and again after the verdict, in connection with his motion for new trial. The salient details of those inquiries have already been laid out, and in our view the trial judge's conclusions were well-supported by the evidence before her. Gonzalez had no prior history of mental health problems. He was able to communicate with the court before trial, and he indicated his understanding of the proceedings about to begin. Defense counsel provided no indication that Gonzalez would be unable to participate in his defense, and in fact the court observed Gonzalez doing so. The court also had the benefit of the information from the Marshal, the prison psychologist and the probation department interview. Against this backdrop, we conclude that the district court was not required to order a competency hearing and thus did not abuse its discretion in denying either the motion for a hearing or the continuance motion that was predicated on the need for an evaluation and hearing. The court's rulings were not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Evidentiary rulings</i></h2>\n<p>Gonzalez claims that evidence was improperly admitted against him. We review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 58 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>First, Gonzalez argues that the eleven packages of cocaine seized at the warehouse, along with the packaging materials, were improperly admitted into evidence because there was no \"relevant connection\" between those items and Gonzalez. This argument is, at least in part, premised on a claim that Detective Rave's testimony should have been excluded because he was not sufficiently proficient in Spanish such that his translation of Gonzalez's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> confession could be deemed accurate, and that Rave's decoding of the intercepted phone calls between Gonzalez and Belige was inadmissible.</p>\n<p>Turning first to Detective Rave, we note that the district court conducted a voir dire, at which it was determined that Spanish is Detective Rave's native language, he speaks it fluently and understands multiple dialects, and Spanish is spoken in his own household. He also testified that he has served as a translator many times. Gonzalez relies on the fact that Rave had no formal Spanish education since grammar school, and that he is not certified as a translator or interpreter. He also argues that Rave's testimony is legally flawed because he waited more than two weeks to transcribe his notes of his conversation with Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>We discern no abuse of discretion in the court's decision to allow Detective Rave's testimony. The court was presented with considerable evidence of Officer Rave's fluency. Gonzalez provides no legal support for his apparent theory that only certified translators may provide such testimony, nor can we locate any. In the end, we see this argument as one more properly directed to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. <i>See </i><i>Cummings v. Std. Register Co.,</i> 265 F.3d 56, 65 (1st Cir.2001) (while shortcomings in certain testimony might reduce its probative value, they do not necessarily render it inadmissible). We therefore find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we reject Gonzalez's claim that the trial judge should have excluded Detective Rave's interpretation of the coded language in the intercepted phone calls. Citing no authority, Gonzalez essentially argues that the jury should have rejected Rave's understanding of ambiguous conversations. This is a classic weight versus admissibility argument that goes nowhere. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting Rave's testimony.</p>\n<p>Having disposed of these preliminary evidentiary claims, our conclusion as to the admissibility of the cocaine and its packaging is not difficult to reach. Gonzalez's recorded conversations with Belige placed him squarely in the deal, and his confession to Rave was all the evidence necessary to show that his cousin, acting on Gonzalez's orders, brought the cocaine to Rhode Island, where itand the wrappings used to hide it during transitwere located. Gonzalez's rebuttal argument is ostensibly limited to noting that nobody actually saw the cocaine unloaded from the cousin's vehicle inside the warehouse. The jury rejected this argument, as it was free to do. Accordingly, there was no error in the admission of the cocaine or packaging.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Sufficiency of the evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Because the entirety of Gonzalez's sufficiency argument is premised on the evidentiary claims we have already rejected, we have little trouble concluding that, in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> 483 F.3d 124, 129-30 (1st Cir.2007). In sum, Gonzalez was overheard arranging the drug deal, the drugs were seized, and he confessed his involvement. The verdict was thus sufficiently supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>D. Sentencing</i></h2>\n<p>Gonzalez makes several arguments regarding his twenty-year sentence. First, he claims that the prosecution, by filing a sentence enhancement information<sup>[5]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> on the eve of trial, unconstitutionally burdened his right to a jury trial by essentially penalizing him for choosing to go to trial. The information, which noted two prior drug felony convictions under California law, subjected Gonzalez to a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A). Gonzalez supports his argument by relying on <i>United States v. Green,</i> 346 F.Supp.2d 259 (D.Mass.2004), in which the district court imposed a reduced sentence in part because the government changed its position on various sentence enhancements after plea bargaining collapsed. <i>Id.</i> at 329-30. Gonzalez, however, fails to note that to the extent relevant here, we reversed the district court's sentencing in <i>Green</i> in <i>United States v. Yeje-Cabrera,</i> 430 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2005). Our comment there is dispositive here: \"A defendant simply has no right to a sentence, after trial, that is as lenient as a sentence he could have had earlier in a plea bargain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26-27. <i>See also, </i><i>United States v. Jenkins,</i> 537 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.2008) (absent evidence of prosecutorial vindictiveness, there is no due process violation when government files § 851 information after failure to reach plea agreement in which government would have agreed not to file information).</p>\n<p>Next, also relying on <i>Green,</i> Gonzalez argues that the use of the § 851 information unconstitutionally violates the Separation of Powers Doctrine, because it places too much sentencing power in the hands of the prosecutor. Gonzalez cites no pertinent authority for his position, which has been explicitly rejected by at least three other circuits. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Watford,</i> 468 F.3d 891, 911 (6th Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Jensen,</i> 425 F.3d 698, 707 (9th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Cespedes,</i> 151 F.3d 1329, 1332-34 (11th Cir.1998). Each of these cases relied on <i>United States v. LaBonte,</i> 520 U.S. 751, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997), in which the Court noted that a prosecutor's ability to affect sentencing \"is similar to the discretion a prosecutor exercises when he decides what, if any, charges to bring against a criminal suspect. Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate, so long as it is not based on improper factors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 761-62, 117 S.Ct. 1673. We join the three other circuits in holding no viable Separation of Powers claim is presented by the defendant's argument.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez next argues broadly that mandatory minimum sentences violate his right to due process because they remove the trial judge's sentencing discretion. However, it is beyond cavil that Congress has the power to set statutory minimum and maximum sentences to which courts must adhere. <i>Chapman v. United States,</i> 500 U.S. 453, 467, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991).</p>\n<p>Finally, Gonzalez argues that his sentence must be reversed because his prior convictions were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In so doing, he argues against the continuing viability of <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). This argument is a non-starter, for \"whatever the continuing viability of <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> we have previously held that we are bound to follow it until it is expressly overruled.\" <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> 440 F.3d 514, 520 (1st. Cir.2006) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> 549 U.S. 1118, 127 S.Ct. 928, 166 L.Ed.2d 715 (2007).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> Appellant's arguments having been rejected, his conviction and sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MERRITT, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur in the Court's opinion, but I agree with the District Court that the prosecution's decision to seek a mandatory sentence of 20 years under 21 U.S.C. § 851 passes all understanding. The District Court said: \"I recognize you [AUSA] do this at the behest of your superiors. But I can't sit here today and impose this sentence <i>without saying it's wrong,</i> and you can take that message to whoever you think might listen.\" The Judicial Conference of the United States for almost 20 years, and the Sentencing Commission for almost 10 years, have pleaded with the judiciary committees of Congress to do something about the serious injustices that these long, mandatory minimum sentences imposeto no avail. This is a 20-year sentence for a nonviolent crime by a defendant with a serious mental illness. His incarceration will cost the American taxpayers in today's dollars somewhere between $600,000 and $1,000,000. With some carefully monitored rehabilitation treatment, it is possible that he could be released in just a few years. Like the District Judge, I think that the prosecution's purely discretionary decision to ratchet up this sentence to 20 years is misguided and ought to be reconsidered when the judgment becomes final.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The briefs refer to this individual as \"Belige.\" The transcripts of the phone conversations use \"Beligue.\" For the sake of consistency, we use the former spelling.</p>\n<p>[2]  Rave was assigned to work with an FBI narcotics task force.</p>\n<p>[3]  A full-blown hearing, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a), would involve the presentation of evidence, generally including testimony of mental health professionals after examining the defendant. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Soldevila-Lopez,</i> 17 F.3d 480 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>[4]  While Gonzalez's one self-abusive incident should not be discounted, in our view neither the judge's amply supported findings nor the defendant's own statements suggest the \"serious mental illness\" that our concurring colleague finds to be present.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, we do not agree that the concurrence's unadorned description of the defendant's crimes as \"nonviolent\" adequately captures the risks associated with significant drug distribution operations, either for the authorities who investigate them or for society at large. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Scott,</i> 270 F.3d 30,41 (1st Cir.2001) (although large-scale drug trafficking may itself be nonviolent, the crime is commonly associated with violence).</p>\n<p>[5]  Under 21 U.S.C. § 851, the government must file an information with the court if it intends to seek an increase in a defendant's sentence based on a prior conviction.</p>\n\n</div>",

He was sentenced to twenty years in prison. On appeal, Gonzalez claims that the district court erred in denying his pre-trial motion for a competency hearing and in admitting certain evidence. He also asserts that the evidence was legally insufficient to convict him, and that his sentence violated his constitutional rights. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</i></h2>\n<p>We review the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict. <i>United States v. Marin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203236\"><a href=\"/opinion/203236/united-states-v-marin/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2008). In January 2006, law enforcement authorities were investigating two Rhode Island men, Estoredarico Bernard (\"Belige\"), and Eucraneo Severino (\"Severino\"). The investigation included surveillance of a liquor store that Belige owned and operated, an import/export business owned and operated by Severino, and Severino's residence.</p>\n<p>During this time period, Gonzalez lived in Denver, Colorado, where he served as a middleman for Colorado-based cocaine dealers tied to Mexican drug cartels. His role was to find customers in the northeast United States. Belige was one such customer.</p>\n<p>In late January, authorities eavesdropped on a telephone call from Gonzalez to Belige, in which Gonzalez left the message, \"Uncle. I am Fernando. Call me back whenever you can to [a phone number].\" Two days later, Belige listened to the message three times, and then returned the call, leaving the following message: \"Your uncle is calling you. Call me back.\" Gonzalez returned the call and the two spoke for a short time. The conversation went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Belige<sup>[1]</sup> (\"B\"): Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Gonzalez (\"G\"): Oh, Hello, uncle, how have you been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: [Chuckles]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Where were you? Were you lost?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: No, there wasn't any. [chuckles].</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: [chuckles]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Oh well things were calm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Oh that's good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: So, are you working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Do you want me to take a ride over?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Come over today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: [Chuckles] It's just that I'm getting it for you way too high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Oh, st, then you're not right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What ... where are you driving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Come again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What's the mileage? How much are you driving?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> G: For 19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What? You are crazy (laughter)(unintelligible) is here this week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: And what about 18½?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: 18½.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Wellit can be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: To help you out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah, well let melet me see if I can get ready right away and I'll call you in the afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: That I'll be ready right away and I'll call you in the afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Well come over here before the other one arrives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah, yeah. If I go, I'll be arriving in two days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Oh, around Saturday. Saturday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Alright.</blockquote>\n<p>According to Central Falls, R.I., Detective Dorian Rave<sup>[2]</sup>, the above conversation was actually rife with coded language concerning the delivery of cocaine to Belige. For example, \"there wasn't any\" was an indication that Gonzalez had been out of contact because of a depleted cocaine supply; when he asked whether Belige was \"working,\" Gonzalez was asking whether Belige was dealing drugs; finally, the discussion of \"mileage\"18½ and 19was actually the price per kilogram in thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p>True to his word, Gonzalez called Belige later the same day. This shorter conversation went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>B: Hello.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Uh what's up uncle, it's me Fernando.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Talk to me Fernando.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Oh I couldn't do that. It didn't work out for me. I need you to just tojust for 19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Oh but it doesn't work out that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: It doesn't work out? Yeah, but he'll leave in the morning and the guy has them but I wasn't able to get them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: He didn't want togo lower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Damn, that's rough that way. That's not much profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: There's no profit there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: What did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: That there's not much profit there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Uh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: No, well think about it-if you want and I'll look for another guy to see what comes up, if you're a go call me that those are there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Well then. Uh, then when would that be here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah, he's-he would be leaving in the morning and arrives Saturday in the afternoon or Sunday morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Uh. Well, then come over to help you out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Come over to help you out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Oh then thank you man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>B: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>G: Alright.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> Detective Rave decoded this conversation to mean that Gonzalez could go no lower than the $19,000 per kilogram price discussed earlier in the day. Despite the protest about the small profit, Belige agreed after Gonzalez informed him that a courier would leave the next morning (a Wednesday) and deliver the cocaine to Belige Saturday or Sunday.</p>\n<p>On the following Monday, January 30, surveillance personnel observed Severino enter Belige's liquor store. He left the liquor store in his car, followed by a car with Colorado license plates. The Colorado car went into a warehouse at Severino's place of business. The driver of the Colorado carlater determined to be Gonzalez's cousin, Adalberto Gonzalezleft about an hour later. He was followed by federal agents to a nearby hotel. Later that day, agents approached Severino and obtained permission to search the warehouse, where they seized a duffel bag containing 11 sealed packages of cocaine, package sealing materials, and gasoline soaked wrappings and rags, which police theorized were used to protect the cocaine that had been hidden in the Colorado car's gas tank during transit.</p>\n<p>After seizing the cocaine, police arrested Belige and Adalberto Gonzalez. At the request of the police, Belige called appellant to tell him that he and appellant's cousin had been arrested. Detective Rave subsequently called appellant, identifying himself as a police officer. During this conversationwhich took place in SpanishGonzalez acknowledged that he had discussed the arrest with Belige. He admitted his status as the middleman for the Colorado distributors and the tasks he did for them, as well as the fact that he had negotiated the sale to Belige and enlisted his cousin to be the drug courier.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez was indicted on one count of conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846, and one count of aiding and abetting the distribution and possession with intent to distribute the same amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.</p>\n<p>The jury convicted Gonzalez on both counts after a three-day trial. He was sentenced to 240 months' imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>II. LEGAL ANALYSIS</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>A. Competency</i></h2>\n<p>Gonzalez first argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court wrongfully denied his request for a competency examination and the related request for a continuance. The relevant facts may be sketched briefly.</p>\n<p>On the day of jury selection, Gonzalez arrived at court in his jail-issued clothes, contrary to the advice of his attorney and the magistrate judge, who also discussed with him the potential negative ramifications of his choice of attire. Gonzalez said simply that he \"just wanted to\" wear the jail clothes. His attorney indicated that Gonzalez was going forward to trial against his adviceand despite \"strong\" evidence against himbecause Gonzalez feared for his family's safety from members of the drug cartel with whom he had associated if he pled guilty and cooperated. A jury was selected, and trial was scheduled to begin two days later, February 8, 2007.</p>\n<p>The next day, however, defense counsel filed motions seeking a competency hearing for Gonzalez and a continuance. The basis for the motions was an incident which occurred at the detention facility where Gonzalez was being held, in which <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> he cut his wrists seriously enough to require transport to a hospital and sutures to repair the damage. He was seen by a staff psychologist before being taken to the hospital. Both the apparent suicide attempt and Gonzalez's prior refusal to wear civilian clothes to court were given as reasons to question Gonzalez's competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p>The district court held a brief hearing<sup>[3]</sup> on the competency issue. The judge asked defense counsel whether a pre-hearing conversation with Gonzalez demonstrated that he was unable to understand why he was in court, unable to communicate with or assist defense counsel or unable to participate in the trial. Counsel indicated that Gonzalez knew why he was in court and that he was communicating, although \"he might not be focused on assisting counsel.\" The judge also asked a Deputy Marshal with knowledge of the incident for information on Gonzalez. He stated that Gonzalez had told the staff psychologist during a five-minute examination that he was not seeking to end his life, and that he was instead reacting to his pre-trial confinement and fears for his family's safety. The Marshal also told the judge that jail personnel with whom he had spoken had told him that Gonzalez understood \"what's going on,\" and had not acted in any sort of delusional way. Finally, the judge spoke directly to Gonzalez, who said that he understood the roles of the judge, jury and attorneys.</p>\n<p>The court denied both the motion to continue and the request for a competency examination and hearing. She found \"absolutely no indication ... that this Defendant has in the past exhibited any symptoms of mental disease or defect.\" She added that she found no \"indication that [Gonzalez] is now mentally incompetent, that is, unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings ... or to assist properly in his defense.\" The judge also noted the stress Gonzalez was under due to the charges against him, and concluded that his apparent suicide attempt alone, without any other indicia of a mental disease or defect, was insufficient to warrant a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p>The court re-visited the competency issue after the jury's verdict, in connection with Gonzalez's motion for new trial. At that time, the court considered information in the Presentence Report prepared by the Probation Department. In an interview, Gonzalez denied any history of mental illness, said that his suicide attempt was a result of his \"situation,\" and was \"out of character\" for him. He also denied any subsequent suicidal impulses, noting that while he was emotionally upset about his conviction and worried about his family, he was not depressed and would not harm himself. In denying the new trial motion, the district court reiterated its pre-trial decision, further supporting the decision with the observation that Gonzalez had communicated with his counsel during the trial.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> A defendant's due process right to a fair trial includes the right not to be tried, convicted or sentenced while incompetent. <i>Drope v. Missouri,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109191\"><a href=\"/opinion/109191/drope-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 172-73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109191\"><a href=\"/opinion/109191/drope-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span> (1975). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a), the district court must have a hearing \"if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\" <i>See also </i><i>Dusky v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106037\"><a href=\"/opinion/106037/dusky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106037\"><a href=\"/opinion/106037/dusky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We will affirm so long as there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support the decision. <i>United States v. Bruck,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198104\"><a href=\"/opinion/198104/united-states-v-bruck/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>Gonzalez points to <i>Soldevila-Lopez,</i> in which we reversed the district court's decision to deny a continuance and psychological evaluation of a defendant awaiting sentencing. 17 F.3d at 490. In that case, however, the district court had already granted the defendant's motion for a hearing and evaluation but then denied a subsequent request for further examination to respond to a court appointed psychologist's eleventh-hour addendum that the defendant was malingering. <i>Id.</i> at 482. We found error in the denial of the request for follow-up in light of the new information from the psychologist. <i>Id.</i> at 489. In addition, not only was the trail of events in <i>Soldevila-Lopez</i> decidedly dissimilar to those presented here, but also the defendant in that case had a history of psychiatric illness and had been under medical care for his condition, two factors not present here.</p>\n<p>The district court addressed both Gonzalez and his attorney before the trial and again after the verdict, in connection with his motion for new trial. The salient details of those inquiries have already been laid out, and in our view the trial judge's conclusions were well-supported by the evidence before her. Gonzalez had no prior history of mental health problems. He was able to communicate with the court before trial, and he indicated his understanding of the proceedings about to begin. Defense counsel provided no indication that Gonzalez would be unable to participate in his defense, and in fact the court observed Gonzalez doing so. The court also had the benefit of the information from the Marshal, the prison psychologist and the probation department interview. Against this backdrop, we conclude that the district court was not required to order a competency hearing and thus did not abuse its discretion in denying either the motion for a hearing or the continuance motion that was predicated on the need for an evaluation and hearing. The court's rulings were not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>B. Evidentiary rulings</i></h2>\n<p>Gonzalez claims that evidence was improperly admitted against him. We review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203344\"><a href=\"/opinion/203344/united-states-v-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>First, Gonzalez argues that the eleven packages of cocaine seized at the warehouse, along with the packaging materials, were improperly admitted into evidence because there was no \"relevant connection\" between those items and Gonzalez. This argument is, at least in part, premised on a claim that Detective Rave's testimony should have been excluded because he was not sufficiently proficient in Spanish such that his translation of Gonzalez's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> confession could be deemed accurate, and that Rave's decoding of the intercepted phone calls between Gonzalez and Belige was inadmissible.</p>\n<p>Turning first to Detective Rave, we note that the district court conducted a voir dire, at which it was determined that Spanish is Detective Rave's native language, he speaks it fluently and understands multiple dialects, and Spanish is spoken in his own household. He also testified that he has served as a translator many times. Gonzalez relies on the fact that Rave had no formal Spanish education since grammar school, and that he is not certified as a translator or interpreter. He also argues that Rave's testimony is legally flawed because he waited more than two weeks to transcribe his notes of his conversation with Gonzalez.</p>\n<p>We discern no abuse of discretion in the court's decision to allow Detective Rave's testimony. The court was presented with considerable evidence of Officer Rave's fluency. Gonzalez provides no legal support for his apparent theory that only certified translators may provide such testimony, nor can we locate any. In the end, we see this argument as one more properly directed to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. <i>See </i><i>Cummings v. Std. Register Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199597\"><a href=\"/opinion/199597/cummings-v-standard-register/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir.2001) (while shortcomings in certain testimony might reduce its probative value, they do not necessarily render it inadmissible). We therefore find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we reject Gonzalez's claim that the trial judge should have excluded Detective Rave's interpretation of the coded language in the intercepted phone calls. Citing no authority, Gonzalez essentially argues that the jury should have rejected Rave's understanding of ambiguous conversations. This is a classic weight versus admissibility argument that goes nowhere. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting Rave's testimony.</p>\n<p>Having disposed of these preliminary evidentiary claims, our conclusion as to the admissibility of the cocaine and its packaging is not difficult to reach. Gonzalez's recorded conversations with Belige placed him squarely in the deal, and his confession to Rave was all the evidence necessary to show that his cousin, acting on Gonzalez's orders, brought the cocaine to Rhode Island, where itand the wrappings used to hide it during transitwere located. Gonzalez's rebuttal argument is ostensibly limited to noting that nobody actually saw the cocaine unloaded from the cousin's vehicle inside the warehouse. The jury rejected this argument, as it was free to do. Accordingly, there was no error in the admission of the cocaine or packaging.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>C. Sufficiency of the evidence</i></h2>\n<p>Because the entirety of Gonzalez's sufficiency argument is premised on the evidentiary claims we have already rejected, we have little trouble concluding that, in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202688\"><a href=\"/opinion/202688/united-states-v-garcia-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 129-30 (1st Cir.2007). In sum, Gonzalez was overheard arranging the drug deal, the drugs were seized, and he confessed his involvement. The verdict was thus sufficiently supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>D. Sentencing</i></h2>\n<p>Gonzalez makes several arguments regarding his twenty-year sentence. First, he claims that the prosecution, by filing a sentence enhancement information<sup>[5]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> on the eve of trial, unconstitutionally burdened his right to a jury trial by essentially penalizing him for choosing to go to trial. The information, which noted two prior drug felony convictions under California law, subjected Gonzalez to a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A). Gonzalez supports his argument by relying on <i>United States v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2568795\"><a href=\"/opinion/2568795/united-states-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2004), in which the district court imposed a reduced sentence in part because the government changed its position on various sentence enhancements after plea bargaining collapsed. <i>Id.</i> at 329-30. Gonzalez, however, fails to note that to the extent relevant here, we reversed the district court's sentencing in <i>Green</i> in <i>United States v. Yeje-Cabrera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201905\"><a href=\"/opinion/201905/united-states-v-yeje-cabrera/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2005). Our comment there is dispositive here: \"A defendant simply has no right to a sentence, after trial, that is as lenient as a sentence he could have had earlier in a plea bargain.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26-27. <i>See also, </i><i>United States v. Jenkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203400\"><a href=\"/opinion/203400/united-states-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3-4 (1st Cir.2008) (absent evidence of prosecutorial vindictiveness, there is no due process violation when government files § 851 information after failure to reach plea agreement in which government would have agreed not to file information).</p>\n<p>Next, also relying on <i>Green,</i> Gonzalez argues that the use of the § 851 information unconstitutionally violates the Separation of Powers Doctrine, because it places too much sentencing power in the hands of the prosecutor. Gonzalez cites no pertinent authority for his position, which has been explicitly rejected by at least three other circuits. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Watford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795983\"><a href=\"/opinion/795983/united-states-v-marlon-watford-aka-tony-vallie-and-ronnie-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></a></span>, 911 (6th Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Jensen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792137\"><a href=\"/opinion/792137/united-states-v-douglas-jensen/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 707 (9th Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Cespedes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73090\"><a href=\"/opinion/73090/united-states-v-cespedes/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1329</span></a></span>, 1332-34 (11th Cir.1998). Each of these cases relied on <i>United States v. LaBonte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118117\"><a href=\"/opinion/118117/united-states-v-labonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118117\"><a href=\"/opinion/118117/united-states-v-labonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1673</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118117\"><a href=\"/opinion/118117/united-states-v-labonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></a></span> (1997), in which the Court noted that a prosecutor's ability to affect sentencing \"is similar to the discretion a prosecutor exercises when he decides what, if any, charges to bring against a criminal suspect. Such discretion is an integral feature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate, so long as it is not based on improper factors.\" <i>Id.</i> at 761-62, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118117\"><a href=\"/opinion/118117/united-states-v-labonte/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1673</span></a></span>. We join the three other circuits in holding no viable Separation of Powers claim is presented by the defendant's argument.</p>\n<p>Gonzalez next argues broadly that mandatory minimum sentences violate his right to due process because they remove the trial judge's sentencing discretion. However, it is beyond cavil that Congress has the power to set statutory minimum and maximum sentences to which courts must adhere. <i>Chapman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112605\"><a href=\"/opinion/112605/chapman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 467, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112605\"><a href=\"/opinion/112605/chapman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1919</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112605\"><a href=\"/opinion/112605/chapman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span> (1991).</p>\n<p>Finally, Gonzalez argues that his sentence must be reversed because his prior convictions were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In so doing, he argues against the continuing viability of <i>Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span> (1998). This argument is a non-starter, for \"whatever the continuing viability of <i>Almendarez-Torres,</i> we have previously held that we are bound to follow it until it is expressly overruled.\" <i>United States v. Jimenez-Beltre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202092\"><a href=\"/opinion/202092/united-states-v-jimenez-beltre/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 520 (1st. Cir.2006) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></span> (2007).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> Appellant's arguments having been rejected, his conviction and sentence are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>MERRITT, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur in the Court's opinion, but I agree with the District Court that the prosecution's decision to seek a mandatory sentence of 20 years under 21 U.S.C. § 851 passes all understanding. The District Court said: \"I recognize you [AUSA] do this at the behest of your superiors. But I can't sit here today and impose this sentence <i>without saying it's wrong,</i> and you can take that message to whoever you think might listen.\" The Judicial Conference of the United States for almost 20 years, and the Sentencing Commission for almost 10 years, have pleaded with the judiciary committees of Congress to do something about the serious injustices that these long, mandatory minimum sentences imposeto no avail. This is a 20-year sentence for a nonviolent crime by a defendant with a serious mental illness. His incarceration will cost the American taxpayers in today's dollars somewhere between $600,000 and $1,000,000. With some carefully monitored rehabilitation treatment, it is possible that he could be released in just a few years. Like the District Judge, I think that the prosecution's purely discretionary decision to ratchet up this sentence to 20 years is misguided and ought to be reconsidered when the judgment becomes final.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The briefs refer to this individual as \"Belige.\" The transcripts of the phone conversations use \"Beligue.\" For the sake of consistency, we use the former spelling.</p>\n<p>[2]  Rave was assigned to work with an FBI narcotics task force.</p>\n<p>[3]  A full-blown hearing, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a), would involve the presentation of evidence, generally including testimony of mental health professionals after examining the defendant. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Soldevila-Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664046\"><a href=\"/opinion/664046/united-states-v-angel-a-soldevila-lopez-aka-angelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n<p>[4]  While Gonzalez's one self-abusive incident should not be discounted, in our view neither the judge's amply supported findings nor the defendant's own statements suggest the \"serious mental illness\" that our concurring colleague finds to be present.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, we do not agree that the concurrence's unadorned description of the defendant's crimes as \"nonviolent\" adequately captures the risks associated with significant drug distribution operations, either for the authorities who investigate them or for society at large. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Scott,</i> 270 F.3d 30,41 (1st Cir.2001) (although large-scale drug trafficking may itself be nonviolent, the crime is commonly associated with violence).</p>\n<p>[5]  Under 21 U.S.C. § 851, the government must file an information with the court if it intends to seek an increase in a defendant's sentence based on a prior conviction.</p>\n\n</div>",
