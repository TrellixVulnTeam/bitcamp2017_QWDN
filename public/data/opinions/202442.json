Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                     Siler,** Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Christopher M. Lefebvre, with whom Family and Consumer Law\nCenter was on brief, for appellant.\n     W. Scott O'Connell, with whom Paul M. Lanagan and Nixon\nPeabody LLP were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          September 29, 2006\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge. This case requires us to determine\n\nwhether a consumer's professed lack of comprehension of a notice of\n\nright to rescind alone suffices to pave the way for belated\n\nrescission under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. §§\n\n1601-1667.     The district court concluded that a bald assertion of\n\nsubjective confusion did not trump the plain language of the\n\ndisputed notice and dismissed the plaintiff's amended complaint.\n\nThe court then rebuffed the plaintiff's two-pronged endeavor either\n\nto obtain reconsideration or to restate her claim.                  This appeal\n\nfollowed.     After careful consideration, we affirm.\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n             Because this appeal follows the granting of a motion to\n\ndismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), we rehearse the facts as\n\nset forth in the plaintiff's amended complaint.                  See Chongris v.\n\nBoard of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir. 1987).               Consistent with\n\nthe   case   law,   however,    we   eschew    reliance     on    the   pleader's\n\nrhetorical     flourishes,     including      unsupported    conclusions      and\n\nassertions.     See id.; see also Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v.\n\nFeliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             In March of 2003, plaintiff-appellant Amy Palmer obtained\n\na debt-consolidation loan, secured by a mortgage on her residence,\n\nfrom defendant-appellee Champion Mortgage.           The closing took place\n\non March 28, 2003.       The plaintiff executed, then and there, a\n\npromissory note, a mortgage, a TILA statement, and a settlement\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fsheet.    She    left   without   receiving   copies   of   any   of   these\n\ndocuments.\n\n           Several days later, the plaintiff received by mail copies\n\nof the closing documents. Included among these papers was a notice\n\nof right to cancel (the Notice) — a notification required by the\n\nTILA.    See 15 U.S.C. § 1635(a).         In relevant part, the Notice\n\ninformed the plaintiff that:\n\n           You have a legal right under federal law to\n           cancel this transaction, without cost, within\n           three (3) business days from whichever of the\n           following events occurs last:\n\n           (1) the date of the transaction, which is\n           MARCH 28, 2003; or (date)\n           (2) the date you received your Truth-in-\n           Lending disclosures; or\n           (3) the date you received this notice of your\n           right to cancel.\n\nThe Notice further provided: \"If you cancel by mail or telegram,\n\nyou must send the notice no later than midnight of APRIL 01, 2003\n\n(or midnight of the third business day following the latest of the\n\nthree (3) events listed above).\"\n\n           Although the plaintiff cannot remember the specific date\n\non which she received the documents, she alleges — and for present\n\npurposes we accept — that they arrived in early April of 2003, but\n\nafter April 1.   At any rate, nothing happened for well over a year.\n\nThen, on or about August 6, 2004, the plaintiff notified Champion\n\nof her intent to rescind the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f               When   Champion    failed      to    respond       to    the     plaintiff's\n\nimportunings, she sued in federal district court.                             Her complaint\n\nalleged that the inclusion of the April 1 deadline was confusing\n\nand   that,     therefore,      she    retained      the    right       to     rescind   the\n\ntransaction under 15 U.S.C. § 1635, which provides for an extended\n\nthree-year rescission period when a creditor fails to make one or\n\nmore material disclosures required under the TILA.\n\n               After some procedural skirmishing, not relevant here, the\n\nplaintiff served an amended complaint.                In tandem with the section\n\n1635 claim, the amended complaint asserted that a right to rescind\n\nthe   transaction        also    existed          under     the        TILA's     state-law\n\ncounterpart, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140D, § 32.                       Champion moved to\n\ndismiss on the ground that the amended complaint failed to state a\n\ncognizable claim.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(6).                  The lower court\n\nallowed this motion, concluding that \"[t]he Notice the plaintiff\n\nreceived clearly and conspicuously advised her of her right to\n\ncancel the transaction within three business days from the last to\n\noccur of three events, one of which was the date she received the\n\nnotice    of    right   to   cancel.\"         Thus,       the   court     reasoned,      the\n\nplaintiff       had   received        the   full    complement           of     disclosures\n\nstipulated by the TILA and her belated attempt to rescind the\n\ntransaction was time-barred.2\n\n\n      2\n      Relatedly, the district court ruled that no claim inhered\nunder the Massachusetts statute invoked by the plaintiff, because\nthat statute was preempted by the TILA. Since the plaintiff does\n\n                                            -4-\n\f           Undaunted, the plaintiff moved for reconsideration, see\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), or in the alternative, for leave to file a\n\nsecond amended complaint, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).    The district\n\ncourt denied both entreaties.      In refusing leave to amend, the\n\ncourt emphasized that the complaint had already been amended once\n\nand that the motion to dismiss had been pending for several months\n\nbefore the court disposed of it.     This timely appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           On appeal, the plaintiff contests the district court's\n\nallowance of Champion's motion to dismiss, as well as the denial of\n\nher requests for reconsideration and for leave to file a second\n\namended complaint.3   We discuss these claims of error sequentially.\n\n                      A.   The Motion to Dismiss.\n\n           We review dismissals for failure to state a claim de\n\nnovo, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and giving the party\n\nwho has pleaded the contested claim the benefit of all reasonable\n\ninferences.   See Rogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nThus, our primary task here is to determine whether, viewing the\n\n\nnot challenge this ruling on appeal, we make no further mention of\nthe state-law claim.\n      3\n      In her brief, the plaintiff directs our attention to the\nincorrect termination of the case one day prior to the actual entry\nof judgment, in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a)(1).           We\nacknowledge that this technical bevue occurred, but in the\ncircumstances of this case any error was patently harmless. The\nplaintiff is not, therefore, entitled to relief on this account.\nSee Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc., 374 F.3d 23,\n30 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                  -5-\n\ffacts    in    the    light    most    flattering   to   the   plaintiff,   she\n\narticulated an actionable TILA claim.\n\n              We begin this inquiry with a synopsis of the relevant\n\nportions of the federal statute. Congress enacted the TILA in 1968\n\n\"to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms\" and \"to protect\n\nthe consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit . . . practices.\"\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1601(a).          To this end, the TILA requires creditors to\n\ndisclose clearly and accurately all the material terms of a credit\n\ntransaction.         See Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, 523 U.S. 410, 412\n\n(1998).\n\n              With    respect     to    non-purchase-money      mortgages    on\n\nresidential dwellings — the type of credit transaction at issue\n\nhere — the TILA confers upon the debtor a right to rescind within\n\nthree days of the transaction's consummation or three days from\n\ndelivery of the material disclosures, whichever occurs later.4              See\n\n15 U.S.C. § 1635(a).          The creditor also must clearly disclose this\n\nrescission right to the debtor.                See 12 C.F.R. § 226.23(b)(1).\n\nShould a creditor fail to deliver any of the required material\n\ndisclosures (including notice of the right to rescind), the debtor\n\n\n\n     4\n      It is unsettled whether Massachusetts citizens retain a\nrescission right under the TILA, given the statutory exemption\ngranted to Massachusetts and the concomitant Federal Reserve\nregulations. See 15 U.S.C. § 1633; Belini v. Wash. Mut. Bank, 412\nF.3d 17, 28 (1st Cir. 2005). Inasmuch as the plaintiff has failed\nto state a valid claim for rescission under the TILA, see text\ninfra, it is unnecessary for us to resolve this thorny issue.\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fmay   rescind   at   any   time   up    to     three   years   following   the\n\nconsummation of the transaction.             See id. § 226.23(a)(3). If a\n\ncreditor does not respond to a rescission request within twenty\n\ndays, the debtor may file suit in federal court to enforce the\n\nrescission right.    See Belini v. Wash. Mut. Bank, 412 F.3d 17, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 2005); see also 15 U.S.C. § 1635(b).\n\n           We move now from the general to the particular.                 The\n\nplaintiff in this case concedes that she received copies of all the\n\nmaterial disclosures mandated under the TILA but alleges that the\n\nNotice was \"defective\" and \"confusing.\" She points specifically to\n\nthe inclusion of a date-certain deadline for rescission (April 1,\n\n2003) and complains that the designated date already had passed by\n\nthe time she received the Notice.            Relying on our admonition that\n\n\"a misleading disclosure is as much a violation of TILA as a\n\nfailure to disclose at all,\" Barnes v. Fleet Nat'l Bank, 370 F.3d\n\n164, 174 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Smith v. Chapman, 614 F.2d 968,\n\n977 (5th Cir. 1980)), she asseverates that the confusing nature of\n\nthe Notice triggered the extended three-year rescission period.\n\n           Champion readily concedes, as it must, that the Notice\n\nincluded an April 1 deadline for rescission.           But it hastens to add\n\nthat the Notice twice indicated in plain language that, in the\n\nalternative, the debtor had three business days after receipt of\n\nthe Notice within which to rescind.            To strengthen its argument,\n\nChampion observes that the Notice is identical in all material\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\frespects to the model form authored by the Federal Reserve Board,\n\nand   that   other   courts    have   found   such   adherence   to     be   an\n\nimpenetrable shield against TILA-based attacks.         See, e.g., Gibson\n\nv. Bob Watson Chevrolet-Geo, Inc., 112 F.3d 283, 286 (7th Cir.\n\n1997); Murphy v. Empire of Am., 583 F. Supp. 1563, 1566 (W.D.N.Y.\n\n1984); see also In re Porter, 961 F.2d 1066, 1076 (3d Cir. 1992)\n\n(explaining that \"use of an appropriate model form necessarily\n\ncomplies with the [TILA]\" (emphasis omitted)).                Based on the\n\nNotice's plain language and its adherence to the model form,\n\nChampion urges us to disregard the plaintiff's subjective state of\n\nmind and join the district court in holding the Notice adequate as\n\na matter of law.\n\n             We find Champion's argument compelling.      Although we are\n\nrequired to view the well-pleaded facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the plaintiff, we need not \"swallow [her] invective hook, line,\n\nand sinker.\"     Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nAs part and parcel of this approach, we must refrain from crediting\n\nher \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, and 'opprobrious\n\nepithets.'\"     Chongris, 811 F.2d at 37 (quoting Snowden v. Hughes,\n\n321 U.S. 1, 10 (1944)); accord Aulson, 83 F.3d at 3.                     This\n\nmethodology is particularly appropriate in the TILA context where\n\nwe, like other courts, have focused the lens of our inquiry on the\n\ntext of the disclosures themselves rather than on plaintiffs'\n\ndescriptions    of   their    subjective    understandings.      See,   e.g.,\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fBarnes, 370 F.3d at 172-74 (examining the language of disputed\n\ndisclosures   in   the   face   of   plaintiff's   claim   that   they   were\n\nmisleading); Zamarippa v. Cy's Car Sales, Inc., 674 F.2d 877, 879\n\n(11th Cir. 1982) (noting that \"it is unnecessary to inquire as to\n\nthe   subjective   deception     or    misunderstanding     of    particular\n\nconsumers\" in determining whether a disclosure violates the TILA);\n\nBustamante v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 619 F.2d 360, 364 (5th\n\nCir. 1980) (applying objective standard in evaluating TILA claim).\n\n          This emphasis on objective reasonableness, rather than\n\nsubjective understanding, is also appropriate in light of the sound\n\ntenet that courts must evaluate the adequacy of TILA disclosures\n\nfrom the vantage point of a hypothetical average consumer — a\n\nconsumer who is neither particularly sophisticated nor particularly\n\ndense.   See Smith v. Cash Store Mgmt., Inc., 195 F.3d 325, 327-28\n\n(7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that TILA disclosures should be viewed\n\nfrom the perspective of an ordinary consumer, not a federal judge);\n\nsee also Edmondson v. Allen-Russell Ford, Inc., 577 F.2d 291, 296\n\n(5th Cir. 1978) (\"We must assess the adequacy of disclosure . . .\n\nby the audience for which disclosure was intended.\").              Thus, we\n\nturn to the question of whether the average consumer, looking at\n\nthe Notice objectively, would find it confusing.           We conclude that\n\nshe would not.\n\n          The Notice itself is annexed to the amended complaint\n\nand, therefore, is deemed fair game on a motion to dismiss.               See\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fCentro Medico del Turabo, 406 F.3d at 5; Rodi v. S. New Engl. Sch.\n\nof Law, 389 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2004); In re Colonial Mortg.\n\nBankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).               It clearly and\n\nconspicuously indicates that the debtor can rescind \"within three\n\n(3) business days from whichever of [three enumerated] events\n\noccurs      last.\"   Although   the   Notice   does   state   in   part   that\n\nrescission has to occur \"no later than midnight of APRIL 01, 2003,\"\n\nthe plaintiff wrests this statement from its contextual moorings.\n\nThe statement is followed immediately by a parenthetical reading\n\n\"(or midnight of the third business day following the latest of the\n\nthree (3) events listed above).\"        We fail to see how any reasonably\n\nalert person — that is, the average consumer — reading the Notice\n\nwould be drawn to the April 1 deadline without also grasping the\n\ntwice-repeated alternative deadlines.\n\n              This facial transparency is bolstered by the fact that\n\nthe language of the Notice closely tracks the language of the model\n\nform.       This is, at the very least, prima facie evidence of the\n\nadequacy of the disclosure.5      See 12 C.F.R. § 226 Supp. I, Intro.\n\npara. 1 (\"Good faith compliance with [the Federal Reserve Board's]\n\n\n        5\n      There is some statutory support for the proposition that\nadherence to a model form bars a TILA non-disclosure claim\nentirely. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1604(b), 1635(h), 1640(f). There is\nalso some case law to that effect.        See, e.g., Bob Watson\nChevrolet-Geo, 112 F.3d at 286; Murphy, 583 F. Supp. at 1566. The\ncase at hand does not require that we go that far, and so we leave\nfor another day the question of whether such adherence invariably\nbrings a creditor within a safe harbor.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fcommentary affords protection from liability under [the TILA].\").\n\nAccordingly, we agree with the district court that the Notice was\n\ncrystal clear and, thus, did not trigger an extended rescission\n\nright under the TILA.\n\n          If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — we note\n\nthat accepting the plaintiff's argument might contravene the goals\n\nof the TILA.     Holding all parties to the plain language of\n\ndisclosures aids the due enforcement of the statutory requirements\n\nby ensuring that any consumer subject to a misleading disclosure\n\nmay bring suit against the creditor.   See Chapman, 614 F.2d at 971\n\n(observing that \"consumers who are aware of the true terms of a\n\ncontract are more able to see that these terms are not clearly and\n\nconspicuously disclosed\").   The flip side of the coin, of course,\n\nis that any creditor who uses plain and legally sufficient language\n\nought to be held harmless.    In other words, courts ought not to\n\ninvent ambiguities that do not in fact exist.\n\n          The plaintiff attempts to circumvent this relatively\n\nstraightforward analysis by citing a raft of cases in which notices\n\nof rescission rights were found wanting.   In each of those cases,\n\nhowever, the notice was either given prior to the closing and\n\nphrased so that the rescission deadline expired before the loan\n\nclosed, see, e.g., Jackson v. Grant, 890 F.2d 118, 122 (9th Cir.\n\n1989); Basnight v. Diamond Developers, Inc., 146 F. Supp. 2d 754,\n\n758 (M.D.N.C. 2001); In re Vickers, 275 B.R. 401, 404-05 (Bankr.\n\n\n                               -11-\n\fM.D. Fla. 2001), or stated only a single fixed rescission deadline\n\nthat had elapsed prior to delivery of the notice, see, e.g., In re\n\nBell, 309 B.R. 139, 157 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 2004), or stated no\n\nrescission deadline whatsoever, see, e.g., Semar v. Platte Valley\n\nFed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n., 791 F.2d 699, 702 (9th Cir. 1986);\n\nReynolds v. D & N Bank, 792 F. Supp. 1035, 1038 (E.D. Mich. 1992);\n\nJohnson v. Thomas, 794 N.E.2d 919, 931 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003).               The\n\nNotice here does not suffer from any of these infirmities.\n\n          That ends this aspect of the matter. Because we find the\n\nNotice clear and adequate, and because the plaintiff otherwise\n\nconcedes receiving all the required disclosures, her right of\n\nrescission   under   the   TILA   had   long   expired   by   the   time   she\n\ncommenced this action. Accordingly, the district court did not err\n\nin dismissing the action on the ground that the plaintiff's TILA\n\nclaim was time-barred.\n\n                B.   The Motion for Reconsideration.\n\n          We need not linger long over the plaintiff's objection to\n\nthe denial of her motion for reconsideration.            The granting of a\n\nmotion for reconsideration is \"an extraordinary remedy which should\n\nbe used sparingly.\"        11 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 2810.1 (2d ed. 1995).            Unless the court\n\nhas misapprehended some material fact or point of law, such a\n\nmotion is normally not a promising vehicle for revisiting a party's\n\ncase and rearguing theories previously advanced and rejected.              See\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fIn re Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1987).               To\n\nobtain relief, the movant must demonstrate either that newly\n\ndiscovered evidence (not previously available) has come to light or\n\nthat the rendering court committed a manifest error of law.               See\n\nMarie v. Allied Home Mortg. Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 7 n.2 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    The     standard   of   appellate   review   is     correspondingly\n\ndeferential: we will not overturn the district court's denial of a\n\nmotion for reconsideration absent an abuse of discretion.                 See\n\nIverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 104 (1st Cir. 2006); In re\n\nSun Pipe Line, 831 F.2d at 25.\n\n              Here, the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration did no\n\nmore   than    reiterate   the    arguments   she   earlier    had   advanced,\n\nclaiming somewhat counterintuitively that the district court had\n\n\"overlooked\" her allegation that the Notice was confusing.              Since\n\nthe court had not overlooked that allegation but, rather, had found\n\nit wanting, the motion was denied.          We discern no hint of error.\n\n                  C.   The Request for Leave to Amend.\n\n              As a last-ditch measure, the plaintiff contests the\n\ndistrict court's refusal to allow her to file a second amended\n\ncomplaint.     We review this ruling for abuse of discretion.           James\n\nv. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77-78 (1st Cir. 1983).            In conducting that\n\nreview, we \"will defer to the district court's hands-on judgment so\n\nlong as the record evinces an adequate reason for the denial.\"\n\nAponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R., 445 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f          In this instance, there is a temporal wrinkle: the\n\nplaintiff requested further leave to amend only after the district\n\ncourt dismissed her first amended complaint. If made subsequent to\n\nthe entry of judgment, such requests, whatever their merit, cannot\n\nbe allowed unless and until the judgment is vacated under, say,\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60.    See 6 Federal Practice and Procedure, supra,\n\n§ 1489 (2d ed. 1990).    Here, no such vacation occurred.\n\n          We need not probe this point too deeply.       The record\n\nbelow is tenebrous as to timing, see supra note 2, and it is\n\narguable that the plaintiff's request to amend antedated the formal\n\nentry of judgment.    But even if we assume for argument's sake that\n\nthe vacation-of-judgment barrier does not pertain, that assumption\n\nwould not salvage the plaintiff's cause.        In that event, the\n\ndistrict court would have had to evaluate the plaintiff's request\n\nunder the liberal standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).    Even so, we\n\nnevertheless would uphold the district court's rejection of the\n\nrequest to amend.\n\n          Our analysis is as follows.   Amendments may be permitted\n\npre-judgment, even after a dismissal for failure to state a claim,\n\nand leave to amend is \"freely given when justice so requires.\"\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).       That is not to say, however, that a\n\ndistrict court lacks authority to deny a request to amend.       In\n\nappropriate circumstances — undue delay, bad faith, futility, and\n\nthe absence of due diligence on the movant's part are paradigmatic\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fexamples — leave to amend may be denied.            See Foman v. Davis, 371\n\nU.S. 178, 182 (1962).      In short, a request to amend — especially a\n\nbelated request — requires the court to examine the totality of the\n\ncircumstances     and     to   exercise    its     informed   discretion    in\n\nconstructing a balance of pertinent considerations.               See Quaker\n\nState Oil Ref. Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d 1510, 1517 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).\n\n           On this occasion, the plaintiff made her request for\n\nleave to amend more than fifteen months after commencing her action\n\nand more than nine months after initially amending her complaint.\n\nHer proposed second amendment sought to assert a new theory based\n\non the timing of Champion's disbursement of the loan proceeds.\n\nThis is not an instance in which newly discovered evidence, not\n\npreviously available, suddenly came to light; the plaintiff was\n\naware of the factual predicate on which her new theory rested\n\nbefore   she    brought    suit.    Considering      the   totality   of    the\n\ncircumstances, we conclude that the district court had sufficient\n\nreason to reject the plaintiff's belated attempt to amend her\n\ncomplaint yet again.           Consequently, we find no abuse of the\n\ndistrict court's wide discretion.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe hold that, as a matter of law, the notice of right to cancel\n\nprovided   by     Champion      complied    with     the   applicable      TILA\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\frequirements. The plaintiff's statutory right to rescind therefore\n\nexpired three days after she received the Notice, and the district\n\ncourt did not err in dismissing her TILA claim as time-barred.           By\n\nlike token, the district court did not abuse its discretion either\n\nin   denying   the   plaintiff's   motion   for   reconsideration   or   in\n\nrefusing to grant her leave to file a second amended complaint.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f",

The district court concluded that a bald assertion of subjective confusion did not trump the plain language of the disputed notice and dismissed the plaintiff's amended complaint. The court then rebuffed the plaintiff's two-pronged endeavor either to obtain reconsideration or to restate her claim. This appeal followed. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this appeal follows the granting of a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), we rehearse the facts as set forth in the plaintiff's amended complaint. <i>See Chongris v. Board of Appeals,</i> 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir.1987). Consistent with the case law, however, we eschew reliance on the pleader's rhetorical flourishes, including unsupported conclusions and assertions. <i>See id.; see also Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March of 2003, plaintiff-appellant Amy Palmer obtained a debt-consolidation loan, secured by a mortgage on her residence, from defendant-appellee Champion Mortgage. The closing took place on March 28, 2003. The plaintiff executed, then and there, a promissory note, a mortgage, a TILA statement, and a settlement sheet. She left without receiving copies of any of these documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days later, the plaintiff received by mail copies of the closing documents. Included among these papers was a notice of right to cancel (the Notice) &#8212; a notification required by the TILA. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a). In relevant part, the Notice informed the plaintiff that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have a legal right under federal law to cancel this transaction, without cost, within three (3) business days from whichever of the following events occurs last:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the date of the transaction, which is MARCH 28, 2003; or (date)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) the date you received your Truth-in-Lending disclosures; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) the date you received this notice of your right to cancel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Notice further provided: \"If you cancel by mail or telegram, you must send the notice no later than midnight of APRIL 01, 2003 (or midnight of the third business day following the latest of the three (3) events listed above).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the plaintiff cannot remember the specific date on which she received the documents, she alleges&#8212;and for present purposes we accept&#8212;that they arrived in early April of 2003, but after April 1. At any rate, nothing happened for well over a year. Then, on or about August 6, 2004, the plaintiff notified Champion of her intent to rescind the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Champion failed to respond to the plaintiff's importunings, she sued in federal district court. Her complaint alleged that the inclusion of the April 1 deadline was confusing and that, therefore, she retained the right to rescind the transaction under 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635, which provides for an extended three-year rescission period when a creditor fails to make one or more material disclosures required under the TILA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After some procedural skirmishing, not relevant here, the plaintiff served an amended complaint. In tandem with the section 1635 claim, the amended complaint asserted that a right to rescind the transaction also existed under the TILA's state-law counterpart, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140D, &#167; 32. Champion moved to dismiss on the ground that the amended complaint failed to state a cognizable claim. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The lower court allowed this motion, concluding that \"[t]he Notice the plaintiff received clearly and conspicuously advised her of her right to cancel the transaction within three business days from the last to occur of three events, one of which was the date she received the notice of right to cancel.\" Thus, the court reasoned, the plaintiff had received the full complement of disclosures stipulated by the TILA and her belated attempt to rescind the transaction was time-barred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undaunted, the plaintiff moved for reconsideration, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), or in the alternative, for leave to file a second amended complaint, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). The district court denied both entreaties. In refusing leave to amend, the court emphasized that the complaint had already been amended once and that the motion to dismiss had been pending for several months before the court disposed of it. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the plaintiff contests the district court's allowance of Champion's motion to dismiss, as well as the denial of her requests for reconsideration and for leave to file a second amended complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We discuss these claims of error sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Motion to Dismiss.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review dismissals for failure to state a claim de novo, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true and giving the party who has pleaded the contested claim the benefit of all reasonable inferences. <i>See Rogan v. Menino,</i> 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir.1999). Thus, our primary task here is to determine whether, viewing the facts in the light most flattering to the plaintiff, she articulated an actionable TILA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin this inquiry with a synopsis of the relevant portions of the federal statute. Congress enacted the TILA in 1968 \"to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms\" and \"to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit . . . practices.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1601(a). To this end, the TILA requires creditors to disclose clearly and accurately all the material terms of a credit transaction. <i>See Beach v. Ocwen Fed. Bank,</i> 523 U.S. 410, 412, 118 S.Ct. 1408, 140 L.Ed.2d 566 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to non-purchase-money mortgages on residential dwellings&#8212;the type of credit transaction at issue here&#8212; the TILA confers upon the debtor a right to rescind within three days of the transaction's consummation or three days from delivery of the material disclosures, whichever occurs later.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a). The creditor also must clearly disclose this rescission right to the debtor. <i>See</i> 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226.23(b)(1). Should a creditor fail to deliver any of the required material disclosures (including notice of the right to rescind), the debtor may rescind at any time up to three years following the consummation of the transaction. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 226.23(a)(3). If a creditor does not respond to a rescission request within twenty days, the debtor may file suit in federal court to enforce the rescission right. <i>See Belini v. Wash. Mut. Bank,</i> 412 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We move now from the general to the particular. The plaintiff in this case concedes that she received copies of all the material disclosures mandated under the TILA but alleges that the Notice was \"defective\" and \"confusing.\" She points specifically to the inclusion of a date-certain deadline for rescission (April 1, 2003) and complains that the designated date already had passed by the time she received the Notice. Relying on our admonition that \"a misleading disclosure is as much a violation of TILA as a failure to disclose at all,\" <i>Barnes v. Fleet Nat'l Bank,</i> 370 F.3d 164, 174 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Smith v. Chapman,</i> 614 F.2d 968, 977 (5th Cir.1980)), she asseverates that the confusing nature of the Notice triggered the extended three-year rescission period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Champion readily concedes, as it must, that the Notice included an April 1 deadline for rescission. But it hastens to add that the Notice twice indicated in plain language that, in the alternative, the debtor had three business days after <i>receipt</i> of the Notice within which to rescind. To strengthen its argument, Champion observes that the Notice is identical in all material respects to the model form authored by the Federal Reserve Board, and that other courts have found such adherence to be an impenetrable shield against TILA-based attacks. <i>See, e.g., Gibson v. Bob Watson Chevrolet-Geo, Inc.,</i> 112 F.3d 283, 286 (7th Cir.1997); <i>Murphy v. Empire of Am.,</i> 583 F.Supp. 1563, 1566 (W.D.N.Y.1984); <i>see also In re Porter,</i> 961 F.2d 1066, 1076 (3d Cir.1992) (explaining that \"use of an appropriate model form necessarily complies with the [TILA]\" (emphasis omitted)). Based on the Notice's plain language and its adherence to the model form, Champion urges us to disregard the plaintiff's subjective state of mind and join the district court in holding the Notice adequate as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Champion's argument compelling. Although we are required to view the well-pleaded facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we need not \"swallow [her] invective hook, line, and sinker.\" <i>Aulson v. Blanchard,</i> 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996). As part and parcel of this approach, we must refrain from crediting her \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, and `opprobrious epithets.'\" <i>Chongris,</i> 811 F.2d at 37 (quoting <i>Snowden v. Hughes,</i> 321 U.S. 1, 10, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497 (1944)); <i>accord Aulson,</i> 83 F.3d at 3. This methodology is particularly appropriate in the TILA context where we, like other courts, have focused the lens of our inquiry on the text of the disclosures themselves rather than on plaintiffs' descriptions of their subjective understandings. <i>See, e.g., Barnes,</i> 370 F.3d at 172-74 (examining the language of disputed disclosures in the face of plaintiff's claim that they were misleading); <i>Zamarippa v. Cy's Car Sales, Inc.,</i> 674 F.2d 877, 879 (11th Cir.1982) (noting that \"it is unnecessary to inquire as to the subjective deception or misunderstanding of particular consumers\" in determining whether a disclosure violates the TILA); <i>Bustamante v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n,</i> 619 F.2d 360, 364 (5th Cir.1980) (applying objective standard in evaluating TILA claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This emphasis on objective reasonableness, rather than subjective understanding, is also appropriate in light of the sound tenet that courts must evaluate the adequacy of TILA disclosures from the vantage point of a hypothetical average consumer&#8212;a consumer who is neither particularly sophisticated nor particularly dense. <i>See Smith v. Cash Store Mgmt., Inc.,</i> 195 F.3d 325, 327-28 (7th Cir.1999) (explaining that TILA disclosures should be viewed from the perspective of an ordinary consumer, not a federal judge); <i>see also Edmondson v. Allen-Russell Ford, Inc.,</i> 577 F.2d 291, 296 (5th Cir.1978) (\"We must assess the adequacy of disclosure . . . by the audience for which disclosure was intended.\"). Thus, we turn to the question of whether the average consumer, looking at the Notice objectively, would find it confusing. We conclude that she would not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Notice itself is annexed to the amended complaint and, therefore, is deemed fair game on a motion to dismiss. <i>See Centro Medico del Turabo,</i> 406 F.3d at 5; <i>Rodi v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law,</i> 389 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir.2004); <i>In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp.,</i> 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.2003). It clearly and conspicuously indicates that the debtor can rescind \"within three (3) business days from whichever of [three enumerated] events occurs last.\" Although the Notice does state in part that rescission has to occur \"no later than midnight of APRIL 01, 2003,\" the plaintiff wrests this statement from its contextual moorings. The statement is followed immediately by a parenthetical reading \"(or midnight of the third business day following the latest of the three (3) events listed above).\" We fail to see how any reasonably alert person&#8212;that is, the average consumer&#8212;reading the Notice would be drawn to the April 1 deadline without also grasping the twice-repeated alternative deadlines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This facial transparency is bolstered by the fact that the language of the Notice closely tracks the language of the model form. This is, at the very least, prima facie evidence of the adequacy of the disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See</i> 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226 Supp. I, Intro. para. 1 (\"Good faith compliance with [the Federal Reserve Board's] commentary affords protection from liability under [the TILA].\"). Accordingly, we agree with the district court that the Notice was crystal clear and, thus, did not trigger an extended rescission right under the TILA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed&#8212;and we doubt that it is&#8212;we note that accepting the plaintiff's argument might contravene the goals of the TILA. Holding all parties to the plain language of disclosures aids the due enforcement of the statutory requirements by ensuring that any consumer subject to a misleading disclosure may bring suit against the creditor. <i>See Chapman,</i> 614 F.2d at 971 (observing that \"consumers who are aware of the true terms of a contract are more able to see that these terms are not clearly and conspicuously disclosed\"). The flip side of the coin, of course, is that any creditor who uses plain and legally sufficient language ought to be held harmless. In other words, courts ought not to invent ambiguities that do not in fact exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff attempts to circumvent this relatively straightforward analysis by citing a raft of cases in which notices of rescission rights were found wanting. In each of those cases, however, the notice was either given prior to the closing and phrased so that the rescission deadline expired before the loan closed, <i>see, e.g., Jackson v. Grant,</i> 890 F.2d 118, 122 (9th Cir.1989); <i>Basnight v. Diamond Developers, Inc.,</i> 146 F.Supp.2d 754, 758 (M.D.N.C.2001); <i>In re Vickers,</i> 275 B.R. 401, 404-05 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2001), or stated only a single fixed rescission deadline that had elapsed prior to delivery of the notice, <i>see, e.g., In re Bell,</i> 309 B.R. 139, 157 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.2004), or stated no rescission deadline whatsoever, <i>see, e.g., Semar v.

Thomas,</i> 342 Ill.App.3d 382, 276 Ill.Dec. 669, 794 N.E.2d 919, 931 (2003). The Notice here does not suffer from any of these infirmities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Because we find the Notice clear and adequate, and because the plaintiff otherwise concedes receiving all the required disclosures, her right of rescission under the TILA had long expired by the time she commenced this action. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing the action on the ground that the plaintiff's TILA claim was time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Motion for Reconsideration.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long over the plaintiff's objection to the denial of her motion for reconsideration. The granting of a motion for reconsideration is \"an extraordinary remedy which should be used sparingly.\" 11 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2810.1 (2d ed.1995). Unless the court has misapprehended some material fact or point of law, such a motion is normally not a promising vehicle for revisiting a party's case and rearguing theories previously advanced and rejected. <i>See In re Sun Pipe Line Co.,</i> 831 F.2d 22, 24-25 (1st Cir.1987). To obtain relief, the movant must demonstrate either that newly discovered evidence (not previously available) has come to light or that the rendering court committed a manifest error of law. <i>See Marie v. Allied Home Mortg. Corp.,</i> 402 F.3d 1, 7 n. 2 (1st Cir.2005). The standard of appellate review is correspondingly deferential: we will not overturn the district court's denial of a motion for reconsideration absent an abuse of discretion. <i>See Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 104 (1st Cir.2006); <i>In re Sun Pipe Line,</i> 831 F.2d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration did no more than reiterate the arguments she earlier had advanced, claiming somewhat counterintuitively that the district court had \"overlooked\" her allegation that the Notice was confusing. Since the court had not overlooked that allegation but, rather, had found it wanting, the motion was denied. We discern no hint of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Request for Leave to Amend.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a last-ditch measure, the plaintiff contests the district court's refusal to allow her to file a second amended complaint. We review this ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>James v. Watt,</i> 716 F.2d 71, 77-78 (1st Cir.1983). In conducting that review, we \"will defer to the district court's hands-on judgment so long as the record evinces an adequate reason for the denial.\" <i>Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> 445 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, there is a temporal wrinkle: the plaintiff requested further leave to amend only <i>after</i> the district court dismissed her first amended complaint. If made subsequent to the entry of judgment, such requests, whatever their merit, cannot be allowed unless and until the judgment is vacated under, say, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60. <i>See</i> 6 Federal Practice and Procedure, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 1489 (2d ed.1990). Here, no such vacation occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not probe this point too deeply. The record below is tenebrous as to timing, <i>see supra</i> note 2, and it is arguable that the plaintiff's request to amend antedated the formal entry of judgment. But even if we assume for argument's sake that the vacation-of-judgment barrier does not pertain, that assumption would not salvage the plaintiff's cause. In that event, the district court would have had to evaluate the plaintiff's request under the liberal standard of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Even so, we nevertheless would uphold the district court's rejection of the request to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis is as follows. Amendments may be permitted pre-judgment, even after a dismissal for failure to state a claim, and leave to amend is \"freely given when justice so requires.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a). That is not to say, however, that a district court lacks authority to deny a request to amend. In appropriate circumstances&#8212;undue delay, bad faith, futility, and the absence of due diligence on the movant's part are paradigmatic examples&#8212;leave to amend may be denied. <i>See Foman v. Davis,</i> 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). In short, a request to amend&#8212;especially a belated request&#8212;requires the court to examine the totality of the circumstances and to exercise its informed discretion in constructing a balance of pertinent considerations. <i>See Quaker State Oil Ref. Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co.,</i> 884 F.2d 1510, 1517 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this occasion, the plaintiff made her request for leave to amend more than fifteen months after commencing her action and more than nine months after initially amending her complaint. Her proposed second amendment sought to assert a new theory based on the timing of Champion's disbursement of the loan proceeds. This is not an instance in which newly discovered evidence, not previously available, suddenly came to light; the plaintiff was aware of the factual predicate on which her new theory rested before she brought suit. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the district court had sufficient reason to reject the plaintiff's belated attempt to amend her complaint yet again. Consequently, we find no abuse of the district court's wide discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we hold that, as a matter of law, the notice of right to cancel provided by Champion complied with the applicable TILA requirements. The plaintiff's statutory right to rescind therefore expired three days after she received the Notice, and the district court did not err in dismissing her TILA claim as time-barred. By like token, the district court did not abuse its discretion either in denying the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration or in refusing to grant her leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Relatedly, the district court ruled that no claim inhered under the Massachusetts statute invoked by the plaintiff, because that statute was preempted by the TILA.

We acknowledge that this technical bevue occurred, but in the circumstances of this case any error was patently harmless. The plaintiff is not, therefore, entitled to relief on this account<i>See Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, Inc.,</i> 374 F.3d 23, 30 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> It is unsettled whether Massachusetts citizens retain a rescission right under the TILA, given the statutory exemption granted to Massachusetts and the concomitant Federal Reserve regulations<i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1633; <i>Belini v. Wash. Mut. Bank,</i> 412 F.3d 17, 28 (1st Cir.2005).

There is also some case law to that effect. <i>See, e.g., Bob Watson Chevrolet-Geo,</i> 112 F.3d at 286; <i>Murphy,</i> 583 F.Supp. at 1566. The case at hand does not require that we go that far, and so we leave for another day the question of whether such adherence invariably brings a creditor within a safe harbor.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The closing took place on March 28, 2003. The plaintiff executed, then and there, a promissory note, a mortgage, a TILA statement, and a settlement sheet. She left without receiving copies of any of these documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days later, the plaintiff received by mail copies of the closing documents. Included among these papers was a notice of right to cancel (the Notice) &#8212; a notification required by the TILA. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635(a). In relevant part, the Notice informed the plaintiff that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have a legal right under federal law to cancel this transaction, without cost, within three (3) business days from whichever of the following events occurs last:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the date of the transaction, which is MARCH 28, 2003; or (date)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) the date you received your Truth-in-Lending disclosures; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) the date you received this notice of your right to cancel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Notice further provided: \"If you cancel by mail or telegram, you must send the notice no later than midnight of APRIL 01, 2003 (or midnight of the third business day following the latest of the three (3) events listed above).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the plaintiff cannot remember the specific date on which she received the documents, she alleges&#8212;and for present purposes we accept&#8212;that they arrived in early April of 2003, but after April 1. At any rate, nothing happened for well over a year. Then, on or about August 6, 2004, the plaintiff notified Champion of her intent to rescind the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Champion failed to respond to the plaintiff's importunings, she sued in federal district court. Her complaint alleged that the inclusion of the April 1 deadline was confusing and that, therefore, she retained the right to rescind the transaction under 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1635, which provides for an extended three-year rescission period when a creditor fails to make one or more material disclosures required under the TILA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After some procedural skirmishing, not relevant here, the plaintiff served an amended complaint. In tandem with the section 1635 claim, the amended complaint asserted that a right to rescind the transaction also existed under the TILA's state-law counterpart, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140D, &#167; 32. Champion moved to dismiss on the ground that the amended complaint failed to state a cognizable claim. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The lower court allowed this motion, concluding that \"[t]he Notice the plaintiff received clearly and conspicuously advised her of her right to cancel the transaction within three business days from the last to occur of three events, one of which was the date she received the notice of right to cancel.\" Thus, the court reasoned, the plaintiff had received the full complement of disclosures stipulated by the TILA and her belated attempt to rescind the transaction was time-barred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undaunted, the plaintiff moved for reconsideration, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), or in the alternative, for leave to file a second amended complaint, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). The district court denied both entreaties. In refusing leave to amend, the court emphasized that the complaint had already been amended once and that the motion to dismiss had been pending for several months before the court disposed of it.

Thus, our primary task here is to determine whether, viewing the facts in the light most flattering to the plaintiff, she articulated an actionable TILA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin this inquiry with a synopsis of the relevant portions of the federal statute. Congress enacted the TILA in 1968 \"to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms\" and \"to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit . . . practices.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1601(a). To this end, the TILA requires creditors to disclose clearly and accurately all the material terms of a credit transaction. <i>See Beach v. Ocwen Fed.

To strengthen its argument, Champion observes that the Notice is identical in all material respects to the model form authored by the Federal Reserve Board, and that other courts have found such adherence to be an impenetrable shield against TILA-based attacks. <i>See, e.g., Gibson v.

This methodology is particularly appropriate in the TILA context where we, like other courts, have focused the lens of our inquiry on the text of the disclosures themselves rather than on plaintiffs' descriptions of their subjective understandings. <i>See, e.g., Barnes,</i> 370 F.3d at 172-74 (examining the language of disputed disclosures in the face of plaintiff's claim that they were misleading); <i>Zamarippa v.

Cash Store Mgmt., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766595\"><a href=\"/opinion/766595/valerie-d-smith-v-the-cash-store-management-inc-the-cash-store-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 327-28 (7th Cir.1999) (explaining that TILA disclosures should be viewed from the perspective of an ordinary consumer, not a federal judge); <i>see also Edmondson v.

Thus, we turn to the question of whether the average consumer, looking at the Notice objectively, would find it confusing. We conclude that she would not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Notice itself is annexed to the amended complaint and, therefore, is deemed fair game on a motion to dismiss. <i>See Centro Medico del Turabo,</i> 406 F.3d at 5; <i>Rodi v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span>, 12 (1st Cir.2004); <i>In re Colonial Mortg.

It clearly and conspicuously indicates that the debtor can rescind \"within three (3) business days from whichever of [three enumerated] events occurs last.\" Although the Notice does state in part that rescission has to occur \"no later than midnight of APRIL 01, 2003,\" the plaintiff wrests this statement from its contextual moorings. The statement is followed immediately by a parenthetical reading \"(or midnight of the third business day following the latest of the three (3) events listed above).\" We fail to see how any reasonably alert person&#8212;that is, the average consumer&#8212;reading the Notice would be drawn to the April 1 deadline without also grasping the twice-repeated alternative deadlines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This facial transparency is bolstered by the fact that the language of the Notice closely tracks the language of the model form. This is, at the very least, prima facie evidence of the adequacy of the disclosure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See</i> 12 C.F.R. &#167; 226 Supp. I, Intro. para. 1 (\"Good faith compliance with [the Federal Reserve Board's] commentary affords protection from liability under [the TILA].\"). Accordingly, we agree with the district court that the Notice was crystal clear and, thus, did not trigger an extended rescission right under the TILA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed&#8212;and we doubt that it is&#8212;we note that accepting the plaintiff's argument might contravene the goals of the TILA. Holding all parties to the plain language of disclosures aids the due enforcement of the statutory requirements by ensuring that any consumer subject to a misleading disclosure may bring suit against the creditor. <i>See Chapman,</i> 614 F.2d at 971 (observing that \"consumers who are aware of the true terms of a contract are more able to see that these terms are not clearly and conspicuously disclosed\"). The flip side of the coin, of course, is that any creditor who uses plain and legally sufficient language ought to be held harmless. In other words, courts ought not to invent ambiguities that do not in fact exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff attempts to circumvent this relatively straightforward analysis by citing a raft of cases in which notices of rescission rights were found wanting. In each of those cases, however, the notice was either given prior to the closing and phrased so that the rescission deadline expired before the loan closed, <i>see, e.g., Jackson v.

The Notice here does not suffer from any of these infirmities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Because we find the Notice clear and adequate, and because the plaintiff otherwise concedes receiving all the required disclosures, her right of rescission under the TILA had long expired by the time she commenced this action. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing the action on the ground that the plaintiff's TILA claim was time-barred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Motion for Reconsideration.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not linger long over the plaintiff's objection to the denial of her motion for reconsideration. The granting of a motion for reconsideration is \"an extraordinary remedy which should be used sparingly.\" 11 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2810.1 (2d ed.1995). Unless the court has misapprehended some material fact or point of law, such a motion is normally not a promising vehicle for revisiting a party's case and rearguing theories previously advanced and rejected. <i>See In re Sun Pipe Line Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495473\"><a href=\"/opinion/495473/application-for-issuance-of-order-requiring-the-united-states-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1st Cir.1987). To obtain relief, the movant must demonstrate either that newly discovered evidence (not previously available) has come to light or that the rendering court committed a manifest error of law. <i>See Marie v. Allied Home Mortg. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201485\"><a href=\"/opinion/201485/marie-v-allied-home-mtg-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 n. 2 (1st Cir.2005). The standard of appellate review is correspondingly deferential: we will not overturn the district court's denial of a motion for reconsideration absent an abuse of discretion. <i>See Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202298\"><a href=\"/opinion/202298/iverson-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 104 (1st Cir.2006); <i>In re Sun Pipe Line,</i> 831 F.2d at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration did no more than reiterate the arguments she earlier had advanced, claiming somewhat counterintuitively that the district court had \"overlooked\" her allegation that the Notice was confusing. Since the court had not overlooked that allegation but, rather, had found it wanting, the motion was denied. We discern no hint of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Request for Leave to Amend.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a last-ditch measure, the plaintiff contests the district court's refusal to allow her to file a second amended complaint. We review this ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>James v. Watt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424030\"><a href=\"/opinion/424030/frank-b-james-v-james-g-watt/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 77-78 (1st Cir.1983). In conducting that review, we \"will defer to the district court's hands-on judgment so long as the record evinces an adequate reason for the denial.\" <i>Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span>, 58 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, there is a temporal wrinkle: the plaintiff requested further leave to amend only <i>after</i> the district court dismissed her first amended complaint. If made subsequent to the entry of judgment, such requests, whatever their merit, cannot be allowed unless and until the judgment is vacated under, say, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60. <i>See</i> 6 Federal Practice and Procedure, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 1489 (2d ed.1990). Here, no such vacation occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not probe this point too deeply. The record below is tenebrous as to timing, <i>see supra</i> note 2, and it is arguable that the plaintiff's request to amend antedated the formal entry of judgment. But even if we assume for argument's sake that the vacation-of-judgment barrier does not pertain, that assumption would not salvage the plaintiff's cause. In that event, the district court would have had to evaluate the plaintiff's request under the liberal standard of Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Even so, we nevertheless would uphold the district court's rejection of the request to amend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis is as follows. Amendments may be permitted pre-judgment, even after a dismissal for failure to state a claim, and leave to amend is \"freely given when justice so requires.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a). That is not to say, however, that a district court lacks authority to deny a request to amend. In appropriate circumstances&#8212;undue delay, bad faith, futility, and the absence of due diligence on the movant's part are paradigmatic examples&#8212;leave to amend may be denied. <i>See Foman v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 182, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1962). In short, a request to amend&#8212;especially a belated request&#8212;requires the court to examine the totality of the circumstances and to exercise its informed discretion in constructing a balance of pertinent considerations. <i>See Quaker State Oil Ref. Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529278\"><a href=\"/opinion/529278/quaker-state-oil-refining-corporation-v-garrity-oil-company-inc-quaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></a></span>, 1517 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this occasion, the plaintiff made her request for leave to amend more than fifteen months after commencing her action and more than nine months after initially amending her complaint. Her proposed second amendment sought to assert a new theory based on the timing of Champion's disbursement of the loan proceeds. This is not an instance in which newly discovered evidence, not previously available, suddenly came to light; the plaintiff was aware of the factual predicate on which her new theory rested before she brought suit. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the district court had sufficient reason to reject the plaintiff's belated attempt to amend her complaint yet again. Consequently, we find no abuse of the district court's wide discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we hold that, as a matter of law, the notice of right to cancel provided by Champion complied with the applicable TILA requirements. The plaintiff's statutory right to rescind therefore expired three days after she received the Notice, and the district court did not err in dismissing her TILA claim as time-barred. By like token, the district court did not abuse its discretion either in denying the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration or in refusing to grant her leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Relatedly, the district court ruled that no claim inhered under the Massachusetts statute invoked by the plaintiff, because that statute was preempted by the TILA. Since the plaintiff does not challenge this ruling on appeal, we make no further mention of the state-law claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In her brief, the plaintiff directs our attention to the incorrect termination of the case one day prior to the actual entry of judgment, in violation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a)(1).

The plaintiff is not, therefore, entitled to relief on this account<i>See Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v.
