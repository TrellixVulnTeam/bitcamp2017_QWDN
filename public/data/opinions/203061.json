Shank, Co., Inc. and Balfour Beatty Construction, Inc.,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                v.\n\n        INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS\n                 LOCAL 99, a/k/a IBEW LOCAL 99,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n                           ERRATA SHEET\n\n     The opinion of this Court issued on August 6, 2007 is amended\nas follows:\n\n     Delete the text of footnote 4 on page 15 in its entirety and\nreplace it with the following:\n\n     Shank/BB correctly argues that an affirmative claim for work\nneed not be explicit and that the actual performance of the work by\nunion-represented employees may be sufficient. Performance of the\nwork might in some instances be \"evidence\" of a claim on the work\nthat creates a jurisdictional dispute.          See, e.g., Int'l\nLongshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union, Local 62-B v. N.L.R.B.\n(Alaska Timber), 781 F.2d 919, 924-26 (D.C. Cir. 1986); Int'l\nLongshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union, Local 14 (Sierra Pacific),\n314 N.L.R.B. 834, 936 (1994), aff'd 85 F.3d 646, 651-53 (D.C. Cir.\n1996). It is not clear that these cases help the company, which\nassigned the \"electrical\" work to other unions willing to do it.\nThe real dispute is still between Shank/BB and the electrical\nunion.   And the NLRB precedent, which only plays the role of\nbackground context for contract construction, involves NLRA\njurisdictional disputes, which by statute are resolved by a third\nparty, and not one of the disputing participants. See 29 U.S.C.\n§ 158(b)(4)(D); id. § 160(k).\n\n     Page 11, line 16: insert apostrophe after \"laborers\"\n\n     Page 16, line 19: insert \"operating\" before \"engineers'\"\n\f",
