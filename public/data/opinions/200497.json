Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n                       Selya, Lipez and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Patrick Shanley on brief for appellants.\n     Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Paul G.\nCasey, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motions for Summary Disposition\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                              June 10, 2003\n\f            Per Curiam.       Appellants Juan and Antonio Dellosantos\n\nappeal their sentences following their convictions for possessing\n\nwith the intent to distribute and distributing heroin in violation\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Antonio contends that the district court\n\nerred by denying his request for a downward departure based on his\n\ndeportable alien status.         Juan contends that the attorney who\n\nrepresented    him    below    provided     constitutionally        ineffective\n\nassistance by failing to seek such a downward departure.                     The\n\ngovernment seeks summary disposition in both appeals.\n\n            Having thoroughly reviewed the briefs and the record, we\n\nsee no reason not to enforce the waiver of appellate rights that is\n\ncontained in Antonio's plea agreement. After all, the record shows\n\nit to be knowing and voluntary, and Antonio does not contend that\n\nthe \"miscarriage of justice\" exception should apply.                See United\n\nStates v. De-La-Cruz Castro, 299 F.3d 5, 15 (1st Cir. 2002), United\n\nStates v. Teeter, 237 F.3d 14, 21-27 (1st Cir. 2001).                   We note,\n\nmoreover, that even if we were to overlook Antonio's waiver of\n\nappellate   rights,   he   abandoned      the   right   to   seek   a   downward\n\ndeparture on the ground presented here by the terms of his plea\n\nagreement, and he forfeited that right by his presentation at the\n\nsentencing hearing.1\n\n\n     1\n        The amended sentencing memorandum that Antonio submitted\nbelow sought a downward departure only on the ground that Antonio\nwas willing to stipulate to his deportability.     Absent a non-\nfrivolous defense to a deportation charge, such departures are\nforeclosed under United States v. Clase-Espinal, 115 F.3d 1054,\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            On appeal Juan argues that the attorney who represented\n\nhim below    rendered   constitutionally   ineffective   assistance    by\n\nfailing to seek a downward departure based on Juan's deportable\n\nalien status.    The argument overlooks the fact that, like Antonio,\n\nJuan waived the right to seek any departures under the terms of his\n\nplea agreement.2\n\n            The court has considered the arguments raised in the\n\nappellants' joint pro se supplemental brief and concludes that they\n\nare meritless.     In view of the foregoing, the government's motion\n\nfor summary disposition in United States v. Antonio Dellosantos,\n\nNo. 02-1177 is allowed.     Appeal dismissed.   See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n            The government's motion for summary disposition in United\n\nStates v. Juan Dellosantos, No. 02-1178, also is allowed.             The\n\njudgment of conviction pertaining to Juan Dellosantos is affirmed.\n\nSee Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n1056-60 (1st Cir. 1997). While Antonio now contends that adverse\npenal consequences associated with his deportable alien status\nshould entitle him to a downward departure, he did not make this\nargument below.    Thus, it has been forfeited.    In all events,\nAntonio has not suggested that his case presents any extraordinary\ncircumstances that would support a downward departure based on his\ndeportability. See United States v. Maldonado, 242 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\nCir. 2001).\n     2\n        As with Antonio, no extraordinary circumstances have been\nidentified in support of a deportability departure for Juan.\n\n                                  -3-\n\f",
