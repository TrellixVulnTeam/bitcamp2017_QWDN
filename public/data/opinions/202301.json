Genc Islami (\"Islami\"), an Albanian citizen who\nemigrated to the United States in 2000 on a fraudulent passport,\napplied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\nConvention Against Torture. The BIA held that even assuming Islami\nhad suffered past persecution, country conditions in Albania have\nchanged and Islami no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution\nin Albania, and it dismissed his appeal.                  Holding substantial\nevidence supports the BIA’s decision, we DENY Islami’s petition for\nreview.\n\n\nI.   Background\n     Islami is a thirty year-old Albanian native who emigrated to\nthe United States to escape mistreatment by the Albanian police for\nhis expressive activities in opposition to the communist government\nthen in power.        Islami conceded removability but applied for\npolitical    asylum   under    Section     208    of   the   Immigration    and\nNationality Act, withholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of\nthe Act, and relief under Article III of the Convention Against\nTorture. Claiming past persecution \"at the hands of the [Albanian]\ngovernment, police and individuals it failed/refused to control,”\nIslami testified to receiving two beatings by Albanian police, one\nin 1991 and one in 1998; to receiving death threats from persons\nwho, Islami suspects, were former Secret Police officers; to\nauthoring letters to U.S. Congressmen criticizing the Albanian\ngovernment   as   abusive;    and   to   his     belief   that   the   \"Albanian\ngovernment and/or its agents\" would \"kill\" him if he returned to\nAlbania because he \"all the time has opposed the [communist]\n\n                                     -2-\n\fgovernment,\" and to his belief that the current government of\nAlbania is, in fact, a communist government in disguise.1\n      The IJ found Islami's testimony to be credible but doubted\nthat the two beatings in 1991 and 1998 and subsequent threats\nqualified       as    \"persecution\"     on     account   of   real   or   imputed\nanti-government political opinion.              However, the IJ did not reach\nthat issue because he found that Albanian country conditions had\nchanged, and Islami no longer had an objectively well-founded fear\nof future persecution.             Because the \"clear probability\" standard\nfor withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against\nTorture is more rigorous than the well-founded-fear requirement for\nasylum, the IJ denied all forms of relief and ordered Islami\nremoved to Albania.         The BIA agreed and dismissed the appeal.\n\n\nII.   Discussion\n      We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d) because\nIslami exhausted his administrative remedies.                  See 8 U.S.C. §\n1252(d)(1).      We review findings of fact and credibility by the BIA\n\"under      a        deferential      'substantial       evidence'    standard.\"\nAlvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1990); Novoa-Umania\nv. INS, 896 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[W]e must uphold any\nfinding of fact that is supported by 'substantial evidence.'\").\nBIA   determinations        of     statutory   eligibility    for    relief   from\n\n1\n  The State Department has concluded that many asylum requests by\nAlbanians assert, as Islami does, that the present Socialist\ngovernment is really the old Communist Party reconstituted;\nhowever, this is not borne out by Department of State documents,\nincluding Albania – Country Report on Human Rights Practices – 2003\n(issued in 2004).\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdeportation, whether via asylum or withholding or removal, are\nconclusive if \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\nevidence on the record considered as a whole.\"                Gebremichael v.\nINS, 10 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1993).           Absent an error of law, the\nBIA's decisions may be overruled only if the evidence \"points\nunerringly in the opposite direction.\" Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359\nF.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir. 2004).\n      An applicant for asylum bears the burden to prove the criteria\nfor   asylum,   and   the    criteria    for   any   withholding    of   removal\nrequested.      Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir.\n2005); Matter of Acosta, 19 I & N Dec. 211 (BIA 1985), modified on\nother grounds, Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I & N Dec. 439 (BIA 1987).\nA credible showing of past persecution gives rise to a regulatory\npresumption that the applicant has a well-founded fear of future\npersecution.     See In Re H, 21 I. & N. Dec. 337, 346 (BIA 1996); 8\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).         Islami criticizes the BIA’s finding that\nthe Attorney General successfully rebutted this presumption by\nshowing changed country conditions in Albania.\n      Even if Islami had suffered past persecution, substantial\nevidence supports the BIA’s finding conditions in Albania have\nimproved.    Islami’s ordinary presumption of a well-founded fear is\nrebutted by a preponderance of evidence that \"[t]here has been a\nfundamental change in circumstances such that [Islami] no longer\nhas   a   well-founded      fear   of   persecution    in   [his]   country   of\nnationality.\"     8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).            We do not dispute\nthat Islami’s fear is subjectively genuine. However, his fear must\nalso be objectively reasonable,\" Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d\n\n                                        -4-\n\f565, 572 (1st Cir. 1999), shown \"’by credible, direct, and specific\nevidence, ... facts that would support a reasonable fear that the\npetitioner faces persecution.’\"             Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 16\n(1st Cir. 2003).       We hold that Islami’s fear cannot be objectively\nreasonable because substantial evidence supports the BIA’s finding\nthat, today, Albanians need not have the same fear of significant\npolice harassment on account of their political opinions.\n      Several    recent      political      developments      offer   cause   for\noptimism, at least on paper.           Albania is now a republic comprised\nof a multi-party parliament.           Its constitution expressly prohibits\npolice and other governmental authorities from engaging in torture,\ndegrading or inhumane treatment, or forcibly obtaining confessions.\nIt provides for an independent judiciary, the right to a fair,\nspeedy and public trial, freedom of assembly, and peaceful change\nof   government.       The     Albanian    Penal    Procedures   Code    provides\nguidelines for the detention of suspects, in addition to counsel\nfor indigent detainees.         Moreover, Albania appears to have joined\nseveral     international      human    rights     agreements,   including    the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the United\nNations Convention Against Torture; the European Convention for the\nProtection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"ECHR\"); the\nEuropean Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment; and Protocol No. 6 to the ECHR\nabolishing the death penalty.\n      The   Albanian    Parliament        has   elected   a   national   People’s\nAdvocate     charged    with    investigating       and   prosecuting    official\nabuses, including police mistreatment, and successful prosecutions\n\n                                          -5-\n\fhave occurred.          Amnesty International reports that human rights\ntraining is now provided to the police by international human\nrights organizations at a centralized police academy.                              And the\nlatest      evidence    shows    these      steps    may       be   having    an    effect:\npolitical killings or disappearances appear to have declined;\nelections have had fewer irregularities; political parties, trade\nunions, and various social groups, although still facing political\npressure, may now publish their own newspapers; and human rights\ngroups in Albania report fewer incidents of police beatings. Where\npolice       beatings    have    occurred,        there    have       been   reports    of\nsuccessful prosecutions.\n       Although police brutality does remain a problem in Albania,\nsubstantial evidence suggests that it is one of abuse of authority.\nIt    does    not    appear     to    be   directed       at    repressing     political\nviewpoints.         Every Albanian citizen is a potential victim.                      Yet,\nthis fact does not render every Albanian citizen eligible for\npolitical      asylum     in    the    United      States.          In    Islami's    case,\nsubstantial evidence supports the BIA's finding that, in light of\nthe many changes Albania has experienced over the six years since\nIslami left, there is simply no reason to believe that Islami's\nreturn would be met with any more than indifference – and certainly\nnot that Islami would immediately be singled out for persecution.\n       Islami       terminated       his   membership      in       the   Albania    Youth\nDemocratic Party Forum in 1994, he is not a member of the current\nopposition Democratic Party, and Islami offered no evidence that\nhis political involvements since 2000 have drawn the attention of\nthe   new     Socialist    government,        or    its    supporters.         Moreover,\n\n                                            -6-\n\f\"[t]here is nothing in the State Department reports that indicate\nthat the Socialist party routinely arrests, jails, or persecutes\nmembers of the Democratic Party.\"      Hasalla v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d\n799, 804 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding that changed country conditions\nin Albania rebutted a presumption that an Albanian Democratic Party\nmember persecuted under the communist regime and harassed from 1995\nthrough 1998 had a well-founded fear that he would suffer future\npersecution).     To the contrary, the Democratic Party is now the\nsecond largest party in the Albanian Parliament, with significant\nrepresentation.\n\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n       Although changed country conditions will not automatically\nrebut an applicant’s presumption of well-founded fear, the evidence\nhere negates Islami’s well-founded fear of future persecution. See\nFergiste v. INS, 138 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[C]hanges in\ncountry conditions must be shown to have negated the particular\napplicant's well-founded fear...\"). Therefore, because substantial\nevidence supports the BIA’s affirmance of the IJ’s denial of\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\nAgainst Torture, we DENY Islami’s petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

Moreover, Albania appears to have joined\nseveral     international      human    rights     agreements,   including    the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the United\nNations Convention Against Torture; the European Convention for the\nProtection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"ECHR\"); the\nEuropean Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment; and Protocol No. 6 to the ECHR\nabolishing the death penalty.\n      The   Albanian    Parliament        has   elected   a   national   People’s\nAdvocate     charged    with    investigating       and   prosecuting    official\nabuses, including police mistreatment, and successful prosecutions\n\n                                          -5-\n\fhave occurred.          Amnesty International reports that human rights\ntraining is now provided to the police by international human\nrights organizations at a centralized police academy.                              And the\nlatest      evidence    shows    these      steps    may       be   having    an    effect:\npolitical killings or disappearances appear to have declined;\nelections have had fewer irregularities; political parties, trade\nunions, and various social groups, although still facing political\npressure, may now publish their own newspapers; and human rights\ngroups in Albania report fewer incidents of police beatings. Where\npolice       beatings    have    occurred,        there    have       been   reports    of\nsuccessful prosecutions.\n       Although police brutality does remain a problem in Albania,\nsubstantial evidence suggests that it is one of abuse of authority.\nIt    does    not    appear     to    be   directed       at    repressing     political\nviewpoints.         Every Albanian citizen is a potential victim.                      Yet,\nthis fact does not render every Albanian citizen eligible for\npolitical      asylum     in    the    United      States.          In    Islami's    case,\nsubstantial evidence supports the BIA's finding that, in light of\nthe many changes Albania has experienced over the six years since\nIslami left, there is simply no reason to believe that Islami's\nreturn would be met with any more than indifference – and certainly\nnot that Islami would immediately be singled out for persecution.\n       Islami       terminated       his   membership      in       the   Albania    Youth\nDemocratic Party Forum in 1994, he is not a member of the current\nopposition Democratic Party, and Islami offered no evidence that\nhis political involvements since 2000 have drawn the attention of\nthe   new     Socialist    government,        or    its    supporters.         Moreover,\n\n                                            -6-\n\f\"[t]here is nothing in the State Department reports that indicate\nthat the Socialist party routinely arrests, jails, or persecutes\nmembers of the Democratic Party.\"      Hasalla v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786118\"><a href=\"/opinion/786118/besnik-hasalla-floresha-hasalla-aida-hasalla-v-john-ashcroft-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 804 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding that changed country conditions\nin Albania rebutted a presumption that an Albanian Democratic Party\nmember persecuted under the communist regime and harassed from 1995\nthrough 1998 had a well-founded fear that he would suffer future\npersecution).     To the contrary, the Democratic Party is now the\nsecond largest party in the Albanian Parliament, with significant\nrepresentation.\n\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n       Although changed country conditions will not automatically\nrebut an applicant’s presumption of well-founded fear, the evidence\nhere negates Islami’s well-founded fear of future persecution. See\nFergiste v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197837\"><a href=\"/opinion/197837/fergiste-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[C]hanges in\ncountry conditions must be shown to have negated the particular\napplicant's well-founded fear...\"). Therefore, because substantial\nevidence supports the BIA’s affirmance of the IJ’s denial of\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention\nAgainst Torture, we DENY Islami’s petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f</pre>",
