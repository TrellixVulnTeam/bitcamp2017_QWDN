This appeal is the latest chapter\n\nin an epic struggle between motor vehicle manufacturers and their\n\ndealers in the State of Maine.             See Alliance of Auto. Mfrs. v.\n\nGwadosky, 304 F. Supp. 2d 104, 106-09 (D. Me. 2004) [Alliance I]\n\n(discussing the historical antecedents).              The controversy centers\n\non reimbursement for warranty work.              Thirty years ago, the state\n\nlegislature intervened in this tug-of-war to ensure equity and to\n\nprevent   collateral     damage     to    consumers.       More    recently,         the\n\nlegislature    amended     the    state    regulatory      scheme     to   prohibit\n\nmanufacturers from adding state-specific surcharges to wholesale\n\nmotor   vehicle   prices    in    order    to    recoup   the     costs    of    their\n\ncompliance with retail-rate reimbursement laws (such as the one\n\nthat the Maine legislature previously had enacted).\n\n           The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (the Alliance),\n\na   national   trade     association      whose      members    are   BMW       Group,\n\nDaimlerChrysler Corp., Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., Mazda\n\nNorth American Operations, Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc.,\n\nPorsche Cars North America, Inc., Toyota Motor North America, Inc.,\n\nand Volkswagen of America, Inc., challenged the recoupment bar as,\n\namong other things, a violation of both the Commerce and Contracts\n\nClauses of the United States Constitution.                  The district court\n\nrejected that binary challenge. After careful consideration of the\n\nclaims asserted, we conclude that the Alliance has not made out a\n\ngenuine   issue   of     material    fact       as   to   the   existence       of    a\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fconstitutional violation.             Consequently, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            The        historic   relationship         between     motor   vehicle\n\nmanufacturers and dealers is not a particularly congenial one.\n\nSee, e.g., Gen. Motors Corp. v. Darling's, 324 F. Supp. 2d 257 (D.\n\nMe. 2004), amended in part by 330 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D. Me. 2004);\n\nLiberty Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 923 F. Supp. 665\n\n(D.N.J. 1996), aff'd, 134 F.3d 557 (3d Cir. 1998); Darling's v.\n\nFord   Motor     Co.,    825   A.2d   344   (Me.   2003).        The   relationship\n\ntypically flows from a franchise agreement that, in addition to\n\nother provisions, requires the dealer to perform warranty repairs\n\n(without regard to whether the dealer sold the vehicle in question)\n\nand sets out explicit rules for how the manufacturer will reimburse\n\nthe dealer for that work.\n\n            Predictably, warranty reimbursement rates have been a\n\nsource of considerable friction.             The manufacturers have demanded\n\npreferential pricing of warranty repairs as a sort of volume\n\ndiscount.        The    dealers   have    argued   that   the     discounted   rate\n\nstructure not only reflects an excessive imbalance in market power,\n\nbut also forces them to increase the charges for non-warranty\n\nrepairs     (a    practice     that      effectively     requires      non-warranty\n\ncustomers to subsidize warranty work).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f           In    1975,    the   Maine    legislature     stepped    into   this\n\nimbroglio and began to regulate the price of warranty repairs\n\nwithin Maine's borders.          See 1975 Me. Laws 1788 (codified as\n\namended at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1176) (mandating that\n\nmotor vehicle manufacturers compensate dealers \"adequately and\n\nfairly\" for warranty repairs).            In its most recent incarnation,\n\nenacted   in    1991,    this   provision     requires   that   manufacturers\n\nreimburse their Maine dealers for parts and labor at the retail\n\nrates customarily charged to non-warranty customers.               See Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1176.\n\n           In the usual motor vehicle franchise agreement, the\n\nmanufacturer reserves the right to set wholesale vehicle prices\n\nunilaterally.1    Exercising this right, Ford Motor Co. responded to\n\nMaine's amended version of section 1176 by adding a \"warranty\n\nparity surcharge\" to the wholesale price of motor vehicles sold in\n\nMaine.    This surcharge was designed to            recoup the incremental\n\nexpenses that resulted from retail-rate reimbursement.\n\n           Adjudicating a dealer challenge to the surcharge, we held\n\nthat nothing in Maine's motor vehicle franchise law prohibited it.\n\nSee Acadia Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 44 F.3d 1050, 1055-57\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); see also Acadia Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.,\n\n\n\n     1\n      General   Motors'    standard    franchise   agreement    is\nrepresentative of the genre. It declares in pertinent part that\n\"[p]rices, destination charges, and other terms of sale applicable\nto any Motor Vehicle may be changed at any time.\"\n\n                                        -4-\n\f799 A.2d 1228, 1231 (Me. 2002) (agreeing with this conclusion). In\n\n2002, Ford set its surcharge at $500 per vehicle and collected more\n\nthan $3,600,000 in additional revenue from Maine dealers. No other\n\nmanufacturer has, as yet, followed suit.\n\n            Once again, the Maine legislature intervened.                  After\n\nseveral    failed   attempts     at    crafting   a     solution,   it    passed\n\nLegislative Document 1294.       That document amended section 1176 by\n\nproviding in pertinent part that a motor vehicle manufacturer \"may\n\nnot otherwise recover its cost for reimbursing a [dealer] for parts\n\nand labor pursuant to this section.\"         L.D. 1294 § 10, 121st Leg.,\n\n1st Reg. Sess. (Me. 2003).             For simplicity's sake, we refer\n\nthroughout this opinion to this proviso — section 10 of L.D. 1294\n\n— as the \"recoupment bar.\"\n\n            On September 4, 2003, the Alliance filed suit in Maine's\n\nfederal    district    court,    challenging      the    recoupment      bar   as\n\nunconstitutional      under    the    Commerce,   Contracts,     and     Takings\n\nClauses.   It sought declaratory and injunctive relief and named as\n\ndefendants Dan A. Gwadosky, in his official capacity as Maine's\n\nSecretary of State, and G. Steven Rowe, in his official capacity as\n\nMaine's Attorney General (collectively, the State).\n\n            The   district    court    allowed    the    Maine   Auto    Dealers\n\nAssociation (MADA) a right to participate in the proceedings as an\n\namicus curiae.      It proceeded to deny the Alliance's motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction, finding that the Alliance had established\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fneither a likelihood of success on the merits nor irreparable harm.\n\nSee Alliance I, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 117; see also Ross-Simons of\n\nWarwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(explicating the preliminary injunction standard).               As to the\n\nCommerce Clause challenge, the court concluded that the recoupment\n\nbar did not reflect a discriminatory purpose, did not give rise to\n\na     discriminatory    effect,   and   did   not   have   any   forbidden\n\nextraterritorial reach. See Alliance I, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 110-14.\n\nThe Contracts Clause challenge was impuissant, the court ruled,\n\nbecause the recoupment bar \"was within the reasonable expectations\n\nof the parties.\"       Id. at 116.\n\n            After limited discovery, the protagonists cross-moved for\n\nsummary judgment.       The district court granted the State's motion\n\nand denied the Alliance's motion, essentially for the reasons\n\nelucidated in Alliance I. See Alliance of Auto. Mfrs. v. Gwadosky,\n\n353 F. Supp. 2d 97, 99-100 (D. Me. 2005) [Alliance II].          Along the\n\nway, the Alliance voluntarily dismissed the Takings Clause claim.2\n\nII.    ANALYSIS\n\n            On appeal, the Alliance reasserts its position that the\n\nrecoupment bar violates both the Commerce and Contracts Clauses.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      The Alliance had challenged another provision of L.D. 1294 on\ndue process grounds. The district court rejected that claim when\nit granted summary judgment for the State, see Alliance II, 353 F.\nSupp. 2d at 108-09, and the Alliance does not contest that\ndetermination.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fWe first sketch the familiar summary judgment standard and then\n\ndeal sequentially with these assertions.\n\n                  A.     The Summary Judgment Standard.\n\n            A district court may enter summary judgment upon a\n\nshowing \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\n\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).       We review orders granting summary\n\njudgment de novo; like the district court, we must scrutinize the\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the summary judgment loser\n\nand draw all reasonable inferences therefrom to that party's\n\nbehoof.    Houlton Citizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178,\n\n184 (1st Cir. 1999).      This standard is not affected by the presence\n\nof cross-motions for summary judgment.           See Blackie v. Maine, 75\n\nF.3d 716, 721 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            It is within this procedural framework that we assess the\n\nAlliance's     claims.     Our review is not constrained by the lower\n\ncourt's stated rationale; we may affirm the entry of summary\n\njudgment on any ground supported by the record.                    See Houlton\n\nCitizens' Coal., 175 F.3d at 184.\n\n                   B.     The Commerce Clause Claims.\n\n            The Constitution grants Congress the power \"[t]o regulate\n\nCommerce . . . among the several States.\"          U.S. Const. art. I, § 8,\n\ncl. 3.      That grant embodies a negative aspect as well — the\n\n\"dormant    Commerce     Clause\"   —   which   \"prevents   state    and   local\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fgovernments from impeding the free flow of goods from one state to\n\nanother.\"      Houlton Citizens' Coal., 175 F.3d at 184.               Put another\n\nway, the dormant Commerce Clause \"prohibits protectionist state\n\nregulation designed to benefit in-state economic interests by\n\nburdening out-of-state competitors.\"               Grant's Dairy-Me., LLC v.\n\nComm'r of Me. Dep't of Agric., Food & Rural Res., 232 F.3d 8, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n              The type of inquiry needed to determine whether a state\n\nlaw transgresses the Commerce Clause varies depending upon the\n\nnature of the law at issue.             A state statute that purports to\n\nregulate commerce occurring wholly beyond the boundaries of the\n\nenacting      state   outstrips   the     limits   of   the    enacting     state's\n\nconstitutional authority and, therefore, is per se invalid. Pharm.\n\nResearch & Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d 66, 79 (1st Cir.\n\n2001), aff'd sub nom. Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh, 538\n\nU.S.    644    (2003).        A   state      statute    that     has   no   direct\n\nextraterritorial reach but that discriminates against interstate\n\ncommerce on its face, in purpose, or in effect receives a form of\n\nstrict scrutiny so rigorous that it is usually fatal. This amounts\n\nto a \"virtually per se invalid rule,\" id. at 79 (citing Or. Waste\n\nSys., Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 511 U.S. 93, 99 (1994)),\n\nunder   which    such    a   statute    is    invalid   unless    it   advances   a\n\nlegitimate local purpose that cannot be served by reasonable non-\n\ndiscriminatory means, see id. at 79, 83.                 A state statute that\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f\"regulates    evenhandedly   and   has    only   incidental   effects    on\n\ninterstate commerce\" engenders a lower level of scrutiny.          Id. at\n\n80.   That analysis entails resort to the balancing test limned in\n\nPike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 (1970): \"Where the statute\n\nregulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public\n\ninterest,    and   its   effects   on    interstate   commerce   are    only\n\nincidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such\n\ncommerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local\n\nbenefits.\"   Id. at 142.\n\n            The Alliance urges that Maine's recoupment bar violates\n\nthe dormant Commerce Clause in three ways: (i) it was enacted on\n\nthe wings of a discriminatory purpose, (ii) it has a discriminatory\n\neffect, and (iii) it has an impermissible extraterritorial reach\n\nthat causes consequences beyond Maine's borders.           None of these\n\nclaims corresponds with the third tier of the analytic framework\n\nset out above.     In all events, the Alliance has expressly waived\n\nany theory of liability premised on the Pike balancing test;\n\ninstead, it has gambled on its theory that the recoupment bar\n\ntriggers strict scrutiny (and, thus, is per se invalid).                See\n\nAlliance I, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 114; see also United States v.\n\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that arguments\n\nnot seasonably made are deemed abandoned).        Accordingly, we leave\n\nPike to one side.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          In the pages that follow, we deal separately with each of\n\nthe three arguments actually made by the Alliance.   Throughout, we\n\nkeep in mind \"[t]he elementary rule . . . that every reasonable\n\nconstruction must be resorted to . . . in order to save a statute\n\nfrom unconstitutionality.\" Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 648, 657\n\n(1895).\n\n          1.   Discriminatory Purpose.   \"The core purpose of the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause is to prevent states and their political\n\nsubdivisions from promulgating protectionist policies.\"    Houlton\n\nCitizens Coal., 175 F.3d at 188. \"A finding that state legislation\n\nconstitutes 'economic protectionism' may be made on the basis of\n\neither discriminatory purpose or discriminatory effect.\"   Bacchus\n\nImps., Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263, 270 (1984) (citations omitted).3\n\nThe Alliance notes that there are no warranty parity surcharges in\n\nneighboring New Hampshire and argues, in part, that discriminatory\n\npurpose mars the recoupment bar because the Maine legislature\n\npassed the law to deprive New Hampshire motor vehicle dealers of\n\n\n     3\n      While courts routinely recite this test, see, e.g., Chem.\nWaste Mgmt., Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U.S. 334, 344 n.6 (1992); Int'l\nTruck & Engine Corp. v. Bray, 372 F.3d 717, 725 (5th Cir. 2004);\nChambers Med. Techs. of S.C., Inc. v. Bryant, 52 F.3d 1252, 1256\n(4th Cir. 1995); Old Coach Dev. Corp. v. Tanzman, 881 F.2d 1227,\n1231 (3d Cir. 1989), there is some reason to question whether a\nshowing of discriminatory purpose alone will invariably suffice to\nsupport a finding of constitutional invalidity under the dormant\nCommerce Clause.    See Kathleen M. Sullivan & Gerald Gunther,\nConstitutional Law 275 (15th ed. 2004) (recognizing the analytical\ndifficulty that arises because \"a law motivated wholly by\nprotectionist   intent   might   fail   to   produce   significant\ndiscriminatory effects\").\n\n                               -10-\n\fthe competitive advantage derived from paying lower wholesale\n\nprices than their Maine counterparts for new cars.\n\n          To support its claim of discriminatory purpose, the\n\nAlliance points to three bodies of evidence:\n\n          C      Statements contained in the Report of\n                 the Commission to Study the Most\n                 Effective Method of Providing Retail\n                 Rate Reimbursement for Parts and Labor\n                 (the Retail Rate Commission Report), a\n                 study   commissioned    by    the  Maine\n                 legislature and published in December\n                 of 2000. Specifically, some Commission\n                 members \"note[d] . . . the unfair\n                 advantage . . . to New Hampshire\n                 dealers who [were] not subject to the\n                 surcharge.\"   Moreover, \"[the majority\n                 of the Commission] argue[d] that Maine\n                 dealers and consumers should not have\n                 to pay more than other buyers in other\n                 parts   of   the    country.\"      These\n                 statements       were     made     while\n                 recommending, among other things, the\n                 enactment     of     a     cost-recovery\n                 prohibition should negotiations between\n                 manufacturers and dealers fail to yield\n                 a compromise solution.\n\n          C      The legislative process that led to\n                 passage    of   the    recoupment   bar.\n                 Specifically, the Maine legislature\n                 enacted L.D. 1294 only after the\n                 relevant legislative committee twice\n                 passed compromise legislation that did\n                 not     include     a     cost-recovery\n                 prohibition.     The first compromise\n                 bill, resulting from manufacturer-\n                 dealer negotiations, died after MADA\n                 withdrew its support. See Comm.

The\n                 legislature ultimately enacted that\n                 version of the bill into law. See 2003\n                 Me. Laws 1067 (codified at Me. Rev.\n                 Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1176).\n\n          C      Materials generated in the course of\n                 MADA's lobbying campaign, and, more\n                 specifically, the statements of one\n                 dealer, John Darling (of the several\n                 statements that the Alliance cites,\n                 only one is attributable to a dealer\n                 other     than    Darling). 4         In\n                 communications with members of the\n                 legislature, Darling lobbied in favor\n                 of the recoupment bar by emphasizing\n                 the price disparity between Maine and\n                 New Hampshire and the competition among\n                 dealers in the two states.           His\n                 statements include: \"[Maine dealers]\n                 don't want cars to cost $500 more in\n                 Maine than they do in New Hampshire,\"\n                 \"[the    cost-recovery     prohibition]\n                 eliminates the current price disparity\n                 between Maine dealers and surrounding\n                 states,\" and    \"surcharges    must   be\n                 curtailed as they are forcing Maine\n                 consumers to buy out-of-state where\n                 Ford   dealers   don't   pay    a   $500\n                 surcharge.\"\n\n          At the outset, we brush aside the questions raised below\n\nregarding the Alliance's standing to challenge the law on Commerce\n\nClause grounds. A trade association's standing may derive from its\n\nmembers' standing.   See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw\n\n\n\n     4\n      Although Darling was also a member of the Retail Rate\nCommission, he did not make any of the cited statements in that\ncapacity.   Rather, he spoke as a Maine dealer and a member of\nMADA's board of directors, years after the Commission had concluded\nits business.\n\n                               -12-\n\fEnvtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181 (2000) (limning\n\nrequirements for derivative standing).        Ford, a member of the\n\nAlliance,    has   suffered   concrete   pecuniary    injury   from   the\n\nrecoupment bar.     That injury is enough to ground the Alliance's\n\nstanding to sue even though the Alliance is not a member of the\n\nout-of-state class against whom the recoupment bar ostensibly\n\ndiscriminates.     See Bacchus Imps., 468 U.S. at 267 (holding that\n\nin-state liquor wholesalers had standing to challenge a Hawaii law\n\nthat allegedly burdened out-of-state liquor producers because the\n\nwholesalers suffered economic injury); see also Gen. Motors Corp.\n\nv. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 286 (1997).\n\n            Having confirmed the Alliance's standing, we turn to the\n\nmerits of the claim.     The Alliance, as the party challenging the\n\nvalidity of the recoupment bar, bears the burden of demonstrating\n\nthat the statute was animated by a discriminatory purpose.            See\n\nHughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322, 336 (1979).        Notwithstanding the\n\ngenerosity inherent in our standard of review — we must assay the\n\nfacts in the light most flattering to the party against whom\n\nsummary judgment has been granted, Houlton Citizens' Coal., 175\n\nF.3d at 184 — the Alliance has failed to carry this burden.\n\n            The most debilitating weakness in this argument results\n\nfrom the fact that the Alliance loses sight of the forest while\n\nsearching for trees.    The purpose of a statute, like its meaning,\n\nmust be discerned from the statute as a whole.        Thus, context is a\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fcritically important interpretive tool.          See Edwards v. Aguillard,\n\n482 U.S. 578, 594 (1987) (\"The plain meaning of the statute's\n\nwords,    enlightened   by    their    context   and    the    contemporaneous\n\nlegislative history, can control the determination of legislative\n\npurpose.\").      The Alliance's strained attempt to piece together\n\nisolated bits of evidence ignores the larger context in which the\n\nrecoupment bar rests.        An assessment of that larger context makes\n\nmanifest the evident purpose of the recoupment bar.\n\n            The recoupment bar is fully integrated into Maine's motor\n\nvehicle franchise law.       See Me. Rev. Ann. Stat. tit. 10, §§ 1171 to\n\n1190-A.     It   comprises     one    sentence   of    one    section   of    that\n\nintricately constructed law — a section that has been on the books,\n\nin one form or another, for three decades.              See id. § 1176.        The\n\nrationale for the motor vehicle franchise law can be found within\n\nthe four corners of the statute itself: its purpose is \"to prevent\n\nfrauds, impositions and other abuses against residents and to\n\nprotect and preserve the economy, the investments of residents, the\n\npublic safety and the transportation system of the State.\"                   Id. §\n\n1182. Although the legislature adopted this policy in 1997 (before\n\nthe recoupment bar was even a gleam in its sponsors' eyes), its\n\nspirit permeates the statutory scheme and reflects the core purpose\n\nof section 1176 (which, of course, had been on the books for over\n\ntwenty years when the policy statement was adopted).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f              Seen in this light, it is readily apparent that the\n\noverriding legislative objective behind section 1176 was to prevent\n\nan unfair price differential between warranty and non-warranty\n\nrepair work — a differential that the Maine legislature reasonably\n\nviewed as detrimental to consumers and motor vehicle dealers alike.\n\nFord's counter — the imposition of the warranty parity surcharge —\n\nthwarted this purpose and revealed the existence of a loophole in\n\nthe retail-rate reimbursement provision.         The recoupment bar was a\n\ndevice designed to plug that loophole and restore the structural\n\nintegrity of section 1176's warranty-reimbursement scheme.\n\n              Read in its entirety, the Retail Rate Commission Report\n\nconfirms this understanding.           In the opening sections of that\n\ndocument, the Commission reiterated the root purposes of section\n\n1176:   \"to     protect   retail    customers\"   and   \"to   protect     Maine\n\nautomobile dealers from the superior bargaining position of the\n\nnational manufacturers.\"           The Commission deemed \"[t]he current\n\nsurcharge practices of the manufacturers\" as \"contrary to the\n\nintent of the statute\" and premised its consideration of the cost-\n\nrecovery question on that assumption. Against this background, the\n\nCommission's occasional references to the surcharge's competitive\n\nimpact on Maine motor vehicle dealers are best understood as\n\nefforts    to    highlight   a   concrete    manifestation    of   the   harm\n\nattributable to the surcharge, not as statements of legislative\n\npurpose.\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f           The presence of other, less direct evidence reinforces\n\nthis view.      In this regard, the most salient fact is that the\n\nrecoupment bar is closely tailored to achieve the legislative\n\npurpose stated in section 1182.                    Cf. Hunt v. Wash. State Apple\n\nAdver. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 352 (1977) (finding it \"somewhat\n\nsuspect\"   that    the   means         chosen      to    effectuate       the    challenged\n\nregulation's      \"ostensible          .    .      .     purpose\"       were     relatively\n\nineffective).     The recoupment bar plugs the loophole that Ford was\n\nexploiting with perfect precision and ensures that manufacturers,\n\nnot dealers or consumers, will bear the true cost of retail-rate\n\nreimbursement.\n\n           The Alliance urges us to look past this larger context\n\nbased on the tenet that \"[l]ess deference to . . . legislative\n\njudgment   is     due    .    .    .    where          the   local   regulation         bears\n\ndisproportionately       on       out-of-state          residents       and    businesses.\"\n\nKassel v. Consol. Freightways Corp., 450 U.S. 662, 675-76 (1981).\n\nThat tenet is inapposite here.               The Kassel Court's exhortation to\n\nlook beyond legislative judgments is predicated on the existence of\n\na threshold condition: the statute must bear disproportionately on\n\nout-of-state    interests.             As   we   soon        discuss,    see    infra   Part\n\nII(B)(2)-(3), the recoupment bar does not possess so invidious an\n\nimpact.\n\n           At any rate, the legislative process evidence upon which\n\nthe Alliance relies is indeterminate. As a general rule, statutory\n\n\n                                            -16-\n\finterpretation cannot safely be made to rest upon inferences drawn\n\nfrom intermediate legislative maneuvers.    See Trailmobile Co. v.\n\nWhirls, 331 U.S. 40, 61 (1947).    In this instance, such reliance\n\nwould be especially problematic because there are countless reasons\n\nwhy the state legislature may have altered its position.\n\n           Where, as here, a party presents circumstantial evidence\n\nof an allegedly discriminatory purpose in support of a dormant\n\nCommerce Clause argument, it is that party's responsibility to show\n\nthe relationship between the proffered evidence and the challenged\n\nstatute.   See E. Ky. Res. v. Fiscal Court, 127 F.3d 532, 543 (6th\n\nCir. 1997).   While statements by a law's private-sector proponents\n\nsometimes can shed light on its purpose, see, e.g., S.D. Farm\n\nBureau v. Hazeltine, 340 F.3d 583, 594-95 (8th Cir. 2003), the\n\ncorrespondence of a single lobbyist has little (if any) probative\n\nvalue in demonstrating the objectives of the legislative body as a\n\nwhole.   See, e.g., Bell Atl. Tel. Cos. v. FCC, 131 F.3d 1044, 1048\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1997).   This is particularly so when, as in this case,\n\nfar stronger statements of intent can be gleaned from official\n\nlegislative sources.   See Garcia v. United States, 469 U.S. 70, 76\n\n(1984) (eschewing reliance on the comments of a single legislator\n\nand emphasizing that \"the authoritative source for finding the\n\nLegislature's intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill\").\n\n           None of this is to say that the legislature was blind to\n\nthe plight of Maine's motor vehicle dealers.      The record makes\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fpellucid, however, that if a potential discriminatory purpose was\n\nlurking in the background, that purpose was, at most, incidental to\n\nthe primary purposes that we have identified.          Incidental purpose,\n\nlike incidental effect, cannot suffice to trigger strict scrutiny\n\nunder the dormant Commerce Clause.          Cf. Pike, 397 U.S. at 142\n\n(adhering to a lower level of scrutiny when \"effects on interstate\n\ncommerce are only incidental\").\n\n           2.     Discriminatory      Effect.     We   turn      next   to   the\n\nAlliance's attempt to demonstrate that the recoupment bar has a\n\ndiscriminatory effect. The Alliance posits that the recoupment bar\n\nmanifests this pernicious effect in two ways: first, it eliminates\n\nthe competitive advantage of New Hampshire dealers vis-à-vis Maine\n\ndealers;   and    second,   it   exports    the    cost     of    retail-rate\n\nreimbursement nationally to out-of-state dealers. The problem here\n\nis   practical,   not   conceptual.     After   combing    the     record,   we\n\nconclude that the Alliance has not put forth sufficient evidence to\n\nsurvive summary judgment with respect to either such effect.\n\n           To support its assertion that the recoupment bar has an\n\nadvantage-stripping effect on New Hampshire dealers, the Alliance\n\nrelies on one central piece of evidence — a stipulation that\n\n\"[t]here is some competition between motor vehicle dealers in Maine\n\nand motor vehicle dealers in other states.\"               That stipulation,\n\nhowever, bears only a tangential relationship to the Alliance's\n\ntheories of discriminatory effect.        While the Alliance visualizes\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthe recoupment bar as \"an effort to stem the tide of customers\n\ndeciding to purchase motor vehicles in New Hampshire rather than\n\nMaine,\" Appellant's Br. at 25,5 the stipulation supplies no proof\n\nof a cross-border \"tide.\"                  There is likewise no evidence of how\n\nFord's implementation of a warranty parity surcharge may (or may\n\nnot)       have       affected   interstate       competition,   nor       is   there   any\n\nevidence of the recoupment bar's supposed interference with the\n\ncompetitive process.              For all that the record discloses, we could\n\njust as easily surmise that any success that New Hampshire dealers\n\nmay have had in luring Maine customers was premised on, say, better\n\nservice,          a    willingness   to     accept   lower    profit   margins,         more\n\nconvenient locations, or New Hampshire's eschewal of a general\n\nstatewide sales tax.\n\n                  To    be   sure,   the    Alliance      endeavors   to    bolster     the\n\nstipulation            by    reiterating    the    same    amalgam    of    Retail      Rate\n\nCommission and lobbyist statements on which it relied in its\n\nassertion of discriminatory purpose. For good measure, it adds the\n\nobservation of a Ford official that state-specific pricing actions\n\n\"may put [dealers] at a cost disadvantage . . . vis-[à]-vis dealers\n\nin bordering states.\" These augmentations add nothing of substance\n\nto the Alliance's claim.               At best, they reflect generalizations,\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      All citations to the appellant's brief refer to the version\nfiled under seal.\n\n                                             -19-\n\funsupported by either statistical analysis or concrete facts, about\n\nthe competitive position of Maine dealers.6\n\n          As to its contention that the recoupment bar \"effectively\n\nrequire[s]    that   all   dealers    nationwide   fund   the   additional\n\nmanufacturer payments associated with warranty repairs in Maine,\"\n\nAppellant's Br. at 35, the Alliance once again relies on a single\n\npiece of evidence: this time, the insistence of a General Motors'\n\nplenipotentiary that her company cannot absorb costs, but, as a\n\ncommercial entity, must account for them somehow (such as through\n\nnational price adjustments).7        But this statement is a waif in the\n\nwilderness.   The Alliance adduced no evidence of national vehicle\n\npricing, and nothing in the record illuminates wholesale vehicle\n\n\n     6\n      In their briefs and at oral argument, the parties devoted\nmuch time and energy to New Hampshire's retail-rate reimbursement\nlaw. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 357-C:5(II)(b). Although that statute\nis similar to Maine's retail-rate reimbursement law, manufacturers\nhave continued to pay for warranty work at discounted rates.\nAgainst this background, the State argued that New Hampshire's\nrequirement is mandatory and that the Alliance, by flouting that\nrequirement, improperly fabricated the competitive advantage that\nit claims Maine law destroys. The Alliance demurs; it interprets\nNew Hampshire's statute as optional, and insists that New Hampshire\ndealers are simply not submitting claims for retail rates. We need\nnot resolve these conflicting accounts because the Alliance has not\npresented enough evidence of discriminatory effect to warrant\nfurther inquiry into the requirements of New Hampshire law.\n     7\n      It seems odd to rely on General Motors for concrete evidence\nof the recoupment bar's effects, given that General Motors has\nnever imposed a warranty parity surcharge in Maine. To compound\nthe oddity, the record contains a statement from a representative\nof Ford that cost absorption is in fact an option and, moreover, an\noption to which Ford has resorted in the past.      Because of the\noverall paucity of proof, however, we need not explore these\ncuriosities.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fprices in Maine, New Hampshire, or elsewhere. By like token, there\n\nis not a shred of evidence that speaks reliably to trends in\n\npricing       after   Maine's   enactment      of    either   its     retail-rate\n\nreimbursement law or the recoupment bar. Finally, the record fails\n\nto provide a definitive statement of retail-rate reimbursement\n\ncosts incurred by manufacturers in Maine for which they allegedly\n\nmust account.\n\n               The proponent of a dormant Commerce Clause claim bears\n\nthe burden of proof as to discrimination.             See Hughes, 441 U.S. at\n\n336.       To block summary judgment, the party having the burden of\n\nproof on a critical issue must present evidence on that issue that\n\nis \"significantly probative,\" not \"merely colorable.\" Cadle Co. v.\n\nHayes, 116 F.3d 957, 960 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986)).                   The Alliance\n\nhas not satisfied that requirement here; it has offered only\n\nprognostications woven from the gossamer strands of speculation and\n\nsurmise, unaccompanied by any significantly probative evidence of\n\neither advantage-stripping or cost-exportation. That is inadequate\n\nto make out a genuine issue of material fact.8            See Medina-Munoz v.\n\nR.J.       Reynolds   Tobacco   Co.,   896    F.2d   5,   8   (1st    Cir.   1990)\n\n(explaining that \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences,\n\n\n\n       8\n      Because the Alliance has failed in its proof, we need not\ndecide whether its legal theories of discriminatory effect, if\nadequately supported by probative evidence, would suffice to\ntrigger strict scrutiny.\n\n                                       -21-\n\fand unsupported speculation\" are entitled to no weight in the\n\nsummary judgment calculus).\n\n            3.        Extraterritorial         Reach.        The   Alliance's      final\n\nCommerce    Clause      claim      is   that     the    recoupment       bar    has    an\n\nexterritorial reach that produces a constitutional infirmity. This\n\nclaim   rests    on    the    premise     that   the    recoupment       bar    has   the\n\nimpermissible \"practical effect of tying the wholesale price of\n\nmotor vehicles in Maine to the wholesale price of identical motor\n\nvehicles outside of Maine\" by making \"the wholesale price of motor\n\nvehicles in Maine the minimum wholesale price in the 49 other\n\nstates.\" Appellant's Br. at 39-40. Despite this bold declaration,\n\nthe Alliance adduced no probative evidence of price-tying below.\n\nOn appeal, it rehashes yet again the same evidence that it offered\n\nin connection with discriminatory purpose and adds one weapon to\n\nits armamentarium — the suggestion of a Commission member that\n\nMaine \"should move into law that manufacturers may not charge a\n\ndifferent price to Maine dealers.\"\n\n            These statements (all of which were made well before the\n\nlegislature acted) tell us nothing about either the recoupment\n\nbar's reach or its actual effect on national pricing. Furthermore,\n\nthe record reflects, and the Alliance itself acknowledges, that\n\nmanufacturers     add    state-specific          surcharges        to   motor   vehicle\n\nwholesale   prices      for    a   wide    variety      of    reasons     (e.g.,      some\n\nmanufacturers impose a California-specific surcharge to recover\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fcosts associated with that state's environmental regulations).\n\nThis potential still exists for motor vehicles sold in Maine;\n\nnothing   in   Maine        law   prevents    automobile      manufacturers   from\n\nadjusting their wholesale prices based on transportation costs,\n\nlabor    costs,   or    the       like.     There   is    only   one    limitation:\n\nmanufacturers     cannot          use     surcharges     to   recover    warranty-\n\nreimbursement costs (and, thus, to frustrate the purpose of Maine's\n\nretail-rate reimbursement statute).                 Like the elephant in the\n\nparlor, the implications of this conclusion are too obvious to\n\nignore.    The recoupment bar does not transform Maine prices into\n\nnational minimum prices because automobile manufacturers retain the\n\nability to adjust those prices for any reason save one.\n\n            On this sparse record, our extraterritorial-reach inquiry\n\nis short and to the point.              The inference that the Alliance would\n\nhave us draw is simply too much of a stretch.                    In view of this\n\nshortcoming and because the Alliance has not provided any other,\n\nmore reliable proof of the price-tying allegedly associated with\n\nthe recoupment bar, the lower court did not err in entering summary\n\njudgment on the extraterritorial reach claim.                 See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).    Consequently, there is no cause to engage the Alliance's\n\nlegal theory.\n\n                       C.    The Contracts Clause Claim.\n\n            The Alliance also attacks the recoupment bar on a second\n\nfront.     It argues that Maine, in derogation of the Contracts\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\fClause, has trespassed on manufacturers' franchise agreements by\n\neliminating components of the manufacturers' pricing discretion.\n\n             The Contracts Clause declares that: \"No State shall . .\n\n. pass any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts . . . .\"\n\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 1.         Though seemingly absolute in its\n\nprohibition, the Contracts Clause \"must be accommodated to the\n\ninherent police power of the State 'to safeguard the vital interest\n\nof its people.'\"      Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kan. Power & Light\n\nCo., 459 U.S. 400, 410 (1983) (quoting Home Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v.\n\nBlaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 434 (1934)).\n\n             To determine whether the Contracts Clause is implicated,\n\na reviewing court first must ask \"whether the state law has, in\n\nfact,     operated   as   a   substantial    impairment      of   a   contractual\n\nrelationship.\"       Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S.\n\n234, 244 (1978).      This inquiry elicits an affirmative answer only\n\nif   \"a   contractual     relationship      exists,   that    relationship    is\n\nimpaired by a change in the law, and the resultant impairment is\n\nsubstantial.\" Houlton Citizens' Coal., 175 F.3d at 190. The first\n\ntwo of these three factors are often easily satisfied, and this\n\ncase falls into that pattern: automobile manufacturers typically\n\nhave franchise agreements with dealers that reserve the right to\n\nset wholesale motor vehicle prices unilaterally, see supra note 1,\n\nand the recoupment bar now restricts their ability to exercise that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fright.        The question of substantial impairment is, therefore,\n\ndispositive.\n\n              The parties' reasonable expectations are central to the\n\nissue    of    substantiality.        In    that    regard,      it    is   especially\n\nimportant whether or not the parties have been operating in a\n\nregulated industry.           Energy Reserves, 459 U.S. at 413; Houlton\n\nCitizens' Coal., 175 F.3d at 190.             Maine has heavily regulated the\n\nmanufacturer-dealer          franchise     relationship,        including      warranty\n\nreimbursement       rates,    since   1975.        See   1975    Me.    Laws   1732-39\n\n(codified as amended at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, §§ 1171 to\n\n1190-A); see also Alliance I, 304 F. Supp. 2d at 115.                               The\n\nrecoupment bar — a necessary means to effectuate the State's\n\nwarranty reimbursement policy — was a foreseeable addition to that\n\nregulatory regime.            It was, therefore, permissible under the\n\nContracts Clause.        After all, if the Contracts Clause allows a\n\nState to dictate the price of warranty repairs in the first\n\ninstance,      it   perforce    allows     the   State    to     require     that   the\n\nmanufacturer, rather than the dealer or the consumer, absorb the\n\ntrue cost of those repairs.           Cf. Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, 462 U.S.\n\n176, 194 (1983) (holding that a State that regulates the price of\n\na commodity may require the sellers to \"absorb a tax increase\n\nthemselves rather than pass it through to their consumers\").\n\n              It follows inexorably, as night follows day, that the\n\nrecoupment bar did not substantially impair franchise agreements\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fentered after 1975.    Those franchise agreements were executed with\n\nthe knowledge and expectation of pervasive state regulation.\n\n          As to franchise agreements entered before 1975 — the\n\nrecord reveals no fewer than six that fit into that taxonomy — our\n\ninquiry continues.     As to those agreements, we ask \"whether the\n\nimpairment, albeit substantial, is reasonable and necessary to\n\nfulfill an important public purpose.\" McGrath v. R.I. Ret. Bd., 88\n\nF.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1996).          The public purpose requirement\n\nensures that the State is exercising its police power and not\n\ncatering to special interests.       See Energy Reserves, 459 U.S. at\n\n412.\n\n          As    we   have   said,    Maine's   legislature   passed   the\n\nrecoupment bar as a consumer- and dealer-protection measure to plug\n\na loophole in, and better effectuate the goals of, the state's\n\nretail-rate reimbursement law.        See supra Part II(B)(1).        That\n\nrationale brings the recoupment bar squarely within the category of\n\nremedies to generalized social or economic problems that constitute\n\nlegitimate     subjects     for   legislation,    notwithstanding     the\n\nimperatives of the Contracts Clause. See Energy Reserves, 459 U.S.\n\nat 411-12; see also Greenwood Trust Co. v. Massachusetts, 971 F.2d\n\n818, 828 (1st Cir. 1992) (describing \"consumer protection\" as a\n\n\"subject[] over which the states have traditionally exercised their\n\npolice powers\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f          The Alliance tries to parry this thrust by characterizing\n\nthe recoupment bar as a direct adjustment of manufacturers' and\n\ndealers' contractual rights.   That characterization elevates hope\n\nover reason.   In each of the cases on which the Alliance relies,\n\nthe reviewing court found no credible evidence of a legitimate\n\npublic purpose.   See Equip. Mfrs. Inst. v. Janklow, 300 F.3d 842,\n\n860-61 (8th Cir. 2002) (noting that \"both the State and the\n\n[defendant] concede that the Act's purpose is to level the playing\n\nfield between manufacturers and dealers\" and that there was no\n\nevidence of any significant public purpose); McDonald's Corp. v.\n\nNelson, 822 F. Supp. 597, 608-09 (S.D. Iowa 1993) (pointing out\n\nthat \"the articulated overall purpose of the Act is specifically to\n\nadjust the balance of power between the contracting parties\" and\n\nthat the Act implicated no broad societal interest). As we already\n\nhave explained, Maine's recoupment bar aspires to protect consumers\n\nas well as dealers.    Its purpose is much broader than a simple\n\nreallocation of existing contractual rights and, thus, that purpose\n\nqualifies as significant, legitimate, and public.       See Energy\n\nReserves, 459 U.S. at 411-12 & n.13.\n\n          When, as in this instance, the State is not a party to a\n\ncontract, courts ordinarily defer, within broad limits, to the\n\nlegislature's judgment about the reasonableness and necessity of a\n\nparticular measure. See id. at 412-13. Given the recoupment bar's\n\nevident purpose and the legislature's careful tailoring of it to\n\n\n                               -27-\n\ffit that purpose, we are constrained to follow that praxis here.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that the recoupment bar passes muster under the\n\nContracts Clause as to both pre-1975 and post-1975 franchise\n\nagreements.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n            Refined to bare essence, this appeal involves a policy\n\ndecision   by   the   Maine    legislature    to   prevent     motor   vehicle\n\nmanufacturers from imposing compulsory discounts on dealers who\n\nperform    warranty   repairs.       In     the    case   of   a   particular\n\nmanufacturer, that policy decision was negated by a warranty parity\n\nsurcharge added to the wholesale price of all vehicles sold to\n\nMaine   dealers.      The     legislature    countered    by   enacting    the\n\nrecoupment bar as a means of plugging the loophole and restoring\n\nthe structural integrity of its original policy.                The Alliance\n\nstrives to characterize this wholly Maine sequence of events as a\n\ndeprivation of an out-of-state competitive advantage, a cost-\n\nexporting scheme, or a price-tying mechanism.             To advance such a\n\ncharacterization is tantamount to saying that when a State resolves\n\nto prevent or correct a practice pursued by a manufacturer, which\n\nit reasonably has determined is contrary to its declared public\n\npolicy, it must force its own citizens rather than the errant\n\nmanufacturer to bear the cost.       The Constitution does not require\n\nso Kafkaesque a scenario.          Thus, we hold that the Alliance's\n\nCommerce Clause claims are without merit.\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\f            The Alliance's attempt to dress this case in the raiment\n\nof a Contracts Clause violation fares no better.      Maine heavily\n\nregulates franchise agreements between motor vehicle manufacturers\n\nand dealers, and the recoupment bar does not impermissibly impinge\n\nupon those agreements.\n\n            We need go no further.   The upshot is that the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in favor of the State was\n\nentirely correct.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -29-\n\f",

The controversy centers\n\non reimbursement for warranty work.              Thirty years ago, the state\n\nlegislature intervened in this tug-of-war to ensure equity and to\n\nprevent   collateral     damage     to    consumers.       More    recently,         the\n\nlegislature    amended     the    state    regulatory      scheme     to   prohibit\n\nmanufacturers from adding state-specific surcharges to wholesale\n\nmotor   vehicle   prices    in    order    to    recoup   the     costs    of    their\n\ncompliance with retail-rate reimbursement laws (such as the one\n\nthat the Maine legislature previously had enacted).\n\n           The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (the Alliance),\n\na   national   trade     association      whose      members    are   BMW       Group,\n\nDaimlerChrysler Corp., Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., Mazda\n\nNorth American Operations, Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc.,\n\nPorsche Cars North America, Inc., Toyota Motor North America, Inc.,\n\nand Volkswagen of America, Inc., challenged the recoupment bar as,\n\namong other things, a violation of both the Commerce and Contracts\n\nClauses of the United States Constitution.                  The district court\n\nrejected that binary challenge. After careful consideration of the\n\nclaims asserted, we conclude that the Alliance has not made out a\n\ngenuine   issue   of     material    fact       as   to   the   existence       of    a\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fconstitutional violation.             Consequently, we affirm the judgment\n\nbelow.\n\nI.

The   relationship\n\ntypically flows from a franchise agreement that, in addition to\n\nother provisions, requires the dealer to perform warranty repairs\n\n(without regard to whether the dealer sold the vehicle in question)\n\nand sets out explicit rules for how the manufacturer will reimburse\n\nthe dealer for that work.\n\n            Predictably, warranty reimbursement rates have been a\n\nsource of considerable friction.             The manufacturers have demanded\n\npreferential pricing of warranty repairs as a sort of volume\n\ndiscount.        The    dealers   have    argued   that   the     discounted   rate\n\nstructure not only reflects an excessive imbalance in market power,\n\nbut also forces them to increase the charges for non-warranty\n\nrepairs     (a    practice     that      effectively     requires      non-warranty\n\ncustomers to subsidize warranty work).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f           In    1975,    the   Maine    legislature     stepped    into   this\n\nimbroglio and began to regulate the price of warranty repairs\n\nwithin Maine's borders.          See 1975 Me. Laws 1788 (codified as\n\namended at Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1176) (mandating that\n\nmotor vehicle manufacturers compensate dealers \"adequately and\n\nfairly\" for warranty repairs).            In its most recent incarnation,\n\nenacted   in    1991,    this   provision     requires   that   manufacturers\n\nreimburse their Maine dealers for parts and labor at the retail\n\nrates customarily charged to non-warranty customers.               See Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1176.\n\n           In the usual motor vehicle franchise agreement, the\n\nmanufacturer reserves the right to set wholesale vehicle prices\n\nunilaterally.1    Exercising this right, Ford Motor Co. responded to\n\nMaine's amended version of section 1176 by adding a \"warranty\n\nparity surcharge\" to the wholesale price of motor vehicles sold in\n\nMaine.    This surcharge was designed to            recoup the incremental\n\nexpenses that resulted from retail-rate reimbursement.\n\n           Adjudicating a dealer challenge to the surcharge, we held\n\nthat nothing in Maine's motor vehicle franchise law prohibited it.\n\nSee Acadia Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195853\"><a href=\"/opinion/195853/acadia-v-ford-motor/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1055-57\n\n(1st Cir. 1995); see also Acadia Motors, Inc. v.

It declares in pertinent part that\n\"[p]rices, destination charges, and other terms of sale applicable\nto any Motor Vehicle may be changed at any time.\"\n\n                                        -4-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1228</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1231 (Me. 2002) (agreeing with this conclusion). In\n\n2002, Ford set its surcharge at $500 per vehicle and collected more\n\nthan $3,600,000 in additional revenue from Maine dealers. No other\n\nmanufacturer has, as yet, followed suit.\n\n            Once again, the Maine legislature intervened.                  After\n\nseveral    failed   attempts     at    crafting   a     solution,   it    passed\n\nLegislative Document 1294.       That document amended section 1176 by\n\nproviding in pertinent part that a motor vehicle manufacturer \"may\n\nnot otherwise recover its cost for reimbursing a [dealer] for parts\n\nand labor pursuant to this section.\"         L.D. 1294 § 10, 121st Leg.,\n\n1st Reg. Sess. (Me. 2003).             For simplicity's sake, we refer\n\nthroughout this opinion to this proviso — section 10 of L.D. 1294\n\n— as the \"recoupment bar.\"\n\n            On September 4, 2003, the Alliance filed suit in Maine's\n\nfederal    district    court,    challenging      the    recoupment      bar   as\n\nunconstitutional      under    the    Commerce,   Contracts,     and     Takings\n\nClauses.   It sought declaratory and injunctive relief and named as\n\ndefendants Dan A. Gwadosky, in his official capacity as Maine's\n\nSecretary of State, and G. Steven Rowe, in his official capacity as\n\nMaine's Attorney General (collectively, the State).\n\n            The   district    court    allowed    the    Maine   Auto    Dealers\n\nAssociation (MADA) a right to participate in the proceedings as an\n\namicus curiae.      It proceeded to deny the Alliance's motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction, finding that the Alliance had established\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fneither a likelihood of success on the merits nor irreparable harm.\n\nSee Alliance I, 304 F.

See Alliance I, 304 F.

Ford, a member of the\n\nAlliance,    has   suffered   concrete   pecuniary    injury   from   the\n\nrecoupment bar.     That injury is enough to ground the Alliance's\n\nstanding to sue even though the Alliance is not a member of the\n\nout-of-state class against whom the recoupment bar ostensibly\n\ndiscriminates.     See Bacchus Imps., 468 U.S. at 267 (holding that\n\nin-state liquor wholesalers had standing to challenge a Hawaii law\n\nthat allegedly burdened out-of-state liquor producers because the\n\nwholesalers suffered economic injury); see also Gen.

The Alliance, as the party challenging the\n\nvalidity of the recoupment bar, bears the burden of demonstrating\n\nthat the statute was animated by a discriminatory purpose.            See\n\nHughes v.

The purpose of a statute, like its meaning,\n\nmust be discerned from the statute as a whole.        Thus, context is a\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fcritically important interpretive tool.          See Edwards v.

The Alliance's strained attempt to piece together\n\nisolated bits of evidence ignores the larger context in which the\n\nrecoupment bar rests.        An assessment of that larger context makes\n\nmanifest the evident purpose of the recoupment bar.\n\n            The recoupment bar is fully integrated into Maine's motor\n\nvehicle franchise law.       See Me. Rev. Ann. Stat. tit. 10, §§ 1171 to\n\n1190-A.     It   comprises     one    sentence   of    one    section   of    that\n\nintricately constructed law — a section that has been on the books,\n\nin one form or another, for three decades.              See id. § 1176.        The\n\nrationale for the motor vehicle franchise law can be found within\n\nthe four corners of the statute itself: its purpose is \"to prevent\n\nfrauds, impositions and other abuses against residents and to\n\nprotect and preserve the economy, the investments of residents, the\n\npublic safety and the transportation system of the State.\"                   Id. §\n\n1182. Although the legislature adopted this policy in 1997 (before\n\nthe recoupment bar was even a gleam in its sponsors' eyes), its\n\nspirit permeates the statutory scheme and reflects the core purpose\n\nof section 1176 (which, of course, had been on the books for over\n\ntwenty years when the policy statement was adopted).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\f              Seen in this light, it is readily apparent that the\n\noverriding legislative objective behind section 1176 was to prevent\n\nan unfair price differential between warranty and non-warranty\n\nrepair work — a differential that the Maine legislature reasonably\n\nviewed as detrimental to consumers and motor vehicle dealers alike.\n\nFord's counter — the imposition of the warranty parity surcharge —\n\nthwarted this purpose and revealed the existence of a loophole in\n\nthe retail-rate reimbursement provision.         The recoupment bar was a\n\ndevice designed to plug that loophole and restore the structural\n\nintegrity of section 1176's warranty-reimbursement scheme.\n\n              Read in its entirety, the Retail Rate Commission Report\n\nconfirms this understanding.           In the opening sections of that\n\ndocument, the Commission reiterated the root purposes of section\n\n1176:   \"to     protect   retail    customers\"   and   \"to   protect     Maine\n\nautomobile dealers from the superior bargaining position of the\n\nnational manufacturers.\"           The Commission deemed \"[t]he current\n\nsurcharge practices of the manufacturers\" as \"contrary to the\n\nintent of the statute\" and premised its consideration of the cost-\n\nrecovery question on that assumption. Against this background, the\n\nCommission's occasional references to the surcharge's competitive\n\nimpact on Maine motor vehicle dealers are best understood as\n\nefforts    to    highlight   a   concrete    manifestation    of   the   harm\n\nattributable to the surcharge, not as statements of legislative\n\npurpose.\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f           The presence of other, less direct evidence reinforces\n\nthis view.      In this regard, the most salient fact is that the\n\nrecoupment bar is closely tailored to achieve the legislative\n\npurpose stated in section 1182.                    Cf. Hunt v. Wash.

See E. Ky. Res. v.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76\n\n(1984) (eschewing reliance on the comments of a single legislator\n\nand emphasizing that \"the authoritative source for finding the\n\nLegislature's intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill\").\n\n           None of this is to say that the legislature was blind to\n\nthe plight of Maine's motor vehicle dealers.      The record makes\n\n\n                                -17-\n\fpellucid, however, that if a potential discriminatory purpose was\n\nlurking in the background, that purpose was, at most, incidental to\n\nthe primary purposes that we have identified.          Incidental purpose,\n\nlike incidental effect, cannot suffice to trigger strict scrutiny\n\nunder the dormant Commerce Clause.          Cf. Pike, 397 U.S. at 142\n\n(adhering to a lower level of scrutiny when \"effects on interstate\n\ncommerce are only incidental\").\n\n           2.     Discriminatory      Effect.     We   turn      next   to   the\n\nAlliance's attempt to demonstrate that the recoupment bar has a\n\ndiscriminatory effect. The Alliance posits that the recoupment bar\n\nmanifests this pernicious effect in two ways: first, it eliminates\n\nthe competitive advantage of New Hampshire dealers vis-à-vis Maine\n\ndealers;   and    second,   it   exports    the    cost     of    retail-rate\n\nreimbursement nationally to out-of-state dealers. The problem here\n\nis   practical,   not   conceptual.     After   combing    the     record,   we\n\nconclude that the Alliance has not put forth sufficient evidence to\n\nsurvive summary judgment with respect to either such effect.\n\n           To support its assertion that the recoupment bar has an\n\nadvantage-stripping effect on New Hampshire dealers, the Alliance\n\nrelies on one central piece of evidence — a stipulation that\n\n\"[t]here is some competition between motor vehicle dealers in Maine\n\nand motor vehicle dealers in other states.\"               That stipulation,\n\nhowever, bears only a tangential relationship to the Alliance's\n\ntheories of discriminatory effect.        While the Alliance visualizes\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthe recoupment bar as \"an effort to stem the tide of customers\n\ndeciding to purchase motor vehicles in New Hampshire rather than\n\nMaine,\" Appellant's Br. at 25,5 the stipulation supplies no proof\n\nof a cross-border \"tide.\"                  There is likewise no evidence of how\n\nFord's implementation of a warranty parity surcharge may (or may\n\nnot)       have       affected   interstate       competition,   nor       is   there   any\n\nevidence of the recoupment bar's supposed interference with the\n\ncompetitive process.              For all that the record discloses, we could\n\njust as easily surmise that any success that New Hampshire dealers\n\nmay have had in luring Maine customers was premised on, say, better\n\nservice,          a    willingness   to     accept   lower    profit   margins,         more\n\nconvenient locations, or New Hampshire's eschewal of a general\n\nstatewide sales tax.\n\n                  To    be   sure,   the    Alliance      endeavors   to    bolster     the\n\nstipulation            by    reiterating    the    same    amalgam    of    Retail      Rate\n\nCommission and lobbyist statements on which it relied in its\n\nassertion of discriminatory purpose. For good measure, it adds the\n\nobservation of a Ford official that state-specific pricing actions\n\n\"may put [dealers] at a cost disadvantage . . . vis-[à]-vis dealers\n\nin bordering states.\" These augmentations add nothing of substance\n\nto the Alliance's claim.               At best, they reflect generalizations,\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      All citations to the appellant's brief refer to the version\nfiled under seal.\n\n                                             -19-\n\funsupported by either statistical analysis or concrete facts, about\n\nthe competitive position of Maine dealers.6\n\n          As to its contention that the recoupment bar \"effectively\n\nrequire[s]    that   all   dealers    nationwide   fund   the   additional\n\nmanufacturer payments associated with warranty repairs in Maine,\"\n\nAppellant's Br. at 35, the Alliance once again relies on a single\n\npiece of evidence: this time, the insistence of a General Motors'\n\nplenipotentiary that her company cannot absorb costs, but, as a\n\ncommercial entity, must account for them somehow (such as through\n\nnational price adjustments).7        But this statement is a waif in the\n\nwilderness.   The Alliance adduced no evidence of national vehicle\n\npricing, and nothing in the record illuminates wholesale vehicle\n\n\n     6\n      In their briefs and at oral argument, the parties devoted\nmuch time and energy to New Hampshire's retail-rate reimbursement\nlaw. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 357-C:5(II)(b). Although that statute\nis similar to Maine's retail-rate reimbursement law, manufacturers\nhave continued to pay for warranty work at discounted rates.\nAgainst this background, the State argued that New Hampshire's\nrequirement is mandatory and that the Alliance, by flouting that\nrequirement, improperly fabricated the competitive advantage that\nit claims Maine law destroys. The Alliance demurs; it interprets\nNew Hampshire's statute as optional, and insists that New Hampshire\ndealers are simply not submitting claims for retail rates. We need\nnot resolve these conflicting accounts because the Alliance has not\npresented enough evidence of discriminatory effect to warrant\nfurther inquiry into the requirements of New Hampshire law.\n     7\n      It seems odd to rely on General Motors for concrete evidence\nof the recoupment bar's effects, given that General Motors has\nnever imposed a warranty parity surcharge in Maine. To compound\nthe oddity, the record contains a statement from a representative\nof Ford that cost absorption is in fact an option and, moreover, an\noption to which Ford has resorted in the past.      Because of the\noverall paucity of proof, however, we need not explore these\ncuriosities.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fprices in Maine, New Hampshire, or elsewhere. By like token, there\n\nis not a shred of evidence that speaks reliably to trends in\n\npricing       after   Maine's   enactment      of    either   its     retail-rate\n\nreimbursement law or the recoupment bar. Finally, the record fails\n\nto provide a definitive statement of retail-rate reimbursement\n\ncosts incurred by manufacturers in Maine for which they allegedly\n\nmust account.\n\n               The proponent of a dormant Commerce Clause claim bears\n\nthe burden of proof as to discrimination.             See Hughes, 441 U.S. at\n\n336.       To block summary judgment, the party having the burden of\n\nproof on a critical issue must present evidence on that issue that\n\nis \"significantly probative,\" not \"merely colorable.\" Cadle Co. v.\n\nHayes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197442\"><a href=\"/opinion/197442/cadle-v-hayes/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 960 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/jack-anderson-v-liberty-lobby-inc-and-willis-a-carto/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 249-50 (1986)).

Extraterritorial         Reach.        The   Alliance's      final\n\nCommerce    Clause      claim      is   that     the    recoupment       bar    has    an\n\nexterritorial reach that produces a constitutional infirmity. This\n\nclaim   rests    on    the    premise     that   the    recoupment       bar    has   the\n\nimpermissible \"practical effect of tying the wholesale price of\n\nmotor vehicles in Maine to the wholesale price of identical motor\n\nvehicles outside of Maine\" by making \"the wholesale price of motor\n\nvehicles in Maine the minimum wholesale price in the 49 other\n\nstates.\" Appellant's Br. at 39-40. Despite this bold declaration,\n\nthe Alliance adduced no probative evidence of price-tying below.\n\nOn appeal, it rehashes yet again the same evidence that it offered\n\nin connection with discriminatory purpose and adds one weapon to\n\nits armamentarium — the suggestion of a Commission member that\n\nMaine \"should move into law that manufacturers may not charge a\n\ndifferent price to Maine dealers.\"\n\n            These statements (all of which were made well before the\n\nlegislature acted) tell us nothing about either the recoupment\n\nbar's reach or its actual effect on national pricing. Furthermore,\n\nthe record reflects, and the Alliance itself acknowledges, that\n\nmanufacturers     add    state-specific          surcharges        to   motor   vehicle\n\nwholesale   prices      for    a   wide    variety      of    reasons     (e.g.,      some\n\nmanufacturers impose a California-specific surcharge to recover\n\n\n                                          -22-\n\fcosts associated with that state's environmental regulations).\n\nThis potential still exists for motor vehicles sold in Maine;\n\nnothing   in   Maine        law   prevents    automobile      manufacturers   from\n\nadjusting their wholesale prices based on transportation costs,\n\nlabor    costs,   or    the       like.     There   is    only   one    limitation:\n\nmanufacturers     cannot          use     surcharges     to   recover    warranty-\n\nreimbursement costs (and, thus, to frustrate the purpose of Maine's\n\nretail-rate reimbursement statute).                 Like the elephant in the\n\nparlor, the implications of this conclusion are too obvious to\n\nignore.    The recoupment bar does not transform Maine prices into\n\nnational minimum prices because automobile manufacturers retain the\n\nability to adjust those prices for any reason save one.\n\n            On this sparse record, our extraterritorial-reach inquiry\n\nis short and to the point.              The inference that the Alliance would\n\nhave us draw is simply too much of a stretch.                    In view of this\n\nshortcoming and because the Alliance has not provided any other,\n\nmore reliable proof of the price-tying allegedly associated with\n\nthe recoupment bar, the lower court did not err in entering summary\n\njudgment on the extraterritorial reach claim.                 See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c).    Consequently, there is no cause to engage the Alliance's\n\nlegal theory.\n\n                       C.    The Contracts Clause Claim.\n\n            The Alliance also attacks the recoupment bar on a second\n\nfront.     It argues that Maine, in derogation of the Contracts\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\fClause, has trespassed on manufacturers' franchise agreements by\n\neliminating components of the manufacturers' pricing discretion.\n\n             The Contracts Clause declares that: \"No State shall . .\n\n. pass any . . .

The first\n\ntwo of these three factors are often easily satisfied, and this\n\ncase falls into that pattern: automobile manufacturers typically\n\nhave franchise agreements with dealers that reserve the right to\n\nset wholesale motor vehicle prices unilaterally, see supra note 1,\n\nand the recoupment bar now restricts their ability to exercise that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fright.        The question of substantial impairment is, therefore,\n\ndispositive.\n\n              The parties' reasonable expectations are central to the\n\nissue    of    substantiality.        In    that    regard,      it    is   especially\n\nimportant whether or not the parties have been operating in a\n\nregulated industry.

Maine has heavily regulated the\n\nmanufacturer-dealer          franchise     relationship,        including      warranty\n\nreimbursement       rates,    since   1975.        See   1975    Me.

The\n\nrecoupment bar — a necessary means to effectuate the State's\n\nwarranty reimbursement policy — was a foreseeable addition to that\n\nregulatory regime.            It was, therefore, permissible under the\n\nContracts Clause.        After all, if the Contracts Clause allows a\n\nState to dictate the price of warranty repairs in the first\n\ninstance,      it   perforce    allows     the   State    to     require     that   the\n\nmanufacturer, rather than the dealer or the consumer, absorb the\n\ntrue cost of those repairs.

See Energy Reserves, 459 U.S. at\n\n412.\n\n          As    we   have   said,    Maine's   legislature   passed   the\n\nrecoupment bar as a consumer- and dealer-protection measure to plug\n\na loophole in, and better effectuate the goals of, the state's\n\nretail-rate reimbursement law.        See supra Part II(B)(1).        That\n\nrationale brings the recoupment bar squarely within the category of\n\nremedies to generalized social or economic problems that constitute\n\nlegitimate     subjects     for   legislation,    notwithstanding     the\n\nimperatives of the Contracts Clause.

That characterization elevates hope\n\nover reason.   In each of the cases on which the Alliance relies,\n\nthe reviewing court found no credible evidence of a legitimate\n\npublic purpose.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608-09 (S.D. Iowa 1993) (pointing out\n\nthat \"the articulated overall purpose of the Act is specifically to\n\nadjust the balance of power between the contracting parties\" and\n\nthat the Act implicated no broad societal interest). As we already\n\nhave explained, Maine's recoupment bar aspires to protect consumers\n\nas well as dealers.    Its purpose is much broader than a simple\n\nreallocation of existing contractual rights and, thus, that purpose\n\nqualifies as significant, legitimate, and public.       See Energy\n\nReserves, 459 U.S. at 411-12 & n.13.\n\n          When, as in this instance, the State is not a party to a\n\ncontract, courts ordinarily defer, within broad limits, to the\n\nlegislature's judgment about the reasonableness and necessity of a\n\nparticular measure. See id. at 412-13. Given the recoupment bar's\n\nevident purpose and the legislature's careful tailoring of it to\n\n\n                               -27-\n\ffit that purpose, we are constrained to follow that praxis here.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that the recoupment bar passes muster under the\n\nContracts Clause as to both pre-1975 and post-1975 franchise\n\nagreements.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n            Refined to bare essence, this appeal involves a policy\n\ndecision   by   the   Maine    legislature    to   prevent     motor   vehicle\n\nmanufacturers from imposing compulsory discounts on dealers who\n\nperform    warranty   repairs.       In     the    case   of   a   particular\n\nmanufacturer, that policy decision was negated by a warranty parity\n\nsurcharge added to the wholesale price of all vehicles sold to\n\nMaine   dealers.      The     legislature    countered    by   enacting    the\n\nrecoupment bar as a means of plugging the loophole and restoring\n\nthe structural integrity of its original policy.                The Alliance\n\nstrives to characterize this wholly Maine sequence of events as a\n\ndeprivation of an out-of-state competitive advantage, a cost-\n\nexporting scheme, or a price-tying mechanism.             To advance such a\n\ncharacterization is tantamount to saying that when a State resolves\n\nto prevent or correct a practice pursued by a manufacturer, which\n\nit reasonably has determined is contrary to its declared public\n\npolicy, it must force its own citizens rather than the errant\n\nmanufacturer to bear the cost.       The Constitution does not require\n\nso Kafkaesque a scenario.          Thus, we hold that the Alliance's\n\nCommerce Clause claims are without merit.\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\f            The Alliance's attempt to dress this case in the raiment\n\nof a Contracts Clause violation fares no better.      Maine heavily\n\nregulates franchise agreements between motor vehicle manufacturers\n\nand dealers, and the recoupment bar does not impermissibly impinge\n\nupon those agreements.\n\n            We need go no further.   The upshot is that the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in favor of the State was\n\nentirely correct.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -29-\n\f</pre>",
