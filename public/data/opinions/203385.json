Plaintiff AGA Fishing\n\nGroup Limited (“AGA”) was forced to sell the Georgie J, a scallop\n\nfishing vessel, and its scallop license to settle claims against\n\nAGA after a crewman suffered debilitating injuries aboard the\n\nvessel and recovered a substantial award under the Jones Act.              AGA\n\nwas insured through Defendant Flagship Group, Limited (“Flagship”),\n\nbut the seaman’s award far exceeded the Protection & Indemnity (“P\n\n& I”) coverage in AGA’s policy, which was sold to AGA by Flagship.\n\nAGA sued Flagship and Defendant Brown & Brown, Inc., Flagship’s\n\nparent   company,   contending   that   Flagship    owed   it   a   duty   to\n\nrecommend an adequate level of P & I coverage and breached that\n\nduty when it did not so recommend.         The district court granted\n\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment on all claims. Because AGA\n\npresents no facts evincing a duty on Defendants’ part to ensure\n\nthat AGA was adequately covered, we affirm.1\n\n                           I.    Background\n\n           Because AGA appeals from a grant of summary judgment, in\n\nreciting the facts, we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of\n\nAGA, the non-moving party.       See Ramos-Santiago v. United Parcel\n\n\n     1\n          AGA also contends that Flagship breached its contract\nwith AGA by failing adequately to evaluate AGA’s risk. Because AGA\nraises this argument for the first time on appeal, we decline to\nconsider it. See United States v. Taylor, 511 F.3d 87, 91 (1st\nCir. 2007) (“Absent extraordinary circumstances, ‘[i]t is a bedrock\nrule that when a party has not presented an argument to the\ndistrict court, [he] may not unveil it in the court of appeals.’”)\n(alterations in original) (quoting United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d\n27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n                                  -2-\n\fServ., 524 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir. 2008).              George Jones (“Jones”)\n\nstarted scallop fishing in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in the early\n\n1960s, when he was fifteen years old.             In 1987, he and his wife,\n\nAntonette Jones, formed AGA and purchased a scallop boat, the\n\nVictor, and an accompanying scallop license.                  Under the previous\n\nowner, the Victor carried $1,000,000 in P & I insurance through\n\nNeptune Mutual.        After acquiring the vessel, AGA decided to stay\n\nwith the same insurance company and agent, Ronald Walsh (“Walsh”),\n\nand continue the same level of coverage.\n\n              Some time later, AGA discontinued its insurance policy\n\nwith Neptune Mutual and purchased a policy from Mariners Insurance.\n\nAGA continued the same level of P & I coverage after the switch.\n\nJones assumed that the new agent would tell him if he needed more\n\ncoverage.      In the late 1990s, Jones discovered that his original\n\ninsurance agent, Walsh, had left Neptune Insurance and was now\n\nworking for Flagship.         On its website, Flagship advertised itself\n\nas   having    “the    expertise      necessary   to   offer    the   appropriate\n\ninsurance services for the maritime industry” and claimed to\n\n“systematically and comprehensively examine [its clients’] maritime\n\nexposures.”       The Joneses, however, never viewed the website.\n\nRather,   Jones       liked   Walsh    and   trusted   him.      Their   personal\n\nrelationship and the fact that Walsh quoted a lower premium for the\n\nsame coverage precipitated AGA’s move from Mariners Insurance to\n\nFlagship in 1999.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f          AGA kept the same level of P & I coverage on the vessel\n\nafter moving its insurance business to Flagship, again assuming\n\nthat its agent, now Walsh, would recommend additional coverage, if\n\nnecessary.    According to Walsh, the Joneses “didn’t understand\n\ninsurance” and needed a lot of guidance due to their “naive[te].”\n\nThe Joneses were not highly educated.         Jones left school after the\n\nsixth grade and Antonette Jones did not complete high school,\n\nalthough she received a GED years later.         Although Walsh testified\n\nthat the Joneses required more assistance than his other clients,\n\nWalsh and the Joneses never discussed the amount of P & I coverage\n\non the vessel or whether or not the coverage was sufficient.            The\n\npolicy was renewed annually at the same level of coverage.2\n\n          In 2000, Walsh told Jones that he planned to leave\n\nFlagship and that Flagship was closing its Massachusetts office.\n\nJones asked Walsh how to keep the Georgie J covered.                   Walsh\n\nrecommended   that   AGA   stay   with    Flagship.   AGA   remained   with\n\nFlagship, and Flagship transferred the AGA account to agent John\n\nDevnew (“Devnew”).    Jones was concerned that Devnew would not be\n\nable to give him the level of assistance he desired because he was\n\nbased in Virginia. Devnew reassured Jones that he would “take care\n\nof them.” Devnew considered Jones “simple and unsophisticated” and\n\nknew that the Joneses’ entire fortune was wrapped up in AGA.            Yet\n\n\n     2\n          Also during this time, the Joneses’ son was killed in an\nunrelated incident and the Joneses renamed the Victor the Georgie\nJ in his honor.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fduring   the   time   Devnew   worked      on    the   AGA       account,   he   never\n\ndiscussed P & I coverage levels for the Georgie J with the Joneses\n\nand never recommended increasing the amount of P & I coverage on\n\nthe Georgie J.\n\n            In or around 2001, New Bedford experienced a boom in the\n\nscallop fishing industry. Gross profits per fishing trip increased\n\ndramatically, which translated into significant pay increases for\n\ncrewmen working aboard the scallop vessels.                  Compensation levels\n\nfor individual crew members reached and then exceeded $100,000 a\n\nyear.    The Georgie J and other scallop vessels carried a five- to\n\nseven-member crew.        As a result, vessels that worked out of New\n\nBedford, including those insured by Flagship, commonly carried\n\n$5,000,000 P & I coverage.          It would have cost AGA approximately\n\n$5,000 annually to increase P & I coverage for the Georgie J from\n\n$1,000,000 to $5,000,000.       AGA avers that it would have paid the\n\nhigher premium had Devnew recommended the higher level of coverage.\n\n            During    a   fishing   trip    in    2003,      a    crewman   suffered\n\ndebilitating injuries while working aboard the Georgie J and\n\nsubsequently sued AGA.         The $1,000,000 P & I coverage on the\n\nGeorgie J was grossly insufficient to cover the damages awarded to\n\nthe crewman.    The U.S. Marshal seized the Georgie J and its scallop\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\flicense and sold it at auction in partial satisfaction of the\n\ncrewman’s judgment.3\n\n            AGA sued Flagship and Brown & Brown, Inc., its parent\n\ncompany.     AGA claimed that Flagship breached its duty of care\n\nproperly to advise AGA with regard to coverage needed for the\n\nGeorgie J (Count I).     AGA also alleged negligent misrepresentation\n\n(Count     II),   intentional   misrepresentation    (Count   III),   and\n\nviolations of Massachusetts’ unfair or deceptive trade practice\n\nlaw, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A §§ 2(a), 11 (Counts IV and V).           AGA\n\nfurther alleged that Brown & Brown was vicariously liable for\n\ndamages caused by Flagship (Count VI) and that Brown & Brown\n\nnegligently failed to supervise Flagship (Count VII).\n\n            Defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district\n\ncourt granted as to all claims.          AGA timely appealed.4   We have\n\njurisdiction over the final judgment under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.          In\n\nthis diversity of citizenship case, we apply Massachusetts law,\n\nwhich the parties implicitly agree governs.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          The Georgie J and the license together sold for\n$1,700,000. The proceeds from the sale first went to pay off the\nmortgage, and the remainder went to the injured crewman.\n\n     4\n          Nowhere in its briefs in this court does AGA challenge\nthe district court’s grant of summary judgment on Counts II through\nVII.   We therefore consider those arguments waived and do not\naddress those counts.\n\n                                   -6-\n\f                             II.   Discussion\n\n             We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.   Franceschi v. U.S. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 514 F.3d 81,\n\n84 (1st Cir. 2008).       Summary judgment “should be rendered if the\n\npleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any\n\naffidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n\nfact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.”   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n             “There is no general duty of an insurance agent to ensure\n\nthat the insurance policies procured by him provide coverage that\n\nis adequate for the needs of the insured.”           Martinonis v. Utica\n\nNat’l Ins. Group, 840 N.E.2d 994, 996 (Mass. App. Ct. 2006).           Such\n\na duty only arises under “special circumstances of assertion,\n\nrepresentation and reliance.”        Baldwin Crane & Equip. Corp. v.\n\nRiley & Rielly Ins. Agency, Inc., 687 N.E.2d 1267, 1269 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 1997) (quoting Rapp v. Lester L. Burdick, Inc., 146 N.E.2d 368,\n\n371 (Mass. 1957)); see also Martinonis, 840 N.E.2d at 996 (“[I]n an\n\naction against the agent for negligence, the insured may show that\n\nspecial circumstances prevailed that gave rise to a duty on the\n\npart of the agent to ensure that adequate insurance was obtained.”)\n\n(citing Baldwin Crane, 687 N.E.2d at 1269).\n\n             AGA alleges special circumstances due to the Joneses’\n\nlack    of   education,   Walsh    and    Devnew’s   knowledge   of   their\n\n“naive[te]” and “lack of sophistication,” and testimony from the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fJoneses that they relied completely on Walsh and Devnew to tell\n\nthem how much coverage they needed for the Georgie J.                   AGA also\n\npoints to its long-term relationship with Walsh and his testimony\n\nthat he was aware of the Joneses’ reliance on him.            Additionally,\n\nFlagship presented itself to the public as an expert in the field\n\nof maritime insurance and, through its website, attested that it\n\n“systematically    and     comprehensively”      examined    its        clients’\n\npotential liabilities.\n\n          Courts    have        considered   length    of   relationship       a\n\nsignificant   factor     when    determining   the    existence    of    special\n\ncircumstances.    See McCue v. Prudential Ins. Co., 358 N.E.2d 799,\n\n801 (Mass. 1976) (determining that a jury could find special\n\ncircumstances where insurance agents visited the plaintiffs monthly\n\nfor twenty-eight years); Martinonis, 840 N.E.2d at 996 (noting the\n\nplaintiff’s “long relationship” with her agent).                  An insurer’s\n\npublic representations of expertise or public promises to provide\n\nspecialized counseling, like those found on Flagship’s website,\n\ncould also support, based on other facts as well, a finding of\n\nspecial circumstances.      Baldwin Crane, 687 N.E.2d at 1269-70 (“‘An\n\nexpanded agency agreement, arrangement or relationship, sufficient\n\nto require a greater duty from the agent than the general duty,\n\ngenerally exists when the agent holds himself out as an insurance\n\nspecialist, consultant or counselor . . . .’”) (quoting Sandbulte\n\nv. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 343 N.W.2d 457, 464 (Iowa 1984)).\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f              AGA, however, has not presented facts sufficient to\n\nsupport a finding of special circumstances because neither Walsh\n\nnor Devnew made any representation or assertion that coverage was\n\nsufficient or that AGA could rely on them to recommend sufficient\n\ncoverage.      A plaintiff must be able to show a specific assertion\n\nand    subsequent    reliance    to     establish   special     circumstances.\n\nAssertions can come in the form of “frequent recommendations,” GE\n\nHFS Holdings, Inc. v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 520 F. Supp. 2d\n\n231, 237 (D. Mass. 2007), a recommendation of coverage in a\n\nparticular amount, Bicknell, Inc. v. Havlin, 402 N.E.2d 116, 119\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1980), or assurances that coverage is sufficient,\n\nMartinonis, 840 N.E.2d at 996.\n\n              No agent made any such recommendation or representation\n\nto AGA. Jones testified that Walsh and Devnew never discussed with\n\nhim the amount of P & I coverage the Georgie J had or should have\n\nhad.   No agent even recommended the $1,000,000 P & I coverage.            AGA\n\nmaintained the $1,000,000 P & I coverage from 1987 to 2003 simply\n\nbecause that was the level of coverage in place when AGA first\n\npurchased the vessel.\n\n              AGA avers that it relied on Walsh and Devnew to recommend\n\nsufficient coverage for the Georgie J and that the agents knew that\n\nthey    had    to   do   so   because    the   Joneses   were    “naive”   and\n\n“unsophisticated.”        The Joneses, however, never asked Walsh or\n\nDevnew if the P & I coverage on the Georgie J was sufficient, never\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fasked if they would be told if coverage became insufficient, and\n\nneither Walsh nor Devnew represented that the Joneses would be\n\ninformed if at some point the coverage became insufficient.\n\n               While Walsh testified that the Joneses relied on him\n\ngenerally, special circumstances exist only where reliance is based\n\non an assertion or representation.            Additionally, AGA did not rely\n\non Flagship’s public representations of expertise.               The Joneses\n\nnever saw Flagship’s website; they chose Flagship because of price\n\nand their relationship with Walsh.\n\n              Because AGA has adduced no facts showing the existence of\n\nspecial circumstances that created a duty of care, the district\n\ncourt   did    not   err   in   granting   summary   judgment   in   favor   of\n\nDefendants on Count I of AGA’s complaint.\n\n                                III.   Conclusion\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Defendants is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f",

Background</h2>\n<p>Because AGA appeals from a grant of summary judgment, in reciting the facts, we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of AGA, the non-moving party. <i>See </i><i>Ramos-Santiago v. United Parcel Serv.,</i> 524 F.3d 120, 122 (1st Cir.2008). George Jones (\"Jones\") started scallop fishing in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in the early 1960s, when he was fifteen years old.

According to Walsh, the Joneses \"didn't understand insurance\" and needed a lot of guidance due to their \"naive[te].\" The Joneses were not highly educated.

Although Walsh testified that the Joneses required more assistance than his other clients, Walsh and the Joneses never discussed the amount of P &amp; I coverage on the vessel or whether or not the coverage was sufficient. The policy was renewed annually at the same level of coverage.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In 2000, Walsh told Jones that he planned to leave Flagship and that Flagship was closing its Massachusetts office. Jones asked Walsh how to keep the <i>Georgie J</i> covered. Walsh recommended that AGA stay with Flagship. AGA remained with Flagship, and Flagship transferred the AGA account to agent John Devnew (\"Devnew\"). Jones was concerned that Devnew would not be able to give him the level of assistance he desired because he was based in Virginia. Devnew reassured Jones that he would \"take care of them.\" Devnew considered Jones \"simple and unsophisticated\" and knew that the Joneses' entire fortune was wrapped up in AGA. Yet during the time Devnew worked on the AGA account, he never discussed P &amp; I coverage levels for the <i>Georgie J</i> with the Joneses and never recommended increasing the amount of P &amp; I coverage on the <i>Georgie J.</i></p>\n<p>In or around 2001, New Bedford experienced a boom in the scallop fishing industry.

As a result, vessels that worked out of New Bedford, including those insured by Flagship, commonly carried $5,000,000 P &amp; I coverage.

Summary judgment \"should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p>\"There is no general duty of an insurance agent to ensure that the insurance policies procured by him provide coverage that is adequate for the needs of the insured.\" <i>Martinonis v. Utica Nat'l Ins. Group,</i> 65 Mass.App.Ct. 418, 840 N.E.2d 994, 996 (Mass.App.Ct.2006). Such a duty only arises under \"special circumstances of assertion, representation and reliance.\" <i>Baldwin Crane &amp; Equip. Corp. v. Riley &amp; Rielly Ins. Agency, Inc.,</i> 44 Mass.App.Ct. 29, 687 N.E.2d 1267, 1269 (Mass.App.Ct. 1997) (quoting <i>Rapp v. Lester L. Burdick, Inc.,</i> 336 Mass. 438, 146 N.E.2d 368, 371 (Mass.1957)); <i>see also </i><i>Martinonis,</i> 840 N.E.2d at 996 (\"[I]n an action against the agent for negligence, the insured may show that special circumstances prevailed that gave rise to a duty on the part of the agent to ensure that adequate insurance was obtained.\") (citing <i>Baldwin Crane,</i> 687 N.E.2d at 1269).</p>\n<p>AGA alleges special circumstances due to the Joneses' lack of education, Walsh and Devnew's knowledge of their \"naive[te]\" and \"lack of sophistication,\" and testimony from the Joneses that they relied completely on Walsh and Devnew to tell them how much coverage they needed for the <i>Georgie J.</i> AGA also points to its long-term relationship with Walsh and his testimony that he was aware of the Joneses' reliance on him. Additionally, Flagship presented itself to the public as an expert in the field of maritime insurance and, through its website, attested that it \"systematically and comprehensively\" examined its clients' potential liabilities.</p>\n<p>Courts have considered length of relationship a significant factor when determining the existence of special circumstances. <i>See </i><i>McCue v. Prudential Ins. Co.,</i> 371 Mass. 659, 358 N.E.2d 799, 801 (Mass.1976) (determining that a jury could find special circumstances where insurance <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> agents visited the plaintiffs monthly for twenty-eight years); <i>Martinonis,</i> 840 N.E.2d at 996 (noting the plaintiff's \"long relationship\" with her agent). An insurer's public representations of expertise or public promises to provide specialized counseling, like those found on Flagship's website, could also support, based on other facts as well, a finding of special circumstances. <i>Baldwin Crane,</i> 687 N.E.2d at 1269-70 (\"`An expanded agency agreement, arrangement or relationship, sufficient to require a greater duty from the agent than the general duty, generally exists when the agent holds himself out as an insurance specialist, consultant or counselor....'\") (quoting <i>Sandbulte v. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 343 N.W.2d 457, 464 (Iowa 1984)).</p>\n<p>AGA, however, has not presented facts sufficient to support a finding of special circumstances because neither Walsh nor Devnew made any representation or assertion that coverage was sufficient or that AGA could rely on them to recommend sufficient coverage. A plaintiff must be able to show a specific assertion and subsequent reliance to establish special circumstances. Assertions can come in the form of \"frequent recommendations,\" <i>GE HFS Holdings, Inc. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 520 F.Supp.2d 231, 237 (D.Mass. 2007), a recommendation of coverage in a particular amount, <i>Bicknell, Inc. v. Havlin,</i> 9 Mass.App.Ct. 497, 402 N.E.2d 116, 119 (Mass.App.Ct.1980), or assurances that coverage is sufficient, <i>Martinonis,</i> 840 N.E.2d at 996.</p>\n<p>No agent made any such recommendation or representation to AGA. Jones testified that Walsh and Devnew never discussed with him the amount of P &amp; I coverage the <i>Georgie J</i> had or should have had. No agent even recommended the $1,000,000 P &amp; I coverage. AGA maintained the $1,000,000 P &amp; I coverage from 1987 to 2003 simply because that was the level of coverage in place when AGA first purchased the vessel.</p>\n<p>AGA avers that it relied on Walsh and Devnew to recommend sufficient coverage for the <i>Georgie J</i> and that the agents knew that they had to do so because the Joneses were \"naive\" and \"unsophisticated.\" The Joneses, however, never asked Walsh or Devnew if the P &amp; I coverage on the <i>Georgie J</i> was sufficient, never asked if they would be told if coverage became insufficient, and neither Walsh nor Devnew represented that the Joneses would be informed if at some point the coverage became insufficient.</p>\n<p>While Walsh testified that the Joneses relied on him generally, special circumstances exist only where reliance is based on an assertion or representation. Additionally, AGA did not rely on Flagship's public representations of expertise. The Joneses never saw Flagship's website; they chose Flagship because of price and their relationship with Walsh.</p>\n<p>Because AGA has adduced no facts showing the existence of special circumstances that created a duty of care, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Count I of AGA's complaint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  AGA also contends that Flagship breached its contract with AGA by failing adequately to evaluate AGA's risk.

AGA was insured through Defendant Flagship Group, Limited (\"Flagship\"), but the seaman's award far exceeded the Protection &amp; Indemnity (\"P &amp; I\") coverage in AGA's policy, which was sold to AGA by Flagship. AGA sued Flagship and Defendant Brown &amp; Brown, Inc., Flagship's parent company, contending that Flagship owed it a duty to recommend an adequate level of P &amp; I coverage and breached that duty when it did not so recommend. The district court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment on all claims. Because AGA presents no facts evincing a duty on Defendants' part to ensure that AGA was adequately covered, we affirm.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>Because AGA appeals from a grant of summary judgment, in reciting the facts, we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of AGA, the non-moving party. <i>See </i><i>Ramos-Santiago v. United Parcel Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></span>, 122 (1st Cir.2008). George Jones (\"Jones\") started scallop fishing in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in the early 1960s, when he was fifteen years old. In 1987, he and his wife, Antonette Jones, formed AGA and purchased a scallop boat, the <i>Victor,</i> and an accompanying scallop license. Under the previous owner, the <i>Victor</i> carried $1,000,000 in P &amp; I insurance through Neptune Mutual. After acquiring the vessel, AGA decided to stay with the same insurance company and agent, Ronald Walsh (\"Walsh\"), and continue the same level of coverage.</p>\n<p>Some time later, AGA discontinued its insurance policy with Neptune Mutual and purchased a policy from Mariners Insurance. AGA continued the same level of P &amp; I coverage after the switch. Jones assumed that the new agent would tell him if he needed more coverage. In the late 1990s, Jones discovered that his original insurance agent, Walsh, had left Neptune <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> Insurance and was now working for Flagship. On its website, Flagship advertised itself as having \"the expertise necessary to offer the appropriate insurance services for the maritime industry\" and claimed to \"systematically and comprehensively examine [its clients'] maritime exposures.\" The Joneses, however, never viewed the website. Rather, Jones liked Walsh and trusted him. Their personal relationship and the fact that Walsh quoted a lower premium for the same coverage precipitated AGA's move from Mariners Insurance to Flagship in 1999.</p>\n<p>AGA kept the same level of P &amp; I coverage on the vessel after moving its insurance business to Flagship, again assuming that its agent, now Walsh, would recommend additional coverage, if necessary. According to Walsh, the Joneses \"didn't understand insurance\" and needed a lot of guidance due to their \"naive[te].\" The Joneses were not highly educated. Jones left school after the sixth grade and Antonette Jones did not complete high school, although she received a GED years later. Although Walsh testified that the Joneses required more assistance than his other clients, Walsh and the Joneses never discussed the amount of P &amp; I coverage on the vessel or whether or not the coverage was sufficient. The policy was renewed annually at the same level of coverage.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In 2000, Walsh told Jones that he planned to leave Flagship and that Flagship was closing its Massachusetts office. Jones asked Walsh how to keep the <i>Georgie J</i> covered. Walsh recommended that AGA stay with Flagship. AGA remained with Flagship, and Flagship transferred the AGA account to agent John Devnew (\"Devnew\"). Jones was concerned that Devnew would not be able to give him the level of assistance he desired because he was based in Virginia. Devnew reassured Jones that he would \"take care of them.\" Devnew considered Jones \"simple and unsophisticated\" and knew that the Joneses' entire fortune was wrapped up in AGA. Yet during the time Devnew worked on the AGA account, he never discussed P &amp; I coverage levels for the <i>Georgie J</i> with the Joneses and never recommended increasing the amount of P &amp; I coverage on the <i>Georgie J.</i></p>\n<p>In or around 2001, New Bedford experienced a boom in the scallop fishing industry. Gross profits per fishing trip increased dramatically, which translated into significant pay increases for crewmen working aboard the scallop vessels. Compensation levels for individual crew members reached and then exceeded $100,000 a year. The <i>Georgie J</i> and other scallop vessels carried a five-to seven-member crew. As a result, vessels that worked out of New Bedford, including those insured by Flagship, commonly carried $5,000,000 P &amp; I coverage. It would have cost AGA approximately $5,000 annually to increase P &amp; I coverage for the <i>Georgie J</i> from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. AGA avers that it would have paid the higher premium had Devnew recommended the higher level of coverage.</p>\n<p>During a fishing trip in 2003, a crewman suffered debilitating injuries while working aboard the <i>Georgie J</i> and subsequently sued AGA. The $1,000,000 P &amp; I coverage on the <i>Georgie J</i> was grossly insufficient to cover the damages awarded to the crewman. The U.S. Marshal seized the <i>Georgie J</i> and its scallop license and sold it at auction in partial satisfaction of the crewman's judgment.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> AGA sued Flagship and Brown &amp; Brown, Inc., its parent company. AGA claimed that Flagship breached its duty of care properly to advise AGA with regard to coverage needed for the <i>Georgie J</i> (Count I). AGA also alleged negligent misrepresentation (Count II), intentional misrepresentation (Count III), and violations of Massachusetts' unfair or deceptive trade practice law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A §§ 2(a), 11 (Counts IV and V). AGA further alleged that Brown &amp; Brown was vicariously liable for damages caused by Flagship (Count VI) and that Brown &amp; Brown negligently failed to supervise Flagship (Count VII).</p>\n<p>Defendants moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted as to all claims.
