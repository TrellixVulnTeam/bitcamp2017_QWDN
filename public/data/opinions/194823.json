Resolution\n                                                                      \n\nTrust Corp.,  942 F.2d 34,  37 (1st  Cir. 1991).   In September  1986,\n           \n\nappellants purchased  a new Volvo  from Trebol Motors  Corporation and\n\nTrebol  Motors Distributor  Corporation  (\"Trebol\"),  exclusive  Volvo\n\ndistributors in Puerto  Rico.  Appellants,  who had planned  to buy  a\n\nVolvo  240 DL  (\"Volvo DL\"),  were persuaded  by a Trebol  salesman to\n\npurchase  a  Volvo  240 GLE  (\"Volvo  GLE\"),  a  more prestigious  and\n\nexpensive  model.    Thereafter,  appellants  discovered documentation\n\ninside the  vehicle, listing its identification  number and describing\n\nit as a Volvo DL.\n\n          In  May  1991,  appellants  filed  a  civil  RICO  complaint\n\nagainst,  inter alia,  Trebol, Volvo  Cars of  North America,  and the\n                    \n\nforeign  manufacturers,  Volvo  Car Corporation  and  Volvo Gothenburg\n\nSweden, see  18 U.S.C.    1964(c),1 alleging  that the  defendants had\n           \n\nengaged  in a  seven-year  scheme  to  defraud Trebol's  customers  by\n\nselling  Volvo DL  vehicles \"doctored\"  by Trebol  to look  like their\n\npricier  cousin     the  Volvo GLE.2    As the  predicate  \"pattern of\n\nracketeering  activity,\"  see  18  U.S.C.    1961(1),  (5), appellants\n                             \n\nalleged  that  the defendants  committed  \"millions\"  of \"public\"  and\n\n                      \n\n       1RICO   1964(c) provides:\n\n       Any  person  injured in  his  business  or property  by\n       reason of a  violation of section 1962 of  this chapter\n       may sue  therefor  in  any  appropriate  United  States\n       district court and shall recover  threefold the damages\n       he sustains  and  the cost  of  the suit,  including  a\n       reasonable attorney's fee.\n\n  18 U.S.C.   1964(c).   Appellants alleged violations of   1962(a)\n  (to  \"use  or   invest\"  income  derived   from  a  \"pattern   of\n  racketeering  activity\"),    1962(b)  (to \"acquire  or  maintain\"\n  through a \"pattern  of racketeering activity\" an interest  in any\n  enterprise),    1962(c) (to  \"conduct or  participate\"  through a\n  \"pattern  of  racketeering  activity\"   in  the  conduct  of  any\n  enterprise), and    1962(d) (to \"conspire\" to  violate   1962(a),\n  (b), or (c)).\n\n       2Appellants alternatively allege that Volvo discontinued its\n  premium GLE model by 1984 (a material fact which Trebol allegedly\n  withheld from its Puerto Rico customers), or that if factory-made\n  GLEs  were still in production  at Volvo, Trebol  chose to import\n  the less expensive DL  models, which had been fitted  with $2,000\n  worth  of additional  options.   Trebol  sent  the Volvo  DLs  to\n  Showroom   Auto   Services,   Inc.,   which   replaced   the   DL\n  identification \"badge\" on  the automobile with  a GLE badge,  and\n  removed  all   other  documentary   evidence  of  the   DL  model\n  classification.  Trebol listed the disguised DLs as GLEs at $7000\n  over  the price for  its standard  DL models,  a price  which far\n  exceeded the  cost of the  $2000 option  package incorporated  in\n  each car.  The alleged \"scheme\" resulted in net damages of $5,000\n  to each Trebol customer.\n\n                                  3\n\n\"private\" acts of  mail, wire, and bank fraud, see  18 U.S.C.    1341,\n                                                  \n\n1343, 1344, in furtherance of their GLE scam.  The predicate \"private\"\n\nacts allegedly consisted of an  unspecified number of telephone, wire,\n\nand  mail communications  among  the various  defendants.   Appellants\n\nasserted  that  further  discovery  of defendants'  internal  business\n\nrecords  would  be  necessary to  enable  them  to  specify the  exact\n\ncontents and participants  in these communications.   See New  England\n                                                                      \n\nData Servs.,  Inc.  v.  Becher, 829  F.2d  286, 291  (1st  Cir.  1987)\n                              \n\n(favoring liberal pre-dismissal discovery to permit RICO plaintiffs to\n\nallege  \"scheme to  defraud\"  by obtaining  information regarding  the\n\ntime,  place,  and  contents  of  confidential  communications  within\n\ndefendants'  exclusive control).   On  the other  hand, the  predicate\n\n\"public\"  acts allegedly consisted  of Trebol's  commercial advertise-\n\nments and  direct promotional mailings enticing  customers into Trebol\n\nto purchase Volvo GLEs during the  period from 1984 to 1991.  Attached\n\nto  their complaint were photocopies  of nine ads  and eight mailings,\n\nall dated after July 1989.  Appellants  themselves allegedly sustained\n               \n\nproperty damage in  the amount  of $5,000, the  net cost  differential\n\nbetween  the  Volvo DL  and the  pseudo-Volvo  GLE, and  sought certi-\n\nfication  of a plaintiff  class, estimated at  15,000 Trebol customers\n\nwho purchased GLEs from 1984 to 1991, holding aggregate  claims of $75\n\nmillion trebled ($225 million).\n\n          The   district  court   stayed  further   discovery  pending\n\ndisposition of defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion and appellants' motion\n\nfor  certification under  Rule 23(a).   Meantime,  the  court directed\n\n                                  4\n\nappellants to submit  a more  particularized statement  of their  RICO\n\nclaim, fleshing out  the factual underpinnings for the  allegations in\n\ntheir  complaint.3  In September 1992, based on the unmended vagueness\n\nof  appellants' particularized seventy-nine page RICO-claim statement,\n\nthe court denied  their motion for class  certification, and dismissed\n\nthe  complaint  for failure  to allege  predicate  acts of  fraud with\n\nsufficient particularity  under Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 9(b).4   Thereafter,\n\nthe court denied plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint.  See infra\n                                                                      \n\nnote 8.\n\n                                  II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n                                        \n\n          We  have  imposed  a   threshold  requirement  that  a  RICO\n\n                      \n\n       3Far  from particularizing appellants'  complaint, the RICO-\n  claim  statement provides  general  statistical  data  concerning\n                                    \n  Trebol's  total television and newspaper advertising expenses for\n  the years 1988-1991.  Appellants also alleged that they had found\n  that  15 more  Trebol advertisements  were published  in  a local\n  newspaper  during August and September 1986, at or about the time\n  they purchased their Volvo GLE.  No photocopies of these ads were\n  appended.  As described by appellants, however, these ads  merely\n  \"offer[ed]  for sale  a Volvo  240 GLE,\"  but contained  no other\n  representations   by  Trebol.     Most   importantly,  appellants\n  implicitly concede in  their complaint  that Trebol's  advertise-\n  ments  and mailing  did not  lure them  into buying a  GLE, since\n  appellants arrived on the Trebol lot in 1986 intent on purchasing\n                    \n  a Volvo DL.\n            \n\n       4Rule  9(b) requires that,  \"[i]n all averments  of fraud or\n  mistake,  the  circumstances constituting  the  fraud or  mistake\n  shall be stated with particularity.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  Rule\n  9(b)  disqualifies conclusory  factual allegations  which  do not\n  afford sufficient notice of the fraud  claim to enable defendants\n  to  prepare  their  defense,  with  a  view  to   minimizing  the\n  reputational harm caused by the filing of pretextual or frivolous\n  fraud claims.  See New England Data, 829 F.2d at 289.\n                                     \n\n                                  5\n\ncomplaint \"state facts sufficient to portray (i) specific instances of\n                                                                   \n\nracketeering activity within the reach of the RICO statute and \n\n                                  6\n\n(ii)  a  causal nexus  between that  activity  and the  harm alleged.\"\n                     \n\nMiranda v.

Their  complaint\n                               \n\nalleged that the defendants  \"falsely represented to customers willing\n                                                 \n\nto purchase motor vehicles  that they have available for  sale factory\n                                                                      \n\nmade models  (such as the  Volvo 240 GLE), which  were models distinct\n    \n\nand  allegedly superior to the  other models then  manufactured by the\n\ncompany (such as  the Volvo 240 DL),\" and that  plaintiffs \"relied on,\n                                                                     \n\nand  accepted as  true[,] the representations  [that] . . .  they were\n\nactually purchasing a superior automobile, a so-called  'international\n\nclassic', factory built and inherently more expensive motor vehicle.\"\n                       \n\n          Although we  have  combed  the entire  record,  we  find  no\n\nindication  that Trebol ever  falsely represented that  it was selling\n\n\"factory made\" Volvo  GLEs, as  plaintiffs assert.   On the  contrary,\n\nduring its  twenty-fifth anniversary sale at  least, Trebol advertised\n\nfor  sale its  own  customized versions  of the  Volvo  GLE (\"ha  sido\n\npreparado especialemente para  conmemorar\") apparently configured with\n\n                      \n\n  caused  them  to  buy their  1986  Volvo,  provided  their injury\n  proximately resulted from Trebol's sale  of a disguised Volvo DL,\n  or in other  words, as an  integral part of  the same \"scheme  to\n  defraud.\"   See 18 U.S.C.    1964(c) (\"Any person  injured in his\n                 \n  business or property  by reason  of a violation  of section  1962\n                                     \n  . . . .\") (emphasis added).\n\n                                  8\n\noptional  equipment  in essentially  the same  fashion as  the vehicle\n\nplaintiffs  purchased.     Moreover,   appellants  never  alleged   or\n\ndemonstrated that the nominal  classification \"GLE\", whether generated\n\nat the factory or elsewhere along the distributional chain, invariably\n\nconnotes a fixed set of features or options of determinate value,  nor\n\nhave appellants  suggested  that  defendants  misled them  as  to  the\n\noptions  or features actually incorporated  in the Volvo  240 GLE they\n\npurchased.   Rather,  these ads  and mailings  suggest, at  most, that\n\nplaintiffs  presumed  too much     namely,  that  all Volvo  GLEs were\n\nmonolithic  and  immutable assemblages.    Although  various types  of\n\n\"deceptive  conduct\"  other  than  affirmative  misrepresentations may\n\namount to  a \"scheme to defraud\"  under the mail, wire,  or bank fraud\n\nstatutes, see United  States v. Brien,  617 F.2d 299, 307  (1st Cir.),\n                                     \n\ncert. denied, 446  U.S. 919 (1980); see also United States v.

They argue that  their civil RICO  claim need  not\n\ndepend  on an allegation that the defendants were under an affirmative\n\nduty  to  disclose.    We  do  not agree.    Especially  when  alleged\n\nviolations  of the  mail,  wire,  or  bank  fraud  statutes  form  the\n\npredicate acts relied on in a civil RICO complaint, mere nondisclosure\n\nwill  not  defeat   a  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  absent  a  demonstrated\n\naffirmative  duty  to  disclose,  or  some  special  circumstance  not\n\npresented here.

In September  1986,\n           \n\nappellants purchased  a new Volvo  from Trebol Motors  Corporation and\n\nTrebol  Motors Distributor  Corporation  (\"Trebol\"),  exclusive  Volvo\n\ndistributors in Puerto  Rico.  Appellants,  who had planned  to buy  a\n\nVolvo  240 DL  (\"Volvo DL\"),  were persuaded  by a Trebol  salesman to\n\npurchase  a  Volvo  240 GLE  (\"Volvo  GLE\"),  a  more prestigious  and\n\nexpensive  model.    Thereafter,  appellants  discovered documentation\n\ninside the  vehicle, listing its identification  number and describing\n\nit as a Volvo DL.\n\n          In  May  1991,  appellants  filed  a  civil  RICO  complaint\n\nagainst,  inter alia,  Trebol, Volvo  Cars of  North America,  and the\n                    \n\nforeign  manufacturers,  Volvo  Car Corporation  and  Volvo Gothenburg\n\nSweden, see  18 U.S.C.    1964(c),1 alleging  that the  defendants had\n           \n\nengaged  in a  seven-year  scheme  to  defraud Trebol's  customers  by\n\nselling  Volvo DL  vehicles \"doctored\"  by Trebol  to look  like their\n\npricier  cousin     the  Volvo GLE.2    As the  predicate  \"pattern of\n\nracketeering  activity,\"  see  18  U.S.C.    1961(1),  (5), appellants\n                             \n\nalleged  that  the defendants  committed  \"millions\"  of \"public\"  and\n\n                      \n\n       1RICO   1964(c) provides:\n\n       Any  person  injured in  his  business  or property  by\n       reason of a  violation of section 1962 of  this chapter\n       may sue  therefor  in  any  appropriate  United  States\n       district court and shall recover  threefold the damages\n       he sustains  and  the cost  of  the suit,  including  a\n       reasonable attorney's fee.\n\n  18 U.S.C.   1964(c).   Appellants alleged violations of   1962(a)\n  (to  \"use  or   invest\"  income  derived   from  a  \"pattern   of\n  racketeering  activity\"),    1962(b)  (to \"acquire  or  maintain\"\n  through a \"pattern  of racketeering activity\" an interest  in any\n  enterprise),    1962(c) (to  \"conduct or  participate\"  through a\n  \"pattern  of  racketeering  activity\"   in  the  conduct  of  any\n  enterprise), and    1962(d) (to \"conspire\" to  violate   1962(a),\n  (b), or (c)).\n\n       2Appellants alternatively allege that Volvo discontinued its\n  premium GLE model by 1984 (a material fact which Trebol allegedly\n  withheld from its Puerto Rico customers), or that if factory-made\n  GLEs  were still in production  at Volvo, Trebol  chose to import\n  the less expensive DL  models, which had been fitted  with $2,000\n  worth  of additional  options.   Trebol  sent  the Volvo  DLs  to\n  Showroom   Auto   Services,   Inc.,   which   replaced   the   DL\n  identification \"badge\" on  the automobile with  a GLE badge,  and\n  removed  all   other  documentary   evidence  of  the   DL  model\n  classification.  Trebol listed the disguised DLs as GLEs at $7000\n  over  the price for  its standard  DL models,  a price  which far\n  exceeded the  cost of the  $2000 option  package incorporated  in\n  each car.  The alleged \"scheme\" resulted in net damages of $5,000\n  to each Trebol customer.\n\n                                  3\n\n\"private\" acts of  mail, wire, and bank fraud, see  18 U.S.C.    1341,\n                                                  \n\n1343, 1344, in furtherance of their GLE scam.  The predicate \"private\"\n\nacts allegedly consisted of an  unspecified number of telephone, wire,\n\nand  mail communications  among  the various  defendants.

On  the other  hand, the  predicate\n\n\"public\"  acts allegedly consisted  of Trebol's  commercial advertise-\n\nments and  direct promotional mailings enticing  customers into Trebol\n\nto purchase Volvo GLEs during the  period from 1984 to 1991.  Attached\n\nto  their complaint were photocopies  of nine ads  and eight mailings,\n\nall dated after July 1989.  Appellants  themselves allegedly sustained\n               \n\nproperty damage in  the amount  of $5,000, the  net cost  differential\n\nbetween  the  Volvo DL  and the  pseudo-Volvo  GLE, and  sought certi-\n\nfication  of a plaintiff  class, estimated at  15,000 Trebol customers\n\nwho purchased GLEs from 1984 to 1991, holding aggregate  claims of $75\n\nmillion trebled ($225 million).\n\n          The   district  court   stayed  further   discovery  pending\n\ndisposition of defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion and appellants' motion\n\nfor  certification under  Rule 23(a).

Appellants also alleged that they had found\n  that  15 more  Trebol advertisements  were published  in  a local\n  newspaper  during August and September 1986, at or about the time\n  they purchased their Volvo GLE.  No photocopies of these ads were\n  appended.  As described by appellants, however, these ads  merely\n  \"offer[ed]  for sale  a Volvo  240 GLE,\"  but contained  no other\n  representations   by  Trebol.     Most   importantly,  appellants\n  implicitly concede in  their complaint  that Trebol's  advertise-\n  ments  and mailing  did not  lure them  into buying a  GLE, since\n  appellants arrived on the Trebol lot in 1986 intent on purchasing\n                    \n  a Volvo DL.\n            \n\n       4Rule  9(b) requires that,  \"[i]n all averments  of fraud or\n  mistake,  the  circumstances constituting  the  fraud or  mistake\n  shall be stated with particularity.\"  Fed.

Their  complaint\n                               \n\nalleged that the defendants  \"falsely represented to customers willing\n                                                 \n\nto purchase motor vehicles  that they have available for  sale factory\n                                                                      \n\nmade models  (such as the  Volvo 240 GLE), which  were models distinct\n    \n\nand  allegedly superior to the  other models then  manufactured by the\n\ncompany (such as  the Volvo 240 DL),\" and that  plaintiffs \"relied on,\n                                                                     \n\nand  accepted as  true[,] the representations  [that] . . .  they were\n\nactually purchasing a superior automobile, a so-called  'international\n\nclassic', factory built and inherently more expensive motor vehicle.\"\n                       \n\n          Although we  have  combed  the entire  record,  we  find  no\n\nindication  that Trebol ever  falsely represented that  it was selling\n\n\"factory made\" Volvo  GLEs, as  plaintiffs assert.   On the  contrary,\n\nduring its  twenty-fifth anniversary sale at  least, Trebol advertised\n\nfor  sale its  own  customized versions  of the  Volvo  GLE (\"ha  sido\n\npreparado especialemente para  conmemorar\") apparently configured with\n\n                      \n\n  caused  them  to  buy their  1986  Volvo,  provided  their injury\n  proximately resulted from Trebol's sale  of a disguised Volvo DL,\n  or in other  words, as an  integral part of  the same \"scheme  to\n  defraud.\"   See 18 U.S.C.    1964(c) (\"Any person  injured in his\n                 \n  business or property  by reason  of a violation  of section  1962\n                                     \n  . . . .\") (emphasis added).\n\n                                  8\n\noptional  equipment  in essentially  the same  fashion as  the vehicle\n\nplaintiffs  purchased.     Moreover,   appellants  never  alleged   or\n\ndemonstrated that the nominal  classification \"GLE\", whether generated\n\nat the factory or elsewhere along the distributional chain, invariably\n\nconnotes a fixed set of features or options of determinate value,  nor\n\nhave appellants  suggested  that  defendants  misled them  as  to  the\n\noptions  or features actually incorporated  in the Volvo  240 GLE they\n\npurchased.   Rather,  these ads  and mailings  suggest, at  most, that\n\nplaintiffs  presumed  too much     namely,  that  all Volvo  GLEs were\n\nmonolithic  and  immutable assemblages.

The district court ap-\n\npropriately  concluded that  additional discovery  would amount  to an\n\nunwarranted and \"expensive fishing expedition,\" and properly dismissed\n\n                      \n\n       7As  newfound grounds  for asserting  that defendants  had a\n  duty  to disclose,  appellants ask  this court  to take  judicial\n  notice of the Disclosure of Automobile Information Act, 15 U.S.C.\n     1231-1233, and  its Commonwealth  analog, P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.\n  13,   7351, which purportedly proscribe the removal of automobile\n  manufacturers'  labels  disclosing new-vehicle  model classifica-\n  tions.
