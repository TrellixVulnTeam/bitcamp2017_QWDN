Rivera-Camacho on brief for the appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Camille L. Velez-Rive,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Christopher A. Michaels,\nAssistant Regional Counsel, Social Security Administration, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n                          September 2, 2004\n\f            Per Curiam.         This social security disability appeal\n\nfocuses on whether the claimant's residual functional capacity,\n\ncombined with his age, education, and past work experience, enables\n\nhim   to   do   work   other    than   what   he    did   in   the   past.    The\n\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) answered this question in the\n\naffirmative, and the magistrate judge1 affirmed. We have carefully\n\nreviewed the record and the parties' briefs and affirm the district\n\ncourt's    judgment    for     essentially    the    reasons    stated   in   the\n\nmagistrate judge's Opinion and Order.               We add only the following\n\ncomments.\n\n            On appeal, the claimant makes the following arguments:\n\n            (1) that the expert neurologist and psychiatrist called\n\nby the Commissioner did not give sufficient weight to the opinions\n\nof the claimant's treating neurologist and psychiatrist;\n\n            (2) that the expert psychiatrist did not consider that\n\n\"mental disorders have their ups and downs\";\n\n            (3) that the expert psychiatrist improperly drew an\n\nadverse inference from the fact that the claimant had not been\n\nprescribed anti-depressant medication; and\n\n            (4) that the ALJ incorrectly categorized the claimant as\n\na \"younger individual\" for purposes of determining his ability to\n\ndo other work.\n\n\n\n      1\n      By consent of the parties, this case was decided by a\nmagistrate judge.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            The first three arguments reflect a misunderstanding of\n\nthe applicable locus and standard of judicial review.                     This court\n\nreviews the decisions of the Commissioner, not the opinions of\n\nindividual expert witnesses.           42 U.S.C. § 405(g).           Even construing\n\nthe claimant's first three arguments as challenging the weighing of\n\nthe evidence by the ALJ, rather than by the Commissioner's experts,\n\nthose    arguments    are    unavailing       as    grounds    for    reversing    the\n\nCommissioner's decision for the reasons discussed by the magistrate\n\njudge.\n\n            Additionally, claimant's second argument, that the \"up\n\nand down\" nature of mental illness must be taken into account, is\n\ninapt here.      This is not a case where the ALJ inferred from\n\nsymptom-free intervals that the claimant's mental illness was of\n\ninsufficient duration to be disabling. Cf. Lebus v. Harris, 526 F.\n\nSupp. 56, 61-62 (N.D. Cal. 1981).                    Here, although there was\n\nconflicting evidence as to the diagnosis of claimant's mental\n\nimpairment, there was no evidence of symptom-free intervals during\n\nthe period in question.        Nor was there any dispute that claimant's\n\nimpairments had lasted or were expected to last for the requisite\n\ncontinuous period of not less than twelve months.                    See 20 C.F.R. §§\n\n404.1520(a)(4)(ii),         404.1509   (to     be    \"severe,\"   impairment       must\n\nsatisfy durational requirement).\n\n            As   to   claimant's       third       argument,   the     ALJ   properly\n\nconsidered the medications that claimant had been prescribed in\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fconcluding     that   \"[t]he    claimant's    statements   concerning    his\n\nimpairments and their impact on his ability to work were not\n\nentirely credible.\"      See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1529(c)(3)(iv) (requiring\n\nconsideration of \"[t]he type, dosage, effectiveness, and side\n\neffects of any medication [claimant] take[s] or ha[s] taken\" in\n\nevaluating subjective symptoms); see also Social Security Ruling\n\n96-7p, Evaluation of Symptoms in Disability Claims: Assessing the\n\nCredibility of an Individual's Statements, 1996 WL 374186 *3, *7\n\n(S.S.A. July 2, 1996) (same).             Claimant's suggestion that his\n\ndoctors' failure to prescribe antidepressant medication may have\n\nbeen due to their improper treatment or to his inability to afford\n\nsuch   medication     lacks    any   evidentiary   basis   in   the   record.\n\nMoreover, because this argument was not raised in the lower court,\n\nit may not be raised here.           Keating v. Sec'y of Health and Human\n\nServs., 848 F.2d 271, 273 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n             Claimant's fourth argument, concerning his age, also was\n\nnot raised below and therefore need not be considered here.             Id.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f",
