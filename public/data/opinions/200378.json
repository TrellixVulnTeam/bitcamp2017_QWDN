Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                  Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Robert L. Sheketoff, for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, with whom Jame J. Arguin,\nAssistant Attorney General, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          March 14, 2003\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.           After a Massachusetts Superior\n\nCourt jury convicted Steven James of first degree murder and\n\nrelated assault charges for the 1994 death of Edward Sullivan, he\n\nwas sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment.            The Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed the convictions.          James then\n\npetitioned the federal district court for habeas corpus relief\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254, challenging the admissibility of his\n\nvideotaped confession. The district court denied James's petition.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n          In   its   opinion   on   James's     direct   appeal,   the   SJC\n\nsummarized the important facts.      Commonwealth v. James, 693 N.E.2d\n\n148, 150 (Mass. 1998).    James and some friends were in a parking\n\nlot of a sandwich shop in Rockland, Massachusetts.           Some distance\n\naway, near a van belonging to the victim, an argument began between\n\nSullivan and Steven DiRenzo, another of James's friends.                 The\n\nvictim took a baseball bat out of his van and used it to fend off\n\nDiRenzo, but did not actually swing it.           DiRenzo then called to\n\nJames who, with several of their other friends, ran toward the van\n\nand began taunting Sullivan.    The victim fell, dropped the bat and\n\nlay motionless on his stomach as six or seven people repeatedly hit\n\nand kicked him.   Throughout the beating, he asked them to stop and\n\nmade no attempt to fight back. James picked up the bat and swung it\n\nthree times at Sullivan's head, crushing his skull and lacerating\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fhis brain.     The unconscious victim was taken to a hospital, where\n\nhe died two days later as a result of head injuries.\n\n           Shortly      after   the     fight   in   the    parking   lot,    James\n\ntelephoned the Rockland police, stated that he thought he might\n\nhave killed someone with a baseball bat, and arranged to meet a\n\npolice officer at the scene of the fight.                 There, after a reading\n\nof his Miranda rights, which he confirmed that he understood, he\n\nwas arrested and taken to the Rockland police station.                       At the\n\npolice station Sergeant Richard Craig read James his Miranda rights\n\na second time before asking him if he was willing to talk about the\n\nfight. James indicated that he was.             Sergeant Craig brought him to\n\na   conference   room    and    asked    him    if   he    could   videotape    the\n\ninterview.    James replied \"sure\" and said that he had \"no problem\"\n\nwith that.     The interview then began:\n\n             Craig: - 1994 and it's 11:22 p.m.          I'm\n                    Detective   Sergeant   Richard   Craig.\n                    Videotaping this is PCI Peter Curry.\n                    It's an inteview with Steven James.\n             James: Yeah.\n             Craig: Steven, I'm going to give you some\n                    rights. And first I'd like to inform\n                    you that this is being videotaped. You\n                    have the right to remain silent.\n                    Anything you say can and will be used\n                    against you in a court of law.      You\n                    have the right to an attorney. If you\n                    can't afford an attorney one will be\n                    appointed for you by the Commonwealth.\n                    Do you understand these rights?\n             James: Yes.\n             Craig: Do you wish to make a statement at this\n                    time?\n             James: Nope.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f               Craig: Okay.   Can I talk to you about what\n                      happened earlier tonight?\n               James: Yup.\n\nJames cooperated fully throughout the interview, was forthcoming\n\nwith information and, on one occasion, paused to ask Sergeant\n\nCraig, who was taking notes, if he was speaking too quickly.                      At\n\nthe end of the interview, Sergeant Craig asked James to review his\n\nnotes, make any changes that he wanted, and sign them if he thought\n\nthey were a fair and accurate representation of the interview.\n\nJames    signed       each   page    without        making   any     objections   or\n\nmodifications.\n\n               James moved to suppress admission of the videotape,\n\narguing that the interview should have been terminated immediately\n\nfollowing his answer of \"Nope\" to Sergeant Craig's question about\n\nwhether he wanted to make a statement.                The trial court disagreed,\n\nfinding that \"Nope\" did not signal the invocation of his right to\n\nremain    silent:      \"I    find    that   the      'no'    [sic]    response,   as\n\ndemonstrated by the video, was one of semantics and that he was\n\ndistinguishing        between    reciting       a   formal    statement    and    his\n\nwillingness to answer questions put to him by Craig.\"                     On direct\n\nappeal, the SJC agreed with this determination.\n\n               James then filed a timely habeas petition in the district\n\ncourt    for    the   District      of   Massachusetts,      asserting    that    the\n\nadmission of his videotaped interview violated his Fourteenth\n\nAmendment right to due process. The court denied the writ, holding\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fthat \"[n]ot only has petitioner failed to show that the state\n\ncourts' factual and legal determinations were unreasonable, it is\n\nclear   that    these    determinations     were    fully    supported    by   the\n\nrecord.\"      James v. Marshall, No. 99-10728-RWZ, 2002 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 8157, at *5 (D. Mass. March 12, 2002).                    Petitioner now\n\nappeals.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              A federal court may grant habeas relief to a state\n\nprisoner if it finds, inter alia, that the state court adjudication\n\n\"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law . . .\"\n\n28   U.S.C.    ยง   2254(d)(1)    (2002).      This    section     \"defines     two\n\ncategories of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain federal\n\nhabeas relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in\n\nstate court.\"      Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 404-05 (2000).              A\n\nstate court decision is \"contrary to\" clearly established federal\n\nlaw if it \"applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set\n\nforth in [Supreme Court] cases.\"             Id. at 405.        A state court\n\ndecision      involves    an   \"unreasonable       application\"      of   clearly\n\nestablished federal law if \"the state court identifies the correct\n\ngoverning      legal     principle   from    [Supreme       Court]   cases     but\n\nunreasonably applies it to the facts\" of the petitioner's case, or\n\nif the state court either \"unreasonably extends a legal principle\n\nfrom [Supreme Court] precedent to a new context where it should not\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fapply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new\n\ncontext where it should apply.\"        Id. at 407.      In either case, the\n\nstate   court's    determination     must   be   unreasonable,    not   simply\n\nincorrect.     Id. at 411.\n\n                                     III.\n\n             The SJC affirmed the trial court's conclusion that when\n\nJames stated \"Nope\" in response to Sergeant Craig's inquiry about\n\nmaking a statement, he was declining to make a formal statement,\n\nrather than refusing to answer further questions.              Therefore, the\n\nSJC found that \"Nope\" was not an unequivocal assertion of his right\n\nto remain silent which required an end to further questioning.              In\n\nreaching this conclusion, the SJC said the following:\n\n             We cannot say this determination was clearly\n             erroneous. Immediately before and after that\n             point, the defendant appears to have been\n             quite willing to talk.        The judge was\n             warranted in concluding that the defendant did\n             not suddenly change his mind about discussing\n             the incident, but had no prepared speech.\n\nJames, 693 N.E.2d at 151 (emphasis added).\n\n             James argues that the SJC's consideration of his conduct\n\nand answers after he said \"Nope\" violated clearly established\n\nSupreme Court precedent in Smith v. Illinois, 469 U.S. 91 (1984).\n\nIn   order    to   evaluate   that   argument,     we   must    describe   the\n\nadministration of the Miranda rights and the Supreme Court's\n\nholding in Smith in some detail.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f          Eighteen-year-old Steven Smith was arrested in connection\n\nwith an armed robbery.   Shortly after his arrest, Smith was taken\n\nto an interrogation room for questioning by two police detectives.\n\nThe interview began as follows:\n\n          Q:     Steve, I want to talk with you in\n                 reference to the armed robbery that\n                 took place at McDonald's restaurant on\n                 the morning of the 19th.       Are you\n                 familiar with this?\n          A:     Yeah. My cousin Greg was.\n          Q:     Okay.   But before I do that I must\n                 advise you of your rights. Okay? You\n                 have a right to remain silent. You do\n                 not have to talk to me unless you want\n                 to do so. Do you understand that?\n          A:     Uh. She told me to get my lawyer. She\n                 said you guys would railroad me.\n          Q:     Do you understand that as I gave it to\n                 you, Steve?\n          A:     Yeah.\n          Q:     If you want to talk to me I must advise\n                 you that whatever you say can and will\n                 be used against you in court. Do you\n                 understand that?\n          A:     Yeah.\n          Q:     You have a right to consult with a\n                 lawyer and to have a lawyer present\n                 with you when you're being questioned.\n                 Do you understand that?\n          A:     Uh, yeah. I'd like to do that.\n          Q:     Okay.\n\nId. at 92-93 (emphasis in original).   Instead of terminating the\n\ninterview at this point, the interrogating officer proceeded to\n\nfinish reading Smith his Miranda rights and then pressed him again\n\nto answer their questions.\n\n          Q:     . . . If you want a lawyer and you're\n                 unable to pay for one a lawyer will be\n                 appointed to represent you free of\n                 cost, do you understand that?\n\n                               -7-\n\f          A:       Okay.\n          Q:       Do you wish to talk to me at this time\n                   without a lawyer being present?\n             A:    Yeah and no, uh, I don't know what's\n                   what, really.\n          Q:       Well, you either have to talk to me\n                   this time without a lawyer being\n                   present and if you do agree to talk\n                   with me without a lawyer being present\n                   you can stop at any time you want to.\n             A:    All right. I'll talk to you then.\n\nId. (emphasis in original).    Smith went on to make a confession and\n\nwas convicted of armed robbery after the trial court denied his\n\nmotion to suppress the confession.       The Illinois Supreme Court\n\naffirmed his conviction.      People v. Smith, 466 N.E.2d 236 (Ill.\n\n1984).\n\n          In assessing whether Smith had invoked his right to\n\ncounsel, the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged that \"an accused's\n\nasserted request for counsel may be ambiguous or equivocal,\" and\n\nthat \"courts have developed conflicting standards for determining\n\nthe consequences of such ambiguities.\"     Id. at 95.   In this case,\n\nhowever, the Supreme Court saw no need to resolve those conflicting\n\nstandards.    The Court explained:\n\n          The conflict among courts is addressed to the\n          relevance    of   alleged    ambiguities    or\n          equivocations that either (1) precede an\n          accused's purported requested for counsel, or\n          (2) are part of the request itself. Neither\n          circumstance pertains here, however. Neither\n          the state nor the courts below, for example,\n          have pointed to anything Smith previously had\n          said that might have cast doubt on the meaning\n          of the statement \"I'd like to do that\" upon\n          learning that he had the right to his\n          counsel's presence. . . .      Nor have they\n\n                                  -8-\n\f          pointed to anything inherent in the nature of\n          Smith's actual request for counsel that\n          reasonably would have suggested equivocation.\n\nId. at 96-97.   The court then went on to explain why it had to\n\nreverse the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court:\n\n          The courts below were able to construe\n          Smith's     request     for     counsel    as\n          \"ambiguous\" only by looking to Smith's\n          subsequent responses to continued police\n          questioning and by concluding that,\n          \"considered      in       total,\"     Smith's\n          \"statements\" were equivocal. This line\n          of    analysis    is     unprecedented    and\n          untenable . . . .       Where nothing about\n          the    request    for     counsel    or   the\n          circumstances leading up to the request\n          would     render     it     ambiguous,    all\n          questioning must cease.            In these\n          circumstances, an accused's subsequent\n          statements were relevant only to the\n          question of whether the accused waived\n          the right he had invoked. Invocation and\n          waiver are entirely distinct inquiries,\n          and the two must not be blurred by\n          merging them together.\n\nId. at 97-98 (internal citations omitted).\n\n          In cases addressing the issue of whether the Miranda\n\nrights of a person in police custody have been \"scrupulously\n\nhonored,\" Mosley, 423 U.S. at 104, the Smith case indicates that\n\nthere is often a threshold issue:      whether the suspect actually\n\ninvoked the rights in the first instance.          If the individual\n\nunambiguously invokes his rights, he \"is not subject to further\n\ninterrogation by the authorities . . . unless the accused himself\n\ninitiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with\n\nthe police.\"    Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484-85 (1981).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fHowever, \"if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is\n\nambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the\n\ncircumstances would have understood only that the suspect might be\n\ninvoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the\n\ncessation of questioning.\"     Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452,\n\n459 (1994).     As the Davis decision makes clear, this threshold\n\ninquiry is an objective one.    \"Invocation of the Miranda right to\n\ncounsel requires at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably\n\nbe construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of\n\nan attorney.\"    Id. (internal citations omitted).\n\n          Both Smith and Davis addressed the question of the need\n\nfor clarity in a suspect's invocation of the right to counsel,\n\nrather than the right to remain silent implicated in this case.\n\nHowever, every circuit that has directly addressed the issue \"has\n\nconcluded that Davis applies to both components of Miranda: the\n\nright to counsel and the right to remain silent.\"    Bui v. DiPaolo,\n\n170 F.3d 232, 239 (1st Cir. 1999) (collecting cases).           This\n\ncircuit, joining the Ninth and the Second Circuits, has heretofore\n\nleft the issue open.   Id. at 239 (\"[W]e acknowledge that Davis does\n\nnot 'authoritatively' answer the question in the narrow, technical\n\nsense of that term.\").    Given the habeas context in which James\n\nraises the challenge to the treatment of his right to remain silent\n\nby the police and the state courts, we leave open again the issue\n\nof the applicability of Davis to both the right to counsel and the\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fright to remain silent. \"For the purposes of habeas corpus review,\n\nwe   simply     cannot    deem    unreasonable        a   conclusion    by   the\n\nMassachusetts courts [to apply right to counsel principles to a\n\nright to remain silent case] that is consistent with the approach\n\ntaken by so many respected tribunals.\"            Id.     Thus, in this habeas\n\ncontext,   we   view     the   Smith   and    Davis   precedents   as   clearly\n\nestablished federal law applicable to our evaluation of the SJC's\n\ndecision on James's invocation of his right to remain silent.\n\n           However, in asserting that the SJC ruled contrary to\n\nSmith, James ignores the holding in Smith, which was premised on\n\nthe unambiguous assertion of the right to remain silent:                \"We hold\n\nonly that, under the clear logical force of settled precedent, an\n\naccused's postrequest responses to further interrogation may not be\n\nused to cast retrospective doubt on the clarity of the initial\n\nrequest itself.\"       Smith, 469 U.S. at 100 (second emphasis added).\n\nIn this case, the trial court found ambiguity in James's response\n\nof \"Nope\" to the question, \"Do you wish to make a statement at this\n\ntime?\"     In evaluating that finding of ambiguity by the trial\n\ncourt, the SJC did look at the circumstances of James's interview\n\nbefore and after he said \"Nope.\"\n\n           We cannot say this determination was clearly\n           erroneous. Immediately before and after that\n           point, the defendant appears to have been\n           quite willing to talk.        The judge was\n           warranted in concluding that the defendant did\n           not suddenly change his mind about discussing\n           the incident, but had no prepared speech.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fJames, 693 N.E.2d at 151.    However, because the SJC did not refer\n\nto James's post-\"Nope\" responses \"to cast retrospective doubt on\n\nthe clarity of the initial request itself,\" Smith, 469 U.S. at 100,\n\nthe SJC's decision was not contrary to the clearly established\n\nSmith precedent.    Instead, the SJC used these responses, in part,\n\nas Sergeant Craig used them during the interrogation of James\n\nhimself -- to determine whether James was in fact invoking his\n\nright to remain silent with his ambiguous answer.\n\n            After James says \"Nope\" to the inquiry about a formal\n\nstatement, Sergeant Craig does not ignore his answer and forge\n\nahead with questions about the deadly event.    Instead, he asks him\n\na question designed to clarify the meaning of his answer:    \"Okay.\n\nCan I talk to you about what happened earlier tonight?\"       James\n\nanswers \"Yup.\"     Only then does the questioning about the events\n\ncontinue.    This is precisely the kind of \"good police practice\"\n\ndescribed by the Supreme Court in Davis, where the Supreme Court\n\ndeclined to adopt a rule requiring officers to ask clarifying\n\nquestions in the face of an ambiguous assertion of the right to\n\ncounsel, but noted that \"when a suspect makes an ambiguous or\n\nequivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the\n\ninterviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually wants\n\nan attorney.\"    Davis, 512 U.S. at 461.   That was essentially what\n\nSergeant Craig did here with respect to James's invocation of the\n\nright to remain silent.\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f          Hence, the \"unreasonable application of federal law\"\n\nissue under AEDPA turns on the threshold question posed by Davis:\n\nwhether a reasonable police officer in the position of Sergeant\n\nCraig would have treated James's invocation of the right to remain\n\nsilent as ambiguous, thereby justifying the clarifying question\n\nthat Sergeant Craig asked James.       Davis, 512 U.S. at 459.   The\n\ntrial court was correct to answer that question affirmatively, and\n\nso was the SJC.   Therefore, in summary, the decision of the SJC was\n\nneither contrary to Smith, nor an unreasonable application of\n\nDavis.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\f",

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) affirmed the convictions. James then petitioned the federal district court for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254, challenging the admissibility of his videotaped confession. The district court denied James's petition.

James,</i> 427 Mass. 312, 693 N.E.2d 148, 150 (1998). James and some friends were in a parking lot of a sandwich shop in Rockland, Massachusetts. Some distance away, near a van belonging to the victim, an argument began between Sullivan and Steven DiRenzo, another of James's friends. The victim took a baseball bat out of his van and used it to fend off DiRenzo, but did not actually swing it. DiRenzo then called to James who, with several of their other friends, ran toward the van and began taunting Sullivan. The victim fell, dropped the bat and lay motionless on his stomach as six or seven people repeatedly hit and kicked him. Throughout the beating, he asked them to stop and made no attempt to fight back. James picked up the bat and swung it three times at Sullivan's head, crushing his skull and lacerating his brain. The unconscious victim was taken to a hospital, where he died two days later as a result of head injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the fight in the parking lot, James telephoned the Rockland police, stated that he thought he might have killed someone with a baseball bat, and arranged to meet a police officer at the scene of the fight. There, after a reading of his Miranda rights, which he confirmed that he understood, he was arrested and taken to the Rockland police station. At the police station Sergeant Richard Craig read James his Miranda rights a second time before asking him if he was willing to talk about the fight. James indicated that he was. Sergeant Craig brought him to a conference room and asked him if he could videotape the interview. James replied \"sure\" and said that he had \"no problem\" with that. The interview then began:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Craig: &#8212; 1994 and it's 11:22 p.m. I'm Detective Sergeant Richard Craig.

At the end of the interview, Sergeant Craig asked James to review his notes, make any changes that he wanted, and sign them if he thought they were a fair and accurate representation of the interview. James signed each page without making any objections or modifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James moved to suppress admission of the videotape, arguing that the interview should have been terminated immediately following his answer of \"Nope\" to Sergeant Craig's question about whether he wanted to make a statement. The trial court disagreed, finding that \"Nope\" did not signal the invocation of his right to remain silent: \"I find that the `no' [sic] response, as demonstrated by the video, was one of semantics and that he was distinguishing between reciting a formal statement and his willingness to answer questions put to him by Craig.\" On direct appeal, the SJC agreed with this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James then filed a timely habeas petition in the district court for the District of Massachusetts, asserting that the admission of his videotaped interview violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. The court denied the writ, holding that \"[n]ot only has petitioner failed to show that the state courts' factual and legal determinations were unreasonable, it is clear that these determinations were fully supported by the record.\" <i>James v.

This section \"defines two categories of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain federal habeas relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court.\" <i>Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 404-05, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court decision is \"contrary to\" clearly established federal law if it \"applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495. A state court decision involves an \"unreasonable application\" of clearly established federal law if \"the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [Supreme Court] cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts\" of the petitioner's case, or if the state court either \"unreasonably extends a legal principle from [Supreme Court] precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.\" <i>Id.</i> at 407, 120 S.Ct. 1495.

Therefore, the SJC found that \"Nope\" was not an unequivocal assertion of his right to remain silent which required an end to further questioning. In reaching this conclusion, the SJC said the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot say this determination was clearly erroneous.

Smith went on to make a confession and was convicted of armed robbery after the trial court denied his motion to suppress the confession. The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed his conviction. <i>People v. Smith,</i> 102 Ill.2d 365, 80 Ill.Dec. 784, 466 N.E.2d 236 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing whether Smith had invoked his right to counsel, the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged that \"an accused's asserted request for counsel may be ambiguous or equivocal,\" and that \"courts have developed conflicting standards for determining the consequences of such ambiguities.\" <i>Id.</i> at 95, 105 S.Ct. 490. In this case, however, the Supreme Court saw no need to resolve those conflicting standards. The Court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conflict among courts is addressed to the relevance of alleged ambiguities or equivocations that either (1) <i>precede</i> an accused's purported requested for counsel, or (2) are part of the request <i>itself.</i> Neither circumstance pertains here, however. Neither the state nor the courts below, for example, have pointed to anything Smith previously had said that might have cast doubt on the meaning of the statement \"I'd like to do that\" upon learning that he had the right to his counsel's presence.... Nor have they pointed to anything inherent in the nature of Smith's actual request for counsel that reasonably would have suggested equivocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 96-97, 105 S.Ct. 490.

This line of analysis is unprecedented and untenable.... Where nothing about the request for counsel or the circumstances leading up to the request would render it ambiguous, all questioning must cease. In these circumstances, an accused's subsequent statements were relevant only to the question of whether the accused waived the right he had invoked. Invocation and waiver are entirely distinct inquiries, and the two must not be blurred by merging them together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 97-98, 105 S.Ct. 490 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases addressing the issue of whether the <i>Miranda</i> rights of a person in police custody have been \"scrupulously honored,\" <i>Mosley,</i> 423 U.S. at 104, 96 S.Ct. 321, the <i>Smith</i> case indicates that there is often a threshold issue: whether the suspect actually invoked the rights in the first instance. If the individual unambiguously invokes his rights, he \"is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities ... unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\" <i>Edwards v. Arizona,</i> 451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981). However, \"if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <i>might</i> be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning.\" <i>Davis v. United States,</i> 512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). As the <i>Davis</i> decision makes clear, this threshold inquiry is an objective one. \"Invocation of the <i>Miranda</i> right to counsel requires at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both <i>Smith</i> and <i>Davis</i> addressed the question of the need for clarity in a suspect's invocation of the right to counsel, rather than the right to remain silent implicated in this case. However, every circuit that has directly addressed the issue \"has concluded that <i>Davis</i> applies to both components of Miranda: the right to counsel and the right to remain silent.\" <i>Bui v. DiPaolo,</i> 170 F.3d 232, 239 (1st Cir.1999) (collecting cases). This circuit, joining the Ninth and the Second Circuits, has heretofore left the issue open. <i>Id.</i> at 239 (\"[W]e acknowledge that <i>Davis</i> does not `authoritatively' answer the question in the narrow, technical sense of that term.\"). Given the habeas context in which James raises the challenge to the treatment of his right to remain silent by the police and the state courts, we leave open again the issue of the applicability of <i>Davis</i> to both the right to counsel and the right to remain silent. \"For the purposes of habeas corpus review, we simply cannot deem unreasonable a conclusion by the Massachusetts courts [to apply right to counsel principles to a right to remain silent case] that is consistent with the approach taken by so many respected tribunals.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, in this habeas context, we view the <i>Smith</i> and <i>Davis</i> precedents as clearly established federal law applicable to our evaluation of the SJC's decision on James's invocation of his right to remain silent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in asserting that the SJC ruled contrary to <i>Smith,</i> James ignores the holding in <i>Smith,</i> which was premised on the <i>unambiguous</i> assertion of the right to remain silent: \"We hold only that, under the clear logical force of settled precedent, an accused's <i>postrequest</i> responses to further interrogation may not be used to cast retrospective doubt on the <i>clarity</i> of the initial request itself.\" <i>Smith,</i> 469 U.S. at 100, 105 S.Ct. 490 (second emphasis added). In this case, the trial court found <i>ambiguity</i> in James's response of \"Nope\" to the question, \"Do you wish to make a statement at this time?\" In evaluating that finding of ambiguity by the trial court, the SJC did look at the circumstances of James's interview before and after he said \"Nope.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot say this determination was clearly erroneous.

However, because the SJC did not refer to James's post-\"Nope\" responses \"to cast retrospective doubt on the clarity of the initial request itself,\" <i>Smith,</i> 469 U.S. at 100, 105 S.Ct. 490, the SJC's decision was not contrary to the clearly established <i>Smith</i> precedent. Instead, the SJC used these responses, in part, as Sergeant Craig used them during the interrogation of James himself &#8212; to determine whether James was in fact invoking his right to remain silent with his ambiguous answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After James says \"Nope\" to the inquiry about a formal statement, Sergeant Craig does not ignore his answer and forge ahead with questions about the deadly event. Instead, he asks him a question designed to clarify the meaning of his answer: \"Okay. Can I talk to you about what happened earlier tonight?\" James answers \"Yup.\" Only then does the questioning about the events continue. This is precisely the kind of \"good police practice\" described by the Supreme Court in <i>Davis,</i> where the Supreme Court declined to adopt a rule requiring officers to ask clarifying questions in the face of an ambiguous assertion of the right to counsel, but noted that \"when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually wants an attorney.\" <i>Davis,</i> 512 U.S. at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350.

The trial court was correct to answer that question affirmatively, and so was the SJC. Therefore, in summary, the decision of the SJC was neither contrary to <i>Smith,</i> nor an unreasonable application of <i>Davis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",

James and some friends were in a parking lot of a sandwich shop in Rockland, Massachusetts. Some distance away, near a van belonging to the victim, an argument began between Sullivan and Steven DiRenzo, another of James's friends. The victim took a baseball bat out of his van and used it to fend off DiRenzo, but did not actually swing it. DiRenzo then called to James who, with several of their other friends, ran toward the van and began taunting Sullivan. The victim fell, dropped the bat and lay motionless on his stomach as six or seven people repeatedly hit and kicked him. Throughout the beating, he asked them to stop and made no attempt to fight back. James picked up the bat and swung it three times at Sullivan's head, crushing his skull and lacerating his brain. The unconscious victim was taken to a hospital, where he died two days later as a result of head injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the fight in the parking lot, James telephoned the Rockland police, stated that he thought he might have killed someone with a baseball bat, and arranged to meet a police officer at the scene of the fight. There, after a reading of his Miranda rights, which he confirmed that he understood, he was arrested and taken to the Rockland police station. At the police station Sergeant Richard Craig read James his Miranda rights a second time before asking him if he was willing to talk about the fight. James indicated that he was. Sergeant Craig brought him to a conference room and asked him if he could videotape the interview. James replied \"sure\" and said that he had \"no problem\" with that. The interview then began:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Craig: &#8212; 1994 and it's 11:22 p.m. I'm Detective Sergeant Richard Craig.

The trial court disagreed, finding that \"Nope\" did not signal the invocation of his right to remain silent: \"I find that the `no' [sic] response, as demonstrated by the video, was one of semantics and that he was distinguishing between reciting a formal statement and his willingness to answer questions put to him by Craig.\" On direct appeal, the SJC agreed with this determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">James then filed a timely habeas petition in the district court for the District of Massachusetts, asserting that the admission of his videotaped interview violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.

Where nothing about the request for counsel or the circumstances leading up to the request would render it ambiguous, all questioning must cease.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span> (1994). As the <i>Davis</i> decision makes clear, this threshold inquiry is an objective one. \"Invocation of the <i>Miranda</i> right to counsel requires at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both <i>Smith</i> and <i>Davis</i> addressed the question of the need for clarity in a suspect's invocation of the right to counsel, rather than the right to remain silent implicated in this case. However, every circuit that has directly addressed the issue \"has concluded that <i>Davis</i> applies to both components of Miranda: the right to counsel and the right to remain silent.\" <i>Bui v. DiPaolo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198376\"><a href=\"/opinion/198376/bui-v-dipaolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></a></span>, 239 (1st Cir.1999) (collecting cases). This circuit, joining the Ninth and the Second Circuits, has heretofore left the issue open. <i>Id.</i> at 239 (\"[W]e acknowledge that <i>Davis</i> does not `authoritatively' answer the question in the narrow, technical sense of that term.\"). Given the habeas context in which James raises the challenge to the treatment of his right to remain silent by the police and the state courts, we leave open again the issue of the applicability of <i>Davis</i> to both the right to counsel and the right to remain silent. \"For the purposes of habeas corpus review, we simply cannot deem unreasonable a conclusion by the Massachusetts courts [to apply right to counsel principles to a right to remain silent case] that is consistent with the approach taken by so many respected tribunals.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, in this habeas context, we view the <i>Smith</i> and <i>Davis</i> precedents as clearly established federal law applicable to our evaluation of the SJC's decision on James's invocation of his right to remain silent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, in asserting that the SJC ruled contrary to <i>Smith,</i> James ignores the holding in <i>Smith,</i> which was premised on the <i>unambiguous</i> assertion of the right to remain silent: \"We hold only that, under the clear logical force of settled precedent, an accused's <i>postrequest</i> responses to further interrogation may not be used to cast retrospective doubt on the <i>clarity</i> of the initial request itself.\" <i>Smith,</i> 469 U.S. at 100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111288\"><a href=\"/opinion/111288/smith-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span> (second emphasis added). In this case, the trial court found <i>ambiguity</i> in James's response of \"Nope\" to the question, \"Do you wish to make a statement at this time?\" In evaluating that finding of ambiguity by the trial court, the SJC did look at the circumstances of James's interview before and after he said \"Nope.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot say this determination was clearly erroneous. Immediately before and after that point, the defendant appears to have been quite willing to talk. The judge was warranted in concluding that the defendant did not suddenly change his mind about discussing the incident, but had no prepared speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>James,</i> 693 N.E.2d at 151. However, because the SJC did not refer to James's post-\"Nope\" responses \"to cast retrospective doubt on the clarity of the initial request itself,\" <i>Smith,</i> 469 U.S. at 100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111288\"><a href=\"/opinion/111288/smith-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, the SJC's decision was not contrary to the clearly established <i>Smith</i> precedent. Instead, the SJC used these responses, in part, as Sergeant Craig used them during the interrogation of James himself &#8212; to determine whether James was in fact invoking his right to remain silent with his ambiguous answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After James says \"Nope\" to the inquiry about a formal statement, Sergeant Craig does not ignore his answer and forge ahead with questions about the deadly event. Instead, he asks him a question designed to clarify the meaning of his answer: \"Okay. Can I talk to you about what happened earlier tonight?\" James answers \"Yup.\" Only then does the questioning about the events continue. This is precisely the kind of \"good police practice\" described by the Supreme Court in <i>Davis,</i> where the Supreme Court declined to adopt a rule requiring officers to ask clarifying questions in the face of an ambiguous assertion of the right to counsel, but noted that \"when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually wants an attorney.\" <i>Davis,</i> 512 U.S. at 461, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117863\"><a href=\"/opinion/117863/davis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2350</span></a></span>. That was essentially what Sergeant Craig did here with respect to James's invocation of the right to remain silent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hence, the \"unreasonable application of federal law\" issue under AEDPA turns on the threshold question posed by <i>Davis:</i> whether a reasonable police officer in the position of Sergeant Craig would have treated James's invocation of the right to remain silent as ambiguous, thereby justifying the clarifying question that Sergeant Craig asked James. <i>Davis,</i> 512 U.S. at 459, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117863\"><a href=\"/opinion/117863/davis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2350</span></a></span>. The trial court was correct to answer that question affirmatively, and so was the SJC. Therefore, in summary, the decision of the SJC was neither contrary to <i>Smith,</i> nor an unreasonable application of <i>Davis.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
