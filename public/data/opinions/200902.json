John Denaro was sentenced to\n\n135   months   in   prison   after   pleading       guilty   to   one   count   of\n\nconspiracy to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine, three\n\ncounts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and two\n\ncounts of distribution of cocaine.1           He argues on appeal that the\n\ndistrict court should have allowed him to withdraw his guilty pleas\n\nprior to sentencing because the court did not advise him at the\n\nguilty plea hearing of the possibility that he could be subject to\n\na 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.               He also contends that the\n\ncourt attributed      more   cocaine    to    him    at   sentencing    than    was\n\npermitted under the indictment or warranted based on the evidence.\n\nFinally, he claims that the court erred in determining that he was\n\na manager or supervisor of a criminal activity that involved five\n\nor more persons.     We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\nA.         The Guilty Plea Hearing\n\n           Denaro pleaded guilty to the charges against him without\n\nthe benefit of a plea agreement.            At the outset of the hearing on\n\nthe proposed guilty pleas, the prosecutor explained to Denaro and\n\nthe court that Denaro faced a maximum possible prison sentence of\n\n40 years and a mandatory minimum sentence of at least five years\n\nbecause the charged conspiracy involved at least 500 grams of\n\ncocaine.   He then explained that the mandatory minimum sentence\n\n\n\n      1\n        The indictment included a criminal forfeiture count that\nhas no bearing on the appeal.\n\fwould increase to 10 years if the court determined at sentencing\n\nthat Denaro was responsible for at least five kilograms of cocaine.\n\nDenaro’s counsel responded by stating his view that the drug\n\nquantity specified in the indictment limited the mandatory minimum\n\nsentence to        five   years.   He     acknowledged,    however,     that   the\n\nprosecutor was free to argue otherwise at sentencing.\n\n             The court advised Denaro during the plea colloquy that he\n\nfaced maximum possible sentences of 40 years on the conspiracy\n\ncount and 20 years on each of the substantive counts.                  The court\n\nalso initially advised him that he was subject to a five-year\n\nmandatory minimum sentence. However, the court immediately revised\n\nits statement during the following exchange:\n\n                    COURT:     Because each count is a\n                    separate offense, the maximums get\n                    added up, so that the total maximum,\n                    if my math is correct, is 140 years\n                    in prison, a four-year period of\n                    supervised release, a fine of $7\n                    million, and a special assessment of\n                    $600, and a mandatory minimum also\n                    of five years. The government says,\n                    conceivably, ten years, but that’s\n                    in dispute. Do you understand that?\n\n                    WITNESS:    Yes.\n\nB.           The PSR\n\n             Denaro’s Presentence Report (“PSR”) concluded that he was\n\nsubject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 21\n\nU.S.C.   §   841(b)(1)(A)       because    he    was   responsible     for   7.066\n\nkilograms     of     cocaine.      The     PSR   based    its   drug    quantity\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fdetermination on: (1) 412.32 grams that were seized from Denaro;\n\n(2) 1,652 grams that were derived from drug ledgers; (3) 50 grams\n\nthat were attributed to Denaro by Jonathan Pierce, a distributor\n\nwho worked for Denaro; and (4) 4,952 grams that were attributed to\n\nDenaro by Kyle Visco, a cooperating coconspirator.\n\n            The PSR also proposed a four level increase in Denaro’s\n\noffense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a) because it concluded\n\nthat Denaro was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that\n\ninvolved five or more persons.               The PSR named Denaro, Pierce,\n\nVisco, Denaro’s principal supplier, Yolieda Aquire, and one of his\n\ndistributors, Tiffany Franklin, as the five participants in the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            Denaro objected to the PSR on the grounds that the\n\nindictment limited the amount of cocaine that could be attributed\n\nto   him   to   4,999   grams,   the   drug     quantity   determination   was\n\nexcessive, and the proposed role in the offense adjustment was\n\nunwarranted.\n\nC.          The Sentencing Hearing\n\n            Denaro moved to withdraw his guilty plea during the\n\nsentencing hearing because he claimed that the district court\n\nfailed to properly advise him of the possibility that he could be\n\nsubject to      a   10-year   mandatory      minimum   sentence.   The   court\n\nrejected his motion because it determined that Denaro had knowledge\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fof the potential penalties he faced when he entered his guilty\n\npleas.\n\n           The court then turned to Denaro’s objections to the PSR.\n\nAfter hearing testimony from Visco concerning his dealings with\n\nDenaro, the court determined that he was responsible for more than\n\nsix kilograms of cocaine.          It also concluded that Denaro should\n\nreceive a three level role adjustment rather than the four level\n\nadjustment    proposed   by    the    PSR    because   he   was   a   manager    or\n\nsupervisor but not an organizer or leader of a criminal activity\n\nthat   involved   five   or    more    participants.        After     making    the\n\nnecessary adjustments required by the sentencing guidelines, the\n\ncourt determined that Denaro’s sentencing range was 135 to 168\n\nmonths.   The court selected a sentence at the bottom of the range.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.           The Guilty Plea\n\n           Denaro first argues that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his request to withdraw his guilty plea because the court\n\nfailed to properly advise him at the guilty plea hearing that he\n\ncould be subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.\n\n           This claim does not require extended analysis.               Although\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1) requires a court to “inform the defendant\n\nof, and determine that the defendant understands” any mandatory\n\nminimum penalty     before    it     accepts   a   guilty   plea,     the   record\n\ndemonstrates that the court complied with this requirement by\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fadvising Denaro of the government’s contention that he could be\n\nsubject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.    Given Denaro’s\n\nstatement at the plea hearing that he understood that he faced this\n\npossibility and the absence of any other evidence in the record\n\nsuggesting that he was confused about the issue, the district court\n\nacted properly in denying his request to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\nB.        The Indictment\n\n          Denaro next argues that the court attributed more cocaine\n\nto him for sentencing purposes than the indictment permitted.2   His\n\nargument proceeds in several steps.     First, he notes that the\n\nindictment alleged that the conspiracy involved “at least” 500\n\ngrams of cocaine, an amount that is sufficient to trigger a\n\npossible 40-year maximum sentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\nSecond, because § 841(b)(1)(B) covers conspiracies that involve at\n\nleast 500 grams but no more than five kilograms of cocaine, he\n\nreasons that the maximum amount of cocaine that the court could\n\nattribute to him for any purpose is 4,999 grams.3   He then argues\n\n\n     2\n        Denaro casts his argument as a material variance claim but\nthis is clearly wrong.      A material variance arises when the\nindictment differs substantially from the proof offered at trial.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1998).\nSuch claims become moot when a defendant avoids trial by pleading\nguilty. For the reasons that we explain, however, Denaro’s claim\nfails regardless of how it is characterized.\n\n     3\n        He attempts to bolster this portion of his argument by\nnoting that the version of the indictment he plead guilty to\nsuperceded an indictment that charged an amount in excess of five\nkilograms.\n\n                               -6-\n\fthat the proof varied materially from the indictment because the\n\ncourt attributed more than six kilograms of cocaine to him at\n\nsentencing.\n\n             This argument is fatally flawed because it is based on\n\nthe mistaken premise that a drug quantity allegation such as the\n\none at issue here caps the amount of cocaine that can be attributed\n\nto a defendant at sentencing in the same way that it limits a\n\ndefendant’s maximum sentence under § 841(b)(1)(B).                It does not.\n\nSee United States v. Goodine, 326 F.3d 26, 32-33 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nInstead, when an indictment alleges a drug quantity of “at least”\n\na specified amount, the sentencing court is free to attribute\n\nwhatever drug quantity the evidence warrants to a defendant as long\n\nas    the   defendant’s   sentence     does    not   exceed   the   applicable\n\nstatutory maximum sentence.        See United States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353\n\nF.3d, 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).            Accordingly, we reject Denaro’s\n\nargument that the drug quantity specified in his indictment capped\n\nthe    amount   of    cocaine   that   could   be    attributed     to   him   at\n\nsentencing.\n\nC.           The Drug Quantity Determination\n\n             Denaro next argues that the district court erred in\n\ncrediting Visco’s testimony concerning the amount of cocaine that\n\nDenaro sold during the life of the conspiracy.           This argument is a\n\nnon-starter.         As we have held on many occasions, credibility\n\ndeterminations at sentencing are the exclusive province of the\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fdistrict court.    See United States v. Sanchez, 354 F.3d 70, 83 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d 78, 85 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1163, 1198 (1st Cir.\n\n1993). The district court chose to believe Visco and his testimony\n\nwas sufficient to support the court’s drug quantity determination.\n\nThat ends the matter.\n\nD.        The Role in the Offense Adjustment\n\n          The district court gave Denaro a three-level enhancement\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b) because it determined that he was\n\na manager or supervisor of a criminal activity that involved five\n\nor more persons.       Denaro does not challenge the district court’s\n\ndetermination that he was a manager or supervisor.            Instead, he\n\nfaults   the   court    for   failing    to   specifically   identify   the\n\nparticipants in the conspiracy and argues that the record doesn’t\n\nsupport the court’s general finding that the conspiracy involved at\n\nleast five such participants.\n\n           Denaro’s first argument fails because we have determined\n\nthat a sentencing court need not make specific findings when\n\napplying a role adjustment if “the record clearly reflects the\n\nbasis of the court’s determination.” See United States v. Marrero-\n\nOrtiz, 160 F.3d 768, 779 (1st Cir. 1998).           Only four persons in\n\naddition to the defendant are needed to satisfy the five person\n\nrequirement, see United States v. Preakos, 907 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n1990), and the PSR specifically identified four of the defendant’s\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fcoconspirators as participants.      Under these circumstances, the\n\ncourt did not need to specifically name the participants to justify\n\nits determination that the adjustment was warranted.\n\n          Denaro’s second argument fares no better.        The PSR\n\nprovided a detailed description of the roles that each of the named\n\nparticipants played in the conspiracy and Visco’s testimony at the\n\nsentencing hearing served as further corroboration.      The record\n\nthus contains ample evidence to justify the court’s conclusion that\n\nthe four individuals named in the PSR were all active participants\n\nin the conspiracy.    Since Denaro does not challenge the court’s\n\nconclusion that he was a manager or supervisor of the conspiracy,\n\nthe court’s three-level role in the offense adjustment was proper.\n\n                               III.\n\n          We affirm the actions of the court below because Denaro\n\nwas informed of the applicable mandatory minimum sentence when he\n\nagreed to plead guilty and the court’s sentencing determinations\n\nwere within its discretion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

The PSR named Denaro, Pierce,\n\nVisco, Denaro’s principal supplier, Yolieda Aquire, and one of his\n\ndistributors, Tiffany Franklin, as the five participants in the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n            Denaro objected to the PSR on the grounds that the\n\nindictment limited the amount of cocaine that could be attributed\n\nto   him   to   4,999   grams,   the   drug     quantity   determination   was\n\nexcessive, and the proposed role in the offense adjustment was\n\nunwarranted.\n\nC.          The Sentencing Hearing\n\n            Denaro moved to withdraw his guilty plea during the\n\nsentencing hearing because he claimed that the district court\n\nfailed to properly advise him of the possibility that he could be\n\nsubject to      a   10-year   mandatory      minimum   sentence.   The   court\n\nrejected his motion because it determined that Denaro had knowledge\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fof the potential penalties he faced when he entered his guilty\n\npleas.\n\n           The court then turned to Denaro’s objections to the PSR.\n\nAfter hearing testimony from Visco concerning his dealings with\n\nDenaro, the court determined that he was responsible for more than\n\nsix kilograms of cocaine.          It also concluded that Denaro should\n\nreceive a three level role adjustment rather than the four level\n\nadjustment    proposed   by    the    PSR    because   he   was   a   manager    or\n\nsupervisor but not an organizer or leader of a criminal activity\n\nthat   involved   five   or    more    participants.        After     making    the\n\nnecessary adjustments required by the sentencing guidelines, the\n\ncourt determined that Denaro’s sentencing range was 135 to 168\n\nmonths.   The court selected a sentence at the bottom of the range.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.           The Guilty Plea\n\n           Denaro first argues that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his request to withdraw his guilty plea because the court\n\nfailed to properly advise him at the guilty plea hearing that he\n\ncould be subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.\n\n           This claim does not require extended analysis.               Although\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1) requires a court to “inform the defendant\n\nof, and determine that the defendant understands” any mandatory\n\nminimum penalty     before    it     accepts   a   guilty   plea,     the   record\n\ndemonstrates that the court complied with this requirement by\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fadvising Denaro of the government’s contention that he could be\n\nsubject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.    Given Denaro’s\n\nstatement at the plea hearing that he understood that he faced this\n\npossibility and the absence of any other evidence in the record\n\nsuggesting that he was confused about the issue, the district court\n\nacted properly in denying his request to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\nB.        The Indictment\n\n          Denaro next argues that the court attributed more cocaine\n\nto him for sentencing purposes than the indictment permitted.2   His\n\nargument proceeds in several steps.     First, he notes that the\n\nindictment alleged that the conspiracy involved “at least” 500\n\ngrams of cocaine, an amount that is sufficient to trigger a\n\npossible 40-year maximum sentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\nSecond, because § 841(b)(1)(B) covers conspiracies that involve at\n\nleast 500 grams but no more than five kilograms of cocaine, he\n\nreasons that the maximum amount of cocaine that the court could\n\nattribute to him for any purpose is 4,999 grams.3   He then argues\n\n\n     2\n        Denaro casts his argument as a material variance claim but\nthis is clearly wrong.      A material variance arises when the\nindictment differs substantially from the proof offered at trial.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Torres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198221\"><a href=\"/opinion/198221/united-states-v-torres/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1st Cir. 1998).\nSuch claims become moot when a defendant avoids trial by pleading\nguilty. For the reasons that we explain, however, Denaro’s claim\nfails regardless of how it is characterized.\n\n     3\n        He attempts to bolster this portion of his argument by\nnoting that the version of the indictment he plead guilty to\nsuperceded an indictment that charged an amount in excess of five\nkilograms.\n\n                               -6-\n\fthat the proof varied materially from the indictment because the\n\ncourt attributed more than six kilograms of cocaine to him at\n\nsentencing.\n\n             This argument is fatally flawed because it is based on\n\nthe mistaken premise that a drug quantity allegation such as the\n\none at issue here caps the amount of cocaine that can be attributed\n\nto a defendant at sentencing in the same way that it limits a\n\ndefendant’s maximum sentence under § 841(b)(1)(B).                It does not.\n\nSee United States v. Goodine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781604\"><a href=\"/opinion/781604/united-states-v-brian-goodine-aka-dwayne-goodine/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32-33 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nInstead, when an indictment alleges a drug quantity of “at least”\n\na specified amount, the sentencing court is free to attribute\n\nwhatever drug quantity the evidence warrants to a defendant as long\n\nas    the   defendant’s   sentence     does    not   exceed   the   applicable\n\nstatutory maximum sentence.        See United States v. Perez-Ruiz, 353\n\nF.3d, 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).            Accordingly, we reject Denaro’s\n\nargument that the drug quantity specified in his indictment capped\n\nthe    amount   of    cocaine   that   could   be    attributed     to   him   at\n\nsentencing.\n\nC.           The Drug Quantity Determination\n\n             Denaro next argues that the district court erred in\n\ncrediting Visco’s testimony concerning the amount of cocaine that\n\nDenaro sold during the life of the conspiracy.           This argument is a\n\nnon-starter.         As we have held on many occasions, credibility\n\ndeterminations at sentencing are the exclusive province of the\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fdistrict court.    See United States v. Sanchez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200801\"><a href=\"/opinion/200801/united-states-v-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); United States v. Conley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198112\"><a href=\"/opinion/198112/united-states-v-conley/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85 (1st Cir.\n\n1998); United States v. Sepulveda, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1163</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1198 (1st Cir.\n\n1993). The district court chose to believe Visco and his testimony\n\nwas sufficient to support the court’s drug quantity determination.\n\nThat ends the matter.\n\nD.        The Role in the Offense Adjustment\n\n          The district court gave Denaro a three-level enhancement\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(b) because it determined that he was\n\na manager or supervisor of a criminal activity that involved five\n\nor more persons.       Denaro does not challenge the district court’s\n\ndetermination that he was a manager or supervisor.            Instead, he\n\nfaults   the   court    for   failing    to   specifically   identify   the\n\nparticipants in the conspiracy and argues that the record doesn’t\n\nsupport the court’s general finding that the conspiracy involved at\n\nleast five such participants.\n\n           Denaro’s first argument fails because we have determined\n\nthat a sentencing court need not make specific findings when\n\napplying a role adjustment if “the record clearly reflects the\n\nbasis of the court’s determination.” See United States v. Marrero-\n\nOrtiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198207\"><a href=\"/opinion/198207/united-states-v-marrero-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 779 (1st Cir. 1998).           Only four persons in\n\naddition to the defendant are needed to satisfy the five person\n\nrequirement, see United States v. Preakos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543832\"><a href=\"/opinion/543832/united-states-v-darrell-walter-preakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n1990), and the PSR specifically identified four of the defendant’s\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fcoconspirators as participants.      Under these circumstances, the\n\ncourt did not need to specifically name the participants to justify\n\nits determination that the adjustment was warranted.\n\n          Denaro’s second argument fares no better.        The PSR\n\nprovided a detailed description of the roles that each of the named\n\nparticipants played in the conspiracy and Visco’s testimony at the\n\nsentencing hearing served as further corroboration.      The record\n\nthus contains ample evidence to justify the court’s conclusion that\n\nthe four individuals named in the PSR were all active participants\n\nin the conspiracy.    Since Denaro does not challenge the court’s\n\nconclusion that he was a manager or supervisor of the conspiracy,\n\nthe court’s three-level role in the offense adjustment was proper.\n\n                               III.\n\n          We affirm the actions of the court below because Denaro\n\nwas informed of the applicable mandatory minimum sentence when he\n\nagreed to plead guilty and the court’s sentencing determinations\n\nwere within its discretion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f</pre>",
