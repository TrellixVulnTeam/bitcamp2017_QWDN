FIUMARA,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                      v.\n\n              PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE,\n\n                         Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n            APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n           [Hon. Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                           Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Farris*, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jeffrey R. Mazer with whom Mazer Law Group, LLC was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Robert P. Joy with whom Daniel S. Field, Robert P. Morris, and\nMorgan, Brown, & Joy, LLP were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                                May 1, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           FARRIS, Circuit Judge.           The record satisfies us that\n\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact for trial.               We review\n\ngrants of summary judgment de novo.             Okmyansky v. Herbalife Int’l\n\nof America, Inc., 415 F.3d 154, 158 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           It   is    the   plaintiff’s     burden to show that material\n\nquestions of fact exist.        See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n\n317, 322, 324 (1986).        To do so in this matter, the plaintiff must\n\nshow that he (1) is statutorily impaired under the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (2000), (2) is a qualified\n\nindividual who has the requisite skill, experience, education, and\n\nother job-related requirements for his position, (3) can perform\n\nthe essential functions of his position with or without reasonable\n\naccommodations, and (4) was discharged because of his disability.\n\nCriado v. IBM Corp., 145 F.3d 437, 441 (1st Cir. 1998).               Fiumara\n\nfailed to show that he was a qualified individual under the ADA. He\n\nalso had no commercial “Class B” driver’s license at the time of\n\nhis termination, a requirement for his job, and he failed to\n\nrequest a change of date of a scheduled health examination in a\n\n“sufficiently direct and specific” manner.             See Phelps v. Optima\n\nHealth, Inc., 251 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir. 2001).             State law standards\n\nfor Fiumara’s disability claim under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B, § 4\n\n(2009),   are   not   more    generous     to    Fiumara   than   federal   law\n\nstandards. See Russell v. Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc., 772 N.E.2d\n\n1054, 1063 (Mass. 2002).\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f             An   accommodation that inherently breaches existing\n\nemployee agreements is not a reasonable accommodation.             See Laurin\n\nv.   Providence    Hosp.,   150   F.3d     52,   56-61   (1st   Cir.     1998).\n\nSimilarly, indefinite leave is not a reasonable accommodation under\n\nthe ADA.     See Watkins v. J & S Oil, 164 F.3d 55, 61-62 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).   Harvard was neither required to give Fiumara a position as\n\na bus driver, nor to grant Fiumara indefinite leave.\n\n             To prove retaliation under Massachusetts state law, a\n\nplaintiff must show that he was engaged in protected behavior, “and\n\nthat   the   employer’s   decision   to    retaliate     against   him   was   a\n\ndeterminative factor in its decision to terminate his employment.”\n\nAbramian v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 731 N.E.2d\n\n1075, 1087-88 (Mass. 2000).       As the District Court noted, nothing\n\nin the record suggests that Fiumara was engaged in protected\n\nbehavior prior to his termination, Fiumara v. President and Fellows\n\nof Harvard College, 526 F. Supp. 2d 150, 159 (D. Mass. 2007), or\n\nthat Harvard desired to retaliate against him.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f",
