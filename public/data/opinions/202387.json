Petitioners     Dritan   Vaka,\n\nRanola Vaka, and Briana Vaka (collectively, the \"Vakas\") seek\n\nreview of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\ndenying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").                       For the\n\nreasons set forth below, we affirm the BIA's decision and deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                 I.     Background\n\n            Dritan and Ranola Vaka are married and the parents of\n\nBriana Vaka.       All three are citizens of Albania who entered the\n\nUnited    States   on    or    about    December   19,    2000,1    without   being\n\nlawfully inspected, admitted or paroled.                  On November 19, 2001,\n\nDritan filed an application for asylum, alleging persecution on\n\naccount    of   his     political      opinion.2     On    June    12,   2002,   the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")3 served Dritan with\n\na Notice to Appear, charging the Vakas with removability under\n\n\n\n1\n  The exact date of the Vakas' arrival in the United States is not\ncertain. However, the Government does not dispute the assertion\nthat the entry occurred around this time.\n2\n   Dritan Vaka is the lead petitioner in this case and the only\nindividual claiming to have suffered persecution. His wife and\ndaughter's applications for asylum are derivative of his own,\ndepending wholly on the merits of Dritan's claim.\n3\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized as the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For clarity, the agency will continue to be referred to\nas the INS throughout this opinion.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f§ 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).\n\n          At a hearing before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") on\n\nNovember 4, 2002, the Vakas admitted the allegations against them\n\nand conceded removability.     On March 5, 2004, the Vakas again\n\nappeared before the IJ, and Dritan presented testimony detailing\n\nthe family's experiences in Albania prior to their departure for\n\nthe United States.4\n\n          Dritan was born April 24, 1970 in the town of Kelcyre-\n\nPermet (\"Permet\").    Professionally, he was employed as a taxicab\n\ndriver and owned a cinema with his father. Politically, Dritan had\n\nbeen a member of Albania's Democratic Party (\"DP\") since February\n\n1992. Rather than maintain separate spheres for business and\n\npolitics, Dritan allowed the two aspects of his life to complement\n\neach other; when he was not working, he volunteered his taxi\n\nservices as a chauffeur for local DP officials and opened his\n\ncinema doors to host DP meetings.     Furthermore, he participated in\n\nparty meetings and distributed literature encouraging people to\n\nvote.\n\n          Dritan testified that his political activism made him the\n\ntarget of abuse on several different occasions. The first incident\n\noccurred in 1987 while Dritan was a high school student.      Dritan\n\n\n\n4\n  Ranola also presented testimony generally corroborating Dritan's\naccount.\n\n                                -3-\n\fopposed Albania's Communist government, and while talking with\n\nfriends one day, he expressed his belief that the state's policy of\n\nforcing students to work on the weekends was \"not right.\"                    When\n\nauthorities learned of his comments, Dritan was pulled out of\n\nschool, taken to the local police station, and beaten. Thereafter,\n\nhe was not permitted to return to school and was forced to complete\n\nhis education through night classes.\n\n              The next incident did not occur until March 1997 while he\n\nwas helping the DP prepare for upcoming elections.             While driving\n\nhome from a party rally in Permet one night, he was stopped by a\n\ngroup of men wearing masks and wielding automatic rifles.               Dritan\n\nimmediately recognized two of the men as members of the local\n\nbranch   of    the   Socialist   Party,    which   he   believed   to   be    the\n\nsuccessor of the former Communist regime.               The armed men forced\n\nDritan from the car, levied insults at him, beat him, threatened\n\nhim with the guns they carried, and stole his car.           Although Dritan\n\nwas eventually able to recover the vehicle, it was abandoned twelve\n\nmiles away and heavily vandalized.          Following this attack, Dritan\n\nwent to live with his uncle some six hours away.           However, he still\n\nmanaged to return to Permet in time to participate in elections\n\nheld in June 1997.\n\n              Dritan further testified that in June 1999, as elections\n\napproached in October, members of the Socialist Party searched his\n\nhome, threatened him, and damaged his cinema to such an extent that\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fhe chose to cease operating it as movie theater.                    However, the\n\ncinema continued to be used to host DP meetings.             Then in September\n\nof 2000, several men came to the Vakas' home, threatened the\n\nfamily, and physically abused Dritan.            As evidence of the severity\n\nof the attack, Dritan testified that he received care at the local\n\nhospital for a cut above his eye.              Additionally, the assailants\n\nfatally shot the family dog as they left the home.\n\n             Although he continued to work during the day, Dritan\n\nclaimed that he no longer went out at night as a result of these\n\nincidents.     However, he remained in Albania through the elections\n\nof October 2000 and into November, when he and his family finally\n\nleft the country permanently.                Traveling with valid Albanian\n\npassports personally issued to both Dritan and Ranola some six or\n\nseven years earlier, the Vakas first traveled to Greece, then\n\nItaly,     then    France.     In    France    they     obtained    false   Greek\n\ndocumentation and used it to travel to Belgium, then Spain, and\n\nfinally Mexico.        From Mexico the Vakas crossed into the United\n\nStates illegally, apparently sometime around December 2000.                 Once\n\nin   the   United    States,   the    Vakas    joined    Dritan's    brother,   a\n\nnaturalized United States citizen, and Dritan's parents.\n\n             Following the hearing of March 5, 2004, the IJ issued her\n\ndecision.         The IJ found that Dritan and Ranola had testified\n\ncredibly and that Dritan \"has been harmed in the past on account of\n\nhis political activities.\"          Emphasizing this point in reference to\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe 1997 car theft, the IJ specifically stated, \"The Court wants to\n\nmake a finding that these actions could not have been motivated for\n\ncriminal    intents   since   nothing      was    stolen.\"    Despite     these\n\nconclusions, the IJ held that the Vakas were not eligible for\n\nasylum.    In making this determination, the IJ relied on several\n\ndistinct lines of reasoning.\n\n            First, the IJ suggested that the Vakas' real motivation\n\nfor coming to the United States may have been to reunite with\n\nfamily, rather than escape persecution.               The IJ noted that the\n\nfamily apparently had the option of remaining in Greece with\n\nDritan's sister who lives and works there.              The Vakas could also\n\nhave sought protection in any number of western European countries.\n\nHighlighting this point, the IJ pointed out that Dritan could have\n\nfled ever since his Albanian passport was first issued in 1993 or\n\n1994,5    but   instead   remained    in    Albania     in   order   to    make\n\narrangements to travel to the United States.\n\n            Second, the IJ suggested that the degree of harm and the\n\nnature of risk experienced by Dritan were not severe enough to\n\ntrigger asylum eligibility.          The IJ noted that the attacks and\n\nthreats only occurred sporadically.              Furthermore, Dritan was not\n\n\n\n5\n  By the court's calculation, this would have been when Dritan and\nRanola received their Albanian passports. Although the original\ndocuments were never presented before the IJ, Dritan testified that\nthey had received the passports some six or seven years prior to\nthe departure from Albania. The IJ accepted this assertion as true\nand cited the testimony in her decision.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fprevented from working or owning property and, even after the final\n\nassault, he continued to participate in the DP and hold meetings at\n\nhis cinema.    The IJ also pointed to the fact that the Vakas did not\n\nleave Albania until two months after the last incident of abuse.\n\n           Third, the IJ noted \"the fact that conditions appear to\n\nbe improving in Albania\" and recognized the presence of \"general\n\nimprovements\" regarding levels of electoral violence. The decision\n\nalso noted that the Country Report for Albania, issued by the State\n\nDepartment    in    2003,      indicated    that   conditions     had   \"steadily\n\nimproved.\"     In sum, while the IJ recognized that elections have\n\nbeen plagued by problems in the past, that corruption persists, and\n\nthat human rights abuses still occur in Albania, the IJ found it\n\nprobative that the political process was becoming less irregular.\n\n           Thus, the IJ denied the Vakas' application for asylum,\n\nholding \"the risk of harm does not rise to the well-founded\n\nstandard.\"     With their asylum claim denied, the IJ granted the\n\nVakas voluntary departure from the United States, in lieu of\n\nremoval.     The Vakas then filed a timely appeal to the BIA, which\n\naffirmed     the    IJ's    decision   on    November     8,    2005.    Without\n\nelaborating,       the   BIA    concurred    in    the   IJ's   conclusion   that\n\n\"[a]lthough the lead respondent experienced past harm on account of\n\nhis political opinion, we agree that this mistreatment does not\n\nrise to the level of persecution.\"            Therefore, the BIA found that\n\nthe Vakas failed to meet their burden and issued an order denying\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\ftheir appeal. Pursuant to the IJ's ruling, the BIA further ordered\n\nthe Vakas to voluntarily depart the United States within 60 days or\n\nbe subject to removal.         The Vakas now petition this court for\n\nreview of the BIA's decision.\n\n                             II.   Discussion\n\n             A.   Applicable Law\n\n             Under the INA, the Attorney General has the authority to\n\ngrant asylum to any individual who qualifies as a refugee.                 8\n\nU.S.C.   §   1158(b)(1)(A).6       The    INA   defines   \"refugee\"   as   an\n\nindividual who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her\n\ncountry of nationality \"because of persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in particular social group, or political opinion.\"              8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).       Government regulations interpreting the\n\nINA provide two separate avenues by which an alien may establish\n\nthe he or she qualifies as a refugee: 1) by showing a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution; or 2) by showing the existence of past\n\npersecution, thereby raising a regulatory presumption of a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.              See Palma-Mazariegos v.\n\nGonzáles, 428 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)-\n\n(2).\n\n\n\n6\n   Following the reorganization of the INS that occurred after the\ncreation of the Department of Homeland Security, the INA was\namended to give the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to\ngrant asylum as well. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A).\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           In order to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution,      the     asylum   applicant     must   meet    subjective       and\n\nobjective elements; that is the fear of persecution must be both\n\ngenuine and objectively reasonable. See Palma-Mazariegos, 428 F.3d\n\nat 35.   Additionally, a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\nrequires \"a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if\n\n[the applicant] were to return to [his or her] country,\" and the\n\nanticipated persecution must be committed because of one of the\n\nfive statutorily protected grounds.            8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2).\n\n           As noted, an alien also may become eligible for asylum by\n\nshowing that he or she has suffered from past persecution.                         8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b).           As with the fear of future persecution, the\n\npast persecution must have been committed on the basis of one of\n\nthe five protected grounds.            8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).             Once the\n\nasylum applicant has demonstrated past persecution, a presumption\n\nof a well-founded fear of future persecution also arises.                        Id.\n\nHowever, the Government may rebut this presumption by establishing\n\nthat   changed    country       conditions    have   removed     the    threat    of\n\npersecution or by demonstrating that the alien can safely relocate\n\nwithin   his     or     her   native   country    without      fear    of    further\n\npersecution.     8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i).\n\n           Although federal regulations provide a coherent structure\n\nfor the adjudication of asylum claims once the existence of past\n\npersecution or the likelihood of future persecution is determined,\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fthey provide little insight as to what sort of conduct actually\n\nconstitutes \"persecution.\" See generally 8 C.F.R. § 208.13. Thus,\n\nthe INA and INS regulations largely leave the exact import of the\n\nterm to be determined by judicial exposition.          See Nelson v. INS,\n\n232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).          To that end, the case law of\n\nthis circuit indicates that proving the existence of persecution is\n\na fairly difficult burden to meet.         See Guzmán v. INS, 327 F.3d 11,\n\n15 (1st Cir. 2003).        We have held that the fact that an alien has\n\nendured some physical abuse does not necessarily mean that the\n\nincident should be classified as \"persecution,\" even when the abuse\n\nis suffered because of one of the five protected grounds.             See id.\n\nat 16 (finding that a \"one-time kidnaping and beating falls well\n\nshort of establishing 'past persecution'\"); Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d\n\nat 264 (finding that substantial evidence supported an IJ's ruling\n\nthat three incidents of detainment lasting less than 72 hours each,\n\nall accompanied by some physical abuse, did not rise to the level\n\nof persecution); Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 756-60 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (finding no persecution where a member of a minority ethnic\n\ngroup had been interrogated and beaten for three days in prison and\n\nwarned about pursuing political activities).\n\n           To    qualify    as   persecution,   the   harm    suffered     must\n\nrepresent more than \"episodic violence or sporadic abuse.\"                Palma-\n\nMazariegos, 428 F.3d at 37.        Furthermore, the nature of the harm\n\n\"must   rise    above   unpleasantness,     harassment,      and   even   basic\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fsuffering.\"          Nelson, 232 F.3d at 263.              Beyond these few guiding\n\nprinciples,          however,       whether     particular        conduct     constitutes\n\npersecution must be determined on an ad hoc basis.                           See Aguilar-\n\nSolís v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 570 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            We       review     the    BIA's        denial   of    asylum      under      the\n\ndeferential      substantial          evidence       standard.       Lan     Zhu    Pan    v.\n\nGonzáles, 445 F.3d 60, 61 (1st Cir. 2006).                         The BIA's decision\n\npasses muster under this standard if \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\" INS v. Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992). However,\n\nif \"the record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to\n\nmake a contrary determination,\" we are obliged to overturn the\n\nholding.        Aguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 569.                     Since we are not\n\ncompelled       to     reach    a     conclusion       contrary     to      the    decision\n\npromulgated below, we affirm the BIA's order.\n\n            B.       Past Persecution\n\n            First, we believe substantial evidence exists to support\n\nthe BIA's conclusion that Dritan's experiences did not rise to the\n\nlevel of past persecution, even though he suffered some harm\n\nbecause    of    his     support      for     the    DP.     The   mere     existence      of\n\npolitically          motivated       abuse,     though       deplorable,          does    not\n\nnecessarily indicate that persecution has taken place. See Guzmán,\n\n327 F.3d at 15.          As noted, \"episodic violence or sporadic abuse\"\n\ndoes not reach the level of past persecution.                        Palma-Mazariegos,\n\n\n                                              -11-\n\f428 F.3d at 37.    The three incidents in which Dritan suffered harm\n\nas a result of his affiliation with the DP could be fairly\n\ncharacterized as episodic and sporadic, having occurred over the\n\ncourse of three and a half years and each separated by at least\n\nfourteen months.\n\n          As the IJ also noted, Dritan continued to work and openly\n\nsupported the DP for the duration of the alleged persecution.7\n\nAccording to his own testimony, he was not deterred from voting in\n\nelections in 1997, 1999, or 2000.       Furthermore, even after his\n\nfamily was threatened and his cinema damaged, he continued to host\n\nDP meetings.   Thus, despite the occasional episodes of physical\n\nabuse, Dritan was largely able to continue participating in both\n\n\n7\n   The BIA appears to have implicitly adopted this rationale when\nit affirmed the IJ's holding, writing, \"Although the lead\nrespondent experienced past harm on account of his political\nopinion, we agree that this mistreatment does not rise to the level\nof persecution.\" When the BIA defers to or adopts the decision of\nthe IJ, a court of appeals must then directly review the decision\nof the IJ. Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).\nThis also seems to be permissible when the BIA offers only \"a brief\nexplanatory order,\" as is the case here. Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377\nF.3d 89, 94 & 98 (1st Cir. 2004) (performing a substantial evidence\nreview of the IJ's decision under these circumstances). Moreover,\nas the Government points out in its brief, there is some indication\nin the INS's explanation of its own regulations that the courts of\nappeals should be somewhat more open to reviewing the IJ when the\nBIA decision is issued by a single Board member, as is also the\ncase here. See Board of Immigration Appeals: Procedural Reforms to\nImprove Case Management, Part III, 67 Fed. Reg. 54,878, 54,886\n(Aug. 26, 2002) (suggesting as an example that when a single-member\nBIA   decision   adopts   the  IJ   decision   but  with   specific\nmodifications, \"any reviewing court would be able to look to the\ncombination of the immigration judge's opinion and the single-\nmember decision to understand the conclusions reached in the\nadjudication\").\n\n                                 -12-\n\fhis professional and political life.                   Although we do not seek to\n\nminimize     the   severity      of   the     Vakas'    experiences,        we    are   not\n\ncompelled to find that the harm suffered by Dritan rose to the\n\nlevel of persecution.\n\n              C.   Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n              Since the Vakas failed to establish past persecution,\n\nthey are not entitled to the regulatory presumption of a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).\n\nNevertheless,       they     are      still       afforded     the   opportunity         to\n\ndemonstrate such a fear by direct evidence.                    See Palma-Mazariegos,\n\n428 F.3d at 34.            For the following reasons, we conclude that\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that Dritan\n\nfailed   to    show    he    possessed        a    well-founded      fear    of    future\n\npersecution should he return to Albania.\n\n              First,   substantial        evidence      existed      to   support       the\n\nfinding that any fear of future political persecution was not\n\nobjectively reasonable because of changed country conditions within\n\nAlbania.      At the hearing before the IJ, the Government introduced\n\ntwo State Department documents on conditions in Albania, the 2003\n\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices (\"Country Report\"),                           and\n\nthe   2001     Profile      of   Asylum       Claims     and    Country      Conditions\n\n(\"Profile\") for Albania. United States Department of State, Bureau\n\nof Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Albania: Country Reports on\n\nHuman Rights Practices - 2003, (2004); United States Department of\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fState, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Albania:\n\nProfile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions (2001).                        The\n\ndocuments tend to show that changed country conditions within\n\nAlbania are such that asylum-seekers may no longer have a well-\n\nfounded    fear    of   future      persecution    based   on   their    political\n\nopinion.      For example the Profile states, \"elections held in\n\nOctober 2000 made clear and unmistakable progress toward meeting\n\ndemocratic standards.\"         Notably, these were the last elections in\n\nwhich Dritan participated, as the family left the country only a\n\nmonth afterward.         The Country Report describes a similar trend\n\ncontinuing through the elections of October of 2002, stating\n\n\"[o]verall, the municipal elections were a major step forward, with\n\ngood performances by the police, many local election officials, and\n\nelectoral institutions.\"             Admittedly, the Country Report also\n\ndescribes      ongoing     human      rights      violations    and     systematic\n\ndeficiencies in the political process.              Still, the general tone of\n\nthe   Report      is    that   of    a   continuously      improving    political\n\natmosphere.\n\n            The Vakas fault the IJ's reliance on these documents,\n\nciting the Seventh Circuit's observation that the State Department\n\n\"softpedals human rights violations by countries the United States\n\nwants to have good relations with.\"               Gramatikov v. INS, 128 F.3d\n\n619, 620 (7th Cir. 1997).           However, the Vakas offer no reason why\n\nthe State Department's views on Albania in particular should be\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fviewed with skepticism.           Furthermore, this circuit has stated that\n\nthe State Department's country reports \"are generally probative of\n\ncountry conditions.\" Palma-Mazariegos, 428 F.3d at 36. Despite the\n\nVakas'    assertions,       the    Country       Report     may   \"outweigh[]      the\n\npetitioner's conclusory assertions of continuing danger . . . .\"\n\nAguilar-Solís,      168    F.3d     at    572-73.          Therefore,    we   believe\n\nsubstantial evidence was present for the BIA to conclude that a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution did not exist, even though\n\nDritan had testified credibly regarding the past incidents of\n\nabuse.\n\n           Second, substantial evidence supports a finding that\n\nDritan's alleged fear was not subjectively genuine.                      As noted by\n\nthe IJ, it is quite possible that the Vakas' relocation was\n\nmotivated by a desire to come to the United States rather than a\n\nwish to flee Albania.             The Vakas passed through Greece, Italy,\n\nFrance, Belgium, Spain, and Mexico without seeking asylum, instead\n\ninsisting on continuing on to the United States.                  They even went as\n\nfar as obtaining fraudulent identification in order to leave France\n\nand continue their journey.              The fact that Dritan's brother and\n\nparents   already    reside       in     this    country    further     supports   the\n\nconclusion that the Vakas may have had an ulterior motive for\n\nleaving Albania.          As the Profile warns, \"[a]djudicators should\n\nexplore all the motivations an applicant might have for requesting\n\nasylum, including family members already present in the United\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fStates . . . .\"           Finally, the family's continued presence in\n\nAlbania for two months after the last assault on Dritan further\n\nundermines their allegation of a genuine fear.                  Thus, substantial\n\nevidence existed for the BIA to adopt the IJ's holding that Dritan\n\nfailed to meet his burden of proving a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.\n\n             C.   Withholding of Removal and CAT\n\n             Whereas      asylum    eligibility     only    requires       an   alien\n\ndemonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A), withholding of removal requires an alien to show\n\nthat   \"it   is   more     likely   than   not    that     he   or   she   would    be\n\npersecuted,\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).             In recognition of the fact\n\nthat the standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than\n\nthe standard for asylum, we have held that \"a petitioner unable to\n\nsatisfy the asylum standard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the\n\n[standard for withholding of removal].\"             Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d\n\n24, 27 (1st Cir. 2002) (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).         Since    the     Vakas   failed    to     established         asylum\n\neligibility, their claim for withholding of removal must also be\n\ndenied.\n\n             In regard to the Vakas' CAT claim, their brief offers no\n\ndeveloped argumentation as to why they qualify for relief.8                        Nor\n\n\n8\n   After briefly explaining the law, the Vakas simply state, \"the\nVakas should be granted withholding of removal under Article III of\nthe Convention Against Torture since there is a clear probability\n\n                                       -16-\n\fdid they sufficiently raise the issue before the BIA.           In holding\n\nwith well-established principles of appellate review, issues not\n\nraised below are deemed waived, as are issues unaccompanied by\n\ndeveloped argumentation.        See Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 761\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (\"Issues not raised before the Board may not be\n\nraised for the first time upon judicial review of the Board's\n\ndecisions.\"); Nikijuluw v. Gonzáles, 427 F.3d 115, 120 n.3 (1st\n\nCir.   2005)    (denying   an   asylum-seeker's   CAT   claim   where   the\n\npetitioner \"devoted his appellate brief exclusively to his asylum\n\nclaim and has failed to develop any argument supporting [his CAT\n\nclaim]\").      Thus, the Vakas' claims for withholding of removal and\n\nrelief under the CAT were properly denied.\n\n                            III.    Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we find the BIA's conclusions\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. Therefore, we deny the petition\n\nfor review and affirm the BIA's order.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nthey will suffer torture if returned to Albania.\" No explanation\nas to what the legal definition of \"torture\" is, or why the Vakas\nare likely to be subject to it, is given.\n\n                                    -17-\n\f",

Petitioners     Dritan   Vaka,\n\nRanola Vaka, and Briana Vaka (collectively, the \"Vakas\") seek\n\nreview of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\")\n\ndenying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\").                       For the\n\nreasons set forth below, we affirm the BIA's decision and deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n                                 I.     Background\n\n            Dritan and Ranola Vaka are married and the parents of\n\nBriana Vaka.       All three are citizens of Albania who entered the\n\nUnited    States   on    or    about    December   19,    2000,1    without   being\n\nlawfully inspected, admitted or paroled.                  On November 19, 2001,\n\nDritan filed an application for asylum, alleging persecution on\n\naccount    of   his     political      opinion.2     On    June    12,   2002,   the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")3 served Dritan with\n\na Notice to Appear, charging the Vakas with removability under\n\n\n\n1\n  The exact date of the Vakas' arrival in the United States is not\ncertain. However, the Government does not dispute the assertion\nthat the entry occurred around this time.\n2\n   Dritan Vaka is the lead petitioner in this case and the only\nindividual claiming to have suffered persecution. His wife and\ndaughter's applications for asylum are derivative of his own,\ndepending wholly on the merits of Dritan's claim.\n3\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized as the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(\"BICE\"). For clarity, the agency will continue to be referred to\nas the INS throughout this opinion.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f§ 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(A)(i).\n\n          At a hearing before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") on\n\nNovember 4, 2002, the Vakas admitted the allegations against them\n\nand conceded removability.     On March 5, 2004, the Vakas again\n\nappeared before the IJ, and Dritan presented testimony detailing\n\nthe family's experiences in Albania prior to their departure for\n\nthe United States.4\n\n          Dritan was born April 24, 1970 in the town of Kelcyre-\n\nPermet (\"Permet\").    Professionally, he was employed as a taxicab\n\ndriver and owned a cinema with his father. Politically, Dritan had\n\nbeen a member of Albania's Democratic Party (\"DP\") since February\n\n1992. Rather than maintain separate spheres for business and\n\npolitics, Dritan allowed the two aspects of his life to complement\n\neach other; when he was not working, he volunteered his taxi\n\nservices as a chauffeur for local DP officials and opened his\n\ncinema doors to host DP meetings.     Furthermore, he participated in\n\nparty meetings and distributed literature encouraging people to\n\nvote.\n\n          Dritan testified that his political activism made him the\n\ntarget of abuse on several different occasions. The first incident\n\noccurred in 1987 while Dritan was a high school student.      Dritan\n\n\n\n4\n  Ranola also presented testimony generally corroborating Dritan's\naccount.\n\n                                -3-\n\fopposed Albania's Communist government, and while talking with\n\nfriends one day, he expressed his belief that the state's policy of\n\nforcing students to work on the weekends was \"not right.\"                    When\n\nauthorities learned of his comments, Dritan was pulled out of\n\nschool, taken to the local police station, and beaten. Thereafter,\n\nhe was not permitted to return to school and was forced to complete\n\nhis education through night classes.\n\n              The next incident did not occur until March 1997 while he\n\nwas helping the DP prepare for upcoming elections.             While driving\n\nhome from a party rally in Permet one night, he was stopped by a\n\ngroup of men wearing masks and wielding automatic rifles.               Dritan\n\nimmediately recognized two of the men as members of the local\n\nbranch   of    the   Socialist   Party,    which   he   believed   to   be    the\n\nsuccessor of the former Communist regime.               The armed men forced\n\nDritan from the car, levied insults at him, beat him, threatened\n\nhim with the guns they carried, and stole his car.           Although Dritan\n\nwas eventually able to recover the vehicle, it was abandoned twelve\n\nmiles away and heavily vandalized.          Following this attack, Dritan\n\nwent to live with his uncle some six hours away.           However, he still\n\nmanaged to return to Permet in time to participate in elections\n\nheld in June 1997.\n\n              Dritan further testified that in June 1999, as elections\n\napproached in October, members of the Socialist Party searched his\n\nhome, threatened him, and damaged his cinema to such an extent that\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fhe chose to cease operating it as movie theater.                    However, the\n\ncinema continued to be used to host DP meetings.             Then in September\n\nof 2000, several men came to the Vakas' home, threatened the\n\nfamily, and physically abused Dritan.            As evidence of the severity\n\nof the attack, Dritan testified that he received care at the local\n\nhospital for a cut above his eye.              Additionally, the assailants\n\nfatally shot the family dog as they left the home.\n\n             Although he continued to work during the day, Dritan\n\nclaimed that he no longer went out at night as a result of these\n\nincidents.     However, he remained in Albania through the elections\n\nof October 2000 and into November, when he and his family finally\n\nleft the country permanently.                Traveling with valid Albanian\n\npassports personally issued to both Dritan and Ranola some six or\n\nseven years earlier, the Vakas first traveled to Greece, then\n\nItaly,     then    France.     In    France    they     obtained    false   Greek\n\ndocumentation and used it to travel to Belgium, then Spain, and\n\nfinally Mexico.        From Mexico the Vakas crossed into the United\n\nStates illegally, apparently sometime around December 2000.                 Once\n\nin   the   United    States,   the    Vakas    joined    Dritan's    brother,   a\n\nnaturalized United States citizen, and Dritan's parents.\n\n             Following the hearing of March 5, 2004, the IJ issued her\n\ndecision.         The IJ found that Dritan and Ranola had testified\n\ncredibly and that Dritan \"has been harmed in the past on account of\n\nhis political activities.\"          Emphasizing this point in reference to\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe 1997 car theft, the IJ specifically stated, \"The Court wants to\n\nmake a finding that these actions could not have been motivated for\n\ncriminal    intents   since   nothing      was    stolen.\"    Despite     these\n\nconclusions, the IJ held that the Vakas were not eligible for\n\nasylum.    In making this determination, the IJ relied on several\n\ndistinct lines of reasoning.\n\n            First, the IJ suggested that the Vakas' real motivation\n\nfor coming to the United States may have been to reunite with\n\nfamily, rather than escape persecution.               The IJ noted that the\n\nfamily apparently had the option of remaining in Greece with\n\nDritan's sister who lives and works there.              The Vakas could also\n\nhave sought protection in any number of western European countries.\n\nHighlighting this point, the IJ pointed out that Dritan could have\n\nfled ever since his Albanian passport was first issued in 1993 or\n\n1994,5    but   instead   remained    in    Albania     in   order   to    make\n\narrangements to travel to the United States.\n\n            Second, the IJ suggested that the degree of harm and the\n\nnature of risk experienced by Dritan were not severe enough to\n\ntrigger asylum eligibility.          The IJ noted that the attacks and\n\nthreats only occurred sporadically.              Furthermore, Dritan was not\n\n\n\n5\n  By the court's calculation, this would have been when Dritan and\nRanola received their Albanian passports. Although the original\ndocuments were never presented before the IJ, Dritan testified that\nthey had received the passports some six or seven years prior to\nthe departure from Albania. The IJ accepted this assertion as true\nand cited the testimony in her decision.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fprevented from working or owning property and, even after the final\n\nassault, he continued to participate in the DP and hold meetings at\n\nhis cinema.    The IJ also pointed to the fact that the Vakas did not\n\nleave Albania until two months after the last incident of abuse.\n\n           Third, the IJ noted \"the fact that conditions appear to\n\nbe improving in Albania\" and recognized the presence of \"general\n\nimprovements\" regarding levels of electoral violence. The decision\n\nalso noted that the Country Report for Albania, issued by the State\n\nDepartment    in    2003,      indicated    that   conditions     had   \"steadily\n\nimproved.\"     In sum, while the IJ recognized that elections have\n\nbeen plagued by problems in the past, that corruption persists, and\n\nthat human rights abuses still occur in Albania, the IJ found it\n\nprobative that the political process was becoming less irregular.\n\n           Thus, the IJ denied the Vakas' application for asylum,\n\nholding \"the risk of harm does not rise to the well-founded\n\nstandard.\"     With their asylum claim denied, the IJ granted the\n\nVakas voluntary departure from the United States, in lieu of\n\nremoval.     The Vakas then filed a timely appeal to the BIA, which\n\naffirmed     the    IJ's    decision   on    November     8,    2005.    Without\n\nelaborating,       the   BIA    concurred    in    the   IJ's   conclusion   that\n\n\"[a]lthough the lead respondent experienced past harm on account of\n\nhis political opinion, we agree that this mistreatment does not\n\nrise to the level of persecution.\"            Therefore, the BIA found that\n\nthe Vakas failed to meet their burden and issued an order denying\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\ftheir appeal. Pursuant to the IJ's ruling, the BIA further ordered\n\nthe Vakas to voluntarily depart the United States within 60 days or\n\nbe subject to removal.         The Vakas now petition this court for\n\nreview of the BIA's decision.\n\n                             II.   Discussion\n\n             A.   Applicable Law\n\n             Under the INA, the Attorney General has the authority to\n\ngrant asylum to any individual who qualifies as a refugee.                 8\n\nU.S.C.   §   1158(b)(1)(A).6       The    INA   defines   \"refugee\"   as   an\n\nindividual who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her\n\ncountry of nationality \"because of persecution or a well-founded\n\nfear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in particular social group, or political opinion.\"              8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A).       Government regulations interpreting the\n\nINA provide two separate avenues by which an alien may establish\n\nthe he or she qualifies as a refugee: 1) by showing a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution; or 2) by showing the existence of past\n\npersecution, thereby raising a regulatory presumption of a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.

See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A).\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           In order to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution,      the     asylum   applicant     must   meet    subjective       and\n\nobjective elements; that is the fear of persecution must be both\n\ngenuine and objectively reasonable. See Palma-Mazariegos, 428 F.3d\n\nat 35.   Additionally, a well-founded fear of future persecution\n\nrequires \"a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if\n\n[the applicant] were to return to [his or her] country,\" and the\n\nanticipated persecution must be committed because of one of the\n\nfive statutorily protected grounds.            8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(2).\n\n           As noted, an alien also may become eligible for asylum by\n\nshowing that he or she has suffered from past persecution.                         8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.13(b).           As with the fear of future persecution, the\n\npast persecution must have been committed on the basis of one of\n\nthe five protected grounds.            8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).             Once the\n\nasylum applicant has demonstrated past persecution, a presumption\n\nof a well-founded fear of future persecution also arises.                        Id.\n\nHowever, the Government may rebut this presumption by establishing\n\nthat   changed    country       conditions    have   removed     the    threat    of\n\npersecution or by demonstrating that the alien can safely relocate\n\nwithin   his     or     her   native   country    without      fear    of    further\n\npersecution.     8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i).\n\n           Although federal regulations provide a coherent structure\n\nfor the adjudication of asylum claims once the existence of past\n\npersecution or the likelihood of future persecution is determined,\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fthey provide little insight as to what sort of conduct actually\n\nconstitutes \"persecution.\" See generally 8 C.F.R. § 208.13.

Aguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 569.                     Since we are not\n\ncompelled       to     reach    a     conclusion       contrary     to      the    decision\n\npromulgated below, we affirm the BIA's order.\n\n            B.       Past Persecution\n\n            First, we believe substantial evidence exists to support\n\nthe BIA's conclusion that Dritan's experiences did not rise to the\n\nlevel of past persecution, even though he suffered some harm\n\nbecause    of    his     support      for     the    DP.     The   mere     existence      of\n\npolitically          motivated       abuse,     though       deplorable,          does    not\n\nnecessarily indicate that persecution has taken place. See Guzmán,\n\n327 F.3d at 15.          As noted, \"episodic violence or sporadic abuse\"\n\ndoes not reach the level of past persecution.

The three incidents in which Dritan suffered harm\n\nas a result of his affiliation with the DP could be fairly\n\ncharacterized as episodic and sporadic, having occurred over the\n\ncourse of three and a half years and each separated by at least\n\nfourteen months.\n\n          As the IJ also noted, Dritan continued to work and openly\n\nsupported the DP for the duration of the alleged persecution.7\n\nAccording to his own testimony, he was not deterred from voting in\n\nelections in 1997, 1999, or 2000.       Furthermore, even after his\n\nfamily was threatened and his cinema damaged, he continued to host\n\nDP meetings.   Thus, despite the occasional episodes of physical\n\nabuse, Dritan was largely able to continue participating in both\n\n\n7\n   The BIA appears to have implicitly adopted this rationale when\nit affirmed the IJ's holding, writing, \"Although the lead\nrespondent experienced past harm on account of his political\nopinion, we agree that this mistreatment does not rise to the level\nof persecution.\" When the BIA defers to or adopts the decision of\nthe IJ, a court of appeals must then directly review the decision\nof the IJ.

Moreover,\nas the Government points out in its brief, there is some indication\nin the INS's explanation of its own regulations that the courts of\nappeals should be somewhat more open to reviewing the IJ when the\nBIA decision is issued by a single Board member, as is also the\ncase here. See Board of Immigration Appeals: Procedural Reforms to\nImprove Case Management, Part III, 67 Fed. Reg. 54,878, 54,886\n(Aug. 26, 2002) (suggesting as an example that when a single-member\nBIA   decision   adopts   the  IJ   decision   but  with   specific\nmodifications, \"any reviewing court would be able to look to the\ncombination of the immigration judge's opinion and the single-\nmember decision to understand the conclusions reached in the\nadjudication\").\n\n                                 -12-\n\fhis professional and political life.                   Although we do not seek to\n\nminimize     the   severity      of   the     Vakas'    experiences,        we    are   not\n\ncompelled to find that the harm suffered by Dritan rose to the\n\nlevel of persecution.\n\n              C.   Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution\n\n              Since the Vakas failed to establish past persecution,\n\nthey are not entitled to the regulatory presumption of a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution. See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).\n\nNevertheless,       they     are      still       afforded     the   opportunity         to\n\ndemonstrate such a fear by direct evidence.                    See Palma-Mazariegos,\n\n428 F.3d at 34.            For the following reasons, we conclude that\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that Dritan\n\nfailed   to    show    he    possessed        a    well-founded      fear    of    future\n\npersecution should he return to Albania.\n\n              First,   substantial        evidence      existed      to   support       the\n\nfinding that any fear of future political persecution was not\n\nobjectively reasonable because of changed country conditions within\n\nAlbania.      At the hearing before the IJ, the Government introduced\n\ntwo State Department documents on conditions in Albania, the 2003\n\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices (\"Country Report\"),                           and\n\nthe   2001     Profile      of   Asylum       Claims     and    Country      Conditions\n\n(\"Profile\") for Albania. United States Department of State, Bureau\n\nof Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Albania: Country Reports on\n\nHuman Rights Practices - 2003, (2004); United States Department of\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fState, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Albania:\n\nProfile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions (2001).                        The\n\ndocuments tend to show that changed country conditions within\n\nAlbania are such that asylum-seekers may no longer have a well-\n\nfounded    fear    of   future      persecution    based   on   their    political\n\nopinion.      For example the Profile states, \"elections held in\n\nOctober 2000 made clear and unmistakable progress toward meeting\n\ndemocratic standards.\"         Notably, these were the last elections in\n\nwhich Dritan participated, as the family left the country only a\n\nmonth afterward.         The Country Report describes a similar trend\n\ncontinuing through the elections of October of 2002, stating\n\n\"[o]verall, the municipal elections were a major step forward, with\n\ngood performances by the police, many local election officials, and\n\nelectoral institutions.\"             Admittedly, the Country Report also\n\ndescribes      ongoing     human      rights      violations    and     systematic\n\ndeficiencies in the political process.              Still, the general tone of\n\nthe   Report      is    that   of    a   continuously      improving    political\n\natmosphere.\n\n            The Vakas fault the IJ's reliance on these documents,\n\nciting the Seventh Circuit's observation that the State Department\n\n\"softpedals human rights violations by countries the United States\n\nwants to have good relations with.\"               Gramatikov v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747661\"><a href=\"/opinion/747661/miltcho-gramatikov-ivaylo-gramatikov-and-vesselin-gramatikov-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 (7th Cir. 1997).           However, the Vakas offer no reason why\n\nthe State Department's views on Albania in particular should be\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fviewed with skepticism.           Furthermore, this circuit has stated that\n\nthe State Department's country reports \"are generally probative of\n\ncountry conditions.\" Palma-Mazariegos, 428 F.3d at 36. Despite the\n\nVakas'    assertions,       the    Country       Report     may   \"outweigh[]      the\n\npetitioner's conclusory assertions of continuing danger . . . .\"\n\nAguilar-Solís,      168    F.3d     at    572-73.          Therefore,    we   believe\n\nsubstantial evidence was present for the BIA to conclude that a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution did not exist, even though\n\nDritan had testified credibly regarding the past incidents of\n\nabuse.\n\n           Second, substantial evidence supports a finding that\n\nDritan's alleged fear was not subjectively genuine.                      As noted by\n\nthe IJ, it is quite possible that the Vakas' relocation was\n\nmotivated by a desire to come to the United States rather than a\n\nwish to flee Albania.             The Vakas passed through Greece, Italy,\n\nFrance, Belgium, Spain, and Mexico without seeking asylum, instead\n\ninsisting on continuing on to the United States.                  They even went as\n\nfar as obtaining fraudulent identification in order to leave France\n\nand continue their journey.              The fact that Dritan's brother and\n\nparents   already    reside       in     this    country    further     supports   the\n\nconclusion that the Vakas may have had an ulterior motive for\n\nleaving Albania.          As the Profile warns, \"[a]djudicators should\n\nexplore all the motivations an applicant might have for requesting\n\nasylum, including family members already present in the United\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fStates . . . .\"           Finally, the family's continued presence in\n\nAlbania for two months after the last assault on Dritan further\n\nundermines their allegation of a genuine fear.                  Thus, substantial\n\nevidence existed for the BIA to adopt the IJ's holding that Dritan\n\nfailed to meet his burden of proving a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.\n\n             C.   Withholding of Removal and CAT\n\n             Whereas      asylum    eligibility     only    requires       an   alien\n\ndemonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A), withholding of removal requires an alien to show\n\nthat   \"it   is   more     likely   than   not    that     he   or   she   would    be\n\npersecuted,\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2).             In recognition of the fact\n\nthat the standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than\n\nthe standard for asylum, we have held that \"a petitioner unable to\n\nsatisfy the asylum standard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the\n\n[standard for withholding of removal].\"             Mediouni v.
